REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n5045521\n\nThe Senate passed a measure Tuesday aimed at stopping a Department of Labor regulation critics fear will limit low- and-middle income Americans from seeking retirement advice.\n\n\u201cThis rule will reduce the availability of investment advice for retirees and make the advice that is available more expensive. Higher costs and a more burdensome system also means more expenses for small businesses trying to sponsor retirement plans for their employees,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said in a statement.\n\nThe 1,000-plus page fiduciary rule, which GOP lawmakers have dubbed \u201cObamacare for your retirement plan,\u201d places new regulations and mandates on retirement advisers.\n\nIn the wake of an onslaught of concerns from both parties, the DOL lightened some of the language requiring advisers to be compensated through a fee-based model \u2013 a main grievance of critics due to the risk of creating unnecessary costs \u2013 but did not remove language creating an influx of paperwork for both investors and financial planners alike.\n\nWhile changes were made, those pushing against the rule feel the paperwork will lead to an increase in costs and the additional red tape is off-putting for those seeking financial advice.\n\nThe Protecting Access to Affordable Retirement Advice resolution \u2013 led by Chairman of the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee \u2014 passed the lower chamber In a 234-183 vote April 28.\n\nRanking Member of the Senate Finance Committee Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon slammed the legislation, saying it is necessary to protect Americans from conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cAnd in my view, the overwhelming majority of these advisers are honest people who act in the best interest of their clients,\u201d he said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \u201cBut without modern protections in place, some bad actors choose to push clients toward products with higher fees and lower returns.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama said he will veto the legislation, blocking the regulation, once it hits his desk.\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission is expected to release its version of the fiduciary rule in April 2017.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
