This is about 65 percent more fossil-fuel emission than in 1990, when international negotiations to reduce emissions to address climate change began.\n\nMeanwhile, deforestation now accounts for just 8 percent of total emissions, a fraction that has been declining for several decades.\n\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and cement production. Source: CDIAC, Friedlingstein et al. 2014, Global Carbon Project 2014\n\nThe growth of global emissions since 2009 has been slower than in the prior period of 2000-08. However, projections based on forecast growth in global gross domestic product (GDP) and continuance of improving trends in carbon intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) suggest a continuation of rapid emissions growth over the coming five years.\n\nGlobal emissions continue to track the most carbon-intensive range among more than a thousand scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If continued, this situation would lead to global average temperatures between 3.2C and 5.4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\n\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions from human activity, compared to four different possible futures as depicted in IPCC scenarios. Fuss et al. 2014\n\nThere have been other striking changes in emissions profiles since climate negotiations began. In 1990, about two-thirds of CO 2 emissions came from developed countries including the United States, Japan, Russia and the European Union (EU) nations. Today, only one-third of world emissions are from these countries; the rest come from the emerging economies and less-developed countries that account for 80 percent of the global population, suggesting a large potential further emissions growth.\n\nContinuation of current trends over the next five years alone will lead to a new world order on greenhouse gas emissions, with China emitting as much as the United States, Europe and India together.\n\nCountry Emission Profiles\n\nThere are several ways to explore countries' respective contributions to climate change. These include current emissions, per capita emissions, and cumulative emissions since the industrial revolution.\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production for five regions. Cumulative emissions, production emissions (emissions generated in the region where goods and services are produced), consumption emissions (emissions generated in the region where goods and services are consumed), population, and GDP. 2012 is the most recent year for which all data are available. CDIAC, Global Carbon Project 2014\n\nThe largest emitters in 2013 were China, the United States, the 28 EU countries (considered as a single bloc), and India. Together, they account for 58 percent of global emissions and 80 percent of the emissions growth in 2013 (with the majority the growth coming from China, whereas the EU cut its emissions overall).\n\nHere\u2019s how the major emitters fared in 2013.\n\nChina\n\nEmissions grew at 4.2 percent, the lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, because of weaker economic growth and improvements in the carbon intensity of the economy. Per capita emissions in China (7.2 tons of CO 2 per person) overtook those in Europe (6.8 tons per person).\n\nA large part of China\u2019s high per capita emissions is due to industries that provide services and products to the developed world, not for China\u2019s domestic use. China\u2019s cumulative emissions are still only 11 percent of the total since pre-industrial times.\n\nUnited States\n\nEmissions increased by 2.9 percent because of a rebound in coal consumption, reversing a declining trend in emissions since 2008. Emissions are projected to remain steady until 2019 in the absence of more stringent climate policies, with improvements in the energy and carbon intensity of the economy being offset by growth in GDP and population. The United States remains the biggest contributor of cumulative emissions with 26 percent of the total.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEmissions fell by 1.8 percent on the back of a weak economy, although reductions in some countries were offset by a return to coal led by Poland, Germany and Finland. However, the long-term decrease in EU emissions does not factor in the emissions linked to imported goods and services. When accounting for these \u201cconsumption\u201d emissions, EU emissions have merely stabilized, rather than decreased.\n\nIndia\n\nEmissions grew by 5.1 percent, driven by robust economic growth and an increase in the carbon intensity of the economy. Per capita emissions were still well below the global average, at 1.9 tons of CO 2 per person, although India\u2019s total emissions are projected to overtake those in the EU by 2019 (albeit for a population nearly three times as large). Cumulative emissions account for only 3 percet of the total.\n\nAustralia\n\nEmissions from fossil fuels declined in 2013, largely driven by a 5 percent decline of emissions in the electricity sector over the previous year (as shown by the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Accounts). Fossil fuel emissions per person remain high at 14.6 tonnes of CO 2 .\n\nNational carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.

Source: CDIAC, Global Carbon Project 2014\n\nIs It Too Late to Tame the Climate?\n\nOur estimates (see here and here) show that, at current emissions levels, average global warming will hit 2C in about 30 years.\n\nDespite this apparently imminent event, economic models can still come up with scenarios in which global warming is kept within 2C by 2100, while both population and per capita wealth continue to grow. Are these models playing tricks on us?\n\nMost models invoke two things that will be crucial to stabilising the climate at safer levels. The first is immediate global action to develop carbon markets, with prices rapidly growing to over U.S. $100 per ton of CO 2 .\n\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate Change\n\nThe second is the deployment of \u201cnegative emissions\u201d technologies during the second half of this century, which will be needed to mop up the overshoot of emissions between now and mid-century. This will involve removing CO 2 from the atmosphere and storing it in safe places such as saline aquifers.\n\nThese technologies are largely unavailable at present. The most likely candidate is the production of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, a combination of existing technologies with high costs and with environmental and socio-economic implications that are untested at the required scales.\n\nThere are no easy pathways to climate stabilization, and certainly no magic bullets. It is still open to us to choose whether we halt our CO 2 emissions completely this century \u2013 as required for a safe, stable climate \u2013 or try instead to adapt to significantly greater impacts of climate change.\n\nWhat we have no choice about is the fact that the longer emissions continue to grow at rates of 2 percent per year or more, the harder it will be to tame our climate.\n\nPep Canadell received support from the Australian Climate Change Science Program.
