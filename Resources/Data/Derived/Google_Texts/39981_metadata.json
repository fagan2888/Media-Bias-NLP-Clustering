But some Facebook images posted this week have many scratching their heads, wondering why the Democrats would use what seem to be Republican talking points in their messages.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Democrats posted three images on their Facebook page \u2014 one each with Cruz, Paul, and Rubio \u2014 asking supporters to visit their website and \u201cSay you\u2019re ready to stop Republicans in 2016.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, the slogans on the three images are raising eyebrows. Cruz\u2019s says he wants to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d Paul\u2019s advocates shutting down the Department of Education, and Rubio\u2019s opposes raising the minimum wage.\n\nSeveral Facebook users commented that they originally thought they were looking at Republican ads at first glance. Even several comments on the Democrats\u2019 Facebook page indicated confusion.\n\nA few days prior to these posts, the Democrats had posted several other images, parodies based on the HBO show Game of Thrones, assigning slogans to several of the presumed Republican candidates. Far from hard hitting, the one for Rubio references the moment when he took a sip of water during his response to the President\u2019s State of the Union speech, and the one for former Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) has an image of his glasses and the text, \u201cUh\u2026oops,\u201d after his debate fumble.\n\nThe ones for Cruz and Paul again contain what seem to be Republican talking points. Cruz\u2019s says \u201cshut it down,\u201d referencing the government shutdown that followed his 2013 filibuster \u2014 an event that made him even more of a hero to tea party conservatives. Paul\u2019s has a parody of his logo, holding his finger up to his lips, \u201cShhhh.\u201d This is most likely a reference to the Senator\u2019s passionate advocacy against government intrusions into our privacy \u2014 an issue that makes Paul appealing to both libertarian conservatives and young voters across the political spectrum.\n\nIf the Democrats continue with this type of messaging strategy, they may need to start declaring their Facebook posts as in-kind donations to the Republican Party.
