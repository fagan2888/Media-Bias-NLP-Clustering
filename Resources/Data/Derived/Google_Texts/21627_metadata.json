Women.\n\nOne of the issues is that midwives are often relegated to the bottom of the health services ladder, but their role is actually indispensable, according to WHO. When a midwife is present during a delivery, it\u2019s less likely that emergency interventions will be needed.\n\nTo incentivize more women to become midwives in rural areas, and actually remain in those clinics instead of relocating to more desirable workplaces in cities, UNFPA has developed a compelling training program. The goal is to create competitively paying jobs for women, and ensure that every woman can deliver with a skilled midwife present.\n\nSince 2008, the number of midwives in Ethiopia, for example, has increased by 3,000 to 4,700.\n\n\n\nA skilled birth attendant can help prevent a host of complications, including obstetric fistula, which is a hole that develops between the vagina and rectum or bladder due to obstructed labor and can lead to incontinence. More than 1 million women have the preventable and treatable condition, but fewer than 20,000 get the care they need, according to the Fistula Foundation.\n\nCountries Will Expand Pre- and Post-Natal Care Services\n\nBy 2030, the U.N. has vowed to reduce preventable maternal deaths from 210 deaths per 100,000 live births to fewer than 70.\n\nTo deliver better care, the UNFPA is making essential medicine and reproductive health services more available, and is paying particularly close attention to adolescent moms who face unique risks.\n\nFor example, every year, about 3 million teenage girls undergo unsafe abortions, according to WHO.\n\nTo break the cycle of poverty among this demographic, and reduce their health risks, the UNFPA provides comprehensive sex and reproduction health services and education options for adolescent moms.\n\nBut oftentimes, women just need access to something as simple as soap and water for themselves and their babies to survive the delivery.\n\nRealizing how vast the need is, NGO Freshwater Project International is conducting a two-year pilot program to provide affordable water systems to birthing centers in rural areas of Malawi.\n\nWith support from Water.org and its local partners, women organize building community wells and take out small loans to get household water connections, innovations that play key roles in reducing maternal deaths, according to the aid organizations.\n\n\"With the right investments, we can close the health gap between rich and poor countries -- meaning that every country in the world will have child-mortality rates that are as low as the rate in America or the United Kingdom in 1980,\" Gates wrote in his eponymous blog. \"That would be one of the humanity\u2019s greatest accomplishments ever.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 50 Best Places To Be A Mother 50 Best Places To Be A Mother\n\n1 of 50 Bahrain The lifetime risk of maternal death in Bahrain is 1 in 1,800.
