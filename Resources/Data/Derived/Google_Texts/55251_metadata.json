As opponents of Ex-Im prepare a counteroffensive to keep it shuttered, the bank\u2019s supporters had their say in a hearing on Capitol Hill Friday.\n\nRep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, said U.S. companies have suffered repercussions in the time the bank has been closed. Poe argued other countries use their own export credit agencies, putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nPoe, who led Friday\u2019s hearing, pointed to General Electric\u2019s decision last month to move 100 jobs from a facility outside Houston to Hungary and China so the company can access foreign export credit for its customers of gas turbines.\n\nThe hearing was notably stacked with Ex-Im supporters, positioning The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Diane Katz as the lone voice of opposition. She argued that the subsidies given to foreign purchasers through Ex-Im do not \u201ccreate or support\u201d jobs, but instead \u201credistribute\u201d them from unsubsidized firms to subsidized firms.\n\nKatz, Heritage\u2019s senior research fellow in regulatory policy, said attention should be diverted to the export growth spurred through private financing given that Ex-Im finances only 2 percent of U.S. exports, leaving 98 percent of American exports independent of those subsidies.\n\nShe disputed supporters of the bank who claim that its closure would cripple small businesses attempting to compete in the global market, noting that between 2007 and 2014, more than 51 percent of Ex-Im subsidies benefited just 10 corporations.\n\nFurther, she continued, Ex-Im has assisted less than one-half of a percent of all small businesses, \u201cand even that number is overstated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome members think that the charter should be reauthorized because the charter is helpful to businesses in their district,\u201d Katz said. \u201cBut \u2018helpfulness\u2019 does not justify government superseding a fully functioning export finance market, particularly when the subsidies produce more harm than benefit overall.\u201d\n\nKatz said the government should instead focus on tax and regulatory reforms harming businesses.\n\nThe other witnesses included Amegy Bank National Association Executive Vice President T.J. Raguso, Air Tractor Inc. financial analyst Tyler Schroeder, and Lexington Institute COO Loren Thompson.\n\nVeronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the hearing\u2019s near one-sided evaluation of Ex-Im was \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning after the two years of debate that we\u2019ve had, after so many Republicans who have come to realize that Ex-Im is really one of the poster childs of cronyism, that there was a hearing like this where so few members were against Ex-Im,\u201d de Rugy told The Daily Signal.\n\nMonday\u2019s vote on Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization is the result of a rarely used discharge petition, which 42 Republicans and 172 Democrats signed on Oct. 9 to force a floor vote.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is Republicans and Democrats working together for cronyism and these Republicans who are pro Ex-Im being fully comfortable to be open on the issue,\u201d de Rugy said. \u201cThis is a reason there is so little trust among the public with Republicans because their commitment to cronyism and large corporations is just unwavering.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is gearing up for another battle over the Export-Import Bank nearly four months after the agency's charter expired.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress is gearing up for another battle over the Export-Import Bank nearly four months after the agency's charter expired.", "title": "Export-Import Bank Once Again Takes Center Stage in Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151023_ExImHearing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MfTEri"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress is gearing up for another battle over the Export-Import Bank nearly four months after the agency's charter expired.", "title": "Export-Import Bank Once Again Takes Center Stage in Congress", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151023_ExImHearing.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-10-23T23:29:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ted Poe, cronyism, General Electric, trade"}, "article_summary": "Congress is gearing up for another battle over the Export-Import Bank nearly four months after the agency\u2019s charter expired.\nThe hearing was notably stacked with Ex-Im supporters, positioning The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Diane Katz as the lone voice of opposition.\nThe House of Representatives is preparing to vote Monday on a bill that would revive the bank.\nRep.
