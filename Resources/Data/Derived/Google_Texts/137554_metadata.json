Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who fought to finally get the payment done.\n\n\u201cThe site cannot be allowed to disappear because it should be seared into the consciousness and conscience of every generation,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt is more than a memorial to millions of innocent lives. It is a touchstone for avoiding genocide, injustice, and war. Remembering is the only way to \u2018never forget.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Auschwitz complex was established in 1940 and became the largest concentration camp, with more than 1 million Jews being killed there during the Holocaust, according to the camp\u2019s website. Birkenau, sometimes called Auschwitz II, was the largest part of the camp and where the majority of inmates were killed.\n\nAt the camp, prisoners, including more than 200,000 children, were forced to work, subjected to medical experiments, suffered from hunger and cold and many were killed.\n\nMr. Rivlin said the $15 million donation will be transferred to the fund in early 2015, though it\u2019ll likely come after the 70th anniversary of the camp\u2019s liberation on Jan. 27.\n\nA State Department official said it would make its first contribution \u201cin the coming months\u201d now that Congress has approved the appropriate authorization.\n\nAlmost 30 countries pledged to contribute $160 million to the preservation of the historic site and all except the U.S. had already made their donations, according to the release from Mr. Gutierrez.\n\nThe largest donor was Germany, which gave just over $70 million, according to the fund\u2019s website. Other countries who contributed include Poland, Austria, France, Great Britain, Israel, Russia and Switzerland.\n\nThe fund to preserve Auschwitz-Birkenau was founded in 2009 and needs about $6 million a year to continue conservation work at the concentration camp, the fund\u2019s website said.\n\n\u201cWe created the fund to make sure that future generations will have a possibility to see the authentic space which is not only a living witness of one of the biggest crimes in the history of mankind but also a place which has a fundamental meaning for the entire European civilization,\u201d the website says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. government is finally paying off a promise made in 2010 to give $15 million to preserve the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp &mdash; the last international partner to meet its pledge.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. government is finally paying off a promise made in 2010 to give $15 million to preserve the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp \u2014 the last international partner to meet its pledge.", "title": "Congress approves belated payment to preserve Auschwitz concentration camp", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/1/payment-to-preserve-auschwitz-approved/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/5749b2d042a90129630f6a7067007c3a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/5749b2d042a90129630f6a7067007c3a.jpg", "title": "Congress approves belated payment to preserve Auschwitz concentration", "description": "The U.S. government is finally paying off a promise made in 2010 to give $15 million to preserve the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp &mdash; the last international partner to meet its pledge.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Congress, Department Of State, Luis V Gutierrez"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. government is finally paying off a promise made in 2010 to give $15 million to preserve the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp \u2014 the last international partner to meet its pledge.\nA State Department official said it would make its first contribution \u201cin the coming months\u201d now that Congress has approved the appropriate authorization.\nThe fund to preserve Auschwitz-Birkenau was founded in 2009 and needs about $6 million a year to continue conservation work at the concentration camp, the fund\u2019s website said.\nBirkenau, sometimes called Auschwitz II, was the largest part of the camp and where the majority of inmates were killed.\nThe largest donor was Germany, which gave just over $70 million, according to the fund\u2019s website."}
