That\u2019s because in the past year it\u2019s seen a huge increase in patient load and developed a milelong waiting list.\n\nWhen the $1.9 million project is finished and the clinic reopens in four to five months, it will be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act, have much needed improvements and have more exam rooms. Joe Lock, chief executive officer of EIHC, and other administrators who don\u2019t work with patients will be off-site and their offices turned into exam rooms.\n\nThis is a necessary move, Lock said, because patient encounters \u2014 or an interaction between a patient and health care providers \u2014 jumped 63 percent from 2014 to 2015 \u2014 increasing from 24,273 to 39,594. In addition, the number of homeless patients served soared 176 percent in that same time frame, rising from 377 to 1,319, according to health clinic data.\n\nLock said he\u2019s stumped as to why patients numbers have increased so much, but attributed the majority of the growth to the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nThe EIHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center \u2014 a special designation given by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to clinics that work with an underserved population. The designation means they are eligible for higher reimbursement rates from CMS.\n\nThere are 14 in Iowa and about 1,300 across the country.\n\nIt provides primary care and OB-GYN services to low-income Linn County residents, Lock said, in addition to disease management for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we do best is keep people out of the emergency room,\u201d Lock said.\n\nFinding a medical home\n\nThere\u2019s another reason for EIHC\u2019s patient growth, Lock said \u2014 a shift in patients from the free clinic over to EIHC. Eastern Iowa Health Center is seeing about 150 to 200 patients referred to it from the Community Health Free Clinic every month, he said\n\nThe Community Health Free Clinic has provided free medical and dental services to those without health insurance since 2002.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s primary purpose is to offer patients urgent care services, said Chief Executive Officer Darlene Schmidt, but in recent years patients began using the clinic more as a primary care doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not set up for that,\u201d she said.\n\nEspecially because so many patients have one or more chronic diseases that need to be effectively managed, she said.\n\nAfter the ACA\u2019s passage, Schmidt hired a team of insurance navigators to help patients sign up for either private or government-sponsored insurance plans.\n\n\u201cWe sign people up every day,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom July (2015) to January (2016), we helped 874 people obtain insurance.\u201d\n\nThe next step was to find these patients a medical home, a team-based approach to health care that provides patients with coordinated and comprehensive care. That often meant referring them to Eastern Iowa Health Center.\n\n\u201cA medical home is so important,\u201d Schmidt said, explaining if a patient has diabetes he or she need education and to have their feet and eyes regularly checked. \u201cWe try to do those things, but there\u2019s only so much we can do. We still have lines of 200 people to see. We don\u2019t have 30 minutes to look at their feet.\u201d\n\nBut EIHC has a long waiting list \u2014 upward of 450 people \u2014 so the free clinic continues to care for the patients until they\u2019re able to get an appointment, Schmidt said.\n\nClinic numbers show that visits are steadily falling \u2014 about 13,627 people came to the free clinic in 2012 while only 7,473 did in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a decline, which is a good thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal of every free clinic is to not need to have a free clinic.\u201d\n\nPlanning for the future\n\nLock believes every one deserves outstanding, quality health care regardless of socioeconomic status. And he\u2019s working to ensure that Eastern Iowa Health Center is able to keep up with demand.\n\nEIHC has hired two additional OB-GYNs \u2014 bringing the total up to five \u2014 but offering competitive salaries on a tight budget can be a challenge, he said. However, those services are desperately needed, Lock said, explaining there are about 784 pregnant patients at the clinic.\n\n\u201cIn the OB world, we\u2019re providing care to women without insurance or who are on Medicaid,\u201d said Diane Sorensen, the clinic\u2019s social worker. \u201cWe see a lot of women who are here on a Visa or green card and maybe don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid yet.\u201d\n\nGiving these women the medical care they need will help reduce the number of premature deliveries, she added. Sorensen also works with the women and other patients to find community resources, including transportation with in the Medicaid system, baby items and food banks.\n\nEIHC also has hired a health coach, Melissa Curry, to work with patients to better manage diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Curry said a large portion of patients are overweight and about 650 have Type I or Type II diabetes.\n\nShe works on achievable life style changes and weight loss through diet and exercise, she said, in addition to getting them involved with other community resources such as the YMCA\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program.\n\nAnd looking to the future, the clinic has applied for a federal grant that would allow it to provide dental services \u2014 something Lock and Sorensen said is very needed for the Medicaid populations. Dentists can be hesitant to work with the Medicaid population, Lock said, because reimbursement rates are low and the population can have a high no-show rate as they\u2019re often dealing with other barriers such as lack of transportation.\n\nEIHC surveyed several hundred of their female patients to get an idea on the kinds of services they\u2019re having trouble accessing, and about a quarter said dental, Sorensen said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to be able to have a \u2018warm handoff,\u2019\u201d Lock explained. \u201cTo say to a mom, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got your kid in here for a well-child check, how about we check and see if a dentist is available to look at his gums.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - In a few days time, the Eastern Iowa Health Center briefly will close its doors so staff can pack up their belongings and move to a temporary loc", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - In a few days time, the Eastern Iowa Health Center briefly will close its doors so staff can pack up their belongings and move to a temporary location at 600 Seventh St. SE.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/eastern-iowa-health-center-expands-to-keep-up-with-huge-demand-20160327", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160327/ARTICLE/160329695/AR/0/AR-160329695.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/eastern-iowa-health-center-expands-to-keep-up-with-huge-demand-20160327", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - In a few days time, the Eastern Iowa Health Center briefly will close its doors so staff can pack up their belongings and move to a temporary location at 600 Seventh St. SE.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Eastern Iowa Health Center expands to keep up with huge demand"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2016-03-26T10:11:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-03-27T09:00:00-05:00", "title": "Eastern Iowa Health Center expands to keep up with huge demand"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08e7\"", "article_summary": "Eastern Iowa Health Center is seeing about 150 to 200 patients referred to it from the Community Health Free Clinic every month, he saidThe Community Health Free Clinic has provided free medical and dental services to those without health insurance since 2002.\nThe primary care clinic is moving so it can renovate and expand its facility at 1201 Third Ave.\nAnd he\u2019s working to ensure that Eastern Iowa Health Center is able to keep up with demand.\nClinic numbers show that visits are steadily falling \u2014 about 13,627 people came to the free clinic in 2012 while only 7,473 did in 2014.\nThe EIHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center \u2014 a special designation given by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to clinics that work with an underserved population."}
