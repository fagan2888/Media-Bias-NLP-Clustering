Kennedy (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nIf secrecy fuels the stigma that surrounds mental illness, Patrick Kennedy says, then speaking out about one\u2019s illness can be a powerful tool to defeat it.\n\n\u201cIn my book, \u2018A Common Struggle,\u2019 I said that we are only as sick as our secrets,\u201d said Kennedy, son of the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy and former U.S. Congressman from Rhode Island, who will share his story of mental illness and addiction at the Southeastern Symposium on Mental Health in Greenville on Saturday.\n\n\u201cToday, that\u2019s the mantra of my life,\u201d he told The Greenville News, \u201cand speaking out is something I encourage others to do.\u201d\n\nAbout 43.8 million people \u2500 or one in five Americans \u2500 has a mental illness, according to the South Carolina Institute of Medicine & Public Health. And 10 million of them suffer from a serious condition such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\n\u201cWhen every one of us finds the courage to share our stories, we\u2019ll see the old ways of thinking erode,\u201d Kennedy said via email, \u201cand we\u2019ll begin to see mental illnesses for what they truly are: treatable health conditions from which people recover and live fully, happy and productive lives.\u201d\n\nThe symposium brings together experts and advocates focused on improving care for people who suffer from mental illness and ending the stigma that accompanies it.\n\nKennedy, who authored the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, will speak at the conference along with celebrity and author Mariel Hemingway, whose family has been plagued by suicide.\n\nDr. Kenneth Rogers, chairman of the department of psychiatry at Greenville Health System, said organizers assembled mental health professionals and advocates in the Upstate to develop the conference. It features at least 50 sessions, he said, some geared toward continuing education credits for providers as well as helping people in their day-to-day lives.\n\n\u201cSubjects range from the impact of the Affordable Care Act on mental health and treatment in the Upstate to how art can impact treatment for depression,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are folks from all over the country who submitted abstracts that span the breadth of what\u2019s going on in mental health now from policy issues to how to engage with patients.\u201d\n\nAnd reducing stigma is at the top of the list, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cBy making folks aware, by bringing in some of the big names to talk about their struggles, they end up with a very different feel and experience.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nOne of the issues that feeds stigma, he said, is a fear that someone will become unstable and violent, as rare as that is.\n\n\u201cAs we begin to educate people that folks with mental health issues are actually less aggressive than the general population, and hear stories about folks who suffer from depression who are going to work, doing their own thing, that they live across the street and their kids have been going to school together for years, then they won\u2019t have to be wary of these people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we have to ... be more open and more candid, and that should decrease the stigma substantially,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about being able to have the conversation.\u201d\n\nDiscrimination against people with mental illness is imbedded in the culture, said Mary Giliberti, CEO of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who\u2019ll be speaking to business leaders at the conference about supporting sufferers in the workplace.\n\nWhile communities rally around people with some conditions, that\u2019s not the case with mental illness, she said.\n\n\u201cFor many people, having a mental illness is a very isolating experience,\u201d said Giliberti. \u201cWe are out to change that.\u201d\n\nA \u201cseparate and unequal\u201d system of health care for people with mental illness also perpetuates the stigma, Kennedy said. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was intended to end that by requiring insurers to treat mental health conditions as they treat other physical health conditions.\n\n\u201cThe radical idea was that the brain is part of the body,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today, we still see widespread disregard for the law by many insurers. We still hear about denials of care, burdensome treatment limitations, and higher costs for those who are seeking care. So, it\u2019s no wonder why stigma still exists.\u201d\n\nStigma prevents people from getting the help they need, Giliberti said, while the lack of funding for services is a consequence of the stigma.\n\n\u201cPart of the attitude is that somehow these are less important than other health conditions that we allocate resources to,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of the effort that we\u2019re making in Greenville, and also nationally, is to address the issue of lack of services and support. Our hope is that ... it will lead to more people saying to their legislators, why don\u2019t we make the investment?\u201d\n\n\u2018Conditions like any other\u2019\n\nKennedy said that Washington needs to address the crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the state of mental health and addiction in the United States is in absolute disarray,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see escalating suicide rates, a deadly opioid overdose epidemic, and veterans who are waiting months and months to get care. That\u2019s all in addition to the crisis of homelessness gripping many communities, and the fact that our jails and prisons have become de facto mental health facilities.\n\n\u201cAll of these are symptoms \u2500 and outcomes \u2500 of a truly broken system.\u201d\n\nThe nation needs a system that diverts those with serious illnesses into community-based treatment and support services, instead of putting them in jail, Kennedy said. It also should offer collaborative care, early intervention and prevention, and measurement-based care to ensure the most effective treatments are used, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd we need each and every citizen of this country to agree to hold our leaders accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cInvesting in comprehensive solutions based on what\u2019s known to work is the only way forward.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s event focuses on adult psychiatry while next year\u2019s will deal with children, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cWe will have a spotlight on the latest cutting-edge treatment going on in mental health and substance abuse, because it\u2019s changing so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know a lot more about how to treat mental health problems in general than we did 20 years ago. But the focus is really on the community and how do we move the discussion foward.\u201d\n\nThe fact that communities like Greenville are starting conversations about the issue is exciting, Giliberti said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we want to ... help people understand that mental illnesses are health conditions like any other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that they affect the brain.\u201d\n\nThe Southeastern Symposium on Mental Health event will be held May 6-7 at the Hyatt Regency Downtown.
