The Community Indoor Tennis Center is one phase away from being fully funded. Monday, officials helping to get donations for the CITC held a press conference to update the fundraising effort.

At the presser, officials revealed that more than $1.2 million dollars has been raised during a Chamber of Commerce Fund Drive. That brings the total amount so far to just more than $2.6 million. One more phase is set to begin in November to help reach the $4 million dollars needed to build the 46,000 square foot facility that will house seven tennis courts among other amenities.

The goal is to break ground on the Community Indoor Tennis Center next spring. It will be located at the new Sanford Sports Complex west of the airport. For information on how you can help, click here.
