The amount was set at $10,000 per child per year, equal to 36 percent of University tuition at the time, according to the committee\u2019s report.\n\nBut steady increases in University tuition and inflation rates over the last decade have eroded the tuition assistance value, which has remained constant at $10,000. The amount now covers only 24 percent of University tuition, leaving Brown near the bottom of the committee\u2019s analysis of 19 peer institutions.\n\nDartmouth and Harvard \u2014 the only peer institutions offering lower tuition aid than Brown \u2014 make up for their lack of assistance in other ways, Roth said. Both offer eligible faculty members no-interest loans and increased salaries, meaning Brown ranks last among institutions that provide tuition assistance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty ignorant as to what our status is,\u201d Roth said.\n\nRaising benefits?\n\nThe committee recommended the administration increase tuition assistance to 36 percent of University tuition, a value \u201cminimally competitive\u201d with Brown\u2019s peers, according to the report. With just over 400 children of employees eligible for assistance, the increase would cost the University roughly $2 million.\n\nIn a letter to the ad hoc committee members, Schlissel wrote that to fund the increase in tuition assistance, the University would have to \u201creduce expenditures elsewhere or find new sources of revenue,\u201d such as decreasing faculty salaries by 2 percent or increasing the cost of tuition by 1.3 percent.\n\nOf the University\u2019s three main revenue sources \u2014 undergraduate tuition, funds from the federal government and the University\u2019s endowment \u2014 tuition is the most flexible, said Beppie Huidekoper, executive vice president for finance and administration.\n\nBut with the University already operating under a budget deficit, significant increases to employee benefits would be difficult to implement, she said.\n\nThe University is projected to spend roughly $96 million on employee benefits in fiscal year 2014, a record high, Schlissel said at the faculty meeting last week. That increase would be in line with steady growth over the last decade, documented in University financial statements.\n\nRoth suggested the creation of a voluntary fund for employee benefits to which alums could donate as an example of a way the University could raise funds for tuition assistance.\n\n\u201cI would like to see a more creative rethinking of where the funds come from,\u201d he said.\n\nSchlissel said a major consideration was the fact that tuition assistance is only provided to a subset of the employee population. That money could instead be used to raise employee salaries across the board, he said.\n\nBut the University recently revised its childcare benefit to be competitive with other institutions, Roth said. Tuition assistance is \u201cnot an unfair gift to an advantaged group.\u201d\n\n\u201cDown the road,\u201d he added, tuition assistance will become an issue for recruiting and retaining faculty members.\n\nThe \u201ctake-home\u201d salary is a larger issue for recruiting faculty members, Schlissel said. \u201cVery rarely is TAP considered.\u201d\n\nIf the administration \u201cthought that increasing the tuition benefit would make Brown a better university,\u201d it would have done so, he added.\n\nProfessor of Computer Science John Savage P\u201988 P\u201995 P\u201903 P\u201905 GP\u201917 said the recent growth in University tuition is more of an issue than aid.\n\nWith tuition growing at \u201ctwice the rate of inflation,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve overshot.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstitutions will have to moderate the rate of tuition for many years to come,\u201d he added.\n\nSavage said providing benefits such as health insurance and tuition assistance to employees is very costly, and \u201cBrown is considered to be a very good employer.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance costs in particular will be an overarching concern for the University\u2019s finances in the coming years, Huidekoper said.\n\n\u201cThe incremental cost to Brown of the Affordable Care Act could be millions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching that carefully.\u201d\n\nRetiring with ease\n\nThe ad hoc committee also reviewed retirement benefits in its report.\n\nInitial worries that too few faculty members were retiring under current retirement incentives sparked the committee\u2019s formation, Roth said.\n\nThe current incentive program, announced last December, provides retiring faculty members with a lump sum equal to 1.5 times their salary, $20,000 to help offset costs such as health insurance and annual payments of $2,000 for three years after retirement, The Herald reported at the time.\n\nBut after the program ends June 30, no other incentives will be offered, Schlissel said.\n\nInstead, a phased retirement plan introduced in 2010 that decreases a faculty member\u2019s workload and salary over three years is still available, Schlissel wrote in his letter to the committee.\n\nSavage said taxes on the retirement incentives are a concern, and phased retirement plans are more appealing.\n\nRoth said for faculty members \u201cto just go to zero overnight\u201d is not a realistic or attractive option.\n\n\u201cWe must allow retiring faculty to have continuity and remain within the community,\u201d Roth said.\n\nThe committee proposed creating a center for emeritus faculty members, modeled after Yale\u2019s Koerner Center. The University has since provided an area in the Faculty Club for retired faculty members, though \u201cit\u2019s not really a center,\u201d Roth said.\n\nIn his letter to the committee, Schlissel wrote, \u201cWe are frankly somewhat skeptical about whether (a center) will be possible in light of the many competing demands we face.\u201d\n\nAnother recommendation was for retirees to receive the health benefits of full-time faculty members and to establish \u201chealth retirement savings accounts\u201d for employees over 55. But the incremental costs of the various options were \u201cout of the range of financial prudence,\u201d Schlissel wrote.\n\nRoth said all the reasons behind the administration\u2019s decisions were \u201cexclusively financial considerations with minimal regard to community impact.\u201d\n\nThe University must \u201cstrike a balance between salary and benefits,\u201d Schlissel said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "The U. remains behind most of its peers in annual tuition assistance for the children of employees.", "title": "Finances constrain employee benefits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/themes/browndailyherald/images/facebook-default.png", "updated_time": "2013-11-19T18:11:15+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/11/14/finances-constrain-employee-benefits/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "University News", "tag": "Faculty", "published_time": "2013-11-14T01:42:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-19T18:11:15+00:00"}, "description": "The U. remains behind most of its peers in annual tuition assistance for the children of employees.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Kiki Barnes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebac\"", "article_summary": "Schlissel announced the tuition assistance change along with decisions about retirement benefits and incentives at a faculty meeting last week.\nBut steady increases in University tuition and inflation rates over the last decade have eroded the tuition assistance value, which has remained constant at $10,000.\nThe amount now covers only 24 percent of University tuition, leaving Brown near the bottom of the committee\u2019s analysis of 19 peer institutions.\nSchlissel said a major consideration was the fact that tuition assistance is only provided to a subset of the employee population.\nBoth offer eligible faculty members no-interest loans and increased salaries, meaning Brown ranks last among institutions that provide tuition assistance."}
