September 15, 2015 (Photo: By Michael Clevenger/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nIf genius, as former Louisvillian Thomas Alva Edison once said, is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration, then Attorney General Jack Conway is the smartest man in Kentucky.\n\nHis campaign so far has left Democrats flummoxed over his inability to excite his base and inspire an uprising that would put away a Republican opponent they feel is the least qualified GOP nominee since Peppy Martin in 1999.\n\nThey didn\u2019t feel any better after Tuesday\u2019s Bluegrass Poll Gubernatorial Debate when all people wanted to talk about was Conway\u2019s sweat-filled performance where he glistened in the television lights. He seemed unsure of himself at times and his attempts at humor fell flat.\n\nOn style points, which are often the most important things in political debates, he lost to Republican Matt Bevin \u2013 who lost to independent candidate Drew Curtis. Curtis\u2019 humor and plainspoken answers made him seem more genuine than his two, supposedly more polished foes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a great night for the two leading candidates, but Conway clearly had the worst.\n\nBevin appeared poised, but occasionally arrogant, even as he pitched ideas at odds with past positions on Medicaid; proffered a solution to the state pension crisis that Curtis pointed out could only deepen the current unfunded liability; and dodged a question about why he won\u2019t release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll actually answer this question,\u201d Curtis quipped after Bevin talked around the tax return question. \u201cI\u2019m OK releasing my tax returns. I\u2019m not sure why anybody wants them. If anyone wants a tour of my house, you\u2019re welcome to come on over. My kids are kind of cool \u2026\u201d\n\nBevin also didn\u2019t answer whether he favors needle exchange programs to fight heroin abuse, talking instead about the need to increase job opportunities for people as a way to get people off drugs.\n\nWhile there is little doubt Kentucky needs more and higher paying jobs, low wages and lack of jobs aren't the only indicators for substance abuse troubles and bringing in more jobs wouldn\u2019t likely solve the all state\u2019s drug issues.\n\nAccording to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019 preliminary data from 2014, Kentucky ranks 44th in per capita income. Of the six states that rank below Kentucky, two of them have higher rates of drug abuse deaths, but the other four have lower rates \u2013 some of them much lower.\n\nCurtis called for watching what other states do and trying to replicate their successes, while Conway endorsed needle exchange programs but pushed for more education and treatment programs as ways to combat drug abuse.\n\nConway\u2019s undoubtedly worst moment came when he was trying to answer a question about what he had done to protect women who work in state government in response to a sexual harassment scandal in the state legislature.\n\nThe state\u2019s top law enforcement officer said he had done a lot without giving specifics and then noted that he has surrounded himself with strong women both in his office and at home \u2014 and noted that he even has a female dog.\n\nUgh.\n\nRepublicans seized on that, accusing Conway of comparing women to dogs. But they may have overplayed their hand by suggesting that Conway\u2019s running mate, state Rep. Sannie Overly, played a role in covering up harassment allegations against former state Rep. John Arnold.\n\nIn fact, it appears that Overly was a victim of sexual harassment.\n\nThere were other mistakes. Conway claimed that Bevin wants the state road fund to \u201cgo to zero,\u201d but, according to a fact check by journalism students at the University of Kentucky, the Conway camp could show no evidence that he ever said that.\n\nAnd Bevin said that public school teachers, who currently don\u2019t receive Social Security in lieu of old-style pensions, could be moved to onto the federal retirement program \u2013 without noting that school districts would have the added expense of the employer contribution to the Social Security program.\n\nThe good news for both Conway and Bevin is that this wasn\u2019t the last televised debate. They\u2019ll both have more shots at talking to statewide audiences in the coming weeks \u2013 and possibly without Curtis who, who as an independent candidate, may not qualify for them.\n\nThey\u2019ll both have a chance to improve upon their performances.\n\nNo sweat.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
