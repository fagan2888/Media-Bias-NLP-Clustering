A key element of Saturday\u2019s CBS debate was, according to VOX, a vocal disagreement between the two about Trump\u2019s position on Planned Parenthood \u2014 the defunding of which is a high priority for many GOP voters this election year.\n\nCruz spoke as Trump argued, with the former insisting that the billionaire real-estate and reality TV mogul was a supporter of Planned Parenthood, and Trump mounting the defense that the organization provides a number of important services, but that he doesn\u2019t support their abortion aspect.\n\nThe two also traded verbal blows over what the political leanings might be of an appointee to the Supreme Court by either, with Cruz saying appointees by Trump would be too liberal \u2014 a matter that was already a concern for this election even before long-time justice Antonin Scalia passed away during a hunting trip this weekend.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump reiterated his response to this particular matter, bringing up what he called proof that Cruz would support justices whose decisions would be more liberal-leaning than much of the GOP base might prefer. Specifically, he addressed Cruz\u2019s support for Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\nDuring the debate, Cruz asserted that Justice Roberts would not have been his first choice for nomination in 2005, had he been president and in the position to make the decision. However, a 2005 op-ed by Cruz, then the Solicitor General for Texas, printed in the National Review, shows strong support for the Justice.\n\n\u201cAs a jurist, Judge Roberts\u2019s approach will be that of his entire career: carefully, faithfully applying the Constitution and legal precedent.\n\n\u201cThe Senate should confirm him swiftly.\u201d\n\nIt was to this piece that Trump pointed.\n\nThis shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn\u2019t have nominated John Roberts. Really? https://t.co/gBnsNgomom \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2016\n\nIs it a fine hair to split \u2014 the line between recommending a \u201cquick confirm\u201d for the proposed justice, and considering him one\u2019s own first choice as nominee? There\u2019s enough wiggle room between the two positions that both can stand, certainly.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t stop there, though. He went on to indicate that the op-ed was proof, not just that Cruz lied, but that because of this 2005 position, Cruz is responsible for the Supreme Court rulings in favor of Obamacare.\n\nTed Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn\u2019t! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s not new point of argument from Trump. CNN has video of him saying the same thing earlier this month, at a rally in Arkansas. He says that by supporting Roberts, who voted with the majority of SCOTUS in favor of the ACA on two occasions, Cruz ensured that the health care law would remain in place.\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz responded with a video that reiterated his statements about Planned Parenthood, using clips that included Donald Trump stating, \u201cPlanned Parenthood serves a good function\u2026\u201d alongside news clips that claim Planned Parenthood sells fetal organs, and clips directly from the \u201csting\u201d videos \u2014 videos found to be faked and that have resulted in charges for the individuals and organization behind them, while the medical centers themselves have been repeatedly found clear of wrongdoing.\n\nDonald Trump and Planned Parenthood.
