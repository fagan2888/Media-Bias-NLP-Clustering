Paine & Partners Plants Suba Seeds Deal

The PE firm is invested in other agriculture companies including the Costa Group and Scanbio

PE firm Paine & Partners is acquiring seed distributor Suba Seeds Company SpA.

The Longiano, Italy-based target produces vegetable seeds such as beans, peas, radish, cabbage and carrots to more than 1,000 crop growers. Suba just completed building a new production facility next to its headquarters so it can meet growing demand for its products.

“Suba is well-positioned to continue capturing market share in the growing global market for specialty vegetable seed,” says Paine & Partners president Kevin Schwartz.

Paine & Partners is currently investing out of its fourth fund, valued at $893 million, that is solely focused on the agriculture sector. The PE firm has experience investing in agriculture companies including fruit and vegetable producer Costa Group and fish oil processor Scanbio.

Demand for more food to feed a rising global population is making agriculture suppliers, including seed companies, attractive targets. For more on M&A in the agriculture industry, read Agriculture Acquirers Feed on Crop Protection.
