On June 2, US President Barack Obama set the ball rolling by unveiling plans for a cut in emissions of up to 30 percent from American power plants by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.\n\nAfter the summit, a new UNFCCC round takes place from October 20-25, ahead of the forum's annual parlay, in Lima, Peru, from December 1-12.\n\nEuropean Union negotiator Elina Bardram said there had been a \"good constructive atmosphere\" in Bonn but Lima had to yield a template to make conclusion in Paris possible.\n\nBan's meeting\u2014the first top-level climate gathering since the 2009 Copenhagen summit\u2014is a \"very, very important opportunity,\" she said.\n\nThe EU expected it to be a platform for \"bold pledges\" and a showcase for climate programmes that worked, she said.\n\nOn Bonn's plus side, co-chairs presiding over the negotiations agreed to issue by July 15 a new informal blueprint for a deal, said Climate Action Network, an alliance of green and development campaigners.\n\nThere were also advances in two technical arenas, on how to reduce carbon emissions from cities and using forestry and farming to help the fight against global warming rather than worsen it.\n\nPedestrians and visitors gather as smog envelopes The Red Fort in New Delhi on November 7, 2009\n\n'Not enough on the table'\n\n\"Though the progress here in Bonn by negotiators was heartening, there's not enough on the table. Heads of government (need) to get involved to make the tough choices negotiators can't,\" CAN said.\n\nThe Bonn talks revealed difficult and complex differences on the basics, delegates added.\n\nRicher nations are focused especially on mitigation\u2014reducing emissions\u2014while poorer nations are more preoccupied for help with adapting to climate change, whose effects are already underway.\n\n\"Without finance on the table before Paris it's hard to see how we can avoid a stalemate, which puts a deal in danger,\" said Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid.\n\n\"Poor countries are asking developed nations to stick to their promises on finance before committing to cuts in emissions.\"\n\nAnother stumbling block is the negotiations' second track, which is about beefing up action on climate change before 2020.\n\nSince the near-fiasco of Copenhagen Summit, trust in the climate process has been at a low ebb so promises of vigorous action in the short term are a key to cementing a a deal for the longer term.\n\nExplore further: UN chief says current climate pledges insufficient (Update)", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A new round of talks on climate change sputtered to a close on Sunday, placing the onus on a UN summit in September to boost momentum for a global pact by the end of 2015.", "og": {"url": "http://phys.org/news/2014-06-struggling-climate-summit.html", "image": "http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/hires/2014/3-aphototakeno.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new round of talks on climate change sputtered to a close on Sunday, placing the onus on a UN summit in September to boost momentum for a global pact by the end of 2015.", "title": "Struggling climate talks look to UN summit for push"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17248121, "title": "Struggling climate talks look to UN summit for push", "url": "http://phys.org/news/2014-06-struggling-climate-summit.html", "image": "http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/hires/2014/3-aphototakeno.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A new round of talks on climate change sputtered to a close on Sunday, placing the onus on a UN summit in September to boost momentum for a global pact by the end of 2015."}, "ROBOTS": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 163850683679377}, "Keywords": "Physics News, Science news, Technology News, Physics, Materials, Nanotech, Technology, Science", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.phys.org/newman/csz/news/tmb/2014/3-aphototakeno.jpg", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28f6\"", "article_summary": "Government representatives attend the UN climate change conference in Bonn, western Germany on June 6, 2014Climate summit in New YorkThe Bonn talks will be followed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's special summit on climate change in New York on September 23.\nAnother stumbling block is the negotiations' second track, which is about beefing up action on climate change before 2020.\nRicher nations are focused especially on mitigation\u2014reducing emissions\u2014while poorer nations are more preoccupied for help with adapting to climate change, whose effects are already underway.\nExplore further: UN chief says current climate pledges insufficient (Update)\nThe Bonn talks revealed difficult and complex differences on the basics, delegates added."}
