Starting early next year, the artificially intelligent computing system that can read natural language will enroll patients with colorectal, lung, and breast cancers in clinical trials, expediting what is often considered a slow and inefficient process. The clinic unveiled the partnership on Monday during its annual Transform conference in Rochester, Minn. Members of both IBM and Mayo Clinic\u2019s teams are confident that the supercomputer will bring about significant change to the patient matching process for clinical trials.\n\n\u201cIntegrating Watson into the care delivery system has the potential to transform how we take care of patients,\u201d Nicholas LaRusso, a gastroenterologist at the clinic and the Watson project lead, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWatson can fit into a flow of how we interact with patients, it can help aggregate and organize data, and will provide input required with diagnosis and management, and ultimately become, in my opinion, a member of the provider team.\u201d\n\nFor physicians at institutions like Mayo Clinic, Watson could prove an indispensable partner in administering patient treatment. According to a Mayo Clinic press release, 170,000 patient studies are being conducted worldwide at any given time, with 8,000 of those being done at the clinic alone. Processing clinical trials can be an arcane process \u2013 it is done manually, which involves sorting through patient records to ensure that proper matches are made. Watson could see this process shortened considerably, with matches being made within seconds. As a result, the clinic anticipates patient enrollment to increase from five to 10 percent.\n\n\u201cMatching is such a hard and cumbersome process,\u201d Sean Hogan, IBM vice president of healthcare, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe process can take a long time. This collaboration with Watson is all about Mayo\u2019s continued dedication to putting patients first and supporting clinicians in fulfilling their goals. The response so far to Watson has been great \u2013 the clinicians are really excited.\u201d\n\nJust as it did when competing on Jeopardy, Watson is being \u201cfed\u201d as much information as possible to expand its \u201cknowledge corpus,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nExperts from Mayo Clinic are providing Watson with information on all clinical trials both at the clinic and in public databases like ClinicalTrials.gov. Due to its ability to process natural language, the computing system is learning how to analyze both trial requirements and patient records.\n\nFor LaRusso, Watson\u2019s partnership with Mayo Clinic is part of the many \u201cmomentous changes going on in health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spend three trillion dollars a year in health care and we don\u2019t get the results or outcomes that we pay for,\u201d LaRusso said. \u201cFrom changes spurred by the Affordable Care Act that have catalyzed changes and the availability of technology, from things like apps that allow you to look at health information, to devices that track various physiological changes \u2013 technology has already and will continue to be part of how we take care of patients. Watson is part of that.\u201d\n\nLaRusso said that one of the biggest challenges that physicians face is the task of managing large quantities of data. In the future, as medical lab results could include rapid \u201cgenomic analyses,\u201d LaRusso said that assisted technology like Watson could \u201chelp organize and aggregate huge amounts of data\u201d that would be impossible for a human to process efficiently.\n\nWatson\u2019s ability to \u201cget better at what it\u2019s doing\u201d will enable it to take on more complex data sets, LaRusso added.\n\nWhile Watson will only be matching cancer clinical trials, LaRusso said that he envisions the computing system working to match patients with other conditions. Hogan added that Watson could also make it much easier to find trials for patients with rare conditions.\n\nDoes Watson\u2019s presence at Mayo Clinic offer a look at a future where cognitive technology is a part of all health care facilities across the board? Hogan thinks so.\n\n\u201cLook at the trajectory of how medicine has advanced at institutions like Mayo that push the frontier further,\u201d he said. \u201cThe driving motivation of this kind of technology is to continue to put the patient first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "computing", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/American Innovation,/FOX
