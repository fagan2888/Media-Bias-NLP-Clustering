One factor was the risk from expanding their staff beyond 50 full-time employees and having to provide them federally mandated health coverage.\n\nDespite knowing the penalty for that part of the Affordable Care Act had been postponed for a year, the couple said their margins are thin and the requirements and costs under the law remain unclear.\n\nAdditional Photos Bartender Sara Tucciarone, left, talks about a wine selection with hostess Hillary Len, right, and Wheatfields Restaurant owners Tim Holmes and his wife Colleen at the business in Clifton Park, N.Y. on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2013. The Holmes were considering opening a third business but decided against it. One factor was the risk in expanding their staff beyond 50 full-time employees and having to provide federally mandated health coverage in 2014. Despite knowing the penalty provisions for noncompliance have been postponed one year, the couple said their margins are thin and the requirements and costs of the health care law are not yet clear.

They\u2019ve discussed whether they need to hire a consultant to help them understand what the law means for the owners of small businesses, but it\u2019s an expense they\u2019d rather not have. Yet they have little time to research the act on their own, since they already work more than 70 hours a week.\n\n\u201cAs small-business owners we take all the risk and we employ a lot of people, so any additional cost is difficult for us to justify without having additional revenue,\u201d Colleen Holmes said.\n\nEven though they offer health insurance, the couple said most of their employees refuse it because of the cost of premiums and because most are young and feel they don\u2019t need it or can now get coverage under their parents\u2019 policies through age 26.\n\nAt costs ranging from $300 to $500 a month for one healthy employee, the business could not afford to pay a fraction of the premiums, they said. At even $100 a month, it would be $5,000 monthly for 50 workers.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that money going to come from?\u201d Colleen Holmes said.\n\nHer husband said it would be more advantageous for their employees to go directly to the new health exchange for individual coverage because it can be subsidized by the government.\n\nSince 2004, they\u2019ve owned and operated Wheatfields Restaurant and Bar in Saratoga Springs, an upscale city with a thoroughbred track, performing arts center and Skidmore College. In 2009, they opened a cafe in the nearby Albany suburb of Clifton Park and more recently considered opening a third restaurant in between in Malta, a town that\u2019s been growing with a new semiconductor manufacturing center.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other issues out there, but the health care definitely made us re-evaluate our business strategy in expanding,\u201d Colleen Holmes said.\n\nAnother was New York lawmakers this year boosting the state\u2019s minimum wage, which will rise incrementally from $7.25 an hour to $9 an hour in 2016.\n\nIn addition to the New York health exchange, a separate one will serve small businesses, defined as having 50 or fewer eligible employees. Many owners expect to rely on brokers to help them find the best deal.\n\nThe definition of a small business will increase from 50 to 100 full-time employees in 2016 in New York, expanding access to the state-run exchange and possible tax credits for providing coverage.\n\nHowever, businesses with 50 or more full-time staff still will be required to provide affordable coverage or face tax penalties, which start in 2015. Employee premiums cannot exceed 9.5 percent of gross income.\n\nSeveral city and regional chambers of commerce, which have traditionally offered pooled insurance coverage for small businesses, plan to continue. However, sole proprietors now will have to go to the exchange.\n\nFor now, the Holmes and other small-business owners are trying to understand the law\u2019s effect on them and their employees, as well as figure out what the related costs might be.\n\n\u201cWhen you can\u2019t pinpoint your costs,\u201d said Tim Holmes, \u201cyou can\u2019t make strategic decisions regarding your business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Small businesses that grow beyond a threshold of 50 full-time employees will face mandates to provide health coverage for their workers starting in 2015.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Small businesses that grow beyond a threshold of 50 full-time employees will face mandates to provide health coverage for their workers starting in 2015.", "title": "HEALTH REFORM STORIES: New responsibilities for small businesses - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ACA_smallbiz.jpg", "height": 368}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2013/09/13/health-care-law-perplexing-to-business-owners/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Small businesses that grow beyond a threshold of 50 full-time employees will face mandates to provide health coverage for their workers starting in 2015.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ACA_smallbiz.jpg", "title": "HEALTH REFORM STORIES: New responsibilities for small businesses - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2013-09-13T09:55:51-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93aa\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the New York health exchange, a separate one will serve small businesses, defined as having 50 or fewer eligible employees.\nOne factor was the risk from expanding their staff beyond 50 full-time employees and having to provide them federally mandated health coverage.\nOne factor was the risk in expanding their staff beyond 50 full-time employees and having to provide federally mandated health coverage in 2014.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other issues out there, but the health care definitely made us re-evaluate our business strategy in expanding,\u201d Colleen Holmes said.\nSeveral city and regional chambers of commerce, which have traditionally offered pooled insurance coverage for small businesses, plan to continue."}
