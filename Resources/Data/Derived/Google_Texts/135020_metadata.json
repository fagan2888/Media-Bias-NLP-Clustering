Scientists have, for a while, used electrical stimulation to actually spur the growth of blood vessels. A new study found that using high-frequency electrical stimulation is actually more effective than low-frequency electricity.\n\nAt the University of Cincinnati, engineers applied electricity to vascular cells, which are used to heal wounds. They tested different magnitude and frequency, and found that high-frequency electrical stimulus \u2013 similar to what is produced by cell phones or WiFi networks \u2013 actually improved the growth of blood vessel networks by 50 percent. Low-frequency electrical stimulus, on the other hand, didn\u2019t provide such an effect. The researchers will present their results at the American Physical Society.\n\nThe electrical stimulus changes the ionic environment of the cells that line blood vessels, known as endothelial cells. The electricity can link proteins in order to activate growth, and produces \u201cgrowth factors,\u201d which are one of the body\u2019s ways of healing itself. During the experiments, the vascular tissue cells were exposed to the electrical stimulation for one hour every day for seven days.\n\n\u201cElectrical stimulation activates the pathway for angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and the vascular network growth is enhanced,\u201d physics doctoral student Toloo Taghian, an author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cWe can expect that, as a result, wound closure would be enhanced, leading to a faster healing.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also developed an antenna which is able to apply these electrical signals to localized wounds. The design of the antenna is now the subject of a provisional patent, according to the university\u2019s press release.\n\nThe idea of stimulating wounds with electric currents is not new: it has been shown in the past to accelerate the healing of wounds in human studies. Electrical stimulation has also been used in plastic surgery and foot reconstruction.\n\nAccording to Taghian, if high-frequency electrical stimulation is able to effectively treat wounds, it may be a better technique than current treatments that rely on lots of drugs, and which may harbor adverse side effects. The researchers hope that therapy from electricity could be applied using a handheld device someday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes, chronic wounds, electrical stimulation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study shows how high frequency stimulation accelerates the healing process for chronic wounds, like diabetic ulcers.", "title": "Hard-To-Heal Wounds Benefit From High-Frequency Electricity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hard-heal-wounds-benefit-high-frequency-electricity-270591", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/04/healing-wounds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study shows how high frequency stimulation accelerates the healing process for chronic wounds, like diabetic ulcers.", "title": "Hard-To-Heal Wounds Benefit From High-Frequency Electricity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hard-heal-wounds-benefit-high-frequency-electricity-270591", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/04/healing-wounds.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/04/healing-wounds.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-03-04T18:27:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-04T18:32:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study shows how high frequency stimulation accelerates the healing process for chronic wounds, like diabetic ulcers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf355\"", "article_summary": "A new study found that using high-frequency electrical stimulation is actually more effective than low-frequency electricity.\nA new study has found that high-frequency electrical stimulation \u2014 though it may sound a little scary \u2014 can actually help heal chronic wounds.\nAt the University of Cincinnati, engineers applied electricity to vascular cells, which are used to heal wounds.\nSlow-to-heal wounds, like diabetic ulcers, are usually treated with drugs, but electrical stimulation has proven to be an effective therapy.\nWounds like diabetic ulcers are difficult to heal due to the lack of blood supply near the wound site \u2014 they are made up of damaged blood vessels."}
