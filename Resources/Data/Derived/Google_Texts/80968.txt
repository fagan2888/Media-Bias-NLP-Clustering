Representative Daniel Webster (R-FL) stated that he’s staying in the race for speaker and that he doesn’t see anything in Representative Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) plan that changes “the way the process is” on Wednesday’s “Your World with Neil Cavuto” on the Fox News Channel.

Webster said of Ryan, “I don’t see anything that portrays the idea of changing the way the process is. Under a Webster speakership, for example, we have a December 11th deadline on the appropriations for 2016, and if we don’t act, then we would shut down the government. I say we start day one, week one, as opposed to waiting six weeks, and passing something on the last day, which is the way it usually works and probably will work this time, if we don’t make a change.”

He later added, “I’m the only one offering up a plan that says, we can operate under principle, I’m the only one that’s actually executed a plan like that, that has changed the legislative process, improved our public approval, and made things great for the entire legislative body.”

Webster also stated that he doesn’t believe the House Freedom Caucus will change its endorsement based on conversations he’s had with members of the caucus individually.
