They just want to clip its wings and keep bad policy from taking flight during the frantic last months of the year.\n\nPart of every congressional lifespan, the lame-duck session refers to the window after the November election but before newly elected representatives take their seats. Conservatives fear the lame duck because outgoing lawmakers, temporarily free from responsibility, often vote for controversial legislation.\n\nThat\u2019s why conservatives want to limit the session. But they don\u2019t want to kill it entirely, as one media outlet surmised last week. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.\n\nMulvaney, board member of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Daily Signal his group wants to force Congress to take difficult votes now so that the electorate can give a thumbs up or down at the polls in November.\n\n\u201cNone of this is about staying home in November and December. We should go to D.C., and we should work,\u201d Mulvaney said. He\u2019s not ready to kill the lame-duck session because Congress still has work to do after the election. \u201cPlenty of really good small stuff needs to be done,\u201d Mulvaney explained.\n\nAnother Freedom Caucus board member, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., agrees and told The Daily Signal, \u201cI\u2019m in favor of working more hours, not fewer.\u201d\n\nBut while conservatives like Meadows aren\u2019t ready to quit early, they do want Congress to limits its activity after the November election. That\u2019s why Meadows wants the House to finish the lion\u2019s share of its work now to avoid sloppy work later during the lame-duck session.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of having the most critical legislative issues brought up early this summer long before any lame-duck session,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cConsequential pieces of legislation should not be considered after an election by individuals who are no longer accountable to the people.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, lawmakers have hammered together spending deals at the last moment before the federal government ran out of money to pay its bills. The frequent conservative complaint has been that during that scramble, questionable provisions get slipped into the final package.\n\nTo keep that from happening, conservatives and leadership would have to finish stalled negotiations over government spending levels. That could put members of the Freedom Caucus in an awkward position.\n\nVocal proponents of passing a budget according to so-called \u201cregular order,\u201d conservatives may have to sign off on an emergency spending patch known inside Washington as a continuing resolution.\n\nA temporary fix, the continuing resolution would allocate enough funding to keep the government running.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if Congress could reach a deal before federal funding runs out on Sept. 30. Lawmakers are already short on time.\n\n\u201cThe lights are flickering now,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told The Daily Signal. \u201cIf you look at the schedule, there\u2019s not a whole lot of days to get things done before the election.\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers leave for summer recess on July 15, they won\u2019t return until Sept. 6\u2014that leaves just 17 legislative days for them to finish their work. Those tight margins are a result of a condensed calendar.\n\nThis year, Republican leadership limited the days Congress is in session to make room for the Republican and Democrat national conventions in July and give ample time for incumbent members to fend off electoral challenges before November.\n\nTake any more time off the clock and \u201cit wouldn\u2019t instill much confidence in the people in my district,\u201d said Buck, a Freedom Caucus member and freshman class president. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine we would just not work through the end of the year. That would be disturbing to me.\u201d\n\nBut even if members of the Freedom Caucus changed their mind, they still couldn\u2019t cut out early. They don\u2019t control the calendar. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., does.\n\nAsked about the possibility of shortening the legislative schedule, a senior leadership aide told The Daily Signal that leadership has no plans to kill the lame-duck session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
