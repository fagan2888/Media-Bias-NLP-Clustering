But it has been quite a robust use of force\u2026Do you think that it is going to succeed, the Israeli strategy?\n\nNo, I think he is making a very serious mistake. When Hamas in effect accepted the notion of participation in the Palestinian leadership, it in effect acknowledged the determination of that leadership to seek a peaceful solution with Israel. That was a real option. They should have persisted in that.\n\nInstead Netanyahu launched the campaign of defamation against Hamas, seized on the killing of three innocent Israeli kids to immediately charge Hamas with having done it without any evidence, and has used that to stir up public opinion in Israel in order to justify this attack on Gaza, which is so lethal.\n\nI think he is isolating Israel. He's endangering its longer-range future. And I think we ought to make it very clear that this is a course of action which we thoroughly disapprove and which we do not support and which may compel us and the rest of the international community to take some steps of legitimizing Palestinian aspirations perhaps in the U.N.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch\"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on\u00a0CNN Fareed speaks with former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski about Israel's military operation in Gaza.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Brzezinski: Netanyahu 'making a very serious mistake'", "og": {"url": "http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/07/21/brzezinski-netanyahu-making-a-very-serious-mistake/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140720142359-exp-gps-brzezinski-israel-00012414-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Watch\"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on\u00a0CNN\r\n\r\nFareed speaks with former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski about Israel's military operation in Gaza.", "title": "Brzezinski: Netanyahu 'making a very serious mistake'"}, "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Global Public Square", "keywords": "gps show, middle east, cnn's jason miks", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc846\"", "article_summary": "ET on CNNFareed speaks with former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski about Israel's military operation in Gaza.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on CNN told Wolf Blitzer that the invasion of Gaza was a strategy to demilitarize Gaza, explaining the use of force.\nNo, I think he is making a very serious mistake.\nWhen Hamas in effect accepted the notion of participation in the Palestinian leadership, it in effect acknowledged the determination of that leadership to seek a peaceful solution with Israel.\nBut it has been quite a robust use of force\u2026Do you think that it is going to succeed, the Israeli strategy?"}
