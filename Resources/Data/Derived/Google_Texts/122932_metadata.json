With that in mind, here are the top six poses we\u2019re expecting to see on tomorrow\u2019s Oscars Red Carpet:\n\nTHE SKINNY ARM\n\nCulprits: Alicia Keys, Katy Perry, Anna Kendrick, everyone\n\nThe ol\u2019 faithful, hand-on-hip, 90-degree arm cock gives the illusion of thinner limbs. Also allows the poser to flex for added bicep tone. And which other pose allows you to show off your awards show-themed mani (here\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you, Zooey Deschanel)? We must admit, this pose certainly does the trick. Especially when teamed with The Knee-Cross \u2014 the winning combination that deserves its own Academy Award.\n\nTHE KNEE-CROSS\n\nCulprits: Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift\n\nAlthough the stars will wear full-length gowns tonight, know that, underneath the 12 layers of tulle, most will have one leg crossed in front of the other. Stylist Rachel Wayman says this pose, which works best with pencil skirts, is all about creating an hourglass shape. \u201cInstead of being \u2018up and down\u2019, you\u2019re creating a curve with the body and bringing it back in at the knees.\u201d Beware: the risk of tripping over your own feet is a red alert on the Pose-o-Meter.\n\nTHE PHOTOBOMB\n\nCulprits: Emma Thompson, Jennifer Lawrence\n\nThis is a relatively new addition to the red carpet, but no less deserving of mention. It was made popular by serial trickster J-Law, when she bombed a perfect-picture moment of Sarah Jessica Parker at last year\u2019s Met Gala. Since then, stars have been flocking to ruin pap snaps all over the world. Emma Thompson is the latest, making a perfectly good shot of Lupita Nyong\u2019o at the SAG Awards even better. God bless Thompson.\n\nTHE ANGELINA JO-LEG\n\nCulprit: Angelina Jolie\n\nThis is the pose that started a million memes \u2014 the leg-out pose. Championed by Ange at the Oscars in 2012, it\u2019s been copied by many, but seldom executed correctly. Many think a thigh-high split warrants a peekaboo moment, but this is not the case. It\u2019s a precarious combination of the right amount of awkward bend at the knee, a subtle hand on hip, and a dash of smugness due to the fact you couldn\u2019t care less you\u2019re about to be lambasted online. And by Joan Rivers.\n\nTHE BECKHAM BEND\n\nCulprits: Victoria Beckham, Paris Hilton\n\nOne of the more advanced red-carpet poses, The BB involves leaning as far back as you can without tipping over (your core must be in peak condition). Although Beckham looks a tad uncomfortable, Wayman believes she\u2019s stuck with this pose to accentuate her best asset: her slenderness. \u201cRed-carpet poses are for showing off the best shape for the outfit and body. Victoria likes streamlined outfits and she\u2019s got this pose down to a fine art,\u201d she says.\n\nTHE BACKWARDS GLANCE\n\nCulprits: Eva Longoria, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez\n\nNoticed a culprit pattern here? If you have a buxom derri\u00e8re, this is the pose for you. Also deployed with backless frocks, this stance calls for a \u201cWho? Me?\u201d over-the-shoulder glance towards the photographers\u2019 pit, Bambi eyes optional. This is a particularly favourable pose should you have spilt your drink down your front in the limo en route to the event. Nothing gets Champagne out of organza, darling \u2026\n\nCLICK HERE to download the Sunday Style app.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "CELEBRITIES have walked more red carpets than you or I have had hot dinners, and as such, they know what poses work best for them.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "CELEBRITIES have walked more red carpets than you or I have had hot dinners, and as such, they know what poses work best for them.", "title": "Strike a pose: The six Oscar red carpet poses you can expect to see tomorrow", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/strike-a-pose-the-six-oscar-red-carpet-poses-you-can-expect-to-see-tomorrow/story-e6frfpli-1226842926763", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/03/02/1226842/926568-59ed9092-9e99-11e3-b2ad-08c02f4f904c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/03/02/1226842/926568-59ed9092-9e99-11e3-b2ad-08c02f4f904c.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226842926763, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "flattering shape, red carpet tomorow, complete lack, hidden subtext, added bicep tone, arm cock, serial trickster, over-the-shoulder glance, Getty Images Inc., Screen Actors Guild, Sarah Jessica Parker, Joan Rivers, Rachel Wayman, J Lo, Scarlett Johansson, Victoria Beckham, Eva Longoria, Taylor Swift, iconic leg pose, red carpet frequenters, culprit pattern, stance calls, peak condition, hourglass shape, pencil skirts, perfect-picture moment, Emma Thompson, Alicia Keys, Paris Hilton, Emma Watson, Angelina Jolie, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lawrence, red carpet, red carpet interview", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Mar 02 20:48:22 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Mar 02 20:48:22 EST 2014", "author": "STAFF WRITERS"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2856\"", "article_summary": "THE PHOTOBOMBCulprits: Emma Thompson, Jennifer LawrenceThis is a relatively new addition to the red carpet, but no less deserving of mention.\nEmma Thompson is the latest, making a perfectly good shot of Lupita Nyong\u2019o at the SAG Awards even better.\nCertain red carpet frequenters throw certain poses, time after time, photo after photo.\nCELEBRITIES have walked more red carpets than you or I have had hot dinners, and as such, they know what poses work best for them.\nTHE BECKHAM BENDCulprits: Victoria Beckham, Paris HiltonOne of the more advanced red-carpet poses, The BB involves leaning as far back as you can without tipping over (your core must be in peak condition)."}
