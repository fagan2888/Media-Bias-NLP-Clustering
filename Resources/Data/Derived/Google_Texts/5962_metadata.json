These actions have met with the approval of liberals everywhere. This is not a new attitude. Liberals have always been in favor of the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d from Roosevelt to Johnson to Obama, conveniently skipping Richard Nixon, of course. Liberal scholars have long championed the need of chief executives to meet modern exigencies as defined by liberal priorities\u2014so long as a Democrat was in the White House.\n\nCuriously, while liberals believe the chief executive can unilaterally modify laws passed by Congress, they do not accept many constitutional limits on Congress\u2019 legislative jurisdiction. The Constitution specifically delegates certain enumerated powers to the legislative branch, yet the last Congress run by Democrats governed as if it had plenary powers to legislate on any topic. Who can forget the bemused look of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she was asked to state the specific congressional power that authorized Obamacare? So while Congress can legislate on any topic, their actions are subject to unilateral revision by the chief executive.\n\nOf course, in the liberals\u2019 telling, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over any of this. The court should not review anything Congress does\u2014even on a straight, party-line vote\u2014because there are no limits on congressional authority. Also, according to the Justice Department, the high court has no power to rule on any of Obama\u2019s unilateral actions, either. The justices might as well take permanent vacations given this view of judicial review. Is there just a whiff of self-interest in this theory of separation of powers?\n\nHowever, what is most radically different about the Obama liberals\u2019 interpretation of the Constitution is its neutering of the Bill of Rights. To be sure, liberals never had much good to say about the Second, Ninth and 10th Amendments, but now they\u2019re striking at other amendments, even those they once revered.\n\nThis president has claimed authority to use drones to kill American citizens. He is copying the last administration here, though this time liberals are untroubled by any Fifth Amendment concerns.\n\nThe last vestige of American liberty is certainly the First Amendment\u2019s core guarantees of freedom of speech and religion. Yet, liberals have been cutting back on free expression for years, especially with college campus \u201cspeech codes\u201d that outlaw statements deemed offensive to any groups that might feel aggrieved. Rigorous debate and the free expression of ideas are jettisoned in favor of a pop psychological imperative to make groups and individuals feel good about themselves.\n\nThis assault on free speech continues with a constitutional amendment proposed by a several Democratic senators that would authorize Congress to regulate \u201cthe raising and spending of money and in-kind equivalents with respect to federal elections.\u201d Imagine this language in the hands of acquisitive federal bureaucrats looking for wrongs to correct and matters to regulate and control.\n\nIf you doubt that, just check out how the bureaucrats are interpreting Obamacare and religious liberty. Though not specifically required by Obamacare or any other law, Department of Health and Human Services bureaucrats working with legal abortion absolutists, have issued regulations mandating that every business provide coverage for \u201cmorning after\u201d-type contraceptive devices and drugs in their medical plans.\n\nThe Obama Justice Department argued that such an edict promulgated by bureaucrats trumped the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993, as well as the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom. Fortunately, plaintiffs prevailed in the Supreme Court (Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores), but only by one vote, with four liberal justices siding with the bureaucrats. In a related case, the Obama administration is attempting to force the Little Sisters of the Poor to adhere to the dictates of HHS regulators. Apparently, even the core guarantees of the First Amendment must be sacrificed for the Greater Good.\n\nIronically, the only constitutional provision to limit government power that liberals still champion is the right of \u201cprivacy,\u201d which of course is found nowhere in the Constitution.\n\nIn recent years, many Democrats have sought to rebrand \u201cliberalism\u201d and \u201cprogressivism.\u201d This is not just a cosmetic name change. Liberals of a generation ago accepted limits on government action, especially those limits contained in the Bill of Rights. Progressives, by contrast, have always found limits on their power to be inconvenient. Note Woodrow Wilson deriding the Senate\u2019s relatively minor objections to his League of Nations a century ago. If progressive government in this administration has taught us anything, it is that liberties that run counter to great progressive ambitions are in serious danger.\n\nBe afraid.
