This, according to a new report from the Public Citizen, has led to a weighted payment system that favors specialists over their primary care counterparts.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that the RUC\u2019s members are biased toward their own specialties, this results in the overvaluing of specialty procedures at the expense of primary care. Because there are significantly more specialty procedures than primary care procedures, the overvaluation of specialty and procedural services has caused U.S. specialists\u2019 pay to rise much more rapidly than primary care physicians since the formation of the RUC,\u201d the Public Citizen report said.\n\nWhile this may be the latest large-scale criticism of RUC, it certainly isn\u2019t the only one \u2013 The New York Times, The Washington Post, David Harlow\u2019s Healthblawg and the American Academy of Family Physicians have all called out the committee for valuing and promoting corrupt methodology. Even one of the developers of the resource-based relative value scale, Harvard School of Public Health professor William Hsaio, has frowned upon what the RUC has made of his system.\n\n\u201cAnd that was the point where I knew the system had been co-opted \u2026 It had become a political process, not a scientific process,\u201d Hsaio said in the Public Citizen report. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s political, you only have to look at the motivation of why AMA wants this job.\u201d\n\nIn the thick of such dissent, it\u2019s easy to skip over the latest findings from the University of Michigan Medical School. But overlooking those findings could yield more of the same broken formula, according to the study\u2019s lead author Kevin Kerber, MD.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really fix something when you don\u2019t know what is actually broken,\u201d Kerber told Healthcare Finance News\u2019 sister publication, Medical Practice Insider.\n\nAnd what\u2019s actually broken here, according to Kerber\u2019s study, is not necessarily the RUC or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It appears that the salary discrepancy between providers who perform operations and those who don\u2019t has more to do with how long it takes doctors to provide whatever care they give \u2013 \u201cor rather, how long the influential Medicare payment system assumes it takes them,\u201d the study argues.\n\n\u201cIf the time is the dominant factor explaining the variance in RVUs, we then have to ask ourselves how accurate are the times,\u201d Kerber said. \u201cWhich is a huge potential target because then we have to consider the methods used to determine the times. And they\u2019re based on surveys that RUC performs that often have very low response rates and could have other methodology problems.\u201d\n\nThe analysis undertaken by Kerber and the rest of the study team indicates that the RUC and CMS have not explicitly rigged the payment system to favor specialists over PCPs. There was no evidence suggesting that the groups assigning payments are giving more value to procedures and tests and not office visits, Kerber noted, adding that this is true \u201ceven after adjusting the analysis for the utilization of codes.\u201d\n\nWhich brought the study team back to the $140,000 question (the difference between what surgeons, for instance, make on average [$300,000] and what PCPs make on average [$160,000]): What is the problem if CMS and the RUC are not explicitly favoring these specialists over primary care doctors?\n\nIt all comes down, again, to accuracy and time reporting, Kerber said.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to pay physicians across specialties the same amount per worked time, then one of the main targets has got to be exploring how valid the current times are and trying to come up with better methods to measure them,\u201d he said.\n\nThat means considering \u201chow well physicians know how much time they spend on individual codes,\u201d and not overlooking an important possibility: \u201cIf physicians know that the times that they report are going to determine their pay, then whatever they report may not be accurate, whether they\u2019re doing that overtly or subconsciously.\u201d\n\nAlongside information-gathering tactics, it\u2019s also imperative to consider the added payments that Medicare makes for the overhead costs involved in each service, like tools and equipment, which, the report posits, can \u201cunintentionally create profit sources and incentives for procedures.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Kerber said it\u2019s worth noting that the average surgeon works 5 percent to 10 percent more hours per week than the average primary care doctor, although this accounts for little regarding the wide difference in income.\n\nWork still must be done in discovering the severity of the many factors contributing to the physician income disparity, but one thing remains clear for Kerber \u2013 the assumption that the payment system is skewed toward certain physician types is causing a lot of strain within the provider workforce.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of rumors out there that haven\u2019t really explored the data well enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming adversarial \u2013 certain groups are pitted against other groups and I think it\u2019s become an impediment to actual progress.\u201d\n\nWith an eye on the future, Kerber suggested that today\u2019s medical students may be tempted to choose a higher-paying specialty over primary care, regardless of their passion, which could trigger PCP shortages.\n\nThe 30 physicians comprising the RUC met just last month in Chicago to \u201cdiscuss how much money doctors are paid by Medicare for discrete procedures and, more broadly, how much private insurers pay for the same procedures,\u201d reported the Public Citizen.\n\nGet to know the current RUC representatives here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/wait-what-ruc-doesnt-skew-toward-specialists", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Primary care physicians have long claimed that the RUC has skewed in favor of specialists, but a new University of Michigan Medical School report says there is no such evidence, which, no doubt, will only add to the contentious debate about the secretive committee.", "title": "Wait.
