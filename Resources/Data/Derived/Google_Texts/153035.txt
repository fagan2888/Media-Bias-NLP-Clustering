Derrick Johnson, the president of the Mississippi NAACP, talked with HuffPost Live today about Thad Cochran‘s win over Chris McDaniel, helped somewhat by black voters. And Johnson said that Cochran should “show some reciprocity” to the black voters who backed him on election day.

Johnson said he’s been keeping the pressure on Cochran, as the NAACP has with other Republicans, so support amending the Voting Rights Act, “free of any conditions such as voter ID.” They’ve had no Republican support so far, but with Cochran being reelected, Johnson suggested “this is an opportunity for him to show some reciprocity for African-Americans providing a strong level of support for him.”

And Johnson said that if you look at recent history in Mississippi, “not only would he have not won the election last night, he would not be a sitting senator at all but for the volunteers and the staff of the NAACP.”
