Dad-to-be Troy Dickerson and his wife, Kristen Dickerson, filmed the births of their first two children, so the birth of baby number three was no exception. Troy strapped the GoPro camera on his head while driving at 95mph to the hospital, before Kristen got out of the car, stood up, and made a curbside delivery in front of Texas Medical Center.\n\nThe 10-minute YouTube video, which has already received over 270,000 views, starts with the couple driving along the freeway. It is in between bouts of pain, 42-week pregnant wife tells her husband she doesn\u2019t think she can make it to the hospital, and to stop at a closer location. \u201cI can\u2019t make it! I can\u2019t make it,\u201d said the expecting mom. \u201cWe need to stop.\u201d\n\nIt is not until Troy pulls up near the hospital entrance where his wife exclaims she can feel the baby\u2019s head. Eagerly getting out of the car, Kristen finds herself unable to move, as she stood and knew she was giving birth at that moment. \"I said, 'On the next contraction, push.' And on the next contraction, she pushed, and he came flying out,\" Troy told Click2Houston.\n\nA team of 10 nurses came to assist Kristen, who is a childbirth educator at the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Pavilion for Women. The mother of three was scheduled for induction the next day. Kristen was thrilled to have the footage of her unusual birth, she told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m more hesitant to send it to people, because it\u2019s such an intimate moment for us, but as a birth educator, it\u2019s really cool to let people see that our bodies know what to do.\u201d\n\nIt is rare for women to unexpectedly give birth at home or in the backseat of a taxi, especially if it\u2019s their first baby, but emergency pregnancies do happen. In less than one percent of births, a woman who\u2019s had no labor symptoms, or only intermittent contractions will have a desire to push, signaling the arrival of the baby. In emergency pregnancies, women are always instructed to call 911.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "miracle of life, in labor, impending birth, emergency birth, gopro, pregnancy, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Texan dad Troy Dickerson sped 95mph and filmed his wife\u2019s impending birth in the car all the way to her curbside delivery outside hospital doors.", "title": "Husband Speeds And Films Wife's Birth In Front Of Hospital [GRAPHIC VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-life-husband-uses-gopro-film-wife-giving-birth-outside-hospital-after-driving-95-mph-292432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/woman-gives-birth-outside-hospital-doors.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texan dad Troy Dickerson sped 95mph and filmed his wife\u2019s impending birth in the car all the way to her curbside delivery outside hospital doors.", "title": "Husband Speeds And Films Wife's Birth In Front Of Hospital [GRAPHIC VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-life-husband-uses-gopro-film-wife-giving-birth-outside-hospital-after-driving-95-mph-292432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/woman-gives-birth-outside-hospital-doors.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/woman-gives-birth-outside-hospital-doors.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-10T15:04:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T15:19:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Texan dad Troy Dickerson sped 95mph and filmed his wife\u2019s impending birth in the car all the way to her curbside delivery outside hospital doors."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b13\"", "article_summary": "And on the next contraction, she pushed, and he came flying out,\" Troy told Click2Houston.\nDad-to-be Troy Dickerson and his wife, Kristen Dickerson, filmed the births of their first two children, so the birth of baby number three was no exception.\nA team of 10 nurses came to assist Kristen, who is a childbirth educator at the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Pavilion for Women.\n\u201cWe need to stop.\u201dIt is not until Troy pulls up near the hospital entrance where his wife exclaims she can feel the baby\u2019s head.\nKristen was thrilled to have the footage of her unusual birth, she told ABC News."}
