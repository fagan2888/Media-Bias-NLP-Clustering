(Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nUniversity of Alabama sororities are accused of barring two black women from pledging. Should Greek organizations be forced to be more inclusive? Comments from Twitter and Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe idea that two girls were dropped from sorority recruitment at Alabama because they're black sickens me. That's unacceptable.\n\n\u2014 @MrJakeFleming\n\nSororities and fraternities extend invitations to pledge to those students who fit the culture, social structure, and academic or athletic standing of that particular Greek organization.\n\nIf their culture is accepting of a racial mix, then students of color will be invited. If not, so be it. Forcing a sorority to accept certain students strictly on skin color goes too far. This is not about equal rights. It's no different from a country club deciding whom to admit.\n\n\u2014 Fred Clemens\n\nHistorically black Greek letter organizations accept all races. I was recently at my HBGLO's national convention, and I saw faces of all different races represented in our membership, not just those of African descent. Not to mention that there are African Americans and other racial groups who are members of predominately white Greek letter organizations.\n\nIt's unfortunate when people assume national organizations are racially exclusive based on what they saw during a short time in their undergraduate years.\n\n\u2014 Terri Holland-Hill\n\nWow, Alabama. Of course, it's not just this school. Racism is alive.\n\n\u2014 @Exquisitely_Me_\n\nThere is just as much as, if not more, diversity in predominately white fraternities as there is in predominately black ones.\n\nLet's not pretend that one incident reflects the overall Greek system.\n\n\u2014 Michael Carlisle\n\nMy sorority was listed in that article about rush racism at the University of Alabama. It is not a national policy. Sad.\n\n\u2014 @SassySouthSays\n\nWant more of the conversation?
