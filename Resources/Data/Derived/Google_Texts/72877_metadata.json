After disheartening overtime losses to Minnesota and Colorado, this W was gorgeous to the Rams because they fell behind early to the Roadrunners but found a way to get out of deep beep-beep.\n\nWhat was the real value of this victory?\n\n\u201cTo conquer some demons,\u201d CSU coach Mike Bobo said.\n\nThe first real in-game crisis of the nascent Bobo era landed on the Rams with the ugly thud of a blocked punt early in the second quarter.\n\nWith the offense struggling to find a rhythm, as the ground attack missed injured Dalyn Dawkins and starting quarterback Nick Stevens found frustration more often than star receiver Rashard Higgins, Bobo decided to give an offensive series to freshman QB Coleman Key when CSU took possession with 13 minutes, 21 seconds remaining until halftime.\n\nAfter the drive stalled within the 30-yard line, CSU\u2019s Hayden Hunt took the long snap and rolled right for a rugby punt. Bad idea. Hunt rolled straight into trouble, kicking the football into UTSA defender Justin Chavez at point-blank range. The Roadrunners cashed in that turnover for a cheap touchdown two plays later on an 11-yard pass from Blake Bogenschutz to David Morgan.\n\nWith 10 minutes remaining before intermission, the underdog Roadrunners had a 17-9 lead. And the Rams? They were doing their Wile E. Coyote impression. CSU was in deep beep-beep.\n\nTrailing by eight points on the road to a UTSA team playing only the 50th game in program history? Something was in the air, and it wasn\u2019t the scent of brisket slow cooking over hickory. This smelled like trouble.\n\nThis is where the Rams, who had their hearts broken in back-to-back overtime losses, were at risk of having their spirit stomped on before play in the Mountain West could even begin.\n\nThis appeared to be a quarterback controversy waiting to happen, with the heady Stevens in danger of losing favor to the less experienced but more physically gifted Key.\n\nThis was the first real test of a first-time head coach. Yes, Bobo brings Southeastern Conference street cred from Georgia and a positive intensity that\u2019s infectious. But a catchy mantra like \u201cNever Satisfied!\u201d quickly begins to ring hollow if a rookie coach begins to make a habit of never finding a way to win the close ones.\n\n\u201cSometimes we all tend to question what we\u2019re doing and what we\u2019re about,\u201d Bobo admitted.\n\nThe Rams rallied because Stevens began to find his bearings by rediscovering Higgins as a useful target. Perfect anticipation by CSU cornerback DeAndre Elliott created a crucial interception in the red zone. The Rams reeled off 21 consecutive points, and when Higgins ran past the Roadrunners\u2019 secondary to haul in a 38-yard touchdown pass, it seemed as if Colorado State was home free, leading 30-17 with 6:20 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nTexas-San Antonio, however, refused to surrender. When Jarveon Williams dashed 85 yards for a touchdown to pull the Roadrunners to within 33-31 early in the fourth period, it ensured the final 10:28 of the contest would be a test of will as much as skill for the Rams.\n\n\u201cIt was great to see the guys keep believing, keep fighting and sticking to the plan,\u201d said Bobo, especially pleased with the 143 yards rushing Jasen Oden provided with Dawkins watching from the sideline.\n\nIn the first month of games under Bobo, the imprint of former coach Jim McElwain began to fade and the inevitable mistakes associated with a football program developing a new personality were made.\n\nWhat have the Rams learned about themselves?\n\n\u201cI think we know how to fight,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nThis CSU team won\u2019t sniff 10 victories or make any run at a national ranking. Their conference schedule front-loaded with trouble, there figure to be some trying Saturdays in October.\n\nBut earning a berth in a bowl game? That\u2019s a realistic goal for the Rams.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: CSU wins battle of wills with itself", "title": "Kiszla: CSU wins battle of wills with itself", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/kiszla-csu-wins-battle-of-wills-with-itself/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T22:14:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:35:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mark Kiszla"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTo conquer some demons,\u201d CSU coach Mike Bobo said.\nThe Rams rallied because Stevens began to find his bearings by rediscovering Higgins as a useful target.\nJust don\u2019t tell that to star Rams receiver Rashard Higgins, who grew up in Texas.\nPerfect anticipation by CSU cornerback DeAndre Elliott created a crucial interception in the red zone.\nThis CSU team won\u2019t sniff 10 victories or make any run at a national ranking."}
