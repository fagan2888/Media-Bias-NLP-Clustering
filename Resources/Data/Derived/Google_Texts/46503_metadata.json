This provision has come under fire from religious organizations that oppose birth control or consider things like the morning-after pill to be abortifacients \u2013 substances that induce abortion. They are not.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s contraception mandate does not apply to houses of worship, but religious groups have pushed for the same protection to be granted to religiously affiliated organizations like hospitals, schools and nonprofits.\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has been involved in many prominent legal cases challenging the contraception mandate, said that despite the changes announced on Friday, Obamacare would still force religious groups to provide contraception in violation of their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cEspecially after the supreme court\u2019s recent King v Burwell decision allowed the government to expand its healthcare exchanges, there is no reason at all the government needs religious employers to help it distribute these products,\u201d Becket Fund legal counsel Ad\u00e8le Auxier Keim said in a statement.\n\nUnder the changes to the law, qualifying groups with a religious objection to the contraception mandate can send a note to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of alerting the insurer. The government will then tell the insurer, so that it can provide alternative forms of birth control coverage.\n\nThis applies to privately held companies in which at least 50% of the company is owned by five or fewer people \u2013 though a family counts as one person.\n\nRelated: Hobby Lobby ruling: firms can refuse to provide contraception coverage\n\nIn June 2014, the supreme court ruled in Burwell v Hobby Lobby, a case brought by a Christian-owned company, that \u201cclosely held\u201d corporations had the same religious protections as individuals, and were therefore not required to follow the contraception mandate. The decision came under fire from women\u2019s health groups, which have pushed the Obama administration to adhere to its initial plans.\n\nOne pressure group, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said it did not expect Friday\u2019s announcement to temper religious challenges to the contraception mandate. The group\u2019s executive director, the Reverend Barry W Lynn, said in a statement the supreme court was responsible for making such challenges possible with its Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\n\u201cThe administration had to respond to this ruling, and today\u2019s regulations are a good-faith effort to protect women,\u201d Lynn said.\n\n\u201cAlthough I hope I\u2019m proven wrong, I fear that the religious right and its allies, the Catholic bishops, won\u2019t stop until they have denied access to safe and affordable birth control to as many women as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Healthcare law changes make it easier for religious organizations to deny employees birth control but most forms must still be covered at no cost", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Healthcare law changes make it easier for religious organizations to deny employees birth control but most forms must still be covered at no cost", "title": "Revised Obamacare contraception rule still violates religious beliefs, says group", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/11/revised-obamacare-contraception-mandate-religious-groups", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721131d263781334ea6cd3a0309cc00b70fe4504/0_290_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=1e1f80c47bdc9a9be2cbda51fe76ed40", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/11/revised-obamacare-contraception-mandate-religious-groups?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/11/revised-obamacare-contraception-mandate-religious-groups", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/11/revised-obamacare-contraception-mandate-religious-groups?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@holpuch", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/721131d263781334ea6cd3a0309cc00b70fe4504/0_290_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/11/revised-obamacare-contraception-mandate-religious-groups?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US healthcare,Obama administration,US news,US supreme court,Health insurance,Religion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-11T19:13:40.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T21:02:31.000Z", "tag": "US healthcare,Obama administration,US news,US supreme court,Health insurance,Religion"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721131d263781334ea6cd3a0309cc00b70fe4504/0_290_3000_1801/3000.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=d4eef1fa387bd707e82155ea31101821", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US healthcare,Obama administration,US news,US supreme court,Health insurance,Religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb96e\"", "article_summary": "The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has been involved in many prominent legal cases challenging the contraception mandate, said that despite the changes announced on Friday, Obamacare would still force religious groups to provide contraception in violation of their religious beliefs.\nOne pressure group, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said it did not expect Friday\u2019s announcement to temper religious challenges to the contraception mandate.\nThis provision has come under fire from religious organizations that oppose birth control or consider things like the morning-after pill to be abortifacients \u2013 substances that induce abortion.\nThe Obama administration on Friday announced changes to its signature healthcare law that will make it easier for religious organizations not to cover birth control for women.\nThe government will then tell the insurer, so that it can provide alternative forms of birth control coverage."}
