But Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2014 Winter Olympics, which begin on Feb. 7, are already an extraordinary event by several measures.\n\nFirst, the Sochi Games are the most expensive in history. At $51 billion, the expenditure has exceeded even Beijing\u2019s 2008 festivities ($40 billion), though more than four times as many athletes compete at the Summer Games.\n\nSecond, Sochi is the warmest city to hold the Winter Olympics. (Hence the goofy motto, \u201cHot, Cold, Yours.\u201d) Weather forecasts for Sochi, one of Russia\u2019s few subtropical cities, predict highs in the 50s. Hence also the cost: $10 billion has gone into the construction of a 30-mile highway-cum-railroad that will connect Adler, the temperate coastal site of the skating competitions, with Krasnaya Polyana, the sleepy mountain town transformed, over the past seven years, into a ski resort. With 45 bridges, 12 tunnels and corruption around every turn, this thoroughfare is the most expensive construction contract in Russian history, and by itself costs more than the entire 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver ($7 billion).\n\nLastly, there is the extensive security force surrounding the event, which will include upwards of 60,000 personnel \u2014 one for every six residents of Sochi, and more than the 53,000 foreign spectators expected to attend. When all is said and done, it could mark history\u2019s most concerted effort to install a comprehensive security system in a free city.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry, the 1,500-square-mile \u201cRing of Steel\u201d surrounding Sochi is composed of the following human elements:\n\n25,000 police (compared to 13,000 in London)\n\n30,000 soldiers (compared to 17,000 in London)\n\n8,000 Interior Ministry troops\n\nThe 58th Army, to assist in establishing an Olympic security zone in the contested Georgian territory of Abkhazia, just a couple of miles from Adler.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest security force ever provided for the Olympics. Enabled by a perfect storm of terrorist threats, autocratic government and limitless resources, the system is certainly more extensive that what might be possible at a similar event in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nIn addition to metal detectors and X-rays at various checkpoints, Sochi has been equipped with tens of thousands of cameras. Russia has banned all vehicles not registered in the region. Russian visitors, like their foreign counterparts, must register with police within three days of arrival. The Pentagon has sent two warships to the Black Sea (to join four Russian Grachonok boats), has promised air support and is considering sharing technology used to disrupt remote detonators. Anti-ballistic missiles and underwater machine guns stand at the ready.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like Sochi has been turned into an independent state,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a specialist in security affairs and modern Russia, who teaches at NYU. \u201cIt is an extremely extensive control zone.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, I spoke to Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist who broke the biggest security story of the Sochi Olympics: SORM, the Russians\u2019 virtual surveillance system. The Russian FSB (successor to the KGB) will monitor all communications between spectators, journalists, athletes and anyone else who visits (or lives in) Sochi. The U.S. State Department has warned business travelers to be careful with sensitive information, which \u201cmay be taken and shared with competitors, counterparts, and/or Russian regulatory and legal entities.\u201d One security expert said SORM was like \u201cPRISM on steroids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not public outcry about these measures,\u201d Soldatov said. \u201cAfter every big terrorist attack, like Volgograd,\u201d \u2014 where suicide bombings killed 34 people last month \u2014 \u201cRussian society approves half-measures. And metadata seems quite innocent in comparison to what was proposed.\u201d In October, for example, the lower house of the Russian Parliament approved a law to hold the relatives of terrorists financially responsible for crimes. Muslim women in nearby Dagestan say they have been asked to provide saliva samples to the FSB so that their body parts may be identified in the event of a suicide bombing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid fears of terrorism, the Sochi Olympics have ushered in the latest evolution of the modern surveillance state", "title": "The Sochi Olympics: Putin\u2019s shiny new surveillance state", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Amid fears of terrorism, the Sochi Olympics have ushered in the latest evolution of the modern surveillance state", "title": "The Sochi Olympics: Putin\u2019s shiny new surveillance state", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/the_sochi_olympics_putins_shiny_new_surveillance_state/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/putin_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid fears of terrorism, the Sochi Olympics have ushered in the latest evolution of the modern surveillance state", "title": "The Sochi Olympics: Putin\u2019s shiny new surveillance state", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/putin_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 Sochi Olympics, Dream City, Editor's Picks, panopticon, Security, Surveillance, surveillance state, Vladimir Putin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 Sochi Olympics, Dream City, Editor's Picks, panopticon, Security, Surveillance, surveillance state, Vladimir Putin, News, Politics NewsThe records are supposed to be set on the slopes at Sochi, not on the spreadsheets.\nBut Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2014 Winter Olympics, which begin on Feb. 7, are already an extraordinary event by several measures.\nSecond, Sochi is the warmest city to hold the Winter Olympics.\nWhen all is said and done, it could mark history\u2019s most concerted effort to install a comprehensive security system in a free city.\n\u201cIt is an extremely extensive control zone.\u201dOn Wednesday, I spoke to Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist who broke the biggest security story of the Sochi Olympics: SORM, the Russians\u2019 virtual surveillance system."}
