Sanders, a Vermont senator, has championed a single-payer, federally run health care system.\n\nA little more than half (51 percent) support repealing the law, which Donald Trump has favored. Forty-five percent opposed that approach.\n\nAnd 48% of those surveyed support retaining the Affordable Care Act, which 49 percent of Americans oppose. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has touted the Affordable Care Act and has proposed strengthening it.\n\nNone of the candidates\u2019 names were attached to their proposal during questioning.\n\nThe telephone poll of 1,549 U.S. adults was conducted May 6 to 8 with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nCopyright 2016 KING", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bernie Sanders may be the least likely candidate to make it to the general election, but his approach to health care scores well in a new poll.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "KUSA", "description": "Bernie Sanders may be the least likely candidate to make it to the general election, but his approach to health care scores well in a new poll.", "title": "Poll: 58% back federally run health care plan", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.king5.com/photo/2016/04/08/Sanders3_1460135834498_1486858_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.9news.com/news/politics/poll-58-back-federally-run-health-care-plan/196938598", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.9news.com", "description": "Bernie Sanders may be the least likely candidate to make it to the general election, but his approach to health care scores well in a new poll.", "title": "Poll: 58% back federally run health care plan", "image": {"src": "http://content.king5.com/photo/2016/04/08/Sanders3_1460135834498_1486858_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "@9NEWS", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195999427076956}, "keywords": "National,Politics,Nation-Now,Health", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "A Gallup poll released Monday found that a proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act with federally funded health care for all is favored by 58 percent of U.S. adults, while 37 percent are opposed.\nSanders, a Vermont senator, has championed a single-payer, federally run health care system.\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has touted the Affordable Care Act and has proposed strengthening it.\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - APRIL 06: Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
