He departed the scene and later that day surrendered himself to the authorities.\n\nThe beautiful, radiant faces of the victims, subsequently broadcast to the world, brimmed with all the promise of youth \u2013 a promise broken by an abrupt, insensate act of violence. A grand jury in Durham has indicted Hicks on three counts of first-degree murder, which carries the death penalty. Members of the victims\u2019 family told the press that they believe Hicks targeted them for being Muslim. The chief of the Chapel Hill Police, Chris Blue, announced, however, that their \u201cpreliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,\u201d but added that, \u201cWe understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case.\u201d\n\nThe killings might have passed almost unnoticed in the United States, where, in 2013 alone, there occurred more than 11,000 firearm homicides. But the combination of Hicks\u2019 anti-theism and the Muslim faith of those he slaughtered led to (comprehensible) suspicions that his murder could be classified as a \u201chate crime,\u201d and sparked a social media campaign that prejudged Hicks\u2019 foul misdeed to be an anti-theistically or atheistically motivated execution.\n\nLocal press coverage of the Chapel Hill shooting quickly turned national and then international, with the result that ISIS-abetter Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s crypto-Islamist president, chided President Obama for his silence on it, which apparently prompted the president to wade into the affair with a written declaration that \u201cNo one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,\u201d when there is still no evidence that that is what happened in Chapel Hill. Egypt\u2019s Islamic Al-Azhar University decried a \u201cterrorist cowardly act\u201d rooted in \u201cracism and Islamophobia.\u201d The Organization of Islamic Cooperation \u2013 the same entity pushing in the United Nations for a global law criminalizing \u201cinsults\u201d to religions \u2013 declared that \u201cThis gruesome crime has left Muslims worldwide in a state of shock and has raised concerns of the growing feelings of hatred towards Muslims and the increase of acts linked to Islamophobia in the United States.\u201d\n\nWithout checking the books, some journalists rushed into print and backed calls for an investigation into whether Hicks\u2019 murder was a hate crime, and Attorney General Eric Holder has ordered civil rights lawyers at the Department of Justice to do just that. But North Carolina law has no statute that would even allow prosecution of murder as a hate crime. Glenn Greenwald went beyond hate crime, tweeting: \u201cHorrifying: Radical atheist terrorist murders 3 Muslims in Chapel Hill,\u201d which presumes Hicks\u2019 killing qualifies as terrorism. Check out the FBI\u2019s definition of terrorism: Whether Hicks\u2019 atrocity meets the criteria hinges on his motive.\n\nAnd his motive, I repeat, is not yet clear. The Chapel Hill police have not revised their position that Hicks\u2019 motive was a disagreement over a parking space. We have not heard from Hicks about what impelled him to pull the trigger, but his ex-wife Karen Hicks backed up the police account and issued a statement saying that \u201cThis incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims\u2019 faith, but in fact was related to the longstanding parking disputes that my husband had with the neighbors.\u201d\n\nPostings from Craig Hicks\u2019 Facebook page would seem to corroborate her words: \u201cI hate Islam just as much as christianity, but they\u201d \u2013 Muslims \u2013 \u201chave the right to worship in this country just as much as any others do.\u201d Hicks wrote this in support of American Muslims who wanted to build the once notorious (but never-built and now forgotten) \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d in Manhattan \u2013 not exactly something one would expect from an Islamophobe. On the same page he also opined that \u201cIt\u2019s OK if we have a Muslim president.\u201d Fifty-four percent of Americans, and certainly all Islamophobes, would beg to differ.\n\nNeither these Facebook postings of his nor others reveal murderous sentiments toward Muslims as Muslims. Hicks\u2019 profile picture shows not his face, but the logo \u201cAtheists for Equality.\u201d Neighbors spoke to the media of his aggressive temperament and their fear of him (he was often openly armed and confrontational over minor matters), but none have suggested that animus toward Muslims, much less anti-theist convictions, had anything to do with his crime. That could, of course, change.\n\nThe sad fact is that no surprise should attach to the possibility \u2013 still the only officially bruited one \u2014 that Hicks killed for a banal, trifling motive (a parking space) unrelated to Islamophobia or anti-theism or atheism, \u201cNew\u201d or old.\n\nNevertheless, New Atheists Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris have suffered indictment by at least two well-known opponents of honest discourse about Islam for purportedly inciting Hicks with their \u201cstrident\u201d atheism. Hicks\u2019 Facebook page shows him to have been an admirer of Dawkins\u2019 \u201cThe God Delusion,\u201d which may have prompted the renowned scientist to tweet: \u201cHow could any decent person NOT condemn the vile murder of three young US Muslims in Chapel Hill?\u201d Reza Aslan responded with infelicitous petulance to this and other sympathetic tweets Dawkins emitted: \u201cSorry @RichardDawkins no matter how many times you condemn #ChapelHillShooting we are just going to keep assuming you haven\u2019t and don\u2019t.\u201d Aslan continued in this taunting vein with tweets about Sam Harris, who strongly rebutted him on his blog.\n\nHere you can read a summary of the wider (and unfounded, given the dearth of evidence) New Atheist indictment frenzy, but one article in particular blaming New Atheists for what happened in Chapel Hill does deserve special attention. I\u2019ll get to it in a moment. First, a necessary digression. Neither atheism, \u201cNew\u201d or old, nor anti-theism possesses a canon calling for violence against believers or in any way suborning it. Atheism denotes one thing and no more: the absence of belief in God or gods; and anti-theism, the rejection as undesirable of the existence of God or gods. The closest thing to any modern-day statement of what anti-theism is belongs to the late Christopher Hitchens, who declared, in his 2001 book \u201cLetters to a Young Contrarian,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not even an atheist so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful.\u201d Nothing here could be construed as provocative of violence. And it goes without saying that there exists no equivalent of an atheist \u201cchurch\u201d that could sanction what Hicks did.\n\nThough I\u2019ve never introduced myself as an anti-theist or much bothered with the term, I concur with Hitchens\u2019 definition. Obeisance to imaginary celestial despots and faith in ancient Middle Eastern \u201choly books\u201d of whatever kind have never owned a place in my life. If believers should try to convert me, I would respond with one or another version of Lucifer\u2019s fabled retort to God\u2019s command to submit to Him or be cast out of heaven: Non serviam! I shall not serve!\n\nBut back to the matter at hand. Lack of demonstrative evidence linking atheism, \u201cNew\u201d or old, to the Chapel Hill shootings did not stop Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig, a journalist and Ph.D. candidate in religion and critical thought at Brown University, from drawing up her own bill of indictment against Dawkins, Harris, et al., for the New Republic. In a wrongheaded essay titled \u201cThe Chapel Hill Murders Should Be a Wake-Up Call for Atheists,\u201d she begins by citing a Pew survey showing that atheists and Muslims both enjoy almost equal unpopularity in the United States \u2013 a fact of singular irrelevance to the Hicks slayings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The killing earlier this month of three young Muslims by an atheist was horrible \u2014 but it wasn't a hate crime", "title": "Religion\u2019s new atheist scapegoat: Why the Chapel Hill shootings weren\u2019t about Islamophobia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The killing earlier this month of three young Muslims by an atheist was horrible \u2014 but it wasn't a hate crime", "title": "Religion\u2019s new atheist scapegoat: Why the Chapel Hill shootings weren\u2019t about Islamophobia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/religions_new_atheist_scapegoat_why_the_chapel_hill_shootings_werent_about_islamophobia/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/maher_hicks_dawkins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The killing earlier this month of three young Muslims by an atheist was horrible \u2014 but it wasn't a hate crime", "title": "Religion\u2019s new atheist scapegoat: Why the Chapel Hill shootings weren\u2019t about Islamophobia", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/maher_hicks_dawkins.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, chapel hill murders, Editor's Picks, Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, New Atheism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Glenn Greenwald went beyond hate crime, tweeting: \u201cHorrifying: Radical atheist terrorist murders 3 Muslims in Chapel Hill,\u201d which presumes Hicks\u2019 killing qualifies as terrorism.\nThe Chapel Hill police have not revised their position that Hicks\u2019 motive was a disagreement over a parking space.\nBut North Carolina law has no statute that would even allow prosecution of murder as a hate crime.\nHere you can read a summary of the wider (and unfounded, given the dearth of evidence) New Atheist indictment frenzy, but one article in particular blaming New Atheists for what happened in Chapel Hill does deserve special attention.\nNeither these Facebook postings of his nor others reveal murderous sentiments toward Muslims as Muslims."}
