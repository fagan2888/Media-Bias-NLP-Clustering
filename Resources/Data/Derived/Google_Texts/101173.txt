Big Sean Talks Kanye West's Presidential Bid at iHeartRadio Music Fest 2015: 'I Called That in 2012'

Some may have been surprised by Kanye West’s recent announcement about his plans to run for president in 2020, but Big Sean says he saw it coming.

Kanye West Sees the Light at iHeartRadio Music Festival, Keeps Presidential Bid Alive

The rapper, who was on the iHeartRadio Music Festival lineup on Saturday, Sept. 19, told Billboard that he predicted Kanye’s presidential bid a few years ago.

“I called that back in like 2012, that Kanye was gonna be running for president. He has so many ideas. He’s so passionate,” he said. “Aside from that, though, I know he’s incredible. I mean, he discovered me.”

“Anybody who can listen to a kid rap at a radio station, see the potential in that and follow it through … you know, he’s one of the greatest guys ever,” he continued.

Sean's latest single, “One Man Can Change the World” (off of his album Dark Sky Paradise), features Kanye and John Legend – and another very special person: Sean’s grandmother.

“I’ve never had a song like that, where I get to honor my grandma … It’s really cool. It means a lot,” he said.
