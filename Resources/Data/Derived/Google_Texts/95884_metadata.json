So we\u2019ll basically have this nurses\u2019 station replicated in a central spot where our clinic leaders, physicians and nurses will work to manage the entire department.\u201d\n\nThe idea, says Gregory, is better use of resources and more rapid and efficient patient care.\n\nThat\u2019s important, he says, because the number of patients they see has been increasing 2 percent a year.\n\nGregory points to several patients who are being treated in the hallway \u2014 something he admits happens all too frequently. \u201cIf you\u2019re a patient it\u2019s pretty tough \u2014 especially if you have pain or anxiety or both, as most of our patients do,\" he says. \"That\u2019s not what you want to be exposed to.\u201d\n\nThe hospital's president, Tom Huebner, points to two main issues driving up demand for ER service. First is the shortage of primary care and other providers in Rutland. \u201cSecond,\u201d says Huebner, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a lot of increased demand with patients with behavior health needs, psychiatric patients, patients with substance abuse problems. That has certainly been an increase in volume as well.\u201d\n\nAnd Todd Gregory says many of those patients are much sicker when they do seek help. \u201cAnd so we are now boarding patients for days at a time, where we just didn\u2019t have that to this extent even four years ago,\" he says.\n\nThe hospital completed a much larger $21 million renovation of its emergency department and power plant 13 years ago. But Gregory says their needs have changed even in that short of a time.\n\nTom Huebner says the hospital will pay for the $6 million project with funds it already has. He says the upgrade will increase the number of treatment rooms, provide space for long-term stays, enhance security and improve overall traffic flow. If all goes as planned, he says the project will take 18 months to complete.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Rutland Regional Medical Center is undertaking a $6 million expansion of its emergency room to meet growing demand and the changing needs of patients.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "The Frequency, VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/rutland-regional-medical-center-begins-6-million-er-upgrade", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201601/rrmc_emergency_dept_keck_vpr_2016.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Rutland Regional Medical Center is undertaking a $6 million expansion of its emergency room to meet growing demand and the changing needs of patients.", "title": "Rutland Regional Medical Center Begins $6 Million ER Upgrade"}, "story_id": 464448434, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Nina Keck", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Rutland Regional Medical Center Begins $6 Million ER Upgrade"}, "nid": 36606, "datePublished": "2016-01-26", "keywords": "Rutland, Health Care, The Frequency, VPR News", "wordCount": 513, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Todd Gregory is medical director of Rutland Regional Medical Center\u2019s Emergency Department, which sees about 100 patients a day.\nRutland Regional Medical Center is undertaking a $6 million expansion of its emergency room to meet growing demand and the changing needs of patients.\n\u201cSecond,\u201d says Huebner, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a lot of increased demand with patients with behavior health needs, psychiatric patients, patients with substance abuse problems.\nNationwide, emergency room visits are climbing, despite the intention of the Affordable Care Act to slow ER traffic as more people gained access to doctors and other health-care providers.\nGregory points to several patients who are being treated in the hallway \u2014 something he admits happens all too frequently."}
