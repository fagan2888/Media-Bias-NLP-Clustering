Florida's Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act (CADRA) goes into effect on October 1, 2015.\n\nCADRA is intended to be a national model for legislation providing a new civil remedy (and recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees) to business owners who suffer harm or loss as a result of unauthorized access to their business data or computer systems. To take advantage of CADRA's protections, businesses must protect their computers by installing certain \u201ctechnological access barriers,\u201d or TABs, defined in CADRA.\n\nAn individual violates CADRA when he or she \u201cknowingly and with intent to cause harm or loss\u201d: (1) obtains information from a TAB-protected computer without authorization and as a result causes harm or loss; (2) causes the transmission of a program, code, or command to a TAB-protected computer and as a result causes harm or loss; or (3) traffics in any TAB through which access to a protected computer might be gained without authorization.\n\nDirectors, officers, employees, and others are considered authorized users only when they have express permission of the business owner to access TAB-protected computers. This authorization ends when the relationship between the business and the individual ends - whether by termination of employment or by other means.\n\nA business owner bringing suit under CADRA may recover money damages including: lost profits, economic damages, and the profits gained by the violator. Additionally, the owner is entitled to an injunction to prevent further violations and will recover the stolen information. Finally, the prevailing party in a CADRA action is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees.\n\nA full description of the law is available here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida businesses will soon have new legal cause of action to combat unauthorized access to protected computer systems by employees called Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Florida businesses will soon have an important and powerful new legal cause of action to combat unauthorized access to protected computer systems or data by employees, former employees, directors, off", "title": "Florida\u2019s CADRA a Powerful New Data Protection", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/florida-s-cadra-powerful-new-data-protection", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/computer%20business%20card%20exchange.jpg?itok=LiS3NnCn", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Technology, Florida, Internet, Cybersecurity, Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act, Unauthorized Access, Personal Information, CADRA", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Technology, Florida, Internet, Cybersecurity, Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act, Unauthorized Access, Personal Information, CADRATechnology, Florida, Internet, Cybersecurity, Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act, Unauthorized Access, Personal Information, CADRA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27ef\"", "article_summary": "Florida's Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act (CADRA) goes into effect on October 1, 2015.\nDirectors, officers, employees, and others are considered authorized users only when they have express permission of the business owner to access TAB-protected computers.\nA business owner bringing suit under CADRA may recover money damages including: lost profits, economic damages, and the profits gained by the violator.\nTo take advantage of CADRA's protections, businesses must protect their computers by installing certain \u201ctechnological access barriers,\u201d or TABs, defined in CADRA.\nFinally, the prevailing party in a CADRA action is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees."}
