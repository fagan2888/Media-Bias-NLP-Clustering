People and pets are all OK after a car crashed into an animal shelter lobby Saturday morning.

The driver involved told police her foot slipped while she was passing the East Springs Animal Hospital just before 11:30 a.m. She said she had problems with her brake, and was unable stop before her car went careening through the front of the building. Police say after she stopped, she was able to back out of the lobby.

The crash caused significant damage to the hospital door, and firefighters remained on scene after the crash to repair it.

Police say the driver will likely be ticketed for careless driving.

The animal hospital is located on the 5600 block of Constitution.
