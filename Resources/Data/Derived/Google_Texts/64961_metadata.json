(Photo by David Shankbone)\n\nEarlier this week, responding to initial news reports that the New York Police Department had drastically reduced the number of arrests and citations following the murder of two of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos on December 20, New York-based journalist and radio host Allison Kilkenny took to Twitter and noted, \u201cArrests plummeted 66% but I just looked outside and nothing is on fire and the sun is still out and everything. Weird.\u201d\n\nWhat has been largely reported as a \u201cvirtual work stoppage\u201d by NYPD officers as a result of a perceived lack of support coming from the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio, the internal turmoil between City Hall and the police stemmed from the interplay between ongoing street protests in the city that followed the non-indictment of Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the choking death of Eric Garner and public comments made by the mayor in support of those protests. When the man who killed officers Liu and Ramos appeared cite revenge for Garner\u2019s death as part of his motivation, many officers\u2014including union heads and leaders of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association\u2014quickly put the blame on de Blasio for creating what they called an \u201canti-police\u201d atmosphere.\n\nThough the public debate over the relationship between City Hall and the NYPD has seemingly started to cool, many people are now looking at the \u201cwork stoppage\u201d itself\u2014which reportedly resulted in drastic reductions in arrests, citations, and even parking tickets\u2014as rather positive evidence that a city with less arrests may be something to celebrate, not criticize.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nWriting for Rolling Stone on Wednesday, journalist Matt Taibbi described the situation in the city as \u201csurreal,\u201d but noted positively that, \u201cIn an alternate universe, the New York Police might have just solved the national community-policing controversy.\u201d\n\nIn his article, Taibbi explores that if the police protest was done for \u201cenlightened reasons\u201d\u2014as opposed to what he described as \u201cthe last salvo of an ongoing and increasingly vicious culture-war mess that is showing no signs of abating\u201d\u2014there would be something wonderful about living in a city that called on officers to prioritize building-up community members instead of finding ways to put officers \u201cin the position of having to make up for budget shortfalls\u201d by issuing unnecessary fines and citations to people who can barely afford to make ends meet in the first place.\n\n\u201cIf I were a police officer, I\u2019d hate to be taking money from people all day long,\u201d Taibbi writes. \u201cChrist, that\u2019s worse than being a dentist. So under normal circumstances, this slowdown wouldn\u2019t just make sense, it would be heroic. Unfortunately, this protest is not about police refusing to shake people down for money on principle.\u201d\n\nBut as Matt Ford asks in a new piece for The Atlantic, the stoppage\u2014whatever its motivation\u2014still raises this key question: \u201cIf the NYPD can safely cut arrests by two-thirds, why haven\u2019t they done it before?\u201d\n\nThe \u201chuman implications\u201d of that question, he continues, are not insignificant, especially for those most impacted by aggressive forms of policing. He writes:\n\nFewer arrests for minor crimes logically means fewer people behind bars for minor crimes. Poorer would-be defendants benefit the most; three-quarters of those sitting in New York jails are only there because they can\u2019t afford bail. Fewer New Yorkers will also be sent to Rikers Island, where endemic brutality against inmates has led to resignations, arrests, and an imminent federal civil-rights intervention over the past six months. A brush with the American criminal-justice system can be toxic for someone\u2019s socioeconomic and physical health. The NYPD might benefit from fewer unnecessary arrests, too. Tensions between the mayor and the police unions originally intensified after a grand jury failed to indict a NYPD officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner during an arrest earlier this year. Garner\u2019s arrest wasn\u2019t for murder or arson or bank robbery, but on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes\u2014hardly the most serious of crimes. Maybe the NYPD\u2019s new \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d standard for arrests would have produced a less tragic outcome for Garner then. Maybe it will for future Eric Garners too.\n\nConcluding his assessment, Taibbi describes what he thinks are the two issues that are central to what\u2019s happening in New York City and their relevance to a much broader conversation about race, policing, and other public policy questions for the nation as a whole. He writes:\n\nOne is an ongoing bitter argument about race and blame that won\u2019t be resolved in this country anytime soon, if ever. Dig a millimeter under the surface of the Garner case, Ferguson, the Liu-Ramos murders, and you\u2019ll find vicious race-soaked debates about who\u2019s to blame for urban poverty, black crime, police violence, immigration, overloaded prisons and a dozen other nightmare issues. But the other thing is a highly specific debate over a very resolvable controversy not about police as people, but about how police are deployed. Most people, and police most of all, agree that the best use of police officers is police work. They shouldn\u2019t be collecting backdoor taxes because politicians are too cowardly to raise them, and they shouldn\u2019t be pre-emptively busting people in poor neighborhoods because voters don\u2019t have the patience to figure out some other way to deal with our dying cities.\n\nHowever, what Taibbi ultimately laments is that because the work stoppage, in his opinion, represents a self-interested gesture by the NYPD it will likely have little, if any, long-term impact.\n\nInstead of shining a light on the broader issues he mentioned, Taibbi says, it will unfortunately be \u201cjust more fodder for our ongoing hate-a-thon\u201d that plays out on cable news and elsewhere.\n\nSardonically, Taibbi signed off, \u201cHappy New Year, America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If angered NYPD can so dramatically reduce arrests and citations, many are suggesting it could offer an ironic path to better policing nationwide.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "If angered NYPD can so dramatically reduce arrests and citations, many are suggesting it could offer an ironic path to better policing nationwide.", "title": "'Sun Is Still Out And Everything' After Arrests Drop By Two-Thirds in NYC", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/sun-is-still-out-and-everything-after-arrests-drop-by-two-thirds-in-nyc/200419/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NYPDs-finest-Photo-by-David-Shankbone-cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-02T14:10:45-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If angered NYPD can so dramatically reduce arrests and citations, many are suggesting it could offer an ironic path to better policing nationwide.", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NYPDs-finest-Photo-by-David-Shankbone-cropped.jpg", "title": "'Sun Is Still Out And Everything' After Arrests Drop By Two-Thirds in NYC", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Police", "published_time": "2015-01-03T05:00:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T14:10:45-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21a7\"", "article_summary": "Maybe the NYPD\u2019s new \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d standard for arrests would have produced a less tragic outcome for Garner then.\nOfficers from the NYPD stand on a street in New York City.\nHe writes:Fewer arrests for minor crimes logically means fewer people behind bars for minor crimes.\nMost people, and police most of all, agree that the best use of police officers is police work.\n\u201cIf I were a police officer, I\u2019d hate to be taking money from people all day long,\u201d Taibbi writes."}
