Last December, an 81-year-old Cincinnati grandfather received a call \u201cthat sent my life into a tailspin and conned me out of $7,000 in what I now know was a phone scam,\u201d he told the Senate Select Committee on Aging at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Vacation Rental Scams You Just Won\u2019t Believe\n\n\u201cThe caller had a young voice and said, \u2018Grandpa, this is your favorite grandson.\u2019 To which I replied, \u2018I have six grandsons and they\u2019re all my favorites,\u2019\u201d the scam victim, \u201cRoger W.,\u201d testified on Wednesday.\n\nWhen the caller said he was the oldest grandson, the grandfather reflexively replied, \u201cTighe, how are you?\u201d The grandson explained he had gotten into some trouble during a trip, needed money to get out of jail, \u201cand I don\u2019t want Mom and Dad to know about this,\u201d he added. \u201cTalk to this police officer.\u201d\n\nAs this increasingly sinister charade unfolded, a so-called \u201cpolice officer\u201d got on the phone to tell the shocked grandparent he should go to Walmart or CVS and \u201cload a total of $3,000 into Green Dot Moneypak cards in $1,000 denominations,\u201d Roger W. said, \u201cand that I needed cash to purchase the cards.\u201d\n\nDistressed about his grandson\u2019s predicament and desperate to help, Roger W. (who wanted his privacy maintained for fear of being further victimized) cashed a check for $3,000 \u201cat my bank and went to Walmart and bought three MoneyPak cards, each loaded with $1,000 dollars. I returned home and called the police officer at a number with a 438 area code \u2013 the area code for Montreal, Canada \u2013 and gave him the scratch-off numbers on the MoneyPak cards.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Caller ID Scam You Must Know About\n\nBut the scammers needed another $4,000 to complete the transaction. It was only after sending additional money that Roger W. finally called other family members about his grandson\u2019s situation. When he reached his actual grandson on the phone and learned he was safe and sound \u2013 and hadn\u2019t asked for money \u2013 Roger W. realized he\u2019d been sucker-punched.\n\nHe called the Cincinnati police, the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission, but even more than six months later, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what they\u2019ve been able to do about it,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nRoger W. is one of almost too many to count \u2013 and his quickness to come to a beloved \u201cgrandson\u2019s\u201d rescue is not uncommon. \u201cLove definitely makes a difference, and it works to the scammer\u2019s advantage,\u201d Steve Baker of the Federal Trade Commission told AARP.\n\nSenator Susan Collins (R-ME), the ranking member of the Select Committee on Aging, said Wednesday that one of her constituents, Sandra Jaeger, \u201cgot a call from someone who claimed to be her son. He said he had been in a car accident and didn\u2019t have insurance. He asked her to send $1,500 to pay off the other party, and Mrs. Jaeger did so, using Western Union to wire the money.\u201c\n\nRelated: Social Security Closes Offices As More Seniors Need Services\n\nWhen she realized she\u2019d been scammed, Jaeger contacted \u201clocal and state law enforcement and the FBI, but was told there was nothing they could do.\u201d\n\nCalling these scammers a \u201cscourge,\u201c Sen. Collins warned Wednesday of the \u201cdangers posed by con artists looking to swindle older Americans out of their life savings.\u201c\n\nLast year alone, Americans lost more than $73 million to phone imposter scams, says the FTC \u2013 but that number is almost surely a drop in the bucket, since most victims don\u2019t report these scams out of fear, distress or embarrassment. Instances of imposter scams doubled between 2009 and 2013, says the Select Committee on Aging. That is why it wants better detection of the crimes, more prosecutions, and better consumer safeguards on the part of retailers and phone companies whose products and services are often used during the transactions.\n\nDaniel Marson, director of neuropsychology at University of Alabama-Birmingham and an expert on seniors and their financial decision-making, refers to this relatively new \u201cfinancial elder exploitation\u201d as a \u201ctime bomb,\u201d since the number of older Americans will swell in the years ahead. Consumers Digest reports there are at least five million cases of this financial abuse in the U.S. each year.\n\nRelated: What '60 Minutes' Got Right and Wrong About Aging\n\nA recent study by AARP said people 50 and older may appear \u201ceasy targets\u201d for financial abuse for several reasons: \u201cThey expect honesty in the marketplace, are less likely to take action when defrauded, and are less knowledgeable about their rights in an increasingly complex marketplace\u201d \u2013 but they\u2019re also \u201cmore likely to be home than their younger neighbors\u201d and therefore more likely to pick up the phone, no matter who\u2019s calling.\n\nThe financial scams \u201care real and a concern,\u201d says Michael Hodin, PhD, who studies aging populations, though he worries about the hyper focus on older people as victims. \u201cLet\u2019s not miss the more profound need for a change in culture and perspective that presumes that this demographic can be active, engaged, independent and productive Americans.\u201d\n\nWhile the National Council on Aging includes the imposter scam in its current list of top 10 scams against seniors, Ramsey Alwin, vice president of economic security at the council, says scams against older Americans are \u201cconstantly evolving and changing. Scammers are very creative. On Facebook, for example, they\u2019ll hack into accounts and post status updates saying they\u2019re stuck in other countries and need money.\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Older Americans and the Senate Select Committee on Aging have launched new efforts to combat these frauds. \u201cAny one of us can fall victim,\u201d says Alwin. \u201cThe \u2018victim\u2019 terminology isn\u2019t demeaning or disparaging to anyone. It simply reflects the reality of what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nOther popular scams against older Americans:\n\nhealth insurance fraud\n\ncounterfeit prescription drug scams\n\nfuneral and cemetery scams\n\nfraudulent anti-aging product scams\n\ntelemarketing scams\n\nInternet fraud\n\ninvestment scams\n\nhomeowner and reverse mortgage scams\n\nsweepstakes and lottery scams\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Financial fraud against older Americans is growing rapidly \u2013 with some scams so brazen", "title": "The \u2018Grandpa Scam\u2019 That\u2019s Costing Seniors a Bundle", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/18/Grandpa-Scam-s-Costing-Seniors-Bundle", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122013_Senior_iPad_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/18/Grandpa-Scam-s-Costing-Seniors-Bundle", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122013_Senior_iPad_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Financial fraud against older Americans is growing rapidly \u2013 with some scams so brazen", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It was only after sending additional money that Roger W. finally called other family members about his grandson\u2019s situation.\nRoger W. is one of almost too many to count \u2013 and his quickness to come to a beloved \u201cgrandson\u2019s\u201d rescue is not uncommon.\nIn one scenario, phone scammers posing as relatives of older people aim straight for the seniors\u2019 bank accounts \u2013 and all too often hit the jackpot.\nFinancial fraud against older Americans is growing rapidly \u2013 with some scams so brazen they almost defy belief.\nWhen he reached his actual grandson on the phone and learned he was safe and sound \u2013 and hadn\u2019t asked for money \u2013 Roger W. realized he\u2019d been sucker-punched."}
