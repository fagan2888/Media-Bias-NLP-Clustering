Dylan Parker, CC BY SA-2.0\n\nJohnson & Johnson announced Friday that the company is recalling 200,000 bottles of its most popular Motrin Infants formula \u2014 Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor \u2014 due to a risk that they may contain tiny plastic particles. Consumers have been asked to stop using the impacted items and call the company for a refund at 1-877-414-7709.\n\n\"From our perspective, during the manufacturing process at the third party supplier, that's when the particles got into the ibuprofen,\" McNeil Vice President Ed Kuffner told the Associated Press.\n\nAccording to information obtained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tiny plastic particles (about the size of a poppy seed) were identified in a product lot before it was released to the market. The particles originated with a third party supplier of ibuprofen, which is the active ingredient in the Motrin infant drops. The company is taking every precaution to ensure that any lots that entered the market prior to the discovery of the plastic particles be recalled due to \u201cthe potential for adverse medical events.\u201d However, the company does reiterate that the likelihood of a baby getting sick is very low. The recall is a voluntary, cautionary measure.\n\nHalf-ounce bottles of Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor are the subject of the recall. They can be identified by their lot numbers: DCB3T01, DDB4R01 and DDB4S01.\n\nFor more information about the recall, visit FDA.gov.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "infant motrin recall 2013, fda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that 200,000 bottles of its most popular infant drops may have been contaminated by plastic particles.", "title": "200,000 Bottles Of Infant Motrin Recalled", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/infant-motrin-recall-2013-jj-formula-may-contain-plastic-particles-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-baby", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-baby4396868797.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that 200,000 bottles of its most popular infant drops may have been contaminated by plastic particles.", "title": "200,000 Bottles Of Infant Motrin Recalled", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/infant-motrin-recall-2013-jj-formula-may-contain-plastic-particles-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-baby", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-baby4396868797.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-baby4396868797.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-07T11:04:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:01:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that 200,000 bottles of its most popular infant drops may have been contaminated by plastic particles."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb78\"", "article_summary": "Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that 200,000 bottles of its most popular infant drops may have been contaminated by plastic particles.\nDylan Parker, CC BY SA-2.0Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that the company is recalling 200,000 bottles of its most popular Motrin Infants formula \u2014 Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor \u2014 due to a risk that they may contain tiny plastic particles.\nHalf-ounce bottles of Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor are the subject of the recall.\nAccording to information obtained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tiny plastic particles (about the size of a poppy seed) were identified in a product lot before it was released to the market.\nThe particles originated with a third party supplier of ibuprofen, which is the active ingredient in the Motrin infant drops."}
