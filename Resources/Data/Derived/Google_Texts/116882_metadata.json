We never invaded any country! Around the USSR, he squeezed them until they collapsed during the Bush administration. He surrounded them with our allies. He spent them into disaster. We used surrogates, we used satellite countries, and, yes, we used our military, but we didn't invade. We weren't sending American troops everywhere. As a matter of fact, off the top off my head, I believe the only place we actually invaded was Grenada.\n\n\n\nLindsey Graham doesn't know what the hell he's talking about!
