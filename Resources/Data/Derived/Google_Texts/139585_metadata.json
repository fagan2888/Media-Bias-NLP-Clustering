The three other cases, all reported in Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital and largest city, included two female health workers and a 53-year-old man who is currently being treated at an intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nAccording to the WHO, 170 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported since September 2012, resulting in 72 deaths. People diagnosed with this chronic respiratory infection have reported minor symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea as well as severe complications, including renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nThe elderly man who passed away in Riyadh had no travel history. However, it was reported he had been exposed to animals. Earlier this month, a research team from the Netherlands and Qatari discovered the MERS virus can infect camels the same way it does in humans, Reuters reported. Seeing as camels provide the region with milk, transportation, and meat, the animals can lead to a possible outbreak. The man also had underlying chronic illnesses when he was hospitalized three days before passing away on Dec. 18.\n\nThe 53-year-old man who continues to receive treatment in the ICU was also diagnosed with underlying chronic illnesses after being hospitalized on Nov. 26. Although he had no travel history and no exposure to animals, he was exposed to a confirmed MERS-CoV case. The two female health workers have not experienced any of the disease\u2019s symptoms. The WHO has not recommended the application of any travel or trade restrictions.\n\nThe WHO advises any traveler who recently visited the Middle East and developed a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to be tested for MERS-CoV. Individuals travelling to the Middle East have been asked to avoid close contact to animals and with people with an acute respiratory infection, wash their hands frequently, and adhere to food safety and hygiene rules. Health programs from Member States have also been \u201creminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mers, cov, infection, saudi, arabia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including an elderly man who passed away earlier this month.", "title": "MERS Infection Kills 73-Year-Old Man In Saudi Arabia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mers-infection-kills-73-year-old-man-saudi-arabia-3-more-remain-infected-according-who-reports", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/mers-cov.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including an elderly man who passed away earlier this month.", "title": "MERS Infection Kills 73-Year-Old Man In Saudi Arabia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mers-infection-kills-73-year-old-man-saudi-arabia-3-more-remain-infected-according-who-reports", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/mers-cov.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/mers-cov.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-27T11:00:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-27T11:32:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including an elderly man who passed away earlier this month."}, "article_summary": "The WHO advises any traveler who recently visited the Middle East and developed a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to be tested for MERS-CoV.\nA 73-year-old man from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has died after becoming one of the Arabic state\u2019s four laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday.\nAccording to the WHO, 170 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported since September 2012, resulting in 72 deaths.\nPeople diagnosed with this chronic respiratory infection have reported minor symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea as well as severe complications, including renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nHealth programs from Member States have also been \u201creminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC).\u201d"}
