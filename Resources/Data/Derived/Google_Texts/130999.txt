“It is with humility that I am back in the county that I originated from,” he said. Byne will also become the first physician in recent memory in the town of about 360 people, and more importantly, will help provide primary care at Medical Associates Plus@Keysville.

It is the third MAP clinic, joining one in south Augusta and one in Wrens, aimed at providing care to the underserved in the area, said J.R. Richards, CEO of MAP.

“It’s very important because of access barriers” to care for residents in the area, particularly with transportation, he said. One thing the clinic is planning to do is hire community liaisons to go out into the community and talk to residents about the services available there and how they can access the care, Richards said.

“They are going to be very key to the success of the facility,” he said.

The clinic is housed in a building that formerly held the Keysville Family Health Center opened by Medical College of Georgia in July 2001 but abandoned years ago, town officials said. The new clinic was funded by a $920,000 grant under the Affordable Care Act to expand primary health care into underserved areas.

Byne, who is a family medicine physician who has also worked in Emergency Medicine, said he expected that will be the bulk of what the clinic provides and will help to “get people into the system.”

Keysville Mayor Linda Wilkes said the new clinic is a “starting point” for the town. There is a general store and a nursing home and “that’s pretty much it,” she said. People seek their health care in Waynesboro, or Wrens or maybe Augusta but many can’t or don’t like to drive.

“This will give everyone the care they need,” she said.

And also might encourage growth, Wilkes told center officials.

“With your coming here, we’re hoping other people will follow,” she said. “We need restaurants.”
