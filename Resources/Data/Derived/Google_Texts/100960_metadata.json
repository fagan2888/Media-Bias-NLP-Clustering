President Lyndon Johnson told the editor of The Commercial Appeal of Memphis, Tenn., during the late and urgent stages of his 1964 election campaign, \u201cThree-quarters of this ball game\u2019s done gone. We\u2019re in the last quarter now, and we gotta pass, and go in through tackle, and under guard, and every other thing.\u201d A little more than two years later, Bart Starr and the Green Bay Packers did all of those things themselves, shellacking the Kansas City Chiefs in the first \u201cSupergame.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 years and multiple football-obsessed presidents after that \u2014 including President Obama, who CBS\u2019 Mark Knoller wrote may be responsible for \u201cthe longest football metaphor ever spoken by a presidential candidate\u201d \u2014 the pigskin references at the federal level continue, and the Kansas City Chiefs are still losing big games. (Sorry, guys.) Just this week, one of Obama\u2019s spin masters likened his vision for the healthcare law\u2019s comeback to that of the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 historic rally against the Chiefs in an NFL playoff game Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere was a game just this weekend where a team (Indianapolis) was down by almost 30 points, and they came back and won in the end,\u201d White House health adviser Phil Schiliro told Fusion about Indy\u2019s 45-44 triumph over Kansas City. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to remember [the Colts] behind. In years to come, they won\u2019t remember the bad website in the beginning. What they\u2019ll remember is more than 2 million Americans have enrolled. They\u2019ll remember that 4 million Americans are on Medicaid. They\u2019ll remember \u2026\u201d\n\nSome words on that muffed comparison in a moment. First, a few on that Colts comeback. They trailed 38-10 in the third quarter, at which point their longshot odds to win were worse than one in a hundred. They required a combination of such excellent play and good fortune to recover that it\u2019s natural the quarterback up to the task was named Luck. Andrew Luck. Despite his overgrown neck shrubbery the parks department forgot to mow, he could go unchallenged introducing himself with that sort of Bondian swagger at a cocktail bar. His preferred venue is the football field. His choice of drink is Gatorade, and his armament is his arm, which is more gifted than most. After going down by the 28-point deficit, he completed 17 of 23 passes for 314 yards and accounted for four total touchdowns, including an instinctual fumble recovery that he turned into the game\u2019s most dramatic scoring play.\n\nPresident Obama has copped to \u201cfumbling\u201d the healthcare law\u2019s rollout. Is there anyone or anything out there capable of scooping up the ball and running it in?\n\nA comeback requires an engineer \u2014 that\u2019s why they call it \u201cengineering a comeback\u201d \u2014 and Obamacare has none. There is no spokesperson capable of buffing its exterior and making it presentable to the American people, and there is no tech official capable of repairing Healthcare.gov so well that it spits out substantially lower prices for insurance once people are able to use it. That, much like Delta learned recently, would be just another glitch.\n\nNor does the law have something in its playbook that would lead it to \u201cvictory,\u201d a preferred outcome of the administration that one could fairly question is either winning a PR battle or actually improving the country\u2019s healthcare system. Though it\u2019s taken us a while to find out what is in it, Americans have familiarized themselves with Obamacare\u2019s machinery. It didn\u2019t necessarily let people keep their plans if they liked them, despite assurances to the contrary. It isn\u2019t a lead-pipe lock that it\u2019ll substantially cut emergency room visits, despite assurances to the contrary. It hasn\u2019t turned loose a multitude of low-cost insurance policies, despite assurance to the contrary \u2014 by way of its name, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNo, the White House doesn\u2019t get to get away with saying the law has fallen into an early hole because of a \u201cbad website.\u201d It\u2019s fallen into an early hole because it\u2019s a bad program, and it doesn\u2019t have the gameplan, personnel or Luck to mount a comeback. Where Obamacare is concerned, that\u2019s where the football comparisons start and the final gun sounds.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Yes, a White House adviser actually made this comparison.", "title": "No, Obamacare cannot recover like the Indianapolis Colts - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/09/football-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/07/no-obamacare-cannot-recover-like-the-indianapolis-colts/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "phil-schiliro-obamacare", "published_time": "2014-01-07T18:20:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T18:39:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1867\"", "article_summary": "What they\u2019ll remember is more than 2 million Americans have enrolled.\nThey\u2019ll remember \u2026\u201dSome words on that muffed comparison in a moment.\nJust this week, one of Obama\u2019s spin masters likened his vision for the healthcare law\u2019s comeback to that of the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 historic rally against the Chiefs in an NFL playoff game Saturday.\nThey\u2019ll remember that 4 million Americans are on Medicaid.\nA comeback requires an engineer \u2014 that\u2019s why they call it \u201cengineering a comeback\u201d \u2014 and Obamacare has none."}
