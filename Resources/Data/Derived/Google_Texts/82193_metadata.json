The state forced her to sell her pharmacy in the 1990s because its contract with the joint state-federal Medicaid program was found to violate a constitutional conflict of interest provision.\n\nThe ruling was later overturned, which allowed other health care professionals to serve in state government while keeping their jobs. But it came too late for Ms. Van de Putte, who says she lost $100,000 on the sale.\n\nOver two decades in public office, she has sponsored more than 60 bills affecting pharmacists. The Texas Pharmacy Association recently applauded her pro-pharmacy legacy, while its political wing endorsed her and gave her a $10,000 contribution. (The Texas Pharmacy Association has been a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate to have one of our own in the Texas Senate,\u201d the group said in its 2013 annual report. \u201cShe has been a driving force for the profession and carried a number of the bills which will benefit all of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Remley called Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s ability to draw on her professional experience when she files pharmacy bills \u201chow Texas\u2019 Legislature is supposed to work \u2014 with legislators using their real-world experience to help put Texas first.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Van de Putte\u2019s ties to the investment banking business have been less visible than the pharmacy work. Her association with Southwestern Capital Markets stretches back to at least 1992, when Robert G. Rodriguez, a distant cousin of hers and founder of the company, put her on an unpaid advisory board.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe goal, Mr. Rodriguez said, was to bring together people with a \u201cbackground in the public financing, or tax dollars involved in financing.\u201d The senator\u2019s campaign said she advised the company about health care finance issues. Several months after being named to the board, Ms. Van de Putte, then a House member, filed a bill aimed at getting more business for firms like Southwestern.\n\nThe bill would have required state agencies to make a good-faith effort to give 20 percent of their bond contracting business to women- and minority-owned companies based in Texas.\n\nWhen she explained her bill before a House committee, she told legislators they would hear testimony from \u201csome folks who will let you know what\u2019s happening in the investment banking business.\u201d\n\nOne of them was Bexar County Commissioner Paul Elizondo, a longtime friend and mentor, who supported giving more business to such firms. The other was Mr. Rodriguez, head of the only company that sent representatives to testify in support of the bill.\n\nMs. Van de Putte did not mention that she served on the advisory board but said her bill would be \u201ca real helping hand to those Texas folks who are doing business in this area.\u201d\n\nMr. Remley said disclosing an unpaid role with Southwestern was unnecessary because it was \u201cnot a board in the traditional sense\u201d and did not make decisions. Ms. Van de Putte, he said, as a member of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and the committee that hears such bills, was the bill\u2019s natural author.\n\nThe bill did not become law, but initiatives aimed at giving more work to women- and minority-owned firms were adopted, and Southwestern had some success breaking into state bond deals, Mr. Rodriguez said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA few years later, at a time when his company was doing state bond work, he hired Ms. Van de Putte as a consultant for $2,000 a month, a role she performed from 2000 to 2002. In 2001, she wrote another bill to give preference to state contractors with headquarters in Texas, but it did not single out companies doing bond business like the 1993 bill did. It did not pass, either.\n\nMr. Remley said her support for local firms stemmed not from a desire to help Southwestern but from her belief that state tax dollars should be spent in Texas.\n\nAs for what she did at Southwestern, Mr. Rodriguez recalled paying the senator to develop contacts and foster \u201cgood will\u201d at local government entities where his company sold its services.\n\n\u201cShe could not, quote, do anything for us, relative to the state where she is a legislator, but you have examples today of state reps that are employed by investment banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can go to look and secure finances with school districts and cities and counties.\u201d\n\nMr. Remley gave a different description of Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s work for the firm. He said she was paid to give Southwestern advice on a possible expansion into debt financing in the health care field. In 2007, when she was planning to go to work for the investment banking firm again, she told The San Antonio Express-News that she would \u201cnever get involved with city, county or school district bonds,\u201d calling that \u201cway too close to the ethical line.\u201d She chose not to go back to work for Southwestern, her campaign said.\n\nMr. Rodriguez said his rather dismal performance in state agency bond deals shows that there was no ethical conflict involving the senator. \u201cShe was out there helping us, but neither she, nor I, nor us, obviously, got any benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here to show we got any benefit out of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140904232801, "twitter": {"description": "Blurred lines between State
