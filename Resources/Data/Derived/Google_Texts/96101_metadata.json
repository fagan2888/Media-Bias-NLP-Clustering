For at least the last six years, I\u2019ve been conducting annual interviews with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, either on audio or video.\n\nThis time, I had a professional video crew with me, thanks to Dr. Patricia Salber of \u201cThe Doctor Weighs In\u201d blog. This is the result, filmed on location at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Chicago before athenahealth\u2019s annual Cloud Party. The party hadn\u2019t started, but beer was flowing, though the gregarious Bush stayed mostly on point, and Mick Jagger made for a nice third wheel.\n\nYou got a taste of the interview in an April 17 story that also incorporated comments Bush made to MedCity Editor Chris Seper, but here, for the first time, is the whole thing.\n\nWe discussed such things as the CommonWell Health Alliance, federal health IT incentives, value-based purchasing, patient engagement and population health services. Enjoy.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch our video interview with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush (and a statue of Mick Jagger), from the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Chicago, filmed during HIMSS15.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Watch our video interview with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush (and a statue of Mick Jagger), from the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Chicago, filmed during HIMSS15.", "title": "Video: Our interview with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2015-04-29-10.18.14.png", "updated_time": "2015-09-17T10:46:29-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/04/video-interview-athenahealth-ceo-jonathan-bush/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2015-04-29-10.18.14.png", "title": "Video: Our interview with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush - MedCity News", "description": "Watch our video interview with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush (and a statue of Mick Jagger), from the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Chicago, filmed during HIMSS15.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@nversel"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Video", "published_time": "2015-04-29T14:12:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T10:46:29-04:00"}, "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Athenahealth, Chicago, events, HIMSS, Illinois, Jonathan Bush, Video, , MedCity News", "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10b3\"", "article_summary": "For at least the last six years, I\u2019ve been conducting annual interviews with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, either on audio or video.\nWe discussed such things as the CommonWell Health Alliance, federal health IT incentives, value-based purchasing, patient engagement and population health services.\nI\u2019m new at MedCity News, but I\u2019ve been covering health IT a long time; HIMSS15 two weeks ago was my 14th HIMSS conference.\nThis is the result, filmed on location at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Chicago before athenahealth\u2019s annual Cloud Party.\nThis time, I had a professional video crew with me, thanks to Dr. Patricia Salber of \u201cThe Doctor Weighs In\u201d blog."}
