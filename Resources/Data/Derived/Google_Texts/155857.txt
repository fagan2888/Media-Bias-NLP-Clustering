President Barack Obama is serving notice that he will continue to bypass the mainstream news media as a fundamental strategy during his remaining tenure in the White House, and he is urging his successor to do the same.

The president told Vox, an alternative media outlet described by Obama as "for the brainiac-nerd types," that the next president will need to circumvent the mainstream media, as he has, in order to speak directly to different segments of the public that the traditional media, such as the broadcast television networks, cable TV and major newspapers, might be overlooking or not serving adequately.

"The Balkanization of the media means that we just don't have a common place where we get common facts and a common world view the way we did 20, 30 years ago," Obama said. He added: "My advice to a future president is increasingly try to bypass the traditional venues that create divisions, and try to find new venues within this new media that are quirkier, less predictable."

Obama has been reaching out to alternative media for many months. He gives interviews on media venues that his predecessors disdained as frivolous or silly, such as late-night comedy shows and daytime TV shows, and he talks one on one with popular personalities on YouTube.

The argument posited by Obama and his public relations strategists is that the country is so fractured Into so many constituencies and sub-groups that a president needs to appear on as many venues as possible in order to appeal to the widest audience. "He needs to go where the voters are," says a White House adviser.
