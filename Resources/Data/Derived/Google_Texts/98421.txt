UC San Diego Health and Tri-City Healthcare District plan to affiliate to create a clinically integrated network of care for North San Diego, the health systems announced Wednesday.

The health systems intend to collaborate to increase the number of insurance plans under which Tri-City Healthcare District is an authorized provider, according to UC San Diego Health.

Tri-City Healthcare District CEO Tim Moran said the affiliation with UC San Diego Health creates a connection to the region's only academic health system and the UC San Diego School of Medicine.

"We considered a number of health care providers in San Diego County before making this decision," said Larry Schallock, chairman, Tri-City Healthcare District.

Tri-City Medical Center and the university will jointly recruit physicians, develop customized clinical programs based on local patient needs, and integrate information technology and care pathways to improve clinical outcomes, practice protocols and patient satisfaction, according to UC San Diego Health.

Tri-City will continue to run the medical center as the network's northern San Diego hub. Patients will have access to UC San Diego Health neurosurgical experts and certain other designated subspecialties of care, as well as continued access to comprehensive psychiatric services.

If needed, patients of Tri-City will also have access to advanced diagnostic, imaging, surgical, oncologic and cardiac services, along with clinical trial interventions that typically are found only in academic health centers.

Collaboration among healthcare providers is key to creating a sustainable healthcare delivery system in Southern California, said Patty Maysent, interim CEO, UC San Diego Health.
