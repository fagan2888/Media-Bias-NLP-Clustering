(Photo: Steve Fecht for Cadillac)\n\nCadillac\u2019s new president said he wants the luxury brand to sell an \u201cambitious\u201d 500,000 vehicles globally by 2020, and confirmed other vehicles are in the works: more crossovers and SUVs, a car larger than the big CT6 sedan coming next year, and a car smaller than the ATS.\n\nJohan de Nysschen, speaking Thursday at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference, gave an overview for reorganizing the brand that includes doubling sales by the end of the decade from about 250,000 globally now. Much of that growth will come from China, where Cadillac will sell about 70,000 vehicles this year and a country in which de Nysschen wants to establish as a second hub of volume for Cadillac behind the U.S. But the plan also includes expansion in the Middle East and later in the decade in Europe. De Nysschen said Cadillac will add diesel offerings and right-hand drive models to help it enter and sell vehicles in markets such as Great Britain, Japan and Australia.\n\nA slide in the Barclays presentation on future Cadillac cars shows 12 offerings in the future, including a small luxury car, a convertible, a compact and mid-luxury car, a large luxury car, two other compact/mid luxury cars, a small luxury SUV, a compact luxury SUV and two midsize luxury SUVs, plus the Escalade.\n\nToday\u2019s lineup includes six: the compact ATS and ELR plug-in hybrid, midsize CTS and XTS, and a midsize SRX SUV and the Escalade.\n\nDe Nysschen said U.S. sales could stay flat for three years under current plans that will keep incentives down and average transaction prices high. Cadillac\u2019s U.S. sales are down 4.6 percent through October to 141,452 vehicles. But sales globally are up about 10 percent, largely from growth in China, General Motors Co. has said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going to prioritize the quality of business over the quantity of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we build a solid foundation from which to grow. And if it means in the short-term we lose market share and we lose volume, then so be it.\u201d\n\nDe Nysschen, who joined GM to run Cadillac late this summer after stints with Infiniti and Audi, is establishing a new Cadillac headquarters in New York City that could open in May.\n\nHe also confirmed plans to boost Cadillac\u2019s operating margin from about 6 percent today to 10 percent by the end of 2020. He said Cadillac will offer an \u201ceven higher image building halo car\u201d than the CT6 and vehicles that are more relevant for younger buyers. He stressed more crossovers and SUVs are coming.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s got to be wrong when a brand as iconic as Cadillac and part of the fabric of American culture has one crossover, one SUV,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Germans have so many, we can\u2019t even keep track.\u201d\n\nChanges to Cadillac\u2019s 900-plus U.S. dealers also are part of his strategy. De Nysschen said Cadillac is working on a plan for \u201cboutique stores\u201d and will implement a business model with dealers that is performance-driven and rewards with bonuses.\n\nHe said \u201creorganizing\u201d the dealer network at Audi cost about $170 million and it would not cost any less to do so with Cadillac. He said that would cost Cadillac about $40 million in 2015 and a marketing campaign for Cadillac next year will cost $100 million.\n\nmburden@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 222-2319\n\nTwitter.com/MBurden_DN\n\nGM shuffles executives\n\nGeneral Motors Co. said Thursday it\u2019s shuffling around a number of quality, purchasing, powertrain and connected vehicle executives.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said Alicia Boler-Davis, currently its senior vice president, global quality and customer experience, will replace Mary Chan as its vice president, global connected customer, once Chan leaves GM early next year to pursue other opportunities. Chan was hired in 2012 and has helped GM with its in-vehicle 4G LTE production.\n\nConsequently, Grace Lieblein, GM\u2019s vice president, global purchasing and supply chain will replace Boler-Davis. Both will report to CEO Mary Barra.\n\nSteve Kiefer, GM\u2019s vice president, global powertrain, will replace Lieblein. Dan Nicholson, executive director of powertrain embedded controls, will replace Kiefer. Both will report to Mark Reuss, GM\u2019s president of North America.\n\nAll of the moves are effective immediately.\n\nMichael Martinez\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1vu2E31", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cadillac brand also plans to add several new vehicles, including small sedan, crossovers.", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Cadillac brand also plans to add several new vehicles, including small sedan, crossovers.", "title": "Cadillac wants 500,000 sales by 2020, to double lineup", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2014/11/20/cadillac-wants-sales-double-lineup/70031558/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cadillac brand also plans to add several new vehicles, including small sedan, crossovers.", "title": "Cadillac wants 500,000 sales by 2020, to double lineup", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/957f744b93911020c8e1b86ffb7063193587c238/c=90-0-556-466&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DetroitNews/2014/11/20/B99219017Z.1_20141120193208_000+GFRD12AD.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Cadillac, Johan de Nysschen, General Motors Co., GM, China, dealers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21eb\"", "article_summary": "The Detroit automaker said Alicia Boler-Davis, currently its senior vice president, global quality and customer experience, will replace Mary Chan as its vice president, global connected customer, once Chan leaves GM early next year to pursue other opportunities.\nConsequently, Grace Lieblein, GM\u2019s vice president, global purchasing and supply chain will replace Boler-Davis.\nSteve Kiefer, GM\u2019s vice president, global powertrain, will replace Lieblein.\nA slide in the Barclays presentation on future Cadillac cars shows 12 offerings in the future, including a small luxury car, a convertible, a compact and mid-luxury car, a large luxury car, two other compact/mid luxury cars, a small luxury SUV, a compact luxury SUV and two midsize luxury SUVs, plus the Escalade.\nHe said that would cost Cadillac about $40 million in 2015 and a marketing campaign for Cadillac next year will cost $100 million."}
