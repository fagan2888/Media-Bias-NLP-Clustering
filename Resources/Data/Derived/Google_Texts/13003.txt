Historically, Nevada goes both ways…politically speaking, of course. But it’s important to note that the Silver State has correctly picked the eventual winner of the presidential election, with only one exception, since 1908. (Nevada sevened out picking Jerry Brown over Carter in 1976.) As Nevada historian Guy Rocha says: “We are the bellwether, no other state has been better.” With Nevada being such an important swing state some constituents with a particular degree of “pull” have decided to try to endorse Hillary as only they (legally) can. Yup, the prostitutes from the “Moonlite Bunny Ranch” (link absolutely NSFW) have officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. According to proprietor Dennis Hof, “Air Force Amy has announced that she’s going to give another half-hour to any donor who donates to Hillary. That’s an extra half-hour of time in the bedroom.”

Apparently the (on the) backing of Hillary comes down to Healthcare Reform and Foreign Policy. Obamacare gives legal prostitutes access to proper healthcare--which they have never had before. Before Obamacare, according to Hof, “they classified them in the same category as illegal prostitutes, who have sexually transmitted diseases. Legal prostitutes don’t. So the girls are thrilled with Obamacare.” As far as foreign policy goes the “Bunnies” feel that Hillary will be able to negotiate with foreign leaders much in the same way they themselves are able to communicate with foreign men in spite of a “language barrier.”
