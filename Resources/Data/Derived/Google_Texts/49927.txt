There is no defined period for reaction to occur. It can be immediate or may occur weeks later.

Katherine Hollinger, an epidemiologist with the FDA Office of Cosmetics and Colors, asked people to report them about reaction from temporary tattoo. Hollinger said they cannot provide information with regard to the number of adverse reactions reported every year.

"If you had a reaction to a temporary tattoo or any cosmetic product, the FDA wants to know", affirmed Hollinger. FDA does not approve anything related to temporary tattoos before they go on to the market. But color additives do have to go through FDA approval.

Hollinger could only reveal about the voluntary reports of problems related to temporary tattoos through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. If voluntary reports are received, the FDA can take an action against harmful products.
