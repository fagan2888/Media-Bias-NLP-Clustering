It will be smaller (just five candidates are participating). There will be no undercard debate. And, of course, there will be no Donald Trump. Below is our guide for what each candidate needs to accomplish in tonight\u2019s first Dem debate, which starts at 9:00 pm ET:\n\nHillary Clinton: The Democratic frontrunner is never going to win a fight over who\u2019s the true progressive in the race (see her TPP flip-flop), so she has two goals: One, demonstrate that she is, by far, the best Democrat on that stage \u2013 for Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as the general election. Two, she needs to exude passion and be the dogged policy wonk. And don\u2019t ignore this image: The stage will consist of her and four white men. Just like we saw with Carly Fiorina in the GOP debates, that kind of contrast can pack a punch. Her biggest worry tonight is not the other candidates; it\u2019s likely the moderators. It will be interesting to see if she tries to use BERNIE as a foil to prove her general election viability \u2013 think his I\u2019m-not-a-capitalist remark.\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders: He simply has to come across as electable. Sure, he\u2019s faring well in many general-election polls right now. But make no mistake: His comment on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday that he\u2019s not a capitalist isn\u2019t a winning general-election message, especially when being a socialist running for president is more unpopular than being a Muslim or an atheist. Another question we have: How does Sanders hold up over two hours of debate? One way to judge tonight\u2019s debate is to gauge who does a better job shoring up his/her weakness \u2013 Clinton\u2019s not-always progressive views vs. Sanders\u2019 electability doubts.\n\n\n\n\n\nis more unpopular Martin O\u2019Malley: The former Maryland governor simply needs to find a moment to finally break through, especially with a new Washington Post poll showing him registering at just 4% in his home state of Maryland (!!!). Here\u2019s something to chew on: Does O\u2019Malley target Clinton, or does he instead go after Sanders (who may very well be O\u2019Malley\u2019s biggest threat in this Democratic field)?\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington Post poll Jim Webb: The former Virginia senator needs a strong performance/moment to simply get his credibility back. You\u2019d be forgiven if you forget that Webb is still running for the presidency, given how few events he\u2019s done compared with the competition. Webb is a serious politician with serious ideas. But this presidential contest \u2013 so far \u2013 hasn\u2019t helped his reputation; it has diminished him. And knowing Webb, it bugs him that he hasn\u2019t been able to get traction on income inequality, an issue he believes he put on the table before any other mainstream Dem (see his 2007 State of the Union response). He may let his irritation show which won\u2019t be a good first impression. By the way, it will be striking when the Iran deal conversation comes up, because Webb is one Democrat who has doubts about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLincoln Chafee: What the former Rhode Island governor and senator needs to accomplish is give a rationale for his candidacy \u2013 other than his opposition to the Iraq war (which was a rationale from eight years ago but not now) and his enthusiastic embrace of the Metric system.\n\nHillary is an experienced \u2013 and aggressive \u2013 debater\n\nDespite Hillary Clinton\u2019s rough last few months as a presidential candidate, don\u2019t forget this fact: She\u2019s a strong, experienced, and aggressive debater. She\u2019s not only the sole Democrat on tonight\u2019s stage who has participated in presidential debates before (some 20-plus during the 2007-2008 cycle), but she more often than not was the best performer in them. Indeed, with one key exception (the Oct. 30, 2007 Philly debate over drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants), Clinton emerged unscathed from all of those Dem debates, and she was a bulldog when going on the offensive \u2013 see the Feb. 26, 2008 NBC/MSNBC debate over NAFTA and health care, the Jan. 21, 2008 CNN debate hitting Obama for praising Ronald Reagan, or the April 16, 2008 ABC debate blasting Obama for his bitter/guns remark.\n\nBut the Clinton campaign is focusing more on next week\u2019s Benghazi committee than tonight\u2019s debate\n\nEven though tonight\u2019s debate is a big moment for Clinton and her campaign, we have it on good authority that her team is making more preparations about next week\u2019s Benghazi committee appearance than tonight\u2019s debate. Indeed, her Oct. 22 testimony could very well be her most important event in this important month of October. And don\u2019t miss Politico\u2019s tick-tock on how the Clinton campaign has handled \u2013 or mishandled \u2013 the email controversy over the past seven months. One under-read part of the story: How both Clintons (Hillary and Bill) seem to missing an uber-strategist to help hold their hands during this campaign.\n\nBefore a non-liberal crowd, Sanders\u2019 remarks fell flat\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s \u201cNo Labels\u201d confab in New Hampshire, our colleague Benjy Sarlin made this observation about Bernie Sanders\u2019 remarks to the moderate/centrist crowd: They fell flat. \u201cSanders, who also frequently speaks to crowds of thousands of frenzied supporters, addressed a less enthused audience during his video address. After a warm greeting, the room was mostly quiet, with a number filing out of their seats, texting on their phones or chatting with neighbors as he rattled off statistics about inequality.\u201d Sure, the addresses via video aren\u2019t going to play as well as those in person, but Sanders\u2019 performance was a reminder that he usually addresses crowds of liberals and progressives. According to our Sept. NBC/WSJ poll, only 31% of Americans identify themselves as being liberal \u2013 which means for Democratic candidates to win national elections, they have to over-perform with moderates, too. Can Sanders do that?\n\nWhy Biden not participating in tonight\u2019s debate is a big deal\n\nAs expected, Vice President Joe Biden won\u2019t be participating at tonight\u2019s Democratic debate. Instead, he\u2019s attending meetings at the White House, per his schedule. We can\u2019t emphasize enough how big of a deal it is for Biden NOT to be on tonight\u2019s debate stage, because it dampens the enthusiasm he needs if he wants to get into the race. Per NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker, Biden was unable to reach a decision about his presidential plans after spending another weekend with his family, according to a source familiar with Biden\u2019s thinking. But as we wrote yesterday, the clock is ticking. And here\u2019s the New York Times: \u201cThe danger for Mr. Biden, as his advisers know all too well, is that intrigue can easily turn into fatigue. After 10 weeks of his being egged on by Democrats disenchanted with Mrs. Clinton and by a news media eager for a race to cover, Mr. Biden increasingly faces demands that he make up his mind.\u201d\n\nWaiting to decide until after the debate or Clinton\u2019s Benghazi testimony looks calculating\n\nBiden waiting until after this debate to announce his presidential intentions \u2013 and maybe even after Clinton\u2019s Benghazi committee testimony \u2013 risks looking calculating. That said, the Biden source tells Welker that Biden is more likely trying to determine whether he and his family are emotionally ready, given the recent loss of his son Beau. Still, he can\u2019t wait forever, because that indecision doesn\u2019t help his party, Hillary Clinton, or even Biden himself, as we wrote yesterday. And Welker\u2019s source adds that Biden knows he has to decide soon.\n\nJeb to focus on repealing and replacing Obamacare\n\nFinally, on the GOP side today, NBC\u2019s Jordan Frasier reports: \u201cJeb Bush will call for repealing President Obama\u2019s healthcare law and lay out a three-point plan for replacing it Tuesday in New Hampshire, the latest in a string of policy proposals from the Republican presidential candidate. Bush\u2019s plan will focus on promoting innovation, lowering costs and deferring power to states, according to documents detailing the proposal. During a campaign call with donors and supporters, campaign officials said the plan reflects input from people throughout the healthcare industry and lays out a system they said is more suitable for the 21st century.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Leigh Ann Caldwell.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Tonight\u2019s Democratic presidential debate from Las Vegas won\u2019t look anything like the first two Republican debates.
