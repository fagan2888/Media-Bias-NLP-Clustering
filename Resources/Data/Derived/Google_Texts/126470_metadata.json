The courts said that it had to be optional through the states and so half of the states have jumped on the bandwagon and half of them have turned them down \u2013 I would like Utah be another one of those that turns that expansion down,\u201d Christensen told the media. \u201cThere are those in both of the bodies that want something done, and not just plain turn down and say \u2018no.\u2019 My plan will provide access to healthcare through traditional Medicaid to the most needy.\u201d\n\nChristensen, who is chair of the Senate Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee, had a strong focus on on the financial costs associated with any sort of health care expansion.\n\n\u201cI am particularly aware of the cost,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI want to provide the care to those who really, really need it and still provide some dollars left over in the budget to take care of those people who can possibly get along without it \u2013 like they have done forever \u2013 they have never been entitled to health care or food stamps or so many other social programs that are out there.\u201d\n\n[That\u2019s what] my colleagues are supporting \u2013 is do nothing at all. They don\u2019t want more people put directly under government control. And health care, paid for by the government is government control. \u2013 Sen. Allen Christensen\n\nThroughout the press conference, Christensen emphasized the cost of the Healthy Utah plan. \u201cI have about $100 million in other social service requests, and Healthy Utah will take every available dollar from everywhere and leave nothing for all of those other people who really, truly need it\u2026Once the bills are decided upon, then the Social Services Committee will have to deal with those appropriations. If we do Healthy Utah or another plan that is that expensive, that will save us a lot of debate on the other items because there won\u2019t be any dollars left over for other requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been called a significant number of names for my cold heartedness,\u201d as he referenced a recent ad campaign against Christensen and Representative Jim Dunnigan (Republican \u2013 Taylorsville) from Alliance for a Better Utah that is attacking the two lawmakers for not moving forward on Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan.\n\nSenate President, Wayne Niederhauser (Republican \u2013 Sandy) was not as gun-ho on Christensen\u2019s plan. \u201cMy objective is to try and find a way that we can cover the gap of those who are not insured,\u201d Niederhauser noted. \u201cRight now there is really only one viable possibility, and that is the Health Utah proposal \u2013 but I am not shutting the door on other options.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Christensen would propose anything at all if cost is such a concern, he responded that \u201cthat\u2019s what many of my colleagues are supporting \u2013 is do nothing at all. They don\u2019t want more people put directly under government control. And health care, paid for by the government is government control.\u201d\n\nSenator Brian Shiozawa (Republican \u2013 Salt Lake City)\n\n\u201cOne thing that I want to emphasize is that \u2013 we talk so much about the costs that come to the state, whether it is under a Healthy Utah plan or a plan that only covers 12 or 20 percent of the medically frail \u2013 but also part of that necessary discussion is how much more or less one particular plan will bring back to the state.\u201d\n\nShiozawa noted that the 12 percent medically frail plan would return $300 to $330 million while while Health Utah would return $3.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThat is a significant benefit to the state of Utah that will go to hospitals, providers, and the general economy and has the general downstream economic benefit as well.\u201d\n\nHe would add that the state should look at the revenues, not just the costs.\n\n\u201cOf the choices, none of these are perfect, but this makes the best choice of the options we have been presented\u2026One advantage of Health Utah is that so much of the groundwork has already been laid with the [federal] government.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the House and Senate are currently deciding if they should hold an unprecedented closed-door meeting of all Republicans in the legislature to discuss the fate of health care.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd066\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday, Senator Allan Christensen (Republican \u2013 North Ogden) defended the so called \u201cFrail Utah\u201d plan he is proposing as a counter to Obamacare.\n\u2013 Sen.
