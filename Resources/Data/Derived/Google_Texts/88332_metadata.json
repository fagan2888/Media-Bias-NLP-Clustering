The new arrangement, the company said, would allow it to slash its debt and increase its broadband investments.\n\nGleckman and other tax analysts said the Windstream decision was the IRS\u2019s first real head scratcher when it came to REITs.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no doubt that an increasingly diverse group of companies has created new real estate trusts since Congress created them in 1960. Fifteen years ago, for instance, the hotel giant Host Marriott converted to a REIT.\n\nBefore Windstream\u2019s move this year, one of the most controversial REIT conversions was Penn National Gaming\u2019s decision to spin off its real estate in casinos into a new company.\n\nUnder that arrangement, Penn National\u2019s casino licenses didn\u2019t go to the new company, raising questions about how much the building housing a casino is worth without the license.\n\nElsewhere, the Corrections Corporation of America has spun off its for-profit prisons as REITs.\n\nIron Mountain, the document management company, has also converted, as have companies that own cellphone towers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building up to Windstream for quite awhile. It\u2019s a logical progression from hotels to prisons, casinos, hospitals,\u201d said Lee Sheppard, a columnist at Tax Analysts who has closely watched the deals. \u201cBut when you get to Windstream, now you\u2019re talking about buried wires in the REIT itself.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for the trusts say it\u2019s unfair to lump REITs in with corporate inversions, and even analysts that question the broader rules say converting to a REIT isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nFor starters, REITs don\u2019t have to pay corporate taxes. But shareholders do pay taxes on the dividends that REITs pay out with sometimes more than the top corporate rate of 35 percent. The companies also must get at least three-quarters of its income from the rent or sale of real property.\n\nOfficials at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) said the rules show that it\u2019s too simplistic to examine the trusts\u2019 impact on corporate tax revenues.\n\n\u201cWith a conversion to a REIT, you end up with a situation where shareholders are paying taxes,\u201d said Dara Bernstein, a senior tax counsel at the advocacy group.\n\nNAREIT officials also said that most trusts weren\u2019t conversions like Windstream or Penn Gaming, but instead formerly privately held companies that decided to go public. They also defended the recent IRS regulations, saying that technological advancements since 1960 have also changed what constitutes real estate.\n\n\u201cThe REIT industry today is not the product of conversions,\u201d said Ron Kuykendall, a spokesman for the group.\n\nGleckman also noted that there hasn\u2019t exactly been a flood of REIT conversions since Windstream. Life Time Fitness, a Minnesota-based gym company, said last month it was exploring such a move.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still obstacles for it to be feasible for everybody, or even a good idea,\u201d said Sheppard. \u201cBut if it works, it works pretty well.\u201d\n\nStill, the current REIT setup also underscores the various avenues that lawyers and tax planners have to lower corporate tax bills, and lawmakers have taken notice.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) proposed making it harder for companies to get the tax benefits from spinning off real estate trusts in his tax reform draft this year, a change that would save the government around $6 billion over a decade.\n\nA GOP aide said that even some advocates for the real estate trusts expressed concerns about the increasing popularity of that maneuver, making it easier for Camp to propose the change.\n\nCamp\u2019s tax reform proposal gained little traction, even among Republicans. But lobbyists are also working furiously to ensure keep the current rules intact whenever the tax reform debate heats up again.\n\nLawyers at Skadden Arps, for instance, called Camp\u2019s draft \u201chighly disruptive\u201d to the practice of using REITs and said it showed that \u201ccertain corners of the REIT universe are perceived as a source of potential revenue to be harvested.\u201d\n\nNow, K Street is mobilizing to ensure that any sort of tax reform doesn\u2019t shift the Treasury\u2019s view on the property investment trusts.\n\nIn the first half of this year, there were 50 quarterly reports filed by companies, trade groups and lobbying firms that listed advocacy work on real estate investment trusts, according to federal lobbying disclosures. Firms filed around 90 reports on REITs in 2012, but the amount of disclosures had typically been much smaller in previous years.\n\nThe forestry industry has long been a beneficiary of the REIT process, and top timber companies such as Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser have K Street teams working on the policies.\n\nNAREIT spent $3.74 million on lobbying last year, an all-time high for the trade group, by far.\n\nThe Corrections Corporation of America began lobbying on REITs this year and data-center operator Equinix, which announced plans to convert to a real estate investment trust by 2015, signed up with Squire Patton Boggs in April. In the past, energy companies and shopping malls have also lobbied on the issue.\n\nCompanies \u201cknow that all things in Washington can turn political,\u201d said one lobbyist working on the issue. \u201cAnd they\u2019d rather have their applications considered in the current environment than an uncertain future environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "U.S. companies are latching on to an obscure real estate provision to avoid taxes.", "description": "U.S. companies are latching on to an obscure real estate provision to avoid taxes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker and Megan R.
