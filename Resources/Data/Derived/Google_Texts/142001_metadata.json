They\u2019d also like their states to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe survey, conducted by marketing research firm Nielsen, assessed attitudes about the health care system, and possible solutions, in five populous states: Texas, California, Florida, New York and Ohio.\n\nThe 5,000 respondents were also asked about their party affiliation and insurance status \u2014 and height and weight. Those measurements were used to estimate the rates of obesity, for questions about interventions.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid to cover more poor adults, but 19 states still have not done so.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes Houston Public Media NPR and Kaiser Health News. It can be republished for free. ( details\n\nIn California, New York and Ohio, politicians took advantage of federal funding in the law to expand Medicaid. The survey showed most residents in those three states approved of that decision.\n\nThe Republican leaders of Texas and Florida refused to expand Medicaid. However, the survey showed two-thirds of people in those two states wanted them to do it anyway.\n\n\u201cBoth Texas and Florida, the residents there are hurting and are turning to the idea of Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Dr. Tim Garson, the director of the Health Policy Institute.\n\nGarson noted that more residents in Texas and Florida complained about the quality of health care and felt it was worse than two years ago. Texas was also the state with the most people \u2014 65 percent \u2014 saying they were paying more out-of-pocket for health care than two years ago and were cutting down on other expenses to do so.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily a political statement, this is simply, \u2018What\u2019s the data?\u2019 And the data are Texas and Florida, the two without Medicaid expansion, are having perceived problems with cost and quality worse than the other three,\u201d Garson said.\n\nThe survey did not ask Texans or Floridians if they thought those problems were because political leaders had not expanded Medicaid.\n\nBut 63 percent of Texans and 68 percent of Floridians did favor expansion.\n\nOver all five states, the cost of health care was a common complaint, with 58 percent of respondents reporting that they paid more out-of-pocket for health care than they did two years ago.\n\n\u201cClearly, we as a country, we as a state \u2014 couldn\u2019t we find ways to decrease the overall cost of health care?\u201d Garson asked.\n\nThe ACA has helped 20 million additional Americans get insurance, but Garson says the law didn\u2019t do much to control the actual prices being charged in the health care industry. Consumers feel the financial pressure in their deductibles, copays and monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cOf the uninsured, 87 percent said when they went to the exchange they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Garson said, referring to the online marketplaces where people can buy individual or family insurance plans if their employers don\u2019t provide coverage.\n\nThe survey did not ask respondents if they liked the idea of a government-funded \u201csingle-payer\u201d system. But many did say universal coverage was important.\n\n\u201cOne of my biggest surprises is that 85 percent of everybody asked was looking for \u2018coverage for all,\u2019\u201d Garson said. \u201cThey are worried about their sisters and brothers. And I think that, at some point, is going to show up in the voting rolls.\u201d\n\nBut Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, is skeptical about the power of health care as a campaign issue. Baker is not connected to the survey but examined it at the request of Houston Public Media.\n\nAlthough candidates will talk about Obamacare and health costs, Baker is not convinced it\u2019s the kind of pivotal issue that will motivate voters to choose one presidential candidate over another.\n\n\u201cGenerally, people are mindful of the health care issues because they are very practical, day-to-day concerns, but whether or not they would get out of bed on Tuesday morning in November, and go to the polls based on their feelings about whether or not Medicaid should be expanded in their state is, I think, subject to challenge,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRather, the expected contest between Clinton and Trump will probably be decided on their personality differences, Ross said.\n\nThe poll also asked about emergency room usage and interventions to combat obesity.\n\nForty-six percent of respondents admitted they had gone to an ER even when they knew it wasn\u2019t an emergency. The primary reason they gave was the doctor\u2019s office was closed, Garson said.\n\nRespondents also answered questions about extra taxes on sugary drinks and fast food, with more than half of people in all five states saying they would favor such taxes. That held true even in the two more conservative states of Texas and Florida.\n\nThe majority of people picked a 25 percent tax as \u201creasonable,\u201d while almost half (44 percent) said the tax could be as high as 50 percent on sugary drinks.\n\nPoliticians should take note that such taxes, often called \u201cfat taxes,\u201d might be acceptable to their constituents as an effective obesity intervention, Garson said.\n\nIt\u2019s worked before, he noted: \u201cWhen you go and look back and ask the World Health Organization about smoking, what was it that really led to the real decrease in smoking? It was the cigarette tax,\u201d Garson said.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between Houston Public Media, NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents of California, New York and Ohio approve of Medicaid expansion in those states, the survey by a Houston-based think tank found.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "Residents of California, New York and Ohio approve of Medicaid expansion in those states, the survey by a Houston-based think tank found.", "title": "Majority Of Texans And Floridians Want Medicaid Expansion, Survey Shows", "url": "http://khn.org/news/majority-of-texans-and-floridians-want-medicaid-expansion-survey-shows/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mwa_tim-garson_770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mwa_tim-garson_770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-05-24T09:00:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-24T15:04:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cClearly, we as a country, we as a state \u2014 couldn\u2019t we find ways to decrease the overall cost of health care?\u201d Garson asked.\nThe survey did not ask Texans or Floridians if they thought those problems were because political leaders had not expanded Medicaid.\nThe Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid to cover more poor adults, but 19 states still have not done so.\nThe survey, conducted by marketing research firm Nielsen, assessed attitudes about the health care system, and possible solutions, in five populous states: Texas, California, Florida, New York and Ohio.\nGarson noted that more residents in Texas and Florida complained about the quality of health care and felt it was worse than two years ago."}
