Narrow Networks Cut Costs, Not Quality, Economists Say

Research on Massachusetts government workers finds no evidence that narrow network enrollment is associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals.

A pair of Massachusetts economists has conducted research that casts narrow healthcare provider networks in a favorable light.

"In our study, the evidence suggested that narrow network plans reduced costs by both reducing the prices paid per visit and reducing the quantity of certain services, notably emergency room visits and specialist visits," Robin McKnight, an associate professor of economics at Wellesley College, said last week.

"Interestingly, enrollment in a narrow network plan led to an increase in primary care visits. So part of the way that the narrow network plans reduced costs was by shifting the site of care towards primary care, and away from more expensive settings. We examined several measures of hospital quality and found no evidence that narrow network enrollment was associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals."

Narrow Provider Networks Set to Spread

McKnight conducted the research with Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an architect of Massachusetts' healthcare reform effort, and a technical advisor to the Obama administration on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

The study was funded in part by the National Institute on Aging and the National Bureau of Economic Research.
