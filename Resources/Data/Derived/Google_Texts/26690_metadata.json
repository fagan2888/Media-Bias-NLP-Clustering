Twitter told OSF that it doesn\u2019t distinguish between users, however, and had decided that lawmakers have as much of a right for tweets to be expunged from the Internet as everyone else.\n\n\u201cImagine how nerve-racking \u2013 terrifying, even \u2013 tweeting would be if it was immutable and irrevocable?\u201d Twitter told OSF, according to the Dutch group. \u201cNo one user is more deserving of that ability than another. Indeed, deleting a tweet is an expression of the user\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\nTwitter had suspended API [application program interface] access for the American Politwoops account in May, thereby disabling OSF\u2019s ability to automatically monitor the profiles of politicians. Other accounts remained active in 30 countries in the interim, however, until Twitter\u2019s decision this weekend to revoke API access for the rest of the Politwoops sites as well as Diplotwoops, a service that monitored the accounts of diplomats and official embassies.\n\n\u201cWhat elected politicians publicly say is a matter of public record. Even when tweets are deleted, it\u2019s part of parliamentary history,\u201d said OSF Director Arjan El Fassed. \u201cThese tweets were once posted and later deleted. What politicians say in public should be available to anyone. This is not about typos but it is a unique insight on how messages from elected politicians can change without notice.\u2019\n\n\u201cTracking and archiving deleted tweets from MPs is absolutely in the public interest and hopefully Twitter will reconsider with that in mind,\u201d added Jules Mattsson, the administrator of the now defunct DeletedbyMPs account, in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cSocial media is playing an increasing role in British politics and this denies us an opportunity to extend proper accountability to social platforms.\u201d\n\nTweets from politicians that had been deleted before May 15 are still available on the Politwoops archives, and OSF said it\u2019s working on new tools to \u201cpromote transparency and hold our government accountable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twitter has killed-off a service that archived the deleted tweets of politicians and diplomats around the globe following the social networking site's decision to axe the American version earlier this year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Twitter has killed-off a service that archived the deleted tweets of politicians and diplomats around the globe following the social networking site\u2019s decision to axe the American version earlier this year.", "title": "Twitter kills service that saved politicians\u2019 embarrassing deleted tweets", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/24/twitter-kills-politicians-embarrassing-deleted-twe/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/285a61259152601a790f6a706700473b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/285a61259152601a790f6a706700473b.jpg", "description": "Twitter has killed-off a service that archived the deleted tweets of politicians and diplomats around the globe following the social networking site's decision to axe the American version earlier this", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Twitter kills service that saved politicians\u2019 embarrassing delet"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Twitter, Open State Foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9beb\"", "article_summary": "Twitter has killed-off a service that archived the deleted tweets of politicians and diplomats around the globe following the social networking site\u2019s decision to axe the American version earlier this year.\n\u201cWhat elected politicians publicly say is a matter of public record.\nEven when tweets are deleted, it\u2019s part of parliamentary history,\u201d said OSF Director Arjan El Fassed.\n\u201cImagine how nerve-racking \u2013 terrifying, even \u2013 tweeting would be if it was immutable and irrevocable?\u201d Twitter told OSF, according to the Dutch group.\nTwitter told OSF that it doesn\u2019t distinguish between users, however, and had decided that lawmakers have as much of a right for tweets to be expunged from the Internet as everyone else."}
