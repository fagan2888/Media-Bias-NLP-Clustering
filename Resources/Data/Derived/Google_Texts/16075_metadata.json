Managing labor costs is among hospitals\u2019 top organizational priorities.\n\nThere are number of factors tied to why it will be important for healthcare organizations to focus on labor costs going forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), said J.P. Fingado, president and chief executive officer of API Healthcare. Those factors include the 32 million newly insured people due to the ACA, a growing aging population, not enough staff members \u2013 particularly when it comes to nurses \u2013 and the large percentage of operating costs currently tied to labor.\n\n\u201cThese factors are flourishing into significant variables that touch every aspect of the healthcare business,\u201d said Fingado. \u201cThe results from the research confirm what we have known for some time. The strategic development and deployment of the workforce is the key to achieving long-term sustainability in a continually evolving marketplace, and implementation of technology provides an immediate positive return on the investment.\u201d\n\nImplementing technology helped Ellis Medicine, a hospital based in Schenectady, N.Y., with its labor management.\n\nFollowing a merger of three hospitals in 2007, executives at Ellis had to find ways to blend their organizational cultures and successfully align their patients, medical staff and employees in order to keep down operational costs, said Sara Zappi, director of human resources for Ellis Medicine.\n\nAfter several years of exploring options to manage labor costs, Ellis implemented staffing software that provided real-time data available to both employees and management. The hospital was able to decrease employee salary expenses by 40 percent through less overtime spending, said Zappi.\n\n\u201cWe were able to decrease our overtime just by repositioning where we put our staff \u2013 just being able to know where we need people and where we don\u2019t with data updated in minutes,\u201d she said.\n\nZappi added that transparency between hospital employees and management can lead to a more productive and happy staff, leading to higher retention rates and therefore, lower labor costs overall.\n\nJacob Krive, manager of project information systems at Chicago-based Advocate Health Care, said with being a large healthcare organization, it was important for executives there to come up with a way to combine workforce management systems into one converged technology in order to get a handle on both staffing and financial issues.\n\nBringing all 11 of Advocate\u2019s hospitals together, as well as additional clinics and outpatient facilities, was a complex two-year project, but the benefits seen were worth the effort, said Krive.\n\n\u201cWe were able to ensure compliance and standards in our business decisions, and we were able to anticipate possible employee overtime and the costs involved with that. We integrated best practices from a scheduling side and we eliminated our paper-based processes. Everything is done through automation,\u201d he said. \u201cOur staff enjoys the system as well. A happy staff equals happy patients in the end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/research-ties-staffing-sustainablity", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-HOS-Labor-J.P.Fingado.JPG", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "With labor costs in 2013 accounting for approximately 60 percent of hospital and health system operating budgets, many healthcare systems and hospitals have begun assessing high-labor cost areas with an eye to curbing those costs.", "title": "Cut labor costs with smarter scheduling"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-HOS-Labor-J.P.Fingado.JPG"}, "description": "With labor costs in 2013 accounting for approximately 60 percent of hospital and health system operating budgets, many healthcare systems and hospitals have begun assessing high-labor cost areas with an eye to curbing those costs.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cut labor costs with smarter scheduling"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "With labor costs in 2013 accounting for approximately 60 percent of hospital and health system operating budgets, many healthcare systems and hospitals have begun assessing high-labor cost areas with an eye to curbing those costs.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dbb\"", "article_summary": "After several years of exploring options to manage labor costs, Ellis implemented staffing software that provided real-time data available to both employees and management.\nManaging labor costs is among hospitals\u2019 top organizational priorities.\nWith labor costs in 2013 accounting for approximately 60 percent of hospital and health system operating budgets, many healthcare systems and hospitals have begun assessing high-labor cost areas with an eye to curbing those costs.\nZappi added that transparency between hospital employees and management can lead to a more productive and happy staff, leading to higher retention rates and therefore, lower labor costs overall.\nThere are number of factors tied to why it will be important for healthcare organizations to focus on labor costs going forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), said J.P.
