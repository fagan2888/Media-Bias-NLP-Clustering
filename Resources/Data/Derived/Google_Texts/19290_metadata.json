The firm\u2019s chief executive, Todd Feinman, confirmed his company\u2019s role in exposing the data breach in an interview Tuesday.\n\nMr. Feinman said he couldn\u2019t say exactly what the IRS employee facing charges \u2014 Carl Sheerer \u2014 \u201cdid or didn\u2019t do,\u201d but said his company wasn\u2019t targeting the IRS when it discovered the data irregularities.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS employee charged with storing records of other IRS workers on home computer\n\n\u201cWe were using our own software for testing purposes and sometimes there are just things on the Internet that are publicly available and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d Mr. Feinman said.\n\n\u201cThe information was indexed by the search engines that were out there and our software caught it,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a very common type of data breach where often times identity thieves, because they know what to look for, are finding the information way before an organization even realizes they accidentally put it out there.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr. Sheerer with a misdemeanor for \u201cknowingly and unlawfully\u201d disclosing the data. The case has meant more unwanted publicity for the agency struggling to contain reports of far larger breaches and failures to back up electronic records, putting it at the center of a political firestorm.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS failed to vet contractors with access to taxpayers\u2019 private information\n\nFederal prosecutors haven\u2019t said Mr. Sheerer, who handled ID badge computer systems in Delaware and parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania for the IRS, was attempting to sell or profit from the data.\n\nBut charging papers say he stored backed up IRS data that he took home from work then stored on a file transfer protocol (FTP) server, which is used to share files across computers operating on the same network.\n\nJust how the information went from Mr. Sheerer\u2019s FTP server and turned up on Google and other search engines remains unclear.\n\nMr. Feinman\u2019s company said it doesn\u2019t typically go looking for breaches, but reports them to authorities when they find them. Earlier this year, the company reported that the IRS had mistakenly disclosed more than 630,000 Social Security numbers when it reviewed millions of IRS filings by nonprofit organizations, which are made public.\n\nWhile IRS officials declined to comment on Mr. Sheerer\u2019s case on Monday, officials almost certainly seemed to be discussing his case earlier this year when the agency disclosed a breach identical to the one described in charging documents against Mr. Sheerer.\n\nAt the time, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that an employee had taken a computer thumb drive with personal information on 20,000 IRS workers to his home, then placed the data on his personal network. Mr. Koskinen did not name the employee at the time and called it an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis incident is a powerful reminder to all of us that we must do everything we can to protect sensitive data \u2014 whether it involves our fellow employees or taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said at the time in a message to employees.\n\nMr. Sheerer\u2019s lawyer this week told The Washington Times that the information was old, Mr. Sheerer forgot he had it and it was \u201cpurely accidental\u201d that it was loaded onto his network and made available online.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent criminal charges against an IRS employee accused of storing personal information about more than 20,000 employees and contractors on his home computer network stemmed from the work of a research firm hacker who stumbled across the agency security flaw and reported it to the government.", "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Recent criminal charges against an IRS employee accused of storing personal information about more than 20,000 employees and contractors on his home computer network stemmed from the work of a research firm hacker who stumbled across the agency security flaw and reported it to the government.", "title": "IRS data lapse first uncovered by private firm", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/19/irs-data-lapse-first-uncovered-by-private-firm/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/irs-investigationjpeg-00bb1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/irs-investigationjpeg-00bb1.jpg", "title": "IRS data lapse first uncovered by private firm", "description": "Recent criminal charges against an IRS employee accused of storing personal information about more than 20,000 employees and contractors on his home computer network stemmed from the work of a researc", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, Law Crime, Carl Sheerer, Internal Revenue Service, Todd Feinman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc99a\"", "article_summary": "The firm\u2019s chief executive, Todd Feinman, confirmed his company\u2019s role in exposing the data breach in an interview Tuesday.\nJust how the information went from Mr. Sheerer\u2019s FTP server and turned up on Google and other search engines remains unclear.\nMr. Feinman said he couldn\u2019t say exactly what the IRS employee facing charges \u2014 Carl Sheerer \u2014 \u201cdid or didn\u2019t do,\u201d but said his company wasn\u2019t targeting the IRS when it discovered the data irregularities.\nBut charging papers say he stored backed up IRS data that he took home from work then stored on a file transfer protocol (FTP) server, which is used to share files across computers operating on the same network.\nAt the time, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that an employee had taken a computer thumb drive with personal information on 20,000 IRS workers to his home, then placed the data on his personal network."}
