That\u2019s how much this band means to them.\u201d\n\nDingfelder will be in Cuba, too, capturing the experience on camera.\n\nShe is following up her Emmy Award-winning documentary \u201cJFK in Tampa: The 50th Anniversary\u201d with one on the history of The Fabulous Rockers.\n\n\u201cFor many from that generation who grew up in Tampa, The Rockers resonate with them as much as JFK,\u201d Dingfelder said. \u201cThe Rockers were an important part of their youth. You didn\u2019t grow up in Tampa in that era and not know The Rockers.\u201d\n\nDingfelder is collecting people\u2019s memories of the band via email, lynn@rockersdoc.com.\n\nThe Havana concert is part of an ongoing cultural exchange program between Tampa and Cuba promoted by Mike Mauricio, Joe Capitano Sr., Manuel Fernandez and Alan Kahana.\n\nThe four operate Ybor City\u2019s Habana Art Travel, which brings U.S. citizens to Cuba to learn about its arts scene while importing and selling art created by Cubans. Their gallery is at 1923 E. 7th Ave.\n\nLast November, Habana Art Travel flew the Cuban band Sol y Son to Tampa to headline a concert at the Ritz Theatre in Ybor City attended by more than 600 people.\n\nThe opening act was The Fabulous Rockers.\n\nIn May, Sol y Son will return the favor for The Fabulous Rockers in Havana.\n\n\u201cSol y Son will help bring the crowd and then The Rockers will wow them,\u201d Mauricio said. \u201cThey realize, as we all do, that they are not getting any younger so wanted to finally play that one big concert in Havana.\u201d\n\nThe Fabulous Rockers were formed in 1957, but only after some members quit and were replaced the next year did a version form that resonated with Tampa \u2014 pianist Pupello, vocalists Donna Lynn Caruso Baccarella and Artie Alvarez, trumpeter Onelio Ochoa, bass guitarist Wes Young, saxophonists Manuel \u201cThe Joker\u201d Gutierrez and Roger Menendez, drummer Anthony Lopez and guitarist Chuck Borris.\n\nA mix of Jefferson and Hillsborough high school students, the band performed weekly Saturday shows at the Letter Carrier\u2019s Hall in front of 1,000 teenagers dancing the night away to popular cover songs such as \u201cI Feel Good,\u201d \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d as well as original tunes, chiefly the slow \u201cWould I Still Be Loving You\u201d that leader Pupello recalls bringing \u201cromance to the dance floor.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe band played at almost every prom in the Tampa area, said Tony Zappone of Tampa, a fan of the band since back then.\n\n\u201cThe schools would coordinate their prom dates just to make sure they all had the chance to use The Rockers,\u201d said Zappone. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to risk two proms in one night and one school not getting them. Students would have been so disappointed if The Rockers weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nTheir local popularity, said saxophonist Manuel Guitierrez, 75, had as much to do with their shtick as with their musical talent.\n\nThey wore loud plaid suits \u2014 unusual in that conservative era \u2014 and mixed comedy skits in their show.\n\n\u201cWe were known for tossing some pies around,\u201d Guitierrez said.\n\nThey were the first local band to ditch the chairs and sheet music stands for a free-flowing show on stage.\n\n\u201cBefore us, bands were statues,\u201d Guitierrez said. \u201cWe liked to move around and have fun. The audience enjoyed that.\u201d\n\nTrip promoters Mauricio and Capitano were among their fans.\n\n\u201cThe shows were full of life,\u201d Mauricio said. \u201cThey were the coolest band in the city, by far. No one came close to them.\u201d\n\nCapitano booked them for his wedding in 1959.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted people to have fun, you got The Rockers,\u201d Capitano said. \u201cThey were it. There was no other band.\u201d\n\nNational acts touring Florida took notice of the band\u2019s talent and hired them to open for them at concerts throughout the state then remain on stage as the backup band.\n\n\u201cThat was because of our versatility,\u201d leader Pupello said. \u201cWe had brass and horns, and that makes a difference. When you only have a guitar and a bass, you are limited to what you can play. We had no limitations.\u201d\n\nRay Stevens and Roy Orbison were the most talented performers they played with, Pupello said.\n\nThey kept Jerry Lee Lewis, known for breaking pianos on stage or lighting them on fire, from damaging their instruments by threatening to break his legs.\n\nThe band\u2019s success culminated in two bookings at the Peppermint Lounge \u2014 once for a few weeks and again for a full month.\n\nThen in 1964, The Fabulous Rockers came to an end.\n\nLife took the members in different directions.\n\nPupello went to medical school and later became chief of cardiac surgery at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Tampa.\n\nVocalist Baccarella turned to a career as a lawyer.\n\nDrummer Lopez was a photojournalist for local newspapers.\n\nThe band scattered throughout Florida but kept in touch and in 1994, agreed to one last show \u2014 a reunion concert.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThen when more than 6,000 of their fans showed up to the Tampa Convention Center, they agreed to make their reunion permanent.\n\nThey added six musicians to the roster \u2014 Basil Rodriguez on trumpet, Al Picallo on sax, Roger Priede on congas, Tony Raiano and Roy Garcia on guitar and Dave Jordan on drums.\n\nA few members get together for performances throughout the year, as \u201cThe Ybor City Rockers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we cannot have everyone there it isn\u2019t right to call ourselves The Fabulous Rockers,\u201d Pupello said. \u201cIt would be false advertisement.\u201d\n\nEvery May the full band performs a concert at either The Coliseum in St. Petersburg or the Indian Cultural Center in Tampa. Thousands attend.\n\nThis May, the full reunion concert will be in Havana.\n\nPupello\u2019s dream to play in Cuba dates back 10 years and was inspired by the film, \u201cBuena Vista Social Club.\u201d\n\nThe Academy Award-nominated documentary follows an ensemble of legendary Cuban musicians, some in their 90s, who perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City. For most of the band members, the concert was their first and only time in the United States because of the decades of tension between the two countries.\n\nAfter watching the film, Pupello was reminded of how politics kept away The Fabulous Rockers, too.\n\nPlanning for the Cuba trip began after the Sol y Son concert they played.\n\n\u201cCuban nationals love that old rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d said Pupello, who visited Havana a month ago for the first time to finalize arrangements for the concert. \u201cI was shocked at how popular songs like \u2018Hotel California\u2019 still are. So we\u2019ll play some covers and some of our originals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally cannot wait to see the look on the faces of the Cubans when they see these 70-year-old fans from Tampa hit the dance floor,\u201d filmmaker Dingfelder said.\n\nAs part of her documentary on the band, Dingfelder recorded a recent concert at Carmine\u2019s in Ybor City.\n\nBefore the band took the stage, she said, many in the audience needed walkers to get in place.\n\n\u201cThen the music started and the walkers were tossed aside and they were jitterbugging like teens,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cThe Rockers take these men and women back to a time when they were young and carefree. Their music is the fountain of youth.\u201d\n\npguzzo@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7606", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 20:15:08 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 In their heyday, The Fabulous Rockers were in such demand that high schools scheduled proms around the Tampa band\u2019s calendar.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 In their heyday, The Fabulous Rockers were in such demand that high schools scheduled proms around the Tampa band\u2019s calendar.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s Fabulous Rockers will finally play in Havana", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/tampas-fabulous-rockers-will-finally-play-in-havana-20150228/", "image": {"width": 713, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150228/ARTICLE/150229197/EP/1/2/EP-150229197.jpg", "height": 526}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T20:15:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 In their heyday, The Fabulous Rockers were in such demand that high schools scheduled proms around the Tampa band\u2019s calendar.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s Fabulous Rockers will finally play in Havana", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150228/ARTICLE/150229197/AR/0/AR-150229197.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-28T20:15:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T20:15:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc21c\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 In their heyday, The Fabulous Rockers were in such demand that high schools scheduled proms around the Tampa band\u2019s calendar.\nIn May, Sol y Son will return the favor for The Fabulous Rockers in Havana.\nShe is following up her Emmy Award-winning documentary \u201cJFK in Tampa: The 50th Anniversary\u201d with one on the history of The Fabulous Rockers.\nThen in 1964, The Fabulous Rockers came to an end.\nThe opening act was The Fabulous Rockers."}
