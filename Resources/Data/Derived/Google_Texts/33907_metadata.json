She wasn\u2019t talking about a conventional insurance plan. She lost hers when she left her full-time position for part-time work at her church in Greenville, S.C. She was worried about the program that she had joined six months earlier: Christian Healthcare Ministries.\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries is not an insurance company. It is a nonprofit \u201chealth care sharing ministry\u201d based in Ohio. The cost of membership is far lower than the rates of traditional insurance policies \u2014 $45 a month for the cheapest plan \u2014 but the ministry makes no guarantees of payment. Members send their monthly \u201cgift\u201d to an escrow account, which disburses payments for eligible medical bills, excluding costs like routine physicals, continuing treatment for pre-existing conditions or procedures that members have voted to exclude, like care for pregnancies outside wedlock.\n\nEach time Bixby visited her hospital for tests or chemotherapy, she explained that she was a self-pay patient and a member of a cost-sharing ministry. The hospital never denied her treatment, but \u201cI was getting a 2-inch stack of bills every month, and threats that they would take me to collections,\u201d she told me.\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries assigned her case to a \u201cmember advocate,\u201d who negotiated discounts on her fees. These counted toward Bixby\u2019s $5,000 deductible, so she paid out of pocket only for office visits. In the end, the ministry persuaded the hospital to lop $220,900 off a bill of $301,540 and reimbursed or paid directly the remaining $80,640.\n\nOrganizations such as Christian Healthcare Ministries claim a modest membership. The four main cost-sharing ministries in the U.S. have about 340,000 members. Regulators in several states have raised concerns that these ministries offer the illusion of insurance while sidestepping the Affordable Care Act\u2019s baseline standards of coverage and skirting requirements that apply to conventional insurance companies, like minimum cash reserves. Nonetheless, membership has been growing, particularly since the act granted them an exemption as one of the only ways to avoid the law\u2019s mandate to buy insurance without paying a fine.\n\nThe debate over consumer protections may disguise a more interesting question: Could this model scale up? These ministries seem to achieve a remarkable level of member satisfaction, even if they sometimes must portion out reimbursements when the bills outstrip monthly contributions.\n\nThe ministries\u2019 appeal lies partly in their low fees, but also in their ideological boundaries. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s for everyone,\u201d said Tony Meggs, CEO of the Florida-based Christian Care Ministry, which runs a health care sharing program called Medi-Share.\n\nChristian cost-sharing ministries have been around for about 30 years. They claim that their true origins lie in the Book of Acts, the biblical account of how the first Christians \u201chad everything in common\u201d and \u201cgave to anyone as he had need.\u201d\n\nThe resemblance to apostolic Christianity is debatable. The real precursors are the mutual aid societies of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In their heyday, organizations like the Odd Fellows and the Loyal Order of Moose pooled fees to provide insurance for huge numbers of working-class Americans.\n\nThese aid societies did more than provide relief from doctors\u2019 bills, lost wages or funeral expenses. They also divided the \u201cdeserving\u201d poor from miscreants who suffered through their own fault. Their bylaws stressed \u201cthrift, leadership skills, self-government, self-control and good moral character,\u201d the historian David Beito has written.\n\nToday, Medi-Share requires members to \u201clive by biblical standards\u201d: no tobacco or illegal drugs and no sex \u201coutside of traditional Christian marriage.\u201d Samaritan Ministries, with headquarters in Illinois, requires a pastor\u2019s approval of medical expenses (and refuses to cover treatment for STDs unless \u201ccontracted innocently\u201d).\n\nMembers say these rules are marks of the kind of community that government programs undermine. \u201cThis is a solution for those of us who see the ACA as a problem,\u201d said Daniel Alders, 28, a Samaritan member who lives in Nacogdoches and has turned to the ministry to pay for the births of his two children. Samaritan members send their monthly share directly to another member with medical expenses.\n\nFor a small, self-selected group of Americans, cost-sharing ministries make our broken health care system bearable. There is much to admire in their nonprofit structure and their tireless advocacy for members. The problem is that too often their proponents take them as proof that it\u2019s \u201cin the DNA of Americans to assist and help one another\u201d and success comes \u201cwhen the marketplace is given the opportunity to produce solutions on its own,\u201d as Dale Bellis, Liberty HealthShare\u2019s executive director, put it.\n\nThe truth is that Americans never enjoyed a golden age when local communities came together to solve social problems. In colonial times, villages \u201cwarned out\u201d the aged, disabled and unmarried pregnant women, deporting their neediest residents to other towns.\n\nCost-sharing ministries nurture one kind of community, but only by opting out of the broader obligations of society. To make the Affordable Care Act stick, and to make it work, means convincing more Americans that they are not just their brother\u2019s keeper.\n\nMolly Worthen is an assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina.
