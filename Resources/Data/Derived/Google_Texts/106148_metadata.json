When Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, five years ago this month, the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month. By that spring, job losses had slowed to a halt, and by that summer, the economy was beginning to grow again.\n\nOver the next three years, as Michael Grunwald explains for TIME, the stimulus would produce a 2 to 3 percent increase in GDP each quarter, prevent 5.3 million people from slipping below the poverty line, improve tens of thousands of miles of infrastructure, and provide tax cuts to 160 million Americans.\n\nThese benefits flowed to every state in the union, including Kentucky, where nearly $6 million in stimulus funds were sent to repair an Army depot in Madison County. Mitch McConnell isn\u2019t just aware of this\u2014he touted the benefits of said spending to his constituents: \u201cThis is going to be a source of significant employment. At the peak, we could have up to 600 people working on this, and we believe the substantial majority of those workers will be Kentuckians,\u201d he bragged to local reporters.\n\nMcConnell may hate the stimulus\u2014he supported a filibuster and voted against the final package\u2014but he\u2019s happy to take credit for the benefits. Indeed, he\u2019s playing the same game with the Affordable Care Act. In Washington, the Senate Minority Leader is a vocal critic of Obamacare, and continues to call for total repeal of the law. In Kentucky, by contrast, he\u2019s bona fide crusader for health care access. To wit, here\u2019s an ad from his campaign:", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402181539, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "In one breath, the Senate Minority Leader condemns the stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, in the next one, he touts his benefits for Kentucky.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Mitch McConnell is the Most Shameless Man Alive", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Mitch McConnell is the Most Shameless Man Alive\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46424646.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-18T15:39:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18T15:39:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "In one breath, the Senate Minority Leader condemns the stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, in the next one, he touts his benefits for Kentucky.", "title": "Mitch McConnell is the Most Shameless Man Alive", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/18/mitch-mcconnell-is-the-most-shameless-man-alive/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1392739386580.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb699\"", "article_summary": "In one breath, the Senate Minority Leader condemns the stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, in the next one, he touts his benefits for Kentucky.\nIndeed, he\u2019s playing the same game with the Affordable Care Act.\nMitch McConnell isn\u2019t just aware of this\u2014he touted the benefits of said spending to his constituents: \u201cThis is going to be a source of significant employment.\nMcConnell may hate the stimulus\u2014he supported a filibuster and voted against the final package\u2014but he\u2019s happy to take credit for the benefits.\nKentucky Senator Mitch McConnell\u2014who faces a primary opponent and a credible Democratic challenger\u2014wants you to know that he hates the stimulus as much as any Tea Party Republican."}
