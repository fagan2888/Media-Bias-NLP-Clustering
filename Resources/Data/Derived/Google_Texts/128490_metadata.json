But that\u2019s only true until it\u2019s not.\n\nWhen properly motivated \u2014 for example, by the prospect of guaranteeing profits for multinational corporations \u2014 Congress can rapidly advance major legislation affecting millions of workers faster than you can say \u201cfast track.\u201d The dirty details in the latest example of this involve symbolic concessions, pretend debate and what appears to be the first compromise on slavery negotiated by an American legislative body since the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.\n\nThis week, the Senate took up trade promotion authority \u2014 or \u201cfast track\u201d \u2014 which would allow any president for the next six years to negotiate and finalize trade agreements and obtain a guaranteed Congressional vote within 90 days, with no filibusters or the possibility for amendment. Fast track authority greases the skids for corporate-friendly trade agreements, transferring Congress\u2019 constitutional authority to manage international commerce over to the executive.\n\nRelated: The Democratic Trade Expert Trying to Take Down TPP\n\nThe fast track bill includes a series of \u201cnegotiating objectives,\u201d in which Congress advises trade negotiators to follow various guidelines. But the negotiating objectives have no force of law. In the case of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed 12-nation trade deal, the negotiations have been going on for five years and are by all accounts basically complete. As Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) said when fast track was introduced, \u201cI can decide as an objective that I would like to complete a marathon, but without something enforceable, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nForty-six senators filed over 200 amendments to fast track, often to get enforceable language into the legislation. But only two amendments actually received a vote: one to increase trade adjustment assistance for workers who lose their jobs from trade agreements (that was rejected), and one to guide trade negotiators to \u201cconsider\u201d religious freedom in partner countries. The religious freedom amendment was approved unanimously, but is completely irrelevant, as the U.S. Trade Representative could merely say, \u201cI considered the religious freedom record of our partners, and found it acceptable.\u201d So nothing of value was debated and voted upon on the floor.\n\nIn fact, on the first full day of Senate debate on fast track, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed to limit debate with a cloture vote. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who has led opposition to fast track, contrasted this with the last fast track vote, in 2002. \u201cThat debate took three weeks, with 50 amendments getting a vote,\u201d he said on a conference call on Wednesday. This debate was jammed into one week to deliberately constrain the time frame and force passage without major changes. \u201cThe American people have a right to an open and informed debate,\u201d Brown said.\n\nRelated: McConnell Says TPA Will Counter Chinese Dominance\n\nOne amendment getting special dispensation modifies a bipartisan provision inserted into fast track in the Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) authored a measure that would strip fast track authority from trade deals with any country listed as \u201cTier 3\u201d on the State Department\u2019s annual report on human trafficking. Malaysia, a TPP partner, is a Tier 3 country, meaning that they \u201cdo not fully comply with the minimum standards\u201d of protecting victims of trafficking, per U.S. law. The State Department report shows that Malaysia is a key transit point and destination for forced labor and sex trafficking, victimizing the vast majority of its 2 million foreign migrant workers.\n\nThe effect of the Menendez provision would be to either deny fast track for TPP or kick Malaysia out of the agreement. The White House, which this same week prepared to sign an anti-trafficking bill that got near-unanimous support in both houses of Congress, responded to this by negotiating a \u201ccompromise,\u201d to accommodate a country that allows the buying and selling of human beings.\n\nMenendez agreed to amend his measure, reducing the penalty to denying Tier 3 countries \u201cmarket access\u201d benefits from trade agreements. Still, even this limitation could be waived if, according to the amendment language, the State Department was to \u201csubmit to the appropriate congressional committees a letter\u201d explaining that a Tier 3 country is \u201ctaking concrete actions\u201d to improve its stance on trafficking.\n\nBoth human rights groups and Menendez have argued that this would force proof of improvement on trafficking. But as surely as the State Department could remove a Tier 3 country from its list, it could work up a list of concrete actions taken by that country. Making this information public \u201chas real meaning,\u201d according to Menendez, but once the State Department sends that letter, the trade benefits are granted to the country, whether the allegedly \u201cconcrete actions\u201d are legitimate or disputed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us relax our standards at all,\u201d Brown said in reaction to the slavery compromise. \u201cMalaysia shouldn\u2019t be in the TPP\u2026 That\u2019s the difference between me and the administration: They want to let countries in and hope they do better. I don\u2019t want to let them in until they do better.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama v. Warren on Fast Track \u2014 Why This Fight Is Getting So Nasty\n\nThe cloture vote on Thursday morning involved more shenanigans. A group of lawmakers vowed to vote against cloture, which requires a 60-vote supermajority, unless they could be guaranteed a vote on reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance large-scale products. The key senators in this bloc \u2014 Washington\u2019s Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both Democrats, and South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, a Republican \u2014 come from states where Boeing, the main beneficiary of the Ex-Im Bank, has a significant presence.\n\nThe fast track vote was tense, held open 45 minutes, with public and at times heated discussion on the Senate floor. Finally, McConnell made Cantwell and her colleagues a deal, guaranteeing an Ex-Im vote in June. That provided the margin of victory, and in all 13 Democrats supported cloture on fast track.\n\nBut McConnell\u2019s guarantee was meaningless. The problem for the Ex-Im Bank is in the House of Representatives, and Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) told Cantwell directly that he cannot make a commitment to hold a vote. Cantwell wanted to vote for the trade deal all along, and her pretend \u201cbargain\u201d makes it look like she got something in exchange, which simply isn\u2019t true.\n\nIn the end, one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in this Congress sailed through the Senate to a final vote with no debate, virtually no amendments and compromises of only a symbolic nature \u2014 or made only to ensure countries with bad records on slavery are given a lighter touch. All because the White House demanded that the Senate pass fast track before they go home for Memorial Day recess.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t guarantee final victory, and in fact could weaken its chances. A post-cloture amendment on currency manipulation could still derail TPP, but the White House helped fashion a competing amendment that would let lawmakers say they addressed currency concerns while keeping binding language out of trade deals.\n\nThe bigger question is a vote in the House when lawmakers return after Memorial Day.\n\nFast track supporters wanted to show broad bipartisan support in the Senate, but the bill only got 62 votes for cloture, two more than necessary. And the machinations by which that margin was secured continued to sour the atmosphere in advance of the House vote. \u201cWe expected this to happen,\u201d said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a fast track opponent. \u201cIn the House, the White House doesn\u2019t have the numbers. That they\u2019re approaching (opponents) now, and hadn\u2019t to this point, shows you where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Conventional wisdom dictates that Congress is a hopelessly gridlocked mess of partisan", "title": "A \u2018Fast Track\u2019 to Nowhere Good: The Dirty Details of the Senate\u2019s Compromise", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/22/Fast-Track-Nowhere-Good-Dirty-Details-Senate-s-Compromise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09072011_Trade_Agreements_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/22/Fast-Track-Nowhere-Good-Dirty-Details-Senate-s-Compromise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09072011_Trade_Agreements_article.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Conventional wisdom dictates that Congress is a hopelessly gridlocked mess of partisan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who has led opposition to fast track, contrasted this with the last fast track vote, in 2002.\nAs Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) said when fast track was introduced, \u201cI can decide as an objective that I would like to complete a marathon, but without something enforceable, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dForty-six senators filed over 200 amendments to fast track, often to get enforceable language into the legislation.\nThe effect of the Menendez provision would be to either deny fast track for TPP or kick Malaysia out of the agreement.\nThe fast track vote was tense, held open 45 minutes, with public and at times heated discussion on the Senate floor.\n\u201cWe expected this to happen,\u201d said Rep.
