Spring

New York startup Jello Labs is launching an app that it says will approximate the way brands and shoppers interact in physical stores.

The idea behind the app, called Spring, named after Spring Street in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, is that each retail brand has its own storefront, presenting its merchandise in the way it wants. Brands charge customers directly, with Spring retaining a small fee.

You won’t see any customer reviews and opinions–the presentation is controlled by the brand itself, the way it is in physical stores.

“We are not a social platform,” said David Tisch, co-founder of Jello Labs. “On every other platform, users follower users.” On Spring, shoppers follow brands.

The app is launching with storefronts from 70 brands, including Carolina Herrera and Nicole Miller, as well as brands started by startups such as Warby Parker. Mr. Tisch said he expects to have 450 brands on the app in January.

Mr. Tisch is a prolific investor who previously ran the New York Techstars accelerator program and has backed hundreds of consumer and other startups via his firm BoxGroup. He said running a startup is very different from investing.

For an investor, it’s all about the broad strategy, but when running a company, all the details matter.

“As an investor you meet the CEO, the founder, and you never see the customer service reps,” Mr. Tisch said. “[Now] I’ll go more to my [portfolio] companies’ offices.”

Jello Labs raised $7.5 million in its Series A round earlier this year from some 40 investors, including Thrive Capital, a New York venture firm that co-led the deal with Mr. Tisch’s BoxGroup.
