Bobby Jindal (R-La.) said on Thursday that GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald TrumpTrump: \u2018I\u2019d love to debate Bernie\u2019 to raise M for charity Trump claims aide was 'misquoted' in article about VP pick Vince Foster's sister: 'Cruel' for Trump to bring up his death MORE\u2019s healthcare plan rejects everything Republicans stand for.\n\n\u201cPutting aside the implications of \u2018TrumpCare\u2019 for our taxes, economic growth and the national debt, the implications for conservatism are deadly,\u201d Jindal wrote in a Fox News op-ed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Republican presidential primary is being dominated by someone who agrees with [President]and [Democratic presidential front-runner]about the defining domestic policy issue of our time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe danger is, if he persuades Americans that government-controlled health care is acceptable, he will have opened the door for a nanny state and made the Republican Party irrelevant,\u201d the 2016 GOP presidential candidate added.\n\nJindal argued on Thursday that Trump\u2019s repeated calls for a single-payer healthcare system like ObamaCare is at odds with the rest of their party\u2019s ideology.\n\n\u201cIt would hand the left a rationale for interference for every aspect of our lives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf government pays for your healthcare, they will claim it should have a say in your lifestyle: whether you smoke or drink, your salt and sugar intake, how you exercise and even whether you own a firearm,\u201d Jindal wrote.\n\nJindal also charged that Trump\u2019s support for a costly, universal healthcare structure is unsurprising given his background.\n\n\u201cThe problem is this: Donald Trump is not a conservative,\u201d he said. \"If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cHe inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us,\u201d the Louisiana governor added.\n\nJindal then blamed his fellow Republicans for letting Trump\u2019s ideas catch on with mainstream audiences.\n\n\u201cNow the establishment is enabling Donald Trump with their silence and making him think his position is acceptable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven conservative senators like Ted Cruz Ted CruzTrump clinches GOP nomination Eleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits MORE are complicit,\u201d Jindal added of his competition for next year\u2019s GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cHe has distinguished himself by praising Trump\u2019s positions and clinging to his events, in the hope of picking up his votes when he eventually fades.\u201d\n\nJindal\u2019s remarks come as his 2016 Oval Office bid struggles for traction with potential voters.\n\nHe currently receives less than 1 percent support across multiple national polls.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Louisiana governor attacks his Republican competition in a Fox News op-ed.", "description": "The Louisiana
