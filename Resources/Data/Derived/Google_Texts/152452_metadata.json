Those machines take more than 40,000 mammograms a year.\n\nThe 3-D machine takes 2-D and 3-D images. It will most likely be placed at Hope Women\u2019s Cancer Center in South Asheville, which is owned by Mission and exclusively serves women with cancer.\n\nPaulus said a team of oncologists, radiologists, hospital administration and other experts has been evaluating the tomosynthesis technology for the past couple of years and decided last week to approve its purchase.\n\nDr. Blair Harkness, an oncologist with Hope Cancer Center, who has been leading the 3-D mammogram committee, said he expects a contract to be signed within a month for the machine, which costs $500,000- $600,000 and is made by Hologic.\n\n\u201cAll the studies have shown tomosynthesis has better cancer diagnosis and fewer false positives \u2014 fewer women are called back for questionable findings,\u201d Harkness said. \u201cThe biggest question when that happens is \u2018do I have cancer?\u2019 If we can reduce the number of women called back for false alarms and find more cancer earlier, the better.\u201d\n\nA study published in June in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 450,000 2-D and 3-D mammograms involving 139 doctors and 13 academic and nonacademic sites around the country. It showed 3-D mammography found many more invasive cancers than traditional mammograms and decreased the recall rate for false positives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping within three months we\u2019d have it here. There are logistical issues \u2014 we have to get approval from the state for getting equipment changed out, and we\u2019ll need to get the technicians and the radiologists trained on the new equipment,\u201d Harkness said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for the community, and we\u2019re happy to have that available to women soon.\u201d\n\nFor the Asheville area, Blue Ridge Radiology in Hickory is the closest North Carolina location offering 3-D mammography.\n\nHad the new technology been available earlier, she could have been spared a biopsy, said Carolyn Williams, of Asheville, who has been getting mammograms for the past 26 years.\n\nWhile those have always been normal, Williams said there were some with suspicious findings, forcing her to get a biopsy three years ago.\n\n\u201cHappily, it wasn\u2019t anything, but that biopsy is no walk in the park,\u201d said Williams, who works on the board of the Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County.\n\n\u201cI feel like this 3-D mammography will be a huge step in battling this complex issue of breast cancer diagnosis,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen in the United States have a 12 percent lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer. There were about 232,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed last year, and 64,600 cases of breast cancer in situ, a noninvasive form. Nearly 40,000 people died from the disease.\n\nSince there is no form of prevention or cure, the best chance for survival is early detection.\n\nA North Carolina law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires mammogram facilities to let patients know by letter if they have dense breast tissue.\n\nHarkness said the 3-D technology is better at detecting cancer in women with dense tissue, which can often mask cancer cells, but it \u201cshows improved diagnosis regardless of density \u2014 whether a woman has dense tissue or normal density, there is better diagnosis and fewer call-backs with tomosynthesis.\u201d\n\nMedicare has yet to set rates for 3-D mammography, so some insurance companies are not paying for it, he said.\n\nCarolinas HealthCare in Charlotte, which offers 3-D mammography at three sites, charges patients an extra $50 for 3-D mammograms. Blue Ridge Radiology in Hickory does not charge patients anything above the digital mammography cost.\n\nHealth insurance is required by the Affordable Care Act to cover a yearly screening mammogram for women 40 and older.\n\nPaulus said the cost was a real issue when considering the purchase and whether to pass the cost on to the patients.\n\n\u201cMedicare doesn\u2019t pay for technology, and it costs a lot more than a traditional machine \u2014 about double,\u201d Paulus said.\n\n\u201cIt probably takes the radiologist twice the amount of time to read the film. Essentially, it induces a significant cost onto the health system that nobody compensates us for. We are facing half a billion dollars of payment cuts over the next 10 years. How do you buy things that are understandably needed?\u201d\n\nHe said the hospital will evaluate the benefits of the 3-D machine and then decide if it would benefit the community to add more machines.\n\n\u201cI can see a day when we have nothing but 3-D units. But we might learn maybe it\u2019s not the best technology,\u201d Paulus said. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful and excited about what we\u2019ll learn.\u201d\n\nJulie Young, a two-year breast cancer survivor who lives in Arden, said she is anxious to see the 3-D machine in Asheville. Her dense breast tissue masked the cancer for more than 20 years of traditional mammograms. She was diagnosed only after feeling a lump herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m awaiting delivery of the machine to celebrate and to cancel my travel plans to Hickory (for a mammogram).\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1mTciXB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mission CEO says the hospital system will purchase new 3-D mammogram machine this year.", "og": {"site_name": "Citizen Times", "description": "Mission CEO says the hospital system will purchase new 3-D mammogram machine this year.", "title": "Mission to buy new breast cancer screening machine", "url": "http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2014/07/17/mission-buy-new-breast-cancer-screening-machine/12813121/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/citizen-times.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mission CEO says the hospital system will purchase new 3-D mammogram machine this year.", "title": "Mission to buy new breast cancer screening machine", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb21f3ff57127669762319d8a8e7a3ef970aacd1/c=333-0-1667-1334&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Asheville/2014/07/17/ronpaulus.jpg", "creator": "@asheville", "site": "@asheville", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=787264923", "fb": {"app_id": 117201858348253}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "There were about 232,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed last year, and 64,600 cases of breast cancer in situ, a noninvasive form.\nDr. Ron Paulus (Photo: John Fletcher, Jfletcher@citizen-times.com)After two years of weighing benefits versus costs of new breast cancer screening technology, Mission Health has decided to buy a tomosynthesis, or 3-D mammography, machine for the Asheville community.\n\u201cI feel like this 3-D mammography will be a huge step in battling this complex issue of breast cancer diagnosis,\u201d she said.\nCarolinas HealthCare in Charlotte, which offers 3-D mammography at three sites, charges patients an extra $50 for 3-D mammograms.\nThe 3-D machine takes 2-D and 3-D images."}
