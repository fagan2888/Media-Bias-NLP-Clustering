This week the Third Circuit Court of Appeals decided in Federal Trade Commission v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. that the FTC has authority to regulate the way companies safeguard personal information not simply for \u201cdeceptive\u201d acts, but as an \u201cunfair\u201d business practice. This decision highlights the need for companies to familiarize themselves with the FTC\u2019s guidance on cybersecurity measures.\n\nIn Wyndham, the FTC sued the international hotel chain after Wyndham\u2019s computer network was hacked on three different occasions in 2008 and 2009. Wyndham\u2019s customer privacy policy stated that, among other things, Wyndham safeguarded its customers\u2019 personal information \u201cby using industry standards\u201d and being \u201cconsistent with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d Nevertheless, the personal information for hundreds of thousands of customers was stolen, including payment card information allegedly exported to a domain registered in Russia and used to incur over $10 million in fraudulent charges. The FTC filed suit in U.S. District Court claiming that Wyndham engaged in \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d practices in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a). Wyndham filed a motion to dismiss both the unfair and deceptive practice claims. The motion was denied, but the trial court certified its decision on the unfair practices claim for interlocutory appeal.\n\nUnder Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), the FTC has authority to act against companies that have engaged in \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d The Act codifies an unfair act as one that, \u201ccauses or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(n).\n\nOn appeal, Wyndham made several arguments, including: (1) an \u201cunfair\u201d practice required a finding that such practice was inequitable or characterized by injustice, partiality, or deception; (2) the FTC\u2019s authority in the cybersecurity context was limited by \u201cless-extensive\u201d legislation such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act; (3) as a victim of its computer network being hacked, its practices could not be deemed \u201cunfair\u201d; and (4) that Wyndham did not have fair notice of the specific cybersecurity standards that the FTC expected it to follow.\n\nIn affirming the trial court\u2019s decision that the FTC has authority to regulate companies\u2019 cybersecurity practices, the Third Circuit rejected Wyndham\u2019s arguments and held: that (1) the \u201cunfair\u201d prong of 45(a) does not require any deceptive acts or inequitable conduct; (2) cybersecurity practices could fall into the category of \u201cunfair acts,\u201d (3) there was no supporting authority for the notion that just because Wyndham was also a victim of cyber-attacks Wyndham could not be liable to the FTC, and (4) since it was foreseeable that Wyndham\u2019s customers could be harmed by its failure to implement reasonable and appropriate cybersecurity practices, Wyndham was on notice that the FTC could bring an enforcement action.\n\nGiven the FTC\u2019s authority to regulate cybersecurity practices, companies should strive to understand the FTC\u2019s expectations as a regulator. The FTC\u2019s website publishes complaints, settlements, and guidelines that are helpful. In particular, last month the FTC published \u201cStart With Security, a Guide for Business,\u201d2 which distills facts from more than 50 enforcement actions into ten lessons \u201cthat touch on vulnerabilities that could affect your company, along with practical guidance on how to reduce the risks they pose.\u201d Included in these guidelines are practices the FTC asserts are not reasonable and appropriate, with specific reference to the companies the FTC took action against for such practices.\n\nNotably, it was Wyndham\u2019s alleged failure to implement reasonable and appropriate standards that contributed to the FTC\u2019s decision to file suit. The FTC alleges Wyndham didn't use a firewall, didn't change default passwords, didn't encrypt credit card information, didn't monitor its network for its customers\u2019 personal information, and did not limit third-party access to the company\u2019s networks and computers. Although not raised on appeal, the FTC asserted a deceptive practices claim against Wyndham in the trial court proceeding based on Wyndham\u2019s failure to comply with its own privacy policy. As a result of the Third Circuit\u2019s decision the trial court will move forward to consider the merits of all of the FTC\u2019s claims against Wyndham.\n\nOne consumer advocacy group estimates that cyber-attacks caused more than $500 million in damages in 2014 alone. While federal legislation is still being developed, and a patchwork of legislation relating to data breaches still evolves,3 companies should be mindful of the FTC\u2019s authority to regulate cybersecurity practices, implement reasonable and appropriate industry standards, and familiarize themselves with the FTC\u2019s guidelines.\n\n1 here\n\n2here\n\n3here", "article_metadata": {"description": "Court decided FTC has authority to regulate way companies safeguard personal information not simply for deceptive acts, but as unfair business practice", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "In addition to multi-party or class action lawsuits,1 companies that have their computer networks hacked may also be subject to investigations and enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission (", "title": "Third Circuit Finds that the FTC Has Authority to Sue Companies for Inadequate Cybersecurity Practices as an &quot;Unfair&quot; Practice", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/third-circuit-finds-ftc-has-authority-to-sue-companies-inadequate-cybersecurity", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/courthouseSmall_2.jpg?itok=baubgOvj", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "FTC v.
