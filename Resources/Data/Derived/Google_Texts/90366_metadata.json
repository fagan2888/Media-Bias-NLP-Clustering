It's long past time to rein in the price gouging, and recognize that a healthcare system based on profiteering puts all of us at risk,\" said Jean Ross, co-president of NNU.\n\nThe statement noted that prices were not only high in the hospital sector. Similar ratios are found among medical suppliers, medical labs, insurance companies and outpatient clinics.\n\nAlthough hospitals have claimed that the charges are rarely so high in practice, \"it's a defense that defies logic,\" Ross said in the statement. \"The higher the starting point on a charge, the higher the ultimate reimbursement.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCommunity Health Systems to buy HMA for $3.6B\n\nHospitals' fixed costs drive up healthcare expenditures\n\nPoll: Cost most pressing U.S. health problem\n\nMore patients rely on price transparency for care decisions", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital charges continue to rise, with some procedures billed at more than 10 times their cost, according to a statement from National Nurses United.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "Hospital charges continue to rise, with some procedures billed at more than 10 times their cost, according to a statement from National Nurses United.", "title": "Hospital charge-to-cost ratio on the rise, says nursing group", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/hospital-charge-cost-ratio-rise-says-nursing-group/2014-01-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Community Health Systems (CHS),Health Management Associates (HMA),Hospital Charges,Medicare Cost-to-Charge Ratio (CCR),National Nurses United,Operations & Business Management,Revenue Cycle Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Revenue Cycle Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcfd\"", "article_summary": "Hospital charges continue to rise, with some procedures billed at more than 10 times their cost, according to a statement from National Nurses United (NNU).\nSimilar ratios are found among medical suppliers, medical labs, insurance companies and outpatient clinics.\nThe statement noted that prices were not only high in the hospital sector.\nThe data are based on Medicare Cost Reports covering the fiscal year ending in September of 2012.\n\"Such inflated practices continue to price far too many Americans out of access to needed medical care or expose them to financial ruin."}
