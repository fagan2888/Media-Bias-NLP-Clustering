The old eugenics wanted to improve the human herd through the crude manipulation of who could and should be parents. And, it also promoted the idea of infanticide\u2013to rid the society of those who would drag it down. Margaret Sanger infamously referred to these as \u201cthe human weeds.\u201d\n\nThe new eugenics doesn\u2019t use such a crude lexicon, but still has the old goal of improving the human herd\u2013as well as a new one of satisfying the personal desires of parents\u2013through the more sophisticated weapons of genetic manipulation, eugenic abortion, and someday, infanticide. Of course, Peter Singer is very there.\n\nHe is asked with infanticide and abortion, babies are becoming a \u201ccommodity.\u201d From an interview of him in Salon (my emphasis throughout):\n\nQ: If you make the criteria so flexible, if you make matters of life and death negotiable, don\u2019t you think babies will become a commodity? S: That may be happening anyway, in terms of selecting the children we have before birth.\n\nYes, with IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, parents can\u2013to a limited degree\u2013choose the attributes they want in a child, mostly to eliminate a genetic disease or choosing sex.\n\nTomorrow it will be about other desired personal characteristics. So, Singer is saying, we are already in for an inch on the path to commodifying babies, so let\u2019s go for the mile\u2013no doubt covered by Obamacare. That\u2019s how all standards collapse.\n\nQ: You don\u2019t think this is a problem? S: It would be a problem if you have a society divided along genetic lines, where the rich can buy the genes they want and the poor can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the society that would be best in promoting the happiness of most of its members. But I\u2019m not convinced it would be a problem if these services were available to everyone. It\u2019s an open question that is worth thinking about. Q: From your utilitarian philosophy you couldn\u2019t argue against it. S: Some people might want to select according to characteristics that are in the interests of themselves and their children, but are not in the interests of society as a whole.\n\nPay close attention here. Just as the old eugenics ended up with state coercion, so would Singer\u2019s. And, since he clearly favors the right to kill a baby because he or she is disabled, he is saying that allowing such murders would be in the best interests of society.\n\nIn Singer\u2019s moral view, the grounds for choosing a child out of existence can become very superficial:\n\nQ: What if parents don\u2019t want an ugly child? S: If everyone had the opportunity to avoid having an ugly child, I don\u2019t think I would have a problem. Q: Is ugliness a good enough reason to kill a baby? S: I don\u2019t think there are parents who would be prepared to go through another pregnancy just because they thought their child was not going to be all that beautiful. Q: Parents would never refuse to take responsibility for their baby for frivolous reasons? CLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE! S: Most parents are not going to do that. Most parents who go through pregnancy, and childbirth, are going to love and cherish that child.\n\nNotice, he refuses to say it would be wrong to abort or kill a baby because he or she would be \u201cugly.\u201d So long Abraham Lincoln and Mother Theresa!\n\nAnd Singer\u2019s blithe assurances ring hollow. I recall a poll some years ago in which about 11% of people said they would abort if they knew their child would be obese. Good grief, viable babies are aborted because of cleft palate!\n\nSinger says he is about pursuing and promoting the \u201cethical life.\u201d Read the whole interview. The crassly \u201camoral life\u201d would be more accurate.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
