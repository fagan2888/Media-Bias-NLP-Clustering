Though it\u2019s publicly traded, 80% of Viacom\u2019s voting shares are owned by Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone through his privately held National Amusements Inc.\n\nMr. Redstone is widely reported to have health issues. Viacom has said little on the subject, even as, according to The Wall Street Journal, shareholders are asking questions about who\u2019ll control the company after the 92-year-old\u2019s death.\n\nThis news might have sent you scurrying to look through the thousands of pages of disclosure documents Viacom has filed with the Securities Exchange Commission to see what would happen to control of Mr. Redstone\u2019s shares\u2014and, by extension, Viacom\u2014if he should become incapacitated or die. That\u2019s what I did.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t find such information. And that\u2019s likely because of a gaping loophole in the SEC rules.\n\nShouldn\u2019t Viacom and Mr. Redstone describe in their SEC filings details of these arrangements? After all, the SEC has strict rules requiring the disclosure of any \u201ccontracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise)\u201d with respect to a public company\u2019s shares for anyone who has acquired more than 5% of any class of them. And copies of the agreements and other documents relating to such arrangements need to be publicly filed, as well. When there is any material change in the facts, the filing must be amended promptly.\n\nBut they haven\u2019t violated any rules because of an incredibly arcane exception. The rule requiring descriptions of arrangements and relationships relating to major holders\u2019 shares doesn\u2019t apply to those investors who owned their stake when the company went public and have not acquired additional shares since. These grandfathered stockholders fill out a much simpler form that basically indicates their names and the number of shares they own.\n\nSo when Carl Icahn or William Ackman or any other activist investor crosses the 5% threshold, any arrangements they have with respect to the shares must be quickly disclosed, even if they aren\u2019t close to a controlling stake. But arrangements of Mr. Redstone and National Amusements for transition to a new way in which Viacom will be controlled need not see the light of day, at least in SEC filings.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, and it needs to be fixed. In fairness to the SEC, the root of the problem is in the legislation Congress initially passed in 1968. In that law, the trigger for disclosure is based on acquisition of shares rather than ownership. But even without new legislation, the SEC has many avenues to require such disclosure. The agency writes the rules specifying the content of annual reports and proxy statements, and it could easily require disclosure of arrangements affecting control of shares in any of these documents. It would seem particularly relevant in the annual proxy when the controlling holder is a candidate for election to the board.\n\nAlthough Mr. Redstone and Viacom may occasionally make general references to the succession plan in statements to the media, without such SEC-type disclosure, Viacom holders have relatively little access to solid, up-to-date information. Shareholders remain largely in the dark about what\u2019s in store if there\u2019s a management squabble once Mr. Redstone no longer pulls the strings.\n\nViacom shareholders knew when they bought stock that they would not have a say in management of the company; they knew Mr. Redstone controlled of 80% of the voting shares. But it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to consider that a tacit agreement to remain in the dark as to what the plan is once Mr. Redstone is no longer in a position to assert that control.\n\nSend questions, comments or story ideas to Dealpolitik@gmail.com and follow Ron on Twitter: @Dealpolitik.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A gaping loophole in the SEC rules is likely why we don't know more about Viacom Inc. succession planning.", "title": "Dealpolitik: Viacom\u2019s Redstone Jumps Through Big Disclosure Loophole", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/13/dealpolitik-viacoms-redstone-jumps-through-big-disclosure-loophole/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP652_1003vi_P_20151005085616.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Dealpolitik: Viacom\u2019s Redstone Jumps Through Big Disclosure Loophole", "description": "A gaping loophole in the SEC rules is likely why we don't know more about Viacom Inc. succession planning.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ronald Barusch", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "A gaping loophole in the SEC rules is likely why we don't know more about Viacom Inc. succession planning.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-10-13T20:28:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/13/dealpolitik-viacoms-redstone-jumps-through-big-disclosure-loophole/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-42469", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A gaping loophole in the SEC rules is likely why we don't know more about Viacom Inc. succession planning.", "title": "Dealpolitik: Viacom\u2019s Redstone Jumps Through Big Disclosure Loophole", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/13/dealpolitik-viacoms-redstone-jumps-through-big-disclosure-loophole/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP652_1003vi_P_20151005085616.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-42469", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-14T13:05:11-04:00"}, "article_summary": "And that\u2019s likely because of a gaping loophole in the SEC rules.\nShareholders remain largely in the dark about what\u2019s in store if there\u2019s a management squabble once Mr. Redstone no longer pulls the strings.\nShouldn\u2019t Viacom and Mr. Redstone describe in their SEC filings details of these arrangements?\nAlthough Mr. Redstone and Viacom may occasionally make general references to the succession plan in statements to the media, without such SEC-type disclosure, Viacom holders have relatively little access to solid, up-to-date information.\nViacom shareholders knew when they bought stock that they would not have a say in management of the company; they knew Mr. Redstone controlled of 80% of the voting shares."}
