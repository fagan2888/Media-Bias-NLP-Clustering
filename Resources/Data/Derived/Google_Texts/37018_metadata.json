(Reuters) - The most detailed look at Pluto's surface to date has revealed an unexpected range of mountains, glacial flows, smooth plains and other landscapes, according to studies released on Thursday.\n\nThe unprecedented window into the so-called dwarf planet, which orbits the sun like other planets but is smaller, comes via high-resolution photographs from NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft. The interplanetary space probe made the first-ever visit to Pluto and its five moons last July.\n\nThose images, chemical analyses and other data show a complex, geologically active world 3 billion miles from Earth, with an underground ocean and volcanoes that appear to spew ice, five research papers published in this week\u2019s Science journal said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty wild place geologically,\u201d said planetary scientist William McKinnon of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nAnother scientist described the diversity of landscapes as \"astonishing.\"\n\nHow the varied terrain came to be remains a mystery for the distant Pluto, which has an average surface temperature of minus 380 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 229 degrees Celsius).\n\nScientists suspect several processes at work, including vaporization of volatile ices, such as nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, into Pluto\u2019s cold and unexpectedly compact atmosphere.\n\nThough smaller than Earth's moon, Pluto likely still has enough internal heat from its formation some 4.5 billion years ago to help maintain its most prominent feature, a smooth, 620-mile (1,000-km) wide, heart-shaped basin known as Sputnik Planum.\n\nRelatively young mountains west of Sputnik Planum and mounds to the south are harder to explain. Scientists suspect both rest on blocks of water ice, though how that came to exist on Pluto is unknown.\n\n\u201cWe are puzzled by almost everything,\u201d said Alan Stern, the New Horizons mission's lead scientist.\n\nThe studies show that Pluto\u2019s primary moon, Charon, had an active life but ran out of naturally occurring radioactive heat in its rocks and froze through about 2 billion years ago.\n\nScientists now believe Charon and Pluto\u2019s four other small moons owe their existence to a crash between Pluto and another Pluto-sized body early in the solar system\u2019s history.\n\nSimilar to Earth\u2019s moon, scientists suspect Pluto\u2019s natural satellites were formed from the debris that was hurled into space after the crash.\n\n(Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.", "title": "Frigid Pluto is home to more diverse terrain than expected", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/17/Frigid-Pluto-home-more-diverse-terrain-expected", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/space-pluto_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/17/Frigid-Pluto-home-more-diverse-terrain-expected", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/space-pluto_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Similar to Earth\u2019s moon, scientists suspect Pluto\u2019s natural satellites were formed from the debris that was hurled into space after the crash.\nThe interplanetary space probe made the first-ever visit to Pluto and its five moons last July.\nScientists suspect both rest on blocks of water ice, though how that came to exist on Pluto is unknown.\nHow the varied terrain came to be remains a mystery for the distant Pluto, which has an average surface temperature of minus 380 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 229 degrees Celsius).\nScientists now believe Charon and Pluto\u2019s four other small moons owe their existence to a crash between Pluto and another Pluto-sized body early in the solar system\u2019s history."}
