Public Knowledge has testified in opposition to the bill in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and has repeatedly noted that the bill goes far beyond simply banning rate regulation, threatening the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules and jeopardizing the agency\u2019s consumer protection capabilities.\n\nThe following statement can be attributed to Chris Lewis, Vice President of Government Affairs at Public Knowledge:\n\n\u201cThe partisan rush to pass this bill, and the public support of the broadband industry, shows that the intent of H.R. 2666 goes far beyond simply preventing rate regulation. Statements by House members made it clear that proponents view this as a way to dial back on the FCC\u2019s popular Open Internet Order. Even in the face of a veto threat, this partisan bill has been pushed forward. Senator Ted Cruz has mischaracterized net neutrality rules as \u201cObamaCare for the internet\u201d. Now GOP members seem set on giving net neutrality the ObamaCare treatment with repeated votes to undermine it, with no chance of agreement from the President.\n\n\u201cThis bill redefines \u2018rate regulation\u2019 to mean any action that involves a rate, not simply the setting of a rate as is understood today by the general public and even the Supreme Court. This bill goes beyond the forbearances of the Wheeler-led FCC to eliminate the ability for the FCC to even review the reasonableness of a rate. It is an invitation to monopoly level rates by ISPs, since few Americans have more than one or two choices for high speed broadband.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition in H.R. 2666 targets the power of the FCC to maintain an open internet as well as enforcing basic consumer protections. The bill will also prevent the FCC from reviewing merger agreements to provide low-cost broadband to low-income Americans. It will even prevent the FCC from investigating discriminatory data caps or making decisions around pay-for-privacy schemes in its privacy rules.\n\n\u201cThis bill is not necessary, and beyond that it\u2019s dangerous for consumers. It gives Cable and big ISPs the power to change the internet as we know it, setting themselves up as gatekeepers. The Senate should reject it, as the President has.\u201d\n\nFor more information on this bill, please read our recent blog post, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: \u2018Rate Regulation\u2019 as an Excuse to Gut FCC Consumer Protection Authority\u201d and article, \u201cThe One Line Difference Between Broadband Rate Setting and Price Gouging.\u201d You can also view our letter, signed by 50 public interest groups, opposing the bill.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "fcc, net neutrality, open internet, chris lewis, hr 2666, rate regulation bill", "og": {"site_name": "Public Knowledge", "description": "Today, the House of Representative approved H.R. 2666, the \u201cNo Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act\u201d by a vote of 241-173.
