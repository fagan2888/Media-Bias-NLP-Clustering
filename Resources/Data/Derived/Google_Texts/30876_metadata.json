[Tony Lehmer]\n\nA play tower designed by acclaimed Oklahoma architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.\n\nThe tower, which is reminiscent of the space-age era in which it was designed, is constructed of steel mesh with a spiraling staircase and a mesh sphere that reaches 50 feet above the ground\n\nLast year was the 50th anniversary of the tower. In 1963, Goff was commissioned to design the tower to be the centerpiece of Bartlesville's Sooner Park. The tower was in the center of a circular concrete barrier 50 feet in diameter that was used as a sand play pit area.\n\nThe tower was closed in the early 1990s due to deterioration. Last year, city officials and ConocoPhillips began a fund raising campaign to restore the tower to all its glory. It was taken down and the process to restore it began.\n\nTuesday, workers re-installed the restored tower which is one of Bruce Goff's few public works of sculpture.\n\nThe city of Bartlesville has not said when the tower will be reopened to the public.\n\nBruce Goff also designed the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in downtown Tulsa.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A play tower designed by acclaimed architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.", "author": "Russell Hulstine", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/26725784/restored-landmark-tower-returns-to-bartlesville-park", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5046499_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A play tower designed by acclaimed architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.", "title": "Restored Landmark Tower Returns To Bartlesville Park"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5046499_G.jpg", "description": "A play tower designed by acclaimed architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.", "card": "summary", "title": "Restored Landmark Tower Returns To Bartlesville Park"}, "wnreadableurl": "restored-landmark-tower-returns-to-bartlesville-park", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/10/07", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "owner": "KOTV", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0411\"", "article_summary": "[Tony Lehmer]A play tower designed by acclaimed Oklahoma architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.\nTuesday, workers re-installed the restored tower which is one of Bruce Goff's few public works of sculpture.\nTuesday, workers raised the restored tower which stands as one of Bruce Goff's few public works of sculpture.\nBruce Goff also designed the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in downtown Tulsa.\nLast year, city officials and ConocoPhillips began a fund raising campaign to restore the tower to all its glory."}
