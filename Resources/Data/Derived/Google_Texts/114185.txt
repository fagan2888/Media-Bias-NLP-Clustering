Barrasso visited primarily with members of the A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 300th Field Artillery, who are conducting artillery missions in Afghanistan.

“It’s always an honor to share Thanksgiving dinner with Wyoming troops serving overseas,” said Barrasso. “It’s hard to find anyone braver than our men and women in uniform. Everyone in Wyoming can be proud of the outstanding job they’re doing. They asked me to relay to their families and communities at home that they are doing well and look forward to getting back home to Wyoming.”

Barrasso ate Thanksgiving dinner with the service members, toured the medical facilities, and observed the Cowboy Cannoneers conduct artillery drills.
