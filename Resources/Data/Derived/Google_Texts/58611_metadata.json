And Sweden. And probably others.\n\nIt is being called \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d by Michael Donnelly, the director of global outreach for the Home School Legal Defense Association, which has fought on behalf of those families.\n\nOne battle recently waged involved the Romeike family. Uwe and Hannalore Romeike were threatened with fines, jail time and loss of custody of their children had they remained in Germany and continued homeschooling. They made the choice because of teaching in public schools on homosexuality, abortion and other issues that violated the family\u2019s Christian faith.\n\nThey fled to the U.S. and sought asylum, only to be turned away by the Obama administration.\n\nAdvocates for homeschooling at the time warned the underlying legal precedent in the Romeike family\u2019s case suggests that the government always knows best what education is appropriate for children and can require them to attend a school that violates their religious beliefs.\n\nEven in America.\n\nThe new bill is H.R. 1153, the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act of 2015, and would make it possible for families who are treated harshly over homeschooling to find refuge in the United States.\n\nA vote is scheduled in the House Judiciary Committee sometime this week.\n\nDonnelly said, \u201cA country that bans homeschooling is violating the basic human rights of their citizens. It makes me proud that our Congress is willing to make a statement like this \u2013 that this right should be recognized and protected. I think this bill is going to kickstart serious discussion among Germans and policy makers in other countries, too. What are they going to say when hundreds of families start seeking asylum in the United States fleeing this kind of harsh treatment?\u201d\n\nThe idea comes from Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Daniel Webster of Florida and Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, all Republicans. The HSLDA reported they have include \u201cspecific language that would allow up to 500 grants of asylum to families fleeing homeschool persecution.\u201d\n\nThe Romeike family, which is staying in the U.S. because the Obama administration eventually decided to defer their prosecution, would be able to reopen their case, the HSLDA said.\n\nThe bill explicitly refers to homeschooling as a particular social group and \u201cspecifies that a person is \u2018deemed\u2019 to be eligible for asylum if he or she is persecuted for homeschooling or if the person resists anti-homeschooling laws in his country of origin.\u201d\n\nHSLDA chairman Michael Farris argued the Romeikes\u2019 case before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and said, \u201cNo one should be forced to flee their homeland in order to homeschool. But that is what the Romeikes and scores of other families have had to do in order to escape crushing fines, criminal penalties and even the seizure of their children in countries like Germany and Sweden. Homeschooling is no threat to free societies, and I applaud the Congress for taking action so that families like the Romeikes and others who experience harsh treatment may find refuge and legal status in the land of the free.\u201d\n\nHSLDA even now is fighting on behalf of several families from Sweden and Germany in their cases before the European Court of Human Rights over homeschooling.\n\nWND reported extensively on the Romeike case, whose members eventually stayed in the U.S. on a decision of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAfter an immigration judge granted the family asylum in the U.S. over Germany\u2019s persecution, the Obama administration pursued the case to the appeals level until it got the ruling it wanted, which would have sent the family back to the persecution in Germany. The U.S. Supreme Court justices then failed to affirm the asylum decision.\n\nThen DHS said it would put the case on a deferred status, at least for now.\n\nThe Obama administration relied on a decision by Germany\u2019s Federal Constitutional Court in the American case.\n\nThat foreign court found: \u201cThe general public has a justified interest in counteracting the development of religiously or philosophically motivated \u2018parallel societies\u2019 and in integrating minorities in this area. Integration does not only require that the majority of the population does not exclude religious or ideological minorities, but, in fact, that these minorities do not segregate themselves and that they do not close themselves off to a dialogue with dissenters and people of other beliefs. Dialogue with such minorities is an enrichment for an open pluralistic society. The learning and practicing of this in the sense of experienced tolerance is an important lesson right from the elementary school stage. The presence of a broad spectrum of convictions in a classroom can sustainably develop the ability of all pupils in being tolerant and exercising the dialogue that is a basic requirement of democratic decision-making process.\u201d\n\nWND commentator Ambassador Alan Keyes wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s telling that Obama and [Attorney General Eric] Holder held out against the Romeike family\u2019s plea for asylum until, with the passive-aggressive support of the U.S. Supreme Court, they had established a legal precedent upholding the administration\u2019s lawless view that an unalienable right of the natural family (rooted in the parents\u2019 obligation conscientiously to care for the upbringing of their children) is a \u2018mutable choice\u2019 government is not bound to respect.\u201d\n\nWND Editor and CEO Joseph Farah wrote that people need to understand \u201cthe Romeikes are victims of a Nazi-era law that has never been overturned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1938 law passed under the leadership of Adolf Hitler eliminated exemptions that would provide an open door for homeschoolers under the nation\u2019s compulsory education laws.\u201d\n\nIt was in 1937 when Hitler himself said: \u201cThe youth of today is ever the people of tomorrow. For this reason we have set before ourselves the task of inoculating our youth with the spirit of this community of the people at a very early age, at an age when human beings are still unperverted and therefore unspoiled. This Reich stands, and it is building itself up for the future, upon its youth. And this new Reich will give its youth to no one, but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A new proposal in Congress would make America a refuge for homeschoolers who are persecuted by its allies.
