Vile far-left comedian Bill Maher is known for crossing the lines of decency, where no topic is off limits, even mass shootings.

Appealing to a niche audience that revels in the offensive, Maher’s challenge is to outdo himself from one week to the next on his HBO show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” and this week’s feeble attempt included a suggestion that there be a mass shooting at the Country Music Awards.

“Now that liberals have forwarded their agenda by inserting a mass gay wedding into the Grammys, conservatives must match them tit-for-tat by having a mass shooting at the Country Music Awards,” Maher said on Friday’s show.

The bit was a play on the mass wedding at the Grammy Awards earlier in the week that featured some gay couples, with Maher targeting the one politically safe demographic left in America — white conservatives.
