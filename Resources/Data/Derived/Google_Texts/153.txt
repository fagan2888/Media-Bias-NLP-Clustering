As part of their campaign to help educate the public about the Affordable Care Act, Funny Or Die released this video of Billy Eichner, the star of the excellent "Billy on the Street," playing a simple game with Olivia Wilde: Obamacare Or Shut Up.

The rules are simple. Billy says a fact and Olivia has to tell him whether it's about Obamacare, or whether he should shut up.

Example:

You can sign up for healthcare online in ten minutes: Obamacare.

Gwyneth Paltrow belongs on television: Shut up.
