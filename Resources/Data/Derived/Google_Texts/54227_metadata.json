The authority pays approximately $70,000 a year to dispose of the sludge.\n\nThe authority was looking for other options, said CEO Jay Boren on Friday. It\u2019s possible that, one day, the landfill might not be available.\n\n\u201cGriffin\u2019s not putting any pressure on us, nor have they hinted that they will,\u201d Boren said. But if that did happen, \u201cwe would have to scramble.\u201d\n\nSaving the money is not a primary driver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to cut that $70,000 out of my budget,\u201d Boren said. \u201cIt would be nice to do that but not at the expense of some people who have been customers and residents of that property for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearing what people were saying, from their hearts, we\u2019ve decided that there are other options,\u201d Boren said.\n\nNewnan Utilities composts its sewage sludge at a facility on Hwy. 34 West. There have been informal discussions about sending sludge there, and authority representatives will be meeting with Newnan Utilities in the next few weeks, Boren said.\n\nIf the authority does pursue land application in the future, it won\u2019t be at the Bill Hart and Old Corinth road sites, Boren said.\n\nIn land application, the pressed sludge, which is firm though wet, goes into a truck that grinds it up. It is then sprayed onto the land, similar to a hydroseeding operation.\n\nThe EPD requires monitoring for nitrogen levels and rotation of the application sites.\n\nA plastic bin of the sludge itself sat on the main table during Wednesday\u2019s public hearing. It has an earthy smell, with a barely perceptible sewage odor.\n\nThe fields would be planted with coastal Bermudagrass. Coastal Bermuda was chosen because it pulls high levels of nitrogen from the soil, said Rusty Russell, project manager.\n\nResidents who turned out at the meeting were concerned about pathogens, runoff, and the effect the land application project could have on their property values.\n\nGreg Farmer said he\u2019d seen a study from Sweden stating that human pathogens could remain in the sludge for up to seven years.\n\n\u201cIt includes cholera as well as leprosy, tuberculosis, dysentery. This is in clean waste after the treatment process,\u201d Farmer said.\n\nThough the levels of certain metals are within allowed ranges in the sludge itself, a Harvard study \u201cdetermined the metal levels do tend to accumulate and last for years to come,\u201d Farmer said.\n\n\u201cThey are basically trace elements,\u201d said Braiden Griffiths with engineering firm Stevenson and Palmer. \u201cWe have tested and we have to test them annually, and do soil samples \u2026 we do soil tests to make sure everything is still within the guidelines.\u201d\n\nMelinda Walden, who said the Old Corinth Road site is in her backyard, said she\u2019d found a study that said that there\u2019s a risk of wind-born pathogens going up to 10 kilometers.\n\nCreeks, including Sandy Creek, which feed the Newnan Utilities drinking water reservoirs, flow near the Old Corinth Road site.\n\nStan Roughton said he has a shallow well and worries about the impact on his drinking water, especially after heavy rains.\n\nWalden said that her children play in the creek that runs along her property. She asked Boren if he would let his children plan in a creek that near the land application site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go ahead and say no,\u201d Boren said at the meeting.\n\nFriday, Boren said that, after gathering more information, he would feel comfortable letting his children plan in a creek near the site.\n\n\u201cPeople do not want this, no matter how safe you say it is,\u201d Walden said. \u201cAs a community we are begging you to do something else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "The Newnan Times-Herald", "description": "The Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority won\u2019t be pursuing a plan to apply \u201cstabilized biosolids\u201d to property on Bill Hart and Old Corinth Roads.", "title": "Authority backs down on sludge application proposal", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/02/authority-backs-down-on-sludge-application-proposal", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://cdn.nthstatic.net/static/global/og-logo-default.jpg", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://times-herald.com/", "description": "The Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority won\u2019t be pursuing a plan to apply \u201cstabilized biosolids\u201d to property on Bill Hart and Old Corinth Roads.", "title": "Authority backs down on sludge application proposal", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/02/authority-backs-down-on-sludge-application-proposal", "image": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/assets/photos/2016/authority-backs-down-on-sludge-application-proposal/_articlePhotoFull/sludge.jpg?mtime=20160213005710", "site": "@TimesHerald", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "fb": {"admins": "7027018, 100000783540613, 501100169, 100006595873641"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Local"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The Newnan Times-Herald A bin of pressed sludge was on display at Wednesday\u2019s meeting on proposed sludge application sites.\nIn land application, the pressed sludge, which is firm though wet, goes into a truck that grinds it up.\nThe pressed sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, is currently hauled to a landfill in Griffin.\nIf the authority does pursue land application in the future, it won\u2019t be at the Bill Hart and Old Corinth road sites, Boren said.\nCreeks, including Sandy Creek, which feed the Newnan Utilities drinking water reservoirs, flow near the Old Corinth Road site."}
