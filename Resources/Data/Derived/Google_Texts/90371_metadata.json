In the debate last night, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his new \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposal, and positioned herself as the defender of the status quo that is, er \u2026 not terribly popular. Nevertheless, Hillary wrapped herself firmly in Obama\u2019s mantle as a way to attack Sanders, accusing him of wanting to tear up Democrats\u2019 progress on health care:\n\nTalking about picking the losing horse! In the past year, there has not been a single poll that shows a majority favoring the Affordable Care Act; in fact, the last one to show that was three years ago, almost ten months before the disastrous implementation of ObamaCare. Only three polls since have shown even a plurality in favor of ObamaCare, and all three were within the margin of error. Most polling show majorities opposed to the law, and the margins have widened of late.\n\nSo this is an unusual strategy for the general election. Does it really help Hillary in the primaries? The threat from Bernie Sanders comes from the progressive-populist grassroots who demonize corporations like insurers, and who demand health care as a right provided by government for \u201cfree.\u201d Hillary tries to feign hostility toward insurers in her answer, but the knock on ObamaCare for the Left is that (a) it didn\u2019t go far enough, and (b) it provided a captive market for Big Insurance.\n\nBernie\u2019s plan, on the other hand, gives progressives both the single-payer system they demand and the soak-the-rich tax plan of their dreams:\n\nThere are still lots of questions about how the middle class would fare under his new plan. But it\u2019s clear they would definitely do better than the rich. Employers would put up about half of what Sanders\u2019 staff think the campaign would cost. They\u2019d pay a new payroll tax of 6.2 percent, equal to the amount employers already pay to Social Security. That tax would raise $630 billion a year, the campaign projects. Most Americans would have to pay a \u201cpremium\u201d \u2013 although unlike a premium for a conventional insurance plan, this fee would increase with the household\u2019s income. That premium amounts to a 2.2 percent increase in taxes on earnings that would raise about $210 billion a year. With the standard deduction, it would apply to households earning at least $28,800 a year, according to the campaign. The rich would pay through the nose. In addition to the premium, Sanders would increase the marginal rate on those earning at least $250,000 a year. Those earning between that amount and $500,000 would pay 37 percent on that income. Income between $500,000 and $2 million would be taxed at a rate of 43 percent; income between $2 million and $10 million would be taxed at a rate of 48 percent.\n\nNeedless to say, this single-payer proposal doesn\u2019t have a prayer of passing through Congress. It\u2019s yet another of Bernie\u2019s socialist fantasies, given more gravitas simply because of his position in the polls. But the Democratic base doesn\u2019t want to hear about reality in the primaries \u2014 they want someone who will fight. (Sound familiar?)\n\nWithout really gaining anything in the primaries, Hillary\u2019s impassioned defense of Obama will make it a lot easier for Republicans in the fall to argue that she\u2019s running for Obama\u2019s third term \u2014 assuming she wins the nomination, which is looking more dicey every day. Chris Cillizza points out that these quotes right out of Hillary\u2019s own mouth give the GOP a terrific ad to run all summer and fall:\n\nSplice the three quotes I started this piece with into a TV ad. Throw in a visual or two of Obama and Clinton laughing or hugging. And whammo! You\u2019ve got a terrific negative ad that puts lie to Clinton\u2019s past insistence that she won\u2019t simply be a continuation of Obama\u2019s policies. Now Republicans were already making that attack. And with or without Clinton\u2019s strong defense of Obama on Sunday night, Republicans were going to keep making it. But the strongest (read: most effective) ads in this cynical time are the ones featuring the candidate herself saying things that seem to contradict other things she\u2019s said. Clinton handed that ad to Republicans on Sunday night. She might have had to do it \u2014 you can\u2019t win the general election if you can\u2019t get to the general election \u2014 but it comes with a major downside that Clinton will feel if she is the Democratic nominee this fall.\n\nIf. And that if grows larger with every passing day.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Millstones.", "title": "Hillary: No one will defend ObamaCare better than me!", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/18/hillary-no-one-will-defend-obamacare-better-than-me/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/A7jzhzhqlCQ/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/A7jzhzhqlCQ/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T21:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-18T18:37:49+00:00"}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "In addition to the premium, Sanders would increase the marginal rate on those earning at least $250,000 a year.\nHillary: No one will defend ObamaCare better than me!\nOnly three polls since have shown even a plurality in favor of ObamaCare, and all three were within the margin of error.\nIn the debate last night, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his new \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposal, and positioned herself as the defender of the status quo that is, er \u2026 not terribly popular.\nAnd with or without Clinton\u2019s strong defense of Obama on Sunday night, Republicans were going to keep making it."}
