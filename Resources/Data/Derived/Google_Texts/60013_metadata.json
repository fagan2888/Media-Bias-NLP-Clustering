This Guy Again.\n\nThe libertarian launches a new project to fleece the liberty-loving gullible\n\nOh, Lord. Not this guy again.\n\nThe fight for liberty continues tomorrow. #StayTuned Posted by Greg Brannon on Wednesday, October 7, 2015\n\nYou may remember Greg Brannon from his unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate last year. Enlisting everyone from George Washington to Arcade Fire in the cause, he posted the above video shot at the Governor\u2019s Mansion to his Facebook page yesterday, leading some political observers to conclude he\u2019d be announcing a run for governor.\n\nNo such luck. As Brannon announced this morning, he\u2019s choosing a far more lucrative route, forming a 501(c)4 nonprofit called Organize for Liberty. The organization says it\u2019s \u201cdedicated to encouraging and protecting constitutionally-limited government, individual sovereignty, and the inalienable rights of the individual.\u201d\n\nThanks to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling, these nonprofits\u2014which are tax-exempt, as all nonprofits are\u2014can raise unlimited amounts of money without disclosing their donors.\n\nI just want to hammer this home: This guy has created an organization, devoted to resisting government tyranny, that does not have to pay taxes and can accept unlimited amounts of money from donors whose identities it does not have to disclose.\n\nWow. That\u2019s some weak tyranny, as tyranny goes.\n\nBrannon has proven himself adept at raising money from the gullible, so Organize for Liberty shouldn\u2019t come as a complete surprise. But there\u2019s another aspect of his new group that seems somewhat contradictory.\n\nHe is, of course, a Second Amendment absolutist. During his Senate run, he won the support of Gun Owners of America, the \u201cno-compromise national gun rights organization\u201d that sees the NRA as a bunch of fence-straddling squishes.\n\nThe opening line of Brannon\u2019s announcement today: \u201cThe only legitimate role of a government is to protect the individual\u2019s unalienable rights: Life\u2014from the moment of conception to natural passing\u2014liberty, and the pursuit of your dreams.\u201d\n\nSo, wait: The government can protect an individual\u2019s right to life up to the point of \u201cnatural passing\u201d?\n\nI can think of some people in Oregon, and Charleston, and Newtown, and Aurora, and Lafayette, and Roanoke, who\u2019d be happy if the government had exercised its legitimate function before they lost their loved ones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Libertarian huckster Greg Brannon's new project to fleece the liberty-loving gullible.", "og": {"image": "/Charlotte-Magazine/October-2015/Greg-Brannon-This-Guy-Again/", "type": "article", "description": "Organize for Liberty: Greg Brannon's new anti-government tyranny group that doesn't have to pay taxes or disclose its donors.", "title": "Greg Brannon.
