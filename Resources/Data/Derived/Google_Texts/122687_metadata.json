In 2010, the tea party allowed into office conservative underdogs like Marco Rubio, and launched the political careers of the likes of Christine O\u2019Donnell and Rand Paul. While the tea party wave of 2010 may have been an indicator of Trumpism to come, it wasn\u2019t the birth of it.\n\nIn 2014, another GOP wave took America by storm, resulting in GOP control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nIn the 2014 cycle, Republicans ran on the platform of repealing and replacing Obamacare, building the Keystone Pipeline, and standing in the way of President Obama\u2019s so called illegal, unconstitutional, and nefarious plan to give amnesty to the millions of undocumented immigrants residing within our borders.\n\nI remember these promises quite well. Because while the Washington elite were sunbathing in the rays of power, I was getting sunburn in the rays of the sun \u2014 knocking on countless doors across the 12th Congressional District of Georgia peddling the talking points that, \u201cRepublicans can fix Washington this time\u201d and asking them to give the party one more chance. They\u2019ll repeal this, pass that, and get this done. Just trust me.\n\nAs I flowed through my talking points, the voters were almost uniformly expressionless. It was as if they\u2019ve heard all this before, as if the phrases leaving my mouth had become horribly routine. Or they were wondering why I wasn\u2019t in school.\n\nAt the time, their skepticism puzzled me. But fast forward two years, and the aforementioned promises were never kept. While the betrayals were new to me, it was a game that grassroots conservatives knew all too well.\n\nOnce again, the politicians had lied to them, failed them, and moved on. This disappointment turned into contempt.\n\nKendall Noble is a rigger for Huntington Ingalls Industries in the state of Mississippi. He works 40 hours a week, says he pays his \u201cfair share of taxes,\u201d and supports Donald Trump for President. When I asked about his frustrations with the GOP establishment and politicians altogether, he accused them of selling out. \u201cThey have put the almighty dollar before those they claim to represent. They preach during interviews and follow the money when it counts.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cI am very sick of broken promises CJ.\u201d\n\nNoble wasn\u2019t alone in his disappointment and contempt for the political class and Washington elite. It\u2019s a sentiment shared by many in the grassroots.\n\nPaul Eggbeen, a former president delegate for his local GOP chapter, expressed the same frustration. He said he was \u201cextremely frustrated with the Republican establishment for their repeated capitulated to President Obama.\u201d\n\nHe accused the party of being spineless and letting the Democrats \u201cdefine them.\u201d\n\nThe media will never understand this frustration. The pundits will never be able to explain this contempt. To understand it, you have to feel it. To explain it, you\u2019ve had to experience it.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly why when it comes to stopping Trump, the #StopTrump is trying to light a match in a dark room. The TV spots, the hashtags, the direct mail pieces \u2014 the grassroots knows this game all too well. When was the last time billionaire businessman Tom Ricketts made a phone call to an angry voter?\n\nEven conservative hypeman Erick Erickson, one of the more prominent #StopTrumpers, hasn\u2019t attended the county meeting of his local county party in years. Throughout time, the spokespeople of the tea party has created their own establishments. A monopoly \u2014 led by the likes of Erickson, Dana Loesch, and Glenn Beck have been more motivated by the allure of TV segments, retweets and clicks, than the interests of their own constituency. The GOP establishment betrayed the grassroots and now the leaders of the grassroots are doing the same to their rank and file.\n\nThe passion of Trump supporters has shown not only empathic anger towards government and the establishment but strong disdain for all elites \u2014 in both the establishment and the conservative movement. The same leaders these activists had marched behind in battle with them have been discarded in hopes of a new movement \u2014 a movement born out of the campaign of Donald J. Trump,\n\nThe establishment has set the stage for a revolution. A revolution that will surely be televised. 1.8 billion dollars\u2019 worth of television. actually.\n\nDonald Trump won\u2019t be stopped by ads or think pieces. There might be a chance if the politicians did their jobs. But don\u2019t bet on it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "C.J.
