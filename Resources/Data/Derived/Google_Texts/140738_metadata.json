While this may seem like common sense, researchers weren\u2019t completely certain whether it was true, or if it could have a long-term impact on an adolescent\u2019s behavior and development. But it turns out that kids who work summer jobs are more likely to stay out of trouble even months afterward.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have this conventional wisdom that nothing stops a bullet like a job, but it\u2019s not been clear whether that\u2019s true,\u201d said Sara Heller, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of the study, according to HealthDay. \u201cNow we know these programs are changing youth\u2019s future behavior, not just keeping them busy for the summer.\u201d\n\nThe study examined 1,600 teenagers between 8th and 12th grade who lived in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. Half of them participated in a public summer jobs program called One Summer Plus, which put them to work in nonprofit and government jobs about 25 hours per week at minimum wage. The participants worked as summer camp counselors, community gardeners, or office assistants, with one adult mentor per 10 students. After the summer job had ended, Heller and her team monitored the students for 13 months, examining administrative and attendance records from Chicago Public Schools as well as arrest records from the Chicago Police Department.\n\nThey found that the teens who had worked in the program were 43 percent less likely to be arrested for a violent crime compared to kids who didn\u2019t enroll in the program. Although this same decrease in percentage didn\u2019t occur when it came to other nonviolent crimes, the researchers found that this decline in violent crime was apparent for over a year after leaving the job.\n\nWhy the decrease in violence, specifically? \u201cIt might be teaching youths that not everything that happens is an affront to them, not to get quite so angry, and not to throw that punch,\u201d Heller explained. \u201cIt\u2019s teaching them to manage their own thoughts and emotions more constructively.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the most fascinating result of the study was the fact that working teens who received counseling didn\u2019t fare any better than teens who simply worked. This implies that work is a form of therapy, growth, and emotional stability more so than cognitive behavioral therapy. Because of this, Heller believes that U.S. cities should explore options for summer programs that target teens in poor neighborhoods who are at a high risk of violence, though many already have such programs.\n\nWorking a summer job can instill pride in a teen for earning his own money, as well as boosting his ability to cooperate with others. \u201cWork is showing young people that they matter,\u201d Ed DeJesus, national director of workforce programs and policy at Youth Advocate Programs, told HealthDay. \u201cYoung people have an awakening, a better outlook for their future. They have hope.\u201d\n\nSource: Heller S. Summer jobs reduce violence among disadvantaged youth.
