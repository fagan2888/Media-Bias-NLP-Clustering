(Not affiliated with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association or its member companies.)\n\nA lawsuit over whether health insurance carriers\u2019 provider networks were adequate has screeched to a halt following accusations of impropriety within the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, headed by Mike Kreidler (D). One of the insurers, Premera Blue Cross, subsequently filed a motion to vacate all of Administrative Law Judge Patricia Petersen\u2019s decisions, which could result in Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital starting all over again in its case (Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, Hearings Unit, Docket No. 13-0293).\n\nLast fall, Seattle Children\u2019s sued the insurance commissioner\u2019s office in King County Superior Court after it approved rate filings for four health insurance carriers participating in the state\u2019s exchange, Healthplanfinder, that did not include Seattle Children\u2019s in their networks. In April, Coordinated Care Corp. and Molina Healthcare of Washington, Inc. reversed course and added the hospital, leaving Premera and BridgeSpan Health Co. \u2014 a Regence BlueShield subsidiary that more recently filed a joinder in support of Premera\u2019s motion to set aside Petersen\u2019s orders \u2014 as the remaining carriers.\n\nHowever, in a May 13 ex parte filing in the case, Petersen, who has worked for the insurance commissioner\u2019s office for almost 30 years, said that once she was involved in cases related to the Affordable Care Act, Chief Deputy Insurance Commissioner James Odiorne \u201cmade\u2026efforts to communicate with me ex parte about ongoing cases (at the time, the Coordinated Care case which involved the same significant issue as does the instant Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital case which is ongoing now) in order to influence the outcome of my decisions in the area of the federal Affordable Care Act, the Commissioner\u2019s approvals/disapprovals of the Washington Health Care Exchange filings made by carriers for certification by the Exchange and ultimate sale to Washington consumers.\u201d She cites September as when Odiorne\u2019s efforts to communicate started, which is the month before Seattle Children\u2019s filed its case.\n\nJudge Files Whistleblower Complaint\n\nPetersen contended that Odiorne \u201cexpressed displeasure about those of my decisions which did not uphold the Commissioner\u2019s position and he told me how he believed I was expected to have decided (always in support of the Commissioner\u2019s positions).\u201d She alleged that in two meetings, he \u201cinstructed me to go meet with the Commissioner when I receive a case, find out how the Commissioner wants the case decided, and decide the case in the way the Commissioner wants.\u201d\n\nPetersen also filed a whistleblower complaint with the state auditor\u2019s office, which declined to investigate \u2014 and that means the complaint is now being investigated by her own agency. The insurance commissioner\u2019s office maintains that the communication between the two was allowed, and it also said that it was investigating Petersen herself also regarding ex parte communication around her whistleblower report, which she allegedly had someone email to one of the attorneys in the case. She acknowledged the leak but said it was inadvertent. Petersen is on paid leave during the investigation, which should be final by the end of this month. In the meantime, the agency signed a former judge for the King County Superior Court, George Finkle, to a 90-day contract.\n\nThe situation prompted Sen. Mike Padden (R), chairman of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, to address the issue of administrative law judges deciding cases against the agencies they work for during a committee work session. Petersen testified, although she was under a gag order from Kreidler, so she couldn\u2019t discuss specifics. According to Padden, he invited Kreidler to attend, but he declined, sending a couple of deputy commissioners to discuss the logistics of the hearing system.\n\n\u201cI just know, from 12 years as a district court judge, that independence is a bedrock principle the entire judiciary should embrace,\u201d said Padden in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe implications are enormous,\u201d he continued, \u201cespecially when a hearings officer is essentially deciding which health-care facilities are to be included in a health-care insurer\u2019s network. Then you\u2019re talking, literally, about the choices that families have.\u201d\n\nPremera: \u2018Orders and Rulings Are Tainted\u2019\n\nIn its filing to vacate Petersen\u2019s rulings, Premera contends that \u201cRegardless of the merits of her accusation, her own words leave no question that Judge Petersen\u2019s decision-making and her ability to remain impartial were compromised prior to issuing rulings in this case. Her prior orders and rulings are tainted as a matter of law, and cannot stand.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, says Jack Rovner, an attorney and a principal of The Health Law Consultancy, one of two things will happen in this \u201cmess\u201d of a situation:\n\n(1) \u201cThey can reinstate the case with the new administrative law judge and start from scratch.\u201d That judge \u201ccould review the evidence, which is not tainted,\u201d he says. As far as Petersen\u2019s judgments on motions, it\u2019s unclear if they would stand or not. The new judge \u201cmay require the motions to be refiled.\u201d\n\n(2) \u201cThey can say this is a dead case and invite Seattle Children\u2019s to start anew,\u201d an option that \u201cseems like an unnecessary step,\u201d he tells The AIS Report.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing seems to be in suspended animation,\u201d he says, adding that he has \u201cno idea what\u2019s going to happen procedurally.\u201d\n\nAttorney Tim Parker, a principal with Carney Badley Spellman who represents BridgeSpan, tells The AIS Report that \u201cthe administrative case is still pending; it was not dismissed. It is set for hearing the week of Aug. 18\u201d in order to determine whether the two plans\u2019 networks must include Seattle Children\u2019s \u201cin order to satisfy network adequacy requirements.\u201d\n\nAccording to Parker, \u201cThe substantive issue is whether an exchange network in Washington is inadequate if Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital is not a contracted provider. SCH is a pediatric specialty care and research hospital in the Seattle area.\u201d\n\nCase Comes Down to Money\n\nThe case is about network adequacy standards, which are \u201cpretty vague,\u201d says Rovner. More specifically, he says, such narrow-network cases are \u201creally about money.\u2026The problem becomes when,\u201d for example, including Seattle Children\u2019s in a network increases premiums $10 to $15 for everyone.\n\nWhen a provider pushes back in a situation like this, the question becomes \u201cwhat are they charging and why,\u201d Rovner says. \u201cIf the answer is they are charging too much,\u2026somebody\u2019s paying the bill.\u201d If a provider does not face competition, which would help keep prices down, then \u201cthe government is supposed to regulate it like it does a public utility,\u201d he asserts.\n\nIn Premera\u2019s petition to intervene, it maintains that \u201cPut simply, this case directly affects Premera\u2019s rights because it will affect the cost of health plans that Premera would sell in a competitive marketplace. Thus, this case may affect Premera\u2019s members\u2019 interest. Plaintiff also seeks relief that if granted would preclude Premera from selling in the WHIE [i.e., Washington Health Insurance Exchange]. Plaintiff asks this Court to expel Premera from the WHIE or force Premera to pay rates demanded by the plaintiff.\u201d\n\nPremera, says Rovner, \u201cleft Seattle Children\u2019s out of their network so they can have a cheaper premium.\u201d He points to data on exchanges showing that \u201cconsumers, particularly consumers who were uninsured,\u201d are \u201cextremely price-sensitive.\u2026A plan needs to provide a product that\u2019s inexpensive,\u201d but with requirements on essential health benefits, metal levels and no exclusions for pre-existing conditions, plan sponsors must \u201cgo to the supplier of the service to get a deep discount, and the only way they can do that is to promise volume, and the only way to do that is by a narrow network.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always comes down to money,\u201d says Rovner. \u201cThere are no free lunches.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
