In 1918, Mississippi became the first state in the nation to allow conjugal visits in the belief they would increase the productivity of black inmate workers by giving them an outlet for sexual aggression.\n\nBut conjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi\u2019s penal past as chain gangs. Last month, the state announced they would no longer be allowed effective Feb. 1, citing costs and concerns over female visitors becoming the single parents of children conceived in prison.\n\nOf the more than 22,000 inmates, only 155 inmates had conjugal visits, which are limited to one hour, in the last fiscal year. Extended family visits lasting up to 24 hours, in which children had to be included, were ended last year.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cWhile both the extended family visitation and conjugal visit program involve a small percentage of inmates, the cost coupled with big-ticket items adds up,\u201d Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Christopher B. Epps said. \u201cThe benefits of the programs don\u2019t outweigh the cost in the overall budget.\u201d\n\nMississippi is one of only five states that still has conjugal visit programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like putting a kid in timeout,\u201d State Rep. Richard Bennett, who tried to outlaw the visits in 2012, told the New York Times. \u201cDo you give them their favorite things?\u201d\n\nBut a new group called Mississippi Advocates for Prisoners is trying to get Epps to reconsider. Conjugal visits \u201care the one privilege that allows the men to help keep the family together \u2014 to act as a man and a husband,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Jennifer Rogers, said.\n\nAccording to a recent Yale Law School survey of prison systems in all 50 states, allowing conjugal visits may, in addition to encouraging good behavior, \u201cdecrease sexual violence within prisons\u201d and help strengthen families.\n\nJames Parchman, the warden at Mississippi State Penitentiary, didn\u2019t have the benefits of such research when he made the decision to allow conjugal visits in 1918. According to \u201cWorse Than Slavery\u201d author David Oshinsky, prison officials at the time thought blacks had stronger sexual urges than whites and allowing black inmates to have sex occasionally would make them work harder on prison farms.\n\nIn the 1970s, new prisons were often constructed with special housing units for extended family visits. But by 1993, the number of states allowing visits had shrunk to 17.\n\nIn announcing Mississippi\u2019s about-face, Epps cited the \u201ccosts associated with the staff\u2019s time, having to escort inmates to and from the visitation facility, supervising personal hygiene and keeping up the infrastructure of the facility.\u201d But the state hasn\u2019t offered any figures on the number of babies born or the costs of the conjugal visit program.\n\n\u201cIs it really the money, or is it that the program\u2019s become a political target for Mississippi politicians who find the policy uncomfortably liberal?\u201d asked New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist Jarvis DeBerry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi's penal past as chain gangs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Matthew Heller", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Conjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi's penal past as chain gangs.", "title": "Mississippi Inmates Face Loss Of First-Of-Its-Kind Conjugal Visits Program", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/mississippi-inmates-face-loss-first-kind-conjugal-visits-program/177317/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP590909093.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-21T09:30:05-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi's penal past as chain gangs.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP590909093.jpg", "title": "Mississippi Inmates Face Loss Of First-Of-Its-Kind Conjugal Visits Program", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "Mississippi", "published_time": "2014-01-20T09:17:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T09:30:05-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95f8\"", "article_summary": "Mississippi Inmates Face Loss Of First-Of-Its-Kind Conjugal Visits ProgramConjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi's penal past as chain gangs.\nOf the more than 22,000 inmates, only 155 inmates had conjugal visits, which are limited to one hour, in the last fiscal year.\nBut conjugal visits may soon be as much a relic of Mississippi\u2019s penal past as chain gangs.\nExtended family visits lasting up to 24 hours, in which children had to be included, were ended last year.\nJames Parchman, the warden at Mississippi State Penitentiary, didn\u2019t have the benefits of such research when he made the decision to allow conjugal visits in 1918."}
