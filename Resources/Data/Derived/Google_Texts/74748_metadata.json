(AP) - Children are drawn to The University of Wyoming Geological Museum by the many dinosaur bones, fossils and posters - but an interactive exhibit keeps them coming back.\n\nAn augmented reality sandbox has been on display at the museum for a few months and quickly became a fan favorite, said Laura Vietti, Geological Museum collections manager.\n\n\u201cIt highlights what a topographic map is in real time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an intuitive and useful way of looking at landscaping features - it\u2019s an easy way to show 3-D features from a 2-D projection.\u201d\n\nA box filled with sand is continuously analyzed by a scanner situated above the box; a projector next to it shoots a topographical map onto the sand based on its elevation. If a sand mountain is made in the box, the projection will show, through lines and colors, it is higher than the surrounding sand.\n\n\u201c(The children) are learning stuff, but they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re leaning anything,\u201d Vietti said.\n\nAshley Bean frequents the museum with her two children: Lizzy, 5, and Henry, 3. Ashley said the sand table is by far their favorite exhibit in the museum.\n\n\u201cWe come here pretty often for about an hour, an hour-and-a-half\u201d she said. \u201cThey come back (to the sand table) about three times.\u201d\n\nHer two children stood around the box, pushing and forming the sand while the lines and colors show in real time the difference in elevation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because you can make things pop up on (the sand),\u201d Lizzy said. \u201cI like making water too.\u201d\n\nThe sandbox also has the ability to showcase realistic water changes, Vietti said.\n\nHolding a hand above the table simulates a rain cloud, pouring graphically-produced water onto the sand. It then flows down the mountains or flats into valleys, just as real rain does.\n\nOf course, some children like playing in the box for other reasons.\n\n\u201cI get to play in the sand,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt gets me messy, and I like it.\u201d\n\nHis sister chimed in immediately.\n\n\u201cYou just like throwing sand,\u201d Lizzy said.\n\nTheir mom Ashley said interactive parts of the museum like the sandbox are the most fun for her children.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a little bit young for some of the things here, so the things they can touch - the dinosaur bones, the fossils over there - are their favorite things,\u201d she said.\n\nEven school field trips to the museum can get distracted by the sandbox, for better or worse, Vietti said.\n\n\u201cWe put more emphasis on the other exhibits because they spend so much time playing here,\u201d she said.\n\nLuckily, interactive sandboxes can be used throughout the state, Vietti said.\n\n\u201cThe first prototype was finished last October,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller and can travel anywhere. It can be used in the classroom easily.\u201d\n\nThe sandbox also isn\u2019t limited for use by children, Vietti said.\n\n\u201cThe adults are a little more cautious first, but as soon as they get their hands on it, they have a lot of fun,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the sandtable is one of the newest interactive exhibits in the museum, Vietti said it should be the start of a more hands-on museum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a goal for what we want the museum to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt compliments a more geology-focused exhibit we want to continue to grow.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Laramie Boomerang, http://www.laramieboomerang.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children are drawn to The University of Wyoming Geological Museum by the many dinosaur bones, fossils and posters - but an interactive exhibit keeps them coming back.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Children are drawn to The University of Wyoming Geological Museum by the many dinosaur bones, fossils and posters - but an interactive exhibit keeps them coming back.", "title": "Children learn topography through interactive sandbox", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/13/children-learn-topography-through-interactive-sand/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/13/aef439bee6d0d0237e0f6a7067005c60.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/13/aef439bee6d0d0237e0f6a7067005c60.jpg", "description": "Children are drawn to The University of Wyoming Geological Museum by the many dinosaur bones, fossils and posters - but an interactive exhibit keeps them coming back.", "card": "summary", "title": "Children learn topography through interactive sandbox"}, "Author": "THADDEUS MAST", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "It can be used in the classroom easily.\u201dThe sandbox also isn\u2019t limited for use by children, Vietti said.\nTheir mom Ashley said interactive parts of the museum like the sandbox are the most fun for her children.\nWhile the sandtable is one of the newest interactive exhibits in the museum, Vietti said it should be the start of a more hands-on museum.\n\u201cI like making water too.\u201dThe sandbox also has the ability to showcase realistic water changes, Vietti said.\nAshley said the sand table is by far their favorite exhibit in the museum."}
