TUCKER CARLSON: They are transparently committed to propaganda. And I will say this, the fact that they have suborned all these actors and comedians, that they're entering in to partnership with Funny or Die -- Will Ferrell's website -- or Amy Poehler to sell Obamacare, I mean, when you have entertainment figures acting as shills for government, that's kind of getting in to soviet territory.



MARA LIASSON: That's not new.



CARLSON: I'm not saying it's new or not, it's disturbing.



LIASSON: Yeah, but Obama isn't the only administration that's done this.



CARLSON: Really? I can't remember Saturday Night Live actors working on of behalf of Bush.
