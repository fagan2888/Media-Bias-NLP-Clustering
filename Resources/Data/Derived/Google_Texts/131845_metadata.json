Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office projects the uninsured population will continue to top 30 million by 2024 despite access to insurance under the ACA. Hospital EDs often serve as safety nets to Medicaid recipients and the uninsured population, as well as community care resources during disasters such as 2012's Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe report found other obstacles to hospital functions. For example:\n\nThe number of hospitals providing emergency care is down even as ED visits increase\n\nProviders face a projected staff shortage of nearly 90,000 by 2020\n\nHospitals' role as safety nets is not specifically funded, but rather part of the overarching, patient revenue-supported cost structure\n\nGovernment reimbursements fall short of the cost of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries' care, with a shortfall of more than $51 billion in 2013\n\nHospitals also face declining revenues as other providers, such as ambulatory surgical centers and physician practices, offer outpatient surgical and diagnostic procedures. \"The challenges facing hospitals in maintaining the standby role are symptoms of broader issues facing the healthcare system in the context of growing need and constrained resources,\" the report states. \"How the system addresses these issues, the success of these efforts, and the lessons learned will have a profound effect on the healthcare system as a whole.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEmergency department visits increase since ACA implementation\n\nAmbulatory surgical centers cheaper than hospitals\n\nED use up since MA instituted healthcare reform\n\nWill healthcare reform drive up ED use?\n\nKing v.
