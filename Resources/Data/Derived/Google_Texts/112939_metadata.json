Mitch McConnell\u2019s sharp attack on Mrs. Grimes for supporting it and the rest of President Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\nDemocratic candidates have struggled to defend Obamacare, especially in red states such as Kentucky that will decide whether Republicans can win majority control of the U.S. Senate this year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Politics color information on Obamacare premiums\n\nIn Kentucky, Mr. Obama and Obamacare remain wildly unpopular with voters, even as support has steadily increased for the state\u2019s Kynect health insurance exchange created under Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA.\n\nMrs. Grimes may have opened a back door to support it. The ad features husband Andrew Grimes extolling his wife\u2019s deep commitment to the people of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cShe cares about Kentucky more than anyone else I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he says. \u201cShe cares about the middle class. She cares about the women of Kentucky. She cares about our students. She cares about all those people that feel like they get left behind.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Alison Lundergan Grimes shoots skeet in new campaign ad\n\nMr. Grimes says that his wife is \u201cthe strongest fighter I\u2019ve ever seen, and she will fight for Kentucky families in Washington, where they have not been fought for in a long, long time.\u201d\n\nThe campaign highlights Mrs. Grimes\u2019s support for the Democratic election-year agenda: raising the federal minimum wage, ending tax loopholes for businesses shipping jobs overseas, not touching Social Security and Medicare, and reducing student-loan debt.\n\nThe Grimes campaign urged supporters to share their stories about \u201cwhy Alison Cares\u201d by submitting letters to the editor, sharing photos and videos online and using the hashtag #AlisonCares on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIt also played off of Mrs. Grimes\u2018 stump speech, in which she has declared: \u201cMitch McConnell doesn\u2019t care. I do!\u201d\n\nObamacare is not mentioned itself, but the ad does marry the word \u201ccare\u201d and her name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to appeal to supporters without activating opponents,\u201d said D. Stephen Voss, a political-science professor at University of Kentucky who specializes in the study of voter behavior.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got to mobilize the Democratic base. I think it is smart for doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cMcConnell has done so well tying her to Obama with his messaging that I\u2019m not sure she suffers more . She\u2019s already paid that cost a lot.\u201d\n\nObamacare remains a top campaign issue for voters nationwide and a drag on Democratic candidates in key Senate races. Health care ranked third on a list of top issues for voters, behind the economy and terrorism, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll.\n\nThe issue flared up last week in North Carolina and Louisiana, two other conservative states where incumbent Democratic senators are locked in close races.\n\nReports that health insurance rates were increasing in North Carolina prompted Republican challenger Thom Tillis to slam Democratic Sen. Kay R. Hagan for voting for Obamacare.\n\nIn Louisiana, National Federation of Independent Business dropped its endorsement of Democratic Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, citing her vote for Obamacare, and instead endorsed Republican Bill Cassidy.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is the Republican leader in the Senate, has relentlessly gone after Mrs. Grimes for being \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Kentucky candidate.\u201d\n\nThe McConnell campaign has a website dedicated to the message that Mrs. Grimes is Mr. Obama\u2019s candidate, which features highlights of her support for Obamacare, including her statement that defunding it would be a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell leads Mrs. Grimes by 5.2 percent in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls in Kentucky.\n\nThe Grimes campaign refused to answer questions about the link between AlisonCares and Obamacare.\n\nJustin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that the ad and social-media campaign show that the GOP overplayed its hand in running against Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the GOP strategy of winning back the Senate on ACA alone has failed. Voters agree that we should be holding big insurance companies accountable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has carefully avoided endorsing Obamacare in her run for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, but Monday she inched closer to identifying herself with the president's namesake health care law by launching an \"AlisonCares\" ad campaign.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has carefully avoided endorsing Obamacare in her run for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, but Monday she inched closer to identifying herself with the president\u2019s namesake health care law by launching an \u201cAlisonCares\u201d ad campaign.", "title": "Alison Lundergan Grimes\u2019 embrace of Obamacare is at arm\u2019s length", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/29/alison-lundergan-grimes-embrace-of-obamacare-is-at/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/29/9_292014_ap1346792001998201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/29/9_292014_ap1346792001998201.jpg", "description": "Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has carefully avoided endorsing Obamacare in her run for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, but Monday she inched closer to identifying herself with the president's", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Alison Lundergan Grimes\u2019 embrace of Obamacare is at arm\u2019s"}, "Author": "S.A.
