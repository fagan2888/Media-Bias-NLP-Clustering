Many who work part-time don\u2019t have access to employer-provided health care plans, and even with government assistance, some find that springing for insurance is more than their budget will bear. Add to that people who are undocumented, homeless or waiting for government assistance approval. Even with the act\u2019s implementation, it\u2019s estimated that there are more than 300,000 Nevadans who remain uninsured.\n\nEven without insurance, Southern Nevadans have access to health care.\n\n\u201cWe are the safety net to the safety net,\u201d said Volunteers in Medicine of Southern Nevada Administrative Director Amy Schmidt.\n\nThe Volunteers in Medicine Clinic opened in 2010 at 4770 Harrison Drive in a converted Clark County Parks & Recreation building in Paradise Park. The mostly volunteer-staffed clinic provides primary care, preventive and acute care, newborn checkups, immunizations, diagnostic tests, cancer screenings, health education, pharmacy services and more to Southern Nevada residents who make 200 percent or less of the poverty level, are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and can\u2019t obtain affordable health insurance coverage.\n\nSchmidt said the care patients receive is provided through a collaborative community effort with staffing help provided by medical and nursing students and cash and services coming in from private donors and places such as St. Rose Hospitals, Quest Diagnostics, West Valley Imaging and Radiology Associates of Nevada.\n\nThe organization\u2019s efforts are about to double with the addition of the new Ruffin Family Clinic on the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Madison Avenue.\n\nThe $2.4 million facility is set for a soft opening in mid-August to determine patient eligibility. Doctors should start seeing patients in September. A grand opening celebration is set for Oct. 8, to be followed by a community fair the following Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go slow and ease our way into the new clinic,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nThe organization plans to expand offerings at the Ruffin Family Clinic to include assistance with mental health, social services, dental, vision and expanded community education programs. The Paradise Park clinic is expected to remain open.\n\n\u201cThis facility will stay,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWe do not want to abandon the patient population here. We are looking at treating this more as a satellite clinic.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said the services provided are vital to the uninsured.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had insurance all your life, you don\u2019t know how much things cost. You\u2019re used to just putting down your card; but when you\u2019re uninsured, it\u2019s a totally different ball game. With the patient population we see here, they\u2019ve never had insurance, so even when they get it, they don\u2019t know how it works. So we\u2019ve created a patient support services department so we can follow up with people. \u2026. We really try to give them the tools they need and answer the questions that they have in terms of what insurance means to them now: How is that going to change their life, and how are they going to adapt?\u201d\n\nVolunteers in Medicine isn\u2019t alone in assisting the uninsured. Nevada Health Centers operates six clinics in Clark County with a sliding fee scale based on family income. The nonprofit clinics can be found at 3900 Cambridge St., 2212 S. Eastern Ave., 47 W. Owens Ave., 1799 Mount Mariah Drive, 2225 Civic Center Drive and 1312 E. Tonopah Ave. at Squires Elementary School. In addition to its urban reach, the centers serve rural communities and operate mobile medical services such as the Mammovan and the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile Miles for Smiles dental care facility.\n\nNevada Health Centers representative Carrie Tallman said the organization\u2019s mission is to provide quality people can afford.\n\n\u201cJust because you don\u2019t have a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean quality health care is not attainable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have quality providers out there doing great things.\u201d\n\nShe said the Affordable Care Act has increased the number of patients at the centers.\n\n\u201cIt has helped get people thinking more about it, thinking, \u2018Maybe this is for me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn addition to uninsured patients, the centers see people with insurance and people on Medicare or Medicaid. Tallman said the centers\u2019 focus is on being a patient-centered medical home, not just a place to turn for one-time care.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to manage people\u2019s care, so it\u2019s highly coordinated, and it\u2019s long-term,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about building a relationship versus a revolving-door scenario.\u201d\n\nTallman said patients are encouraged to come in before they\u2019re sick.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to delay until you find you have to break down and make an ER visit,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more information on Volunteers in Medicine, visit vmsn.org or call 702-967-0530.
