European Pressphoto Agency\n\nUpdated with more detail on the plan President Obama purchased.\n\nHONOLULU \u2013 President Barack Obama tested out buying health insurance for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe move was a symbolic gesture, though, as Mr. Obama will continue to receive federal health benefits.\n\nA senior administration official said that the president selected an individual bronze plan with a monthly premium of less than $400.\n\nMr. Obama didn\u2019t experience the health exchanges for himself, though. While the president was in Hawaii, his staff completed the enrollment process for him in Washington, D.C., during the weekend. The complicated nature of the president\u2019s case required an in-person sign-up, the senior administration official said, noting that Mr. Obama\u2019s personal information is not readily available in many of the government databases used to verify identities.\n\n\u201cThe act of the President signing up for insurance coverage through the D.C. exchange is symbolic since the President\u2019s health care will continue to be provided by the military,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cBut he was pleased to participate in a plan as a show of support for these marketplaces which are providing quality, affordable health care options to more than a million people.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials had long said that the president would fulfill a pledge to participate in the new health-insurance marketplace.\n\nMr. Obama signed up on the D.C. marketplace just ahead of a crucial deadline for those seeking coverage beginning Jan. 1. The cutoff had been set for 11:59 p.m. Monday night, but federal officials quietly extended the deadline, allowing consumers to sign up through Tuesday.\n\nFollow @wsjwashington on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "President Barack Obama tested out the federal health-insurance exchange for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "President Signs Up for Obamacare Coverage", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/23/president-signs-up-for-obamacare-coverage/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW518_hawaii_G_20131223150009.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "President Signs Up for Obamacare Coverage", "description": "President Barack Obama tested out the federal health-insurance exchange for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Colleen McCain Nelson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "President Barack Obama tested out the federal health-insurance exchange for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-23T18:40:06-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/23/president-signs-up-for-obamacare-coverage/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-42568", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "President Barack Obama tested out the federal health-insurance exchange for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "President Signs Up for Obamacare Coverage", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/23/president-signs-up-for-obamacare-coverage/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW518_hawaii_G_20131223150009.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-42568", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-23T22:11:32-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebbb\"", "article_summary": "European Pressphoto AgencyUpdated with more detail on the plan President Obama purchased.\nHONOLULU \u2013 President Barack Obama tested out buying health insurance for himself over the weekend, with the White House saying the president signed up for coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile the president was in Hawaii, his staff completed the enrollment process for him in Washington, D.C., during the weekend.\nA senior administration official said that the president selected an individual bronze plan with a monthly premium of less than $400.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s motorcade drives back to Kailuana Street after his morning workout at Marine Corps Base in Hawaii, on Monday."}
