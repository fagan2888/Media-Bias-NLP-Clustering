Across the spectrum of Tuality, Salem , Kaiser Permanente and Asante networks, hospital CEOs were well rewarded for their work.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, recently completed a study of executive compensation at every nonprofit hospital in the country. He found that typical CEOs earn between $400,000 and $500,000 \u2013more at large institutions, or if they oversee more than one hospital, and less if they work in rural areas. Jha\u2019s research looked at total reported compensation, a figure that includes actual pay as well as benefits like retirement plans and other benefits that executives don\u2019t bring home.\n\nLooking at Jha\u2019s math, Tuality Healthcare CEO Richard Stenson, whose total compensation was $453,981 in 2012, was right in line with his peers. So was Win Howard at Asante Three Rivers Medical Center, whose $387,518 compensation package reflects the lower pay typical nationwide in rural areas.\n\nBut Roy Vinyard, CEO of the Asante system, did better than many of his peers across the country. The typical head of a two-hospital system would have earned $637,609 \u2013 while Vinyard\u2019s reported compensation was $1.2 million. Salem Health CEO Norman Gruber, head of another two-hospital system, also did better than might be expected, earning $1.1 million in total compensation.\n\nAssessing pay at Kaiser Permanente is trickier than with the other hospitals in this series. If Kaiser\u2019s national CEO George Halvorson only oversaw his company\u2019s 37 hospitals, he might expect to earn $2.6 million, according to a rough estimate based on Jha\u2019s salary reviews. But Halvorson also heads up a multi-state network of insurance companies, medical clinics and research operations \u2013 areas the Harvard researcher did not factor into his compensation research.\n\nThese insights are the latest revelations from The Lund Report\u2019s in-depth examination of Oregon\u2019s hospital system. For the first two installments in this series, we visited with hospital chains based in the Portland metro area. Part 1 looked at Providence, and Part 2 examined Legacy Health.\n\nNow in Part 3, we visit with secular nonprofits that own two or more hospitals across the state. They range from tiny Salem Health, which owns the smallest hospital in Oregon, to multi-state insurance and healthcare company Kaiser Permanente, which just opened its second Portland-area hospital.\n\nThe figures underpinning these reviews come from multiple sources: * Hospital-specific profit, revenue and charity care figures come from audited financial reports prepared by each hospital and submitted to the Office for Oregon Health Policy & Research.\n\nThe size and reach of each hospital, as summarized through available beds, and inpatient, outpatient and emergency room figures, are reported by hospitals to the state-mandated Databank program. * Executive compensation figures come from the IRS 990 tax forms that all nonprofits are required to file.\n\nAdditional financial details about hospital chains come from IRS 990 forms and from the systems\u2019 own unaudited reports.\n\nIn addition, The Lund Report is reviewing Medicare claims data from the American Hospital Directory and hospital debt information from bond databases In these stories, we are publishing snapshots of each hospital in Oregon, along with a quick look at executive pay. Later, we\u2019ll dig deeper into executive compensation and also ask other questions that build on these initial stories: Do nonprofit hospitals spend enough caring for the poor? How is the Affordable Care Act reshaping hospitals in Oregon? Are these institutions making smart decisions about their money?\n\nKaiser Permanente\n\nKaiser Permanente is for the first time beginning to reveal details about its Oregon hospitals, but there\u2019s still much we don\u2019t know. Kaiser is a massive integrated system of hospitals, insurance plans and medical offices with annual operating revenues in the neighborhood of $50 billion. Through fiscal year 2011 its annual reports to Oregon state officials, Kaiser didn\u2019t break out details of individual hospitals, and instead the best available figures combined the results from 37 hospitals from across the U.S. into a single report. That changed in 2012, allowing The Lund Report to provide a first-ever look into the finances of Kaiser Sunnyside, which appears below. Kaiser\u2019s new\n\nWestside Medical Center hospital opened in August 2013, and it will be about two years before we get the full snapshot of that new arrival.\n\nGeorge Halvorsen, chairman and CEO of the entire national Kaiser Permanente system, received total compensation of $9.9 million in fiscal year 2012. The breakdown: $1.2 million in base pay; $6.9 million in bonuses; $66,865 in deferred compensation; $19,293 in nontaxable benefits; and $1.6 million in other forms of compensation. In FY 2011, his total compensation was $7.9 million.\n\nAndrew McCulloch, regional president for Kaiser Permanente of the Northwest, received base pay of $396,395, bonuses of $475,033, deferred compensation of $170,537, nontaxable benefits totaling $20,159 and other compensation of $333,016. Added up, his total compensation for FY 2012 was $1.4 million, up from $1.04 million the previous year.\n\nKaiser Sunnyside Medical Center\n\nKaiser Sunnyside is the largest hospital in Clackamas County. First opened in 1975, it expanded in 1983 and again in 2007. It is home to the Northwest Center for Heart and Vascular Care, and is the center for most of Kaiser\u2019s cancer care, neurosurgery and most of the system\u2019s non-emergency inpatient surgeries in the region.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nProfit: $47.4 million, prior year not available.\n\nNet patient revenue: not available.\n\nReported charity care charges: $7.6 million.\n\nProfit margin: 8.82 percent.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 269\n\nInpatient days: 71,431\n\nEmergency department visits: 47,000\n\nOutpatient visits: 60,073\n\nKaiser Westside Medical Center\n\nBuilt at a cost of $344 million, Kaiser Westside Medical Center opened in the Tanasbourne neighborhood of Hillsboro in August 2013. With less than a year in operation, it\u2019s so new that many of the statistics included in this report can\u2019t be compiled for this hospital. Kaiser Westside opened with 126 hospital beds, and planning that should allow it to expand to 174 beds in the future. The 421,000-square-foot building was built to LEED Gold environmental standards.\n\nSalem Health\n\nSalem Health is the organization that supports both Salem and West Valley hospitals. Total revenue across the system was $560.4 million in fiscal year 2012, with a profit of $10.9 million. The system ended the year with $896.1 million in assets, up 4 percent from FY 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Salem Health joined with nine other Marion and Polk county healthcare providers to create Willamette Valley Community Health, one of 15 coordinated care organizations that serves Oregon Health Plan members under Affordable Care Act reforms.\n\nSalem Health also operates Willamette Health Partners, a network of physicians and nurse midwives, and is the largest private employer in the Salem area, with more than 4,300 employees as of late 2012. More recently, the nonprofit has partnered with Moda Health to offer Medicare plans within its region and also has teamed up with Moda, Oregon Health & Science University and Legacy Health to win a contract for Oregon\u2019s public employees.\n\nNorman Gruber, president and CEO of both Salem Health and Salem Hospital, had official base pay of $701,300 during the nonprofit\u2019s 2012 fiscal year, plus $215,925 in deferred compensation, $38,940 in nontaxable benefits and $107,048 in other compensation \u2013 bringing his total remuneration to $1.1 million. Even though his base pay declined (it was $719,941 in FY 2011), his overall compensation climbed (from $877,502).\n\nSalem Hospital\n\nHistorically the busiest emergency room in Oregon, Salem Hospital still ranks near the top \u2013 though in 2012 Providence Portland Medical Center and Providence St. Vincent both reported more emergency department visits.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nProfit: $31.6 million, up 32.2 percent from 2011.\n\nNet patient revenue: $497.4 million, down 10.5 percent.\n\nReported charity care charges: $44.3 million, down 11.3 percent.\n\nProfit margin: 5.8 percent, compared to 4.1 percent a year earlier.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 424\n\nInpatient days: 88,453\n\nEmergency department visits: 93,383\n\nOutpatient visits: 369,798\n\nWest Valley Hospital\n\nWith just six staffed beds, Dalles-based West Valley is the smallest hospital in the state, but is busier than larger institutions that serve some rural communities.\n\nRobert Brannican, chief administrative officer of West Valley, earned $223,055 in base compensation in FY 2012, plus $33,768 in bonus and incentive pay, $26,220 in deferred compensation, $24,194 in nontaxable benefits and $4,322 \u2013 bringing his total pay to $311,559 for the year.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nProfit: $1.3 million, down 12.7 percent from 2011.\n\nNet patient revenue: $19.4 million, down 16.3 percent.\n\nReported charity care charges: $1.96 million, up 1.1 percent.\n\nProfit margin: 6.5 percent, compared to 6.4 percent a year earlier.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 6.\n\nInpatient days: 596.\n\nEmergency department visits: 12,622.\n\nOutpatient visits:70,964.\n\nTuality Healthcare\n\nTuality Healthcare is a nonprofit that runs a small health insurance plan, a health education center and two hospitals, located in Forest Grove and Hillsboro \u2013 employing 1,400 people overall. Tuality Community Hospital of Hillsboro, the larger of the two, was founded in 1918, today Tuality Community Hospital maintains partnerships with OHSU and Pacific University. Although Tuality\u2019s two hospitals have different names, buildings and locations, regulators oversee them as two branches of a single hospital. As a result, both report combined financial data and information to state officials about how many patients they see.\n\nRichard Stenson, president and CEO of the Tuality Healthcare system, received total compensation in fiscal year 2012 of $453,981 - $391,482 in base pay, $24,000 in deferred compensation and $38,499 in nontaxable benefits. His FY 2011 total compensation was $405,293 and retired earlier this year.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nNet loss: $1.1 million, an improvement over 2011\u2019s $5.8 million net loss.\n\nNet patient revenue: $154.4 million, down 9.6 percent.\n\nReported charity care charges: $9.7 million, up 2.7 percent.\n\nProfit margin: Negative 0.68 percent, compared to a negative 3.3 percent margin a year earlier.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 149.\n\nInpatient days: 21,618.\n\nEmergency department visits: 38,840.\n\nOutpatient visits: 257,227.\n\nAsante\n\nMedford-based Asante is a nonprofit healthcare company that owns two hospitals and operates a number of clinics along the Interstate 5 corridor in southern Oregon. Those hospitals \u2013 Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford and Three Rivers Medical Center in Grants Pass \u2013 are at the heart of Asante\u2019s efforts. These hospitals serve an older population base than many of their peers across Oregon. People aged 65 or older accounted for 39 percent of Rogue River patients, and 49 percent of Three Rivers Patients. Asante\u2019s combined system-wide revenue was $532.4 million in fiscal year 2012, up 2.6 percent from 2011. System-wide profit was $52.2 million, up 21.9 percent.\n\nRoy Vinyard, president and CEO of Asante, received total compensation of $1.23 million in fiscal year 2012 - $559,653 in base pay, $187,424 in bonuses, $199,893 in nontaxable benefits, $251,063 in deferred compensation and $34,610 in other compensation. The nontaxable benefits and deferred compensation both reflect forms of income earned in 2012 but not paid out during the fiscal year, according to a footnote on Asante\u2019s federal tax filing. Vinyard\u2019s 2011 total compensation was $1.27 million \u2013 higher than in 2012. Click the chart that accompanies this story for the full breakdown.\n\nAsante Rogue Regional Medical Center\n\nFounded in 1958, Medford-based Rogue Regional Medical Center is Asante\u2019s flagship hospital. Formerly known as Rogue Valley Medical Center, it completed a $6 million expansion to its neonatal intensive care unit in 2011.\n\nAsante\u2019s 2012 fiscal year ran Oct. 1, 2011, through Sept. 30, 2012, and right in the middle of that period Rogue Regional Medical Center experienced a change in executive leadership. Kent Brown stepped down in April 2012 after five years as the hospital\u2019s CEO, and Scott Kelly was named to replace him.\n\nKelly received $230,056 in base compensation in 2012, plus $61,029 in bonuses, $72,709 in deferred compensation, $37,611 in nontaxable benefits and $9,697 in other compensation during fiscal year 2012 \u2013 bringing his total remuneration to $411,102.\n\nThough he did not work the full year, Brown received total compensation of $505,182 in FY 2012 - $293,117 in base pay, $63,587 in bonuses, $114,409 in deferred compensation, $34,069 in nontaxable benefits. In FY 2011, Brown\u2019s total compensation was $476,019.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nProfit: $67.6 million, up 302.6 percent from 2011.\n\nNet patient revenue: $375.8 million, up 6.8 percent.\n\nReported charity care charges: $39 million, up 3.4 percent.\n\nProfit margin: 16.1 percent, up from 4.6 percent a year earlier.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 307.\n\nInpatient days: 67,906.\n\nEmergency department visits: 30,371.\n\nOutpatient visits: 362,279.\n\nThree Rivers Medical Center\n\nGrants Pass-based Three Rivers Medical Center prides itself on its holistic approach to modern medical care. Patient rooms are secluded, and the hospital\u2019s healing garden aims to promote tranquility. The hospital was designated a \u201cBaby Friendly Hospital\u201d by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\n\nThree Rivers CEO Win Howard received total compensation of $387,518 in FY 2012 - $206,567 in base pay, $56,134 in bonuses, $78,901 in deferred compensation, $36,611 in nontaxable benefits and $9,305 in other compensation. His total compensation in FY 2011 was $345,005.\n\nFinances, year 2012:\n\nProfit: $14.8 million, up 65.7 percent from 2011.\n\nNet patient revenue: $127.7 million, down 5.95 percent.\n\nReported charity care charges: $22.6 million, up 5.3 percent.\n\nProfit margin: 10.4 percent, compared to 6.5 percent a year earlier.\n\nSize and scope, as of 2012:\n\nAvailable beds: 107.\n\nInpatient days: 21,185.\n\nEmergency department visits: 32,128.\n\nOutpatient visits: 253,833.\n\nReporter Courtney Sherwood can be reached at csherwood@gmail.com.
