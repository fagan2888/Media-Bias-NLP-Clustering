Medicaid is a huge part of state budgets. Had a similar setback been administered to the Medicare program seniors would have been rioting in the streets. Yet any indignity inflicted upon the medically indigent, and those who care for them, generally goes without public notice.\n\n\n\nConcurring in the 5-4 Armstrong decision, Justice Stephen Breyer, an administrative law aficionado, rhapsodized about the states\u2019 \u201ctime-consuming efforts to obtain public input\u201d on Medicaid cuts submitted to the federal government for approval. That\u2019s an ivory tower view of reality. As the former head of a statewide long-term care association, I can not only attest no such efforts were made, but observe that one had to file a public records request to even find out what a state had submitted in the way of rationale for draconian, budget-driven cuts made by its legislature. Nor were such cuts, however objectively immoral, ever rejected by the federal government Medicaid partner that pays no less than half of a state\u2019s Medicaid costs.\n\n\n\nRecently, in finalizing a 2011 proposed rule, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adopted changes that it pledged will \u201callow us to make informed data-driven decisions and document our decisions when considering proposed rate reductions and other methodology changes that may reduce beneficiaries\u2019 abilities to receive needed care.\u201d This is a welcome development for those who feared the Social Security Act\u2019s guarantee of access to efficient, quality care had been read out of the Act by the Court\u2019s denial of any remedy to enforce it.\n\n\n\nThe rulemaking, focusing so exclusively on access to care, is not perfect. Access can be divorced from care quality, even if CMS suggests its quality initiatives will bear fruit. Surely quality requires adequate funding. Facing penalties that include closure, no nursing home provider, for example, could ever admit that Medicaid payment shortfalls for, say, two-thirds of patients on Medicaid degrade overall facility care quality \u2013 even if such a nexus would seem inevitable. Yet quality cannot simply be flogged out of an underpaid caregiving staff by the government that underpays them. Still, it is encouraging to see the federal government finally committing to apply metrics, and transparency, in assessing the ravages that the states\u2019 budget-driven cuts inflict upon our nation\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\n\n\n\nConsider a state like Wisconsin, where a report this year found Medicaid falling $35.99 per patient, per day short of covering care costs in nursing homes. With very strict state enforcement, it\u2019s a testament to providers that care facilities are even open, let alone providing good care in a state with one of the nation\u2019s 15-most disabled patient populations. Let\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward, which can only help providers like those in Wisconsin. Medicaid payment adequacy needs policing, not an absentee landlord.\n\n\n\nBrendan Williams is an Olympia, WA attorney writing frequently on health care issues.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Let\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward.", "description": "Let\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Let\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward.", "title": "The medically indigent get mistreated again", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/260663-the-medically-indigent-get-mistreated-again", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/260663-the-medically-indigent-get-mistreated-again", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-19T18:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Brendan Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-19T18:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/260663-the-medically-indigent-get-mistreated-again", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Let\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward.", "card": "summary", "title": "The medically indigent get mistreated again"}, "dcterms.title": "The medically indigent get mistreated again"}, "article_summary": "Yet any indignity inflicted upon the medically indigent, and those who care for them, generally goes without public notice.\nAccess can be divorced from care quality, even if CMS suggests its quality initiatives will bear fruit.\nMedicaid payment adequacy needs policing, not an absentee landlord.\nNor were such cuts, however objectively immoral, ever rejected by the federal government Medicaid partner that pays no less than half of a state\u2019s Medicaid costs.\nLet\u2019s hope that CMS becomes a more demanding Medicaid partner going forward, which can only help providers like those in Wisconsin."}
