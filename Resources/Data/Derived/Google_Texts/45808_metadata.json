The two countries have not held a summit since 2007 and, despite Kim\u2019s remarks, the likelihood of one happening again soon is very low given the deep distrust that remains between the two countries.\n\nSome experts in the South, however, cautiously welcomed the possibility of increased talks at lower levels.\n\n\u201cAnimosities between South and North Korea would deepen \u2026 if they fail to improve their political ties and ease military tension through a summit this year,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang at the private think-tank Sejong Institute.\n\nSouth Korean officials say they are basically open to any form of talks. Seoul is waiting for the North to respond to its earlier proposal to hold talks this month to discuss a range of issues needed to prepare for the unification and other issues of mutual concern. South Korea made the proposal earlier this week.\n\n\u201cIf North Korea truly has a will to improve South-North relations through a dialogue, we hope (the North) quickly respond positively to our proposal for talks,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said in a statement.\n\nKim noted that this year is particularly significant because it marks the 70th anniversary of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Both sides claim to hold reunification as a fundamental goal, but a vast gap remains over how that should be accomplished and under what form of government a unified Korea would be administered.\n\nOn domestic policy, Kim indicated he will stick to the country\u2019s longstanding \u201cMilitary First\u201d policy and suggested he would pursue science, technology and economic policies aimed at improving the impoverished nation\u2019s standard of living.\n\nBut he also fell back to familiar accusations that the South and the United States are to blame for tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nKim said South Korea must abandon all plots to launch wars and try to work toward fostering peace, and that Washington must initiate a policy shift by abandoning its \u201chostile policy\u201d and \u201creckless invasion plots\u201d on the North.\n\nThe 30-minute speech was the third Kim has delivered on New Year's Day, and the first after the end of the traditional three-year mourning of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. Some analysts believe that with the mourning period over, Kim will pursue policies that more closely reflect his own personal priorities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in a New Year's speech Thursday that he is open to more talks or even a summit with his South Korean counterpart, a statement welcomed by Seoul, which in turn urged the North to take concrete steps toward normalization of relations.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in a New Year\u2019s speech Thursday that he is open to more talks or even a summit with his South Korean counterpart, a statement welcomed by Seoul, which in turn urged the North to take concrete steps toward normalization of relations.", "title": "Kim Jong-un open to senior-level talks with South Korea", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/1/kim-jong-un-open-senior-level-talks-south-korea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/31/south-korea-north-korea-kim-jong-un-jpeg-03c06.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/31/south-korea-north-korea-kim-jong-un-jpeg-03c06.jpg", "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in a New Year's speech Thursday that he is open to more talks or even a summit with his South Korean counterpart, a statement welcomed by Seoul, which in turn urg", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kim Jong-un open to senior-level talks with South Korea"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Kim Jong Il, South Korea, North Korea, Korea"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf57\"", "article_summary": "South Korean officials say they are basically open to any form of talks.\nNorth Korea has denied involvement, but said the hack was a \u201crighteous deed\u201d and suggested it might have been carried out by sympathizers or supporters abroad.\nSouth Korea made the proposal earlier this week.\n\u201cWe believe we can resume suspended senior-level talks and hold other talks on specific issues if South Korea sincerely has a position that it wants to improve North-South relations through a dialogue,\u201d Kim said in the nationally televised address.\n\u201cIf North Korea truly has a will to improve South-North relations through a dialogue, we hope (the North) quickly respond positively to our proposal for talks,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said in a statement."}
