A recall was issued on Friday for Dove-brand chocolate snowflakes that might be mixed in with Snickers, Milky Way or Twix pieces.

They could be dangerous for customers with peanut allergies who aren't expecting the bag to contain nuts, so the manufacturer is recalling about 6,700 packages sold in the U.S. It could also affect customers with milk or wheat allergies.

For people with life-threatening allergies, it's a significant concern. But recalls for undeclared allergens are not uncommon.

In 2014 there were 43 recalls for undeclared allergens. That's out of a total of 94 recalls of all food products -- everything from meat and poultry to produce and other kinds of food.

Mars Chocolate North America said no "adverse reactions" have been reported, but the company became aware of the issue when a customer found a Snickers inside a bag of Dove Chocolate Assortment Snowflakes.

The company is working to remove the products from store shelves and is encouraging customers with potential allergy issues to return them for a refund.

The items were sold between September 19 and December 1.
