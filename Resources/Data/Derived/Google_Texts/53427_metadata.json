I do so amidst much that fills our culture, from the rattling of sabers in Syria to the worries of climate change and Obamacare. Somewhere in all of this the spirit of the Lord speaks, but whether we hear is the perennial question. Traditionally we teach that God speaks through his word inspired (spirit) and inscripted (word), and in these digital days I guess I should add inscreened (iPhone and Android). My concern, apropos for every blogger I would imagine, is the extent to which our dependence on screens somehow diminishes the word of God incarnate in Christians. How do we experience the body of Christ without bodies?\n\nDespite the insistence that \u201cwe are not our gadgets,\u201d the separation between the physical and virtual is ever blurry.
