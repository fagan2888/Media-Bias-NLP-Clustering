RICHMOND – DeSean Jackson was held out of the Redskins’ “Fan Appreciation Day” practice on Saturday after he experienced soreness in his legs, coach Jay Gruden said.

Jackson spent the entire session standing on the sidelines in a jersey and shorts while his teammates practiced in full pads. He was replaced with the first team by Andre Roberts, who was in turn replaced as a slot receiver by Santana Moss.

“[We’re] just trying to keep him fresh,” Gruden said. “He’s been running a lot.”

Wide receiver Aldrick Robinson experienced soreness in a hamstring that cause him to miss the latter portion of practice, while outside linebacker Rob Jackson also bowed out early with his right shoulder wrapped in an elastic bandage.

Left tackle Trent Williams, who missed Friday’s practices after being kicked in one of his shins, returned and participated fully. Wide receiver Pierre Garçon, who missed time earlier in the week because of a strained hamstring, also practiced.

The Redskins announced 20,477 people attended the two-hour practice, which was the last before New England arrives for three days of joint sessions on Monday leading into Thursday’s preseason game.
