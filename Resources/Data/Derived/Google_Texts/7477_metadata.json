Three years later these posts already feel charmingly quaint. (\u201cI just ordered a Kindle,\u201d Ambinder announced.) And in the beginning they also had the ring of simple truthfulness, less clouded by the pressures of digital self-presentation. \u201cI\u2019ll check on updates at the Times and the Post online,\u201d Coates said. \u201cI generally scan the papers.\u201d Compare this to the 2012 report from Vice columnist Kate Carraway: \u201cI consistently buy The New Yorker; The Atlantic; Harper\u2019s; Vanity Fair; Interview; British and American Vogue; the British, American and Canadian editions of ELLE; Flare; Fashion; Glamour; New York Magazine, Los Angeles magazine, and Toronto Life; BookForum.\u201d To read the past few years\u2019 worth of media diets is to witness the inexorable slide into greater and greater delusion in our virtual self-depictions. \u201cI think I said I read The Atlantic,\u201d Awl editor Choire Sicha told me about his 2011 media diet. \u201cI don\u2019t really read The Atlantic.\u201d\n\nMedia diets tend to fall somewhere between two camps: There\u2019s the Brian Stelter school of warp-speed omnivorous robot information ingestion and the Malcolm Gladwell school of eccentric anachronism. (Reached for comment, Stelter said that CNN has asked him to put the kibosh on interviews until he starts his new gig, but on the subject of media diets, he added: \u201cI like the topic.\u201d) Stelter\u2019s daily news intake basically involves unhinging his jaw and consuming the entire internet: \u201cBetween 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., I start opening what ends up being dozens of browser tabs,\u201d etc etc. Gladwell, meanwhile, makes a virtue of abstaining from the racket: \u201cI subscribe to one person\u2019s Twitter feed: my friend Jacob\u2019s,\u201d he wrote in 2011. Reading a Stelter media diet is in equal parts aspirational and stressful, akin to observing a model of perfect efficiency and up-to-the-minute news literacy. Gladwell\u2019s has the opposite effect: in its confident leisureliness it reassures you that your own metabolism is just fast enough.\n\nThe feature has done so well, said Atlantic Wire editor Gabriel Snyder, that editors have kicked around the idea of an open source media diet that allows anyone to contribute. Traffic-wise, \u201cthey\u2019re not cat videos,\u201d Snyder explained\u2014Aaron Sorkin\u2019s media diet currently has upwards of 57,500 views\u2014but they consistently engage an audience and have become one of the Wire\u2019s defining franchises. After all, they\u2019re designed to capitalize on exactly the kinds of \u201ctechnomedia insecurities,\u201d as Snyder puts it, that leave journalists constantly wondering, in the endless slog of filtering and curating, just how much they\u2019re missing. Interviews are usually conducted over the phone, Snyder said, but he added: \u201cI feel a little uncomfortable talking about our strategy, because it has become incredibly imitated.\u201d\n\nThere is perhaps no clearer evidence of the media diet\u2019s cultural creep than Ad Week\u2019s Information Diet, which targets not newshounds but semi-celebrities with no particular claim to expertise on the subject of reading. Emma Bazilian, who conducts most of the Information Diet interviews, bemoaned the redundancy of her task. \u201cEverybody watches \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cThere was a joke in the office for awhile that people in the art department were getting sick of putting a picture of The New York Times in very single Information Diet. Then there are actors who throw out lofty names like the Economist and Forbes, and you\u2019re like, really?\u201d But Bazilian sees a bright side: \u201cI think if we were interviewing more media people instead of celebrities,\u201d she said, \"the info diets would be even more preposterous.\u201d\n\nIt should be said that these things are not always a festival of ego-indulgence. Some are quite charming and self-aware, a kind of anti-media diet for the media dieting set. Grantland\u2019s Rembert Browne, whose own Diet for the Atlantic Wire included accounts of stealing the print edition of the Times from his neighbors, was initially wary of the project. \u201cSometimes these things can be such a put-on: oh, I have a million magazines to read by 9am,\u201d he told me. So he took the opposite tack. \u201c[Sometimes] I wake up at 9:30 a.m, putz around my apartment for an hour, and then consider leaving at 11 a.m.,\u201d his post proclaimed.\n\nLike a celebrity profile written by the celebrity himself, the media diet\u2019s appeal is in part its illusion of intimacy, the fantasy of access to a private routine. As former Atlantic Wire senior writer Jen Doll, who compiled more than a dozen media diets over the course of her time at the Wire, put it: \u201cIf you were like, hey Brian Stelter, what do you do in the bedroom? he would never tell you, but if you are asking about how he interacts with media, you learn these really fascinating details that aren\u2019t gross.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a back-pat aspect to the exercise, which makes an ideal forum for clubby industry shout-outs. \u201cWhen Gladwell said that he reads The Awl, I was literally like: tee hee!\u201d Sicha recalled. Emma Carmichael, editor of The Hairpin, used her media diet to take inventory of her influences: to name just a few, Hamilton Nolan, Tom Scocca, Caity Weaver, Maria Bustillos, Jim Behrle, Nitsuh Abebe, Jon Caramanica, Carrie Battan, Frannie Kelley, Molly Lambert, Charles Pierce, and Julianne Shephard. (\u201cNames I was dropping,\u201d Carmichael told me.)\n\nSuch is the modern media diet: it enshrines the lamest aspects of our media culture\u2014the status anxiety, the horseracing, the elaborate charade of virtual self-promotion. But still, somehow even the most bogus, bloated diets are fairly irresistible as entertainment. \u201cSure, it can feel like a kind of media bragging, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Doll said. \u201cThe question becomes: even if it is a brag, why is it a brag? What does that teach me about this person\u2019s life?\u201d The answer might be: nothing. But clearly that won't stop the media from judging all the things you read.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The cult of telling people what you read", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Please, media types: Enough of your pretentious lists of what you read.", "title": "Why Do We Care About Malcolm Gladwell's Media Diet?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/b000737125c9db088cb347dafff01889358c2643.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/115664/media-diets-our-most-pretentious-obsession", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/b000737125c9db088cb347dafff01889358c2643.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Why Do We Care About Malcolm Gladwell's Media Diet?", "description": "Please, media types: Enough of your pretentious lists of what you read.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/b000737125c9db088cb347dafff01889358c2643.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Do We Care About Malcolm Gladwell's Media Diet?\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/115664/media-diets-our-most-pretentious-obsession\",\"section\":\"Culture\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-20T02:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":115664,\"author\":\"Laura Bennett\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Culture\",\"Media Diets\",\"Atlantic Wire\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2013-11-20"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe579d\"", "article_summary": "The very first media diets posted to the Atlantic Wire in 2010 came from Atlantic staffers: Marc Ambinder, Jeffrey Goldberg, Ta-Nehisi Coates.\nSuch is the modern media diet: it enshrines the lamest aspects of our media culture\u2014the status anxiety, the horseracing, the elaborate charade of virtual self-promotion.\nReading a Stelter media diet is in equal parts aspirational and stressful, akin to observing a model of perfect efficiency and up-to-the-minute news literacy.\nLike a celebrity profile written by the celebrity himself, the media diet\u2019s appeal is in part its illusion of intimacy, the fantasy of access to a private routine.\n\u201cI think I said I read The Atlantic,\u201d Awl editor Choire Sicha told me about his 2011 media diet."}
