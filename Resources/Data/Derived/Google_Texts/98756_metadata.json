For those who don\u2019t remember when the age-defying actress was a twenty-something on the popular television situation comedy Friends, the Rachel was the affectionate nickname given to Aniston\u2019s most popular hairstyle on the show. Now it\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s Aniston\u2019s braid that\u2019s making all the headlines.\n\nChris McMillan is the man behind Jennifer Aniston\u2019s braid, and it\u2019s no coincidence that he was the man behind the Rachel. The two of them are longtime friends, and McMillan was the first to share a picture of the \u201cartfully messy fishtail braid\u201d online, reported the Daily Mail.\n\nAlthough Aniston jokingly complained that McMillan was the \u201cbane\u201d of her existence for creating the Rachel in the first place, it is obvious that she has a lot of affection for her good friend. It seems like Aniston was the only person who didn\u2019t love the Rachel anyhow. The fun style is probably the most recognizable celebrity hairstyle from the decade of the 1990s, and people will still be talking about it long after everyone has forgotten about Jennifer Aniston\u2019s braid.\n\nAniston\u2019s stylist works out of a Beverly Hills salon, and the petite 45-year-old actress was spotted entering the facility for a new style just last week. She didn\u2019t have to sit at the salon alone because her doting husband-to-be arrived shortly thereafter to keep her company. There\u2019s no word on how long it took McMillan to arrange her hair, but response to the new hairdo has been overwhelmingly positive. That should come as no surprise. Aniston looks adorable no matter what she does.\n\nAccording to E! Online, there could be a very interesting reason for Jennifer Aniston\u2019s fishtail braid. The site theorized that the new look is actually part of a test shoot for an upcoming film role in the flick Living Proof. Either way, the style has just about everyone\u2019s stamp of approval. Congratulations to Chris McMillan. He might have just created a new iconic hairstyle.\n\nAs previously reported by The Inquisitr,Jennifer Aniston has been the subject of recent rumors that she still harbors feelings for hunky ex-husband Brad Pitt. However, that ship sailed a very long time ago, and Aniston seems like the type of woman who knows how to live her life in the present, not the past. Besides, Pitt has settled down quite nicely with Angelina Jolie, and the couple is raising a brood of children together.\n\nHow much do you love Jennifer Aniston\u2019s braid?\n\n[Image via Chris McMillan Instagram]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jennifer Aniston's braid could be the new Rachel.
