Miller this week with using approximately $190,000 in corporate funds for personal expenses and falsifying business records to hide this scheme from investors. The SEC alleged in its civil complaint that Miller submitted, or directed his administrative assistants to submit on his behalf, requests for reimbursement for personal expenses with fabricated business descriptions to conceal the true nature of the expenses.\n\nThe alleged personal expenses were wide-ranging, including meals with friends, weekend getaways, limousine rides for his girlfriend, hotel and spa gift certificates, clothing and accessories, and baseball and theater tickets. In addition to submitting false expense reports, the SEC alleged that Miller misused Polycom\u2019s sales incentive program for additional personal travel and perks, including a trip to Bali.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Polycom learned of Miller\u2019s alleged conduct in May 2013. Following an internal investigation, Polycom\u2019s Audit Committee confronted Miller with specific examples of personal expenses that he had submitted with false descriptions. He subsequently tendered his resignation and Polycom publicly announced in July 2013 that the company had found irregularities in his expense submissions.\n\nMiller was charged with violating the antifraud, proxy solicitation, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and with falsely certifying the accuracy of Polycom\u2019s annual reports, which incorporated its proxy statements.\n\nIn a separate administrative order, the SEC charged Polycom with having inadequate internal accounting controls\u2014by, for example, allowing Miller to approve company purchasing card charges incurred by administrative assistants, even if they were incurred on his behalf\u2014and failing to report Miller\u2019s perks to investors. The company agreed to pay $750,000 to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings.\n\nIn the press release announcing the charges, Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said that \u201cCEOs are stewards of corporate assets and must be held to the highest standard of honesty and integrity\u201d and that the SEC \u201cwill not hesitate to charge executives with fraud when they allegedly use a public company as a personal expense account and hide it from investors.\u201d Of the charges against Polycom, Jina L. Choi, Director of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office, added that \u201c[p]ublic companies are required to implement and maintain effective controls over executive compensation and expenses\u201d and that \u201cMiller allegedly exploited weaknesses in Polycom\u2019s controls to steer himself a series of perks to the detriment of shareholders.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEC charged former Polycom CEO Miller with using 190 thousand dollars in corporate funds for personal expenses and falsifying records to hide this from investors", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/sec-charges-ex-ceo-concealing-personal-use-corporate-funds", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Signaling that it is closely scrutinizing the expenses of senior executives and the internal controls of public companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged former Polycom CEO Andrew M.
