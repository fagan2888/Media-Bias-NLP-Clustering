Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, unveiled his health insurance reform plan just before last Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate.\n\n\u201cBernie\u2019s plan would create a federally administered single-payer health care program,\u201d explains his official proposal. \u201cAs a patient, all you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card. Bernie\u2019s plan means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.\u201d It\u2019s called \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\nSanders claims, \u201cThe typical-middle class family would save over $5,000 under this plan.\u201d Which sounds a lot like President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise that Obamacare would save Americans $2,500 a year. In reality, premium costs have soared while coverage has dropped.\n\nCalifornians long have seen similar state-level plans to Bernie\u2019s \u2013 and have rejected them. In 1994, voters faced Proposition 186. In the official state ballot pamphlet, proponents promised to prescribe \u201cthe health insurance you need and deserve.\u201d It attacked the insurance companies for wasting billions on \u201cpaperwork, advertising, profits, big buildings and big salaries.\u201d\n\nIt insisted, in all capitals, \u201c186 GUARANTEES YOUR CHOICE OF DOCTORS.\u201d\n\nOpponents charged Prop. 186 would not guarantee your choice of doctors and \u2013 another capital letters alert \u2013 \u201cBILLIONS WILL BE SPENT EACH YEAR FOR STATE AND REGIONAL BUREAUCRACIES.\u201d Voters rejected Prop. 186 by a huge margin, 73 percent to 27 percent.\n\nThe vote came shortly after even a Democratic Congress pulled the plug on Hillarycare, First Lady Hillary Clinton\u2019s 1993 attempt to establish national coverage.\n\nSince them, of course, Obamacare was passed in 2010 when Democrats briefly controlled both the House and a filibuster-proof 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. Obamacare was based on Romneycare in Massachusetts, and basically mandated that everybody must have health insurance.\n\nIn the current election, a more cautious Hillary explained, \u201cI want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\u201d\n\nBack to California, current Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl introduced a single-payer bill when she was in the California Legislature from 1994 to 2008. It passed in 2006 and 2008, but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\u201cSocialized medicine is not the solution to our state\u2019s health care problems,\u201d Arnold explained in his 2006 veto message. \u201cThis bill would require an extraordinary redirection of public and private funding by creating a vast new bureaucracy to take over health insurance and medical care for Californians \u2013 a serious and expensive mistake. Such a program would cost the state billions and lead to significant new taxes on individuals and businesses, without solving the critical issue of affordability.\u201d\n\nCritics also said Kuehl\u2019s plan eventually would lead to Canada-style total government control of the medical system to contain costs, a criticism also made of Bernie\u2019s plan.\n\nStrangely, just the next January, Schwarzenegger himself proposed a Romneycare/Obamacare-type medical insurance reform that was rejected by the Democratic Legislature as being too expensive.\n\nSince Kuehl left the Legislature, a similar single-payer proposal was advanced by state Sen. Mark Leno, D-Sacramento. His Senate Bill 810 passed the state Senate in 2012, then died. Since then, reported the Los Angeles Review of Books, he \u201cinformed supporters of his intention not to refile.\u201d\n\nI think similar bills have not advanced because of the large state budget deficits following the Great Recession, the implementation of Obamacare and the likelihood Gov. Jerry Brown would oppose any expensive new program. As California\u2019s experience shows, even a liberal Democratic state isn\u2019t eager to inject itself with a single-payer system.
