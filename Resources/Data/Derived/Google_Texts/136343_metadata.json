Smaller shops would also be permitted to open as long as they like on Sundays as long as local mayors and civil leaders see it as being necessary.\n\nThe move would bring London into line with Paris and New York, where no restrictions on Sunday shopping exist.\n\nStrict anti-Sunday shopping laws came into being in the 19th century, under Queen Victoria.\n\nIn 1986, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tried to do away with them but she met stiff opposition from traditionalists and Christian churches.\n\nTwo decades later a compromise was reached, and most shops are now allowed to open for six hours on Sunday.\n\nOsborne said that the U.K.\u2019s Conservative-led government was persuaded to liberalize Sunday shopping laws to boost the economy. In London alone, Sunday business would create 3,000 more jobs and generate extra income for central businesses by 200 million pounds a year, say economists.\n\nJust before this year\u2019s general election in May, the Conservatives said they had \u201cno current plans to relax Sunday trading laws.\u201d\n\nAt that time the Church of England issued a statement saying, \u201cWe believe that for family stability and community life, as many people as possible should have the possibility of a common day off every week.\u201d\n\nUnder current laws, Christians who object to working on Sundays cannot be fired by their firms. Trade unions are expected to seek assurances that those rights are not eroded under planned legislation that would accompany the change.\n\nLM/MG END GRUNDY", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) Strict laws that limit shopping on Sundays could soon be a thing of the past.", "title": "All-day Sunday shopping may be in the cards in Britain", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/07/day-sunday-shopping-may-cards-britain/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thumbRNS-ENGLAND-SUNDAY070715.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/07/day-sunday-shopping-may-cards-britain/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/07/day-sunday-shopping-may-cards-britain/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) Strict laws that limit shopping on Sundays could soon be a thing of the past."}, "article_summary": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) Christian traditionalists may not like it one bit, but all-day Sunday shopping may be in the cards in Britain.\nOsborne said that the U.K.\u2019s Conservative-led government was persuaded to liberalize Sunday shopping laws to boost the economy.\nStrict anti-Sunday shopping laws came into being in the 19th century, under Queen Victoria.\nThe move would bring London into line with Paris and New York, where no restrictions on Sunday shopping exist.\nTwo decades later a compromise was reached, and most shops are now allowed to open for six hours on Sunday."}
