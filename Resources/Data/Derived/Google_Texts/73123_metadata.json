But in the pint-sized, high-mountain town of Montezuma it also has become grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nThe town and its novice clerk have filed suit against every registered voter in the town, claiming that an election held last spring had numerous errors. The lawsuit filed in Summit County District Court last week lists errors that include numbers that don\u2019t add up and mismatched ballots that had to be patched together with the clerk\u2019s sewing machine.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to command all 61 registered voters in Montezuma to appear in court so the judge can sort out an election mess that the petition calls \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never heard of anything like this,\u201d said Andrew Cole, a spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state\u2019s office. \u201cThis is certainly an unusual step to take.\u201d\n\nSeveral residents have retained a Gunnison attorney to challenge the lawsuit. Luke Danielson filed a motion Tuesday claiming the court has no jurisdiction because the town\u2019s residents haven\u2019t been served with notices to appear in court.\n\nThe matter of a town suing its voters began with a highly controversial election for mayor and town board. It was held April Fools\u2019 Day.\n\nIn a town of 65 residents where a draw for a short straw used to decide who had to serve as mayor, an unprecedented dozen candidates ran for office.\n\nThe hot-button issue that led to this kind of participation involved second-home owners. New Montezuma Mayor Lesley Davis, who was elected by a three-vote margin, claimed that 13 of the voters and at least two of the candidates were not really residents of the town.\n\n\u201cThis is our only option to have an objective judge take a look at the election controversy and give us his advice on how to move forward,\u201d Davis said.\n\nLocals say it is easy to tell who doesn\u2019t really live there by the piles of unplowed snow in driveways. Montezuma sits at 10,200 feet, 5 miles up a dirt road from the Keystone ski resort.\n\nThe lawsuit states that an investigation by the Summit County district attorney\u2019s office found that at least five voters were not qualified to vote because they weren\u2019t residents.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites a number of mistakes in the ballots, including the fact that there were no removable stubs to protect the anonymity of the voters. To try to rectify that, town Clerk Helen Moorman sewed stubs to the ballots but didn\u2019t realize the ballots still contained numbers that gave away voters\u2019 identities.\n\nThe upshot to all the mistakes is that no one in Montezuma knows if the current elected officials were elected properly. No challenge was filed within the 10-day window following the election. Thus, the lawsuit filed by Denver attorney Kendra Carberry. She did not return calls seeking comment.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m paying someone to sue me,\u201d Montezuma voter Chris Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly disturbing that the town is using our tax money to sue us.\u201d\n\nNancy Lofholm: 970-256-1957, nlofholm@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nlofholm", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Town of Montezuma sues all of its voters over flawed election", "title": "Town of Montezuma sues all of its voters over flawed election", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/town-of-montezuma-sues-all-of-its-voters-over-flawed-election/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140813__votep1.jpg", "height": 299}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140813__votep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T19:59:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:17:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The matter of a town suing its voters began with a highly controversial election for mayor and town board.\nThus, the lawsuit filed by Denver attorney Kendra Carberry.\nThe town and its novice clerk have filed suit against every registered voter in the town, claiming that an election held last spring had numerous errors.\nBut in the pint-sized, high-mountain town of Montezuma it also has become grounds for a lawsuit.\nNew Montezuma Mayor Lesley Davis, who was elected by a three-vote margin, claimed that 13 of the voters and at least two of the candidates were not really residents of the town."}
