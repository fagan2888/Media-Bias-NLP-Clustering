We haven’t done one of these in a while, but when Vice President Joe Biden hands you lemons, well…it’s time to have some fun.

Biden’s official Vice Presidential Twitter account sent out this inane photo today of smilin’ Joe, standing next to a picture of himself and holding up a heart-shaped admonishment to American women to buy “Quality Health Care” – which, we can only assume, he erroneously has confused with Obamacare.

Here’s the tweeted photo.

Now, here’s a blank canvas for you to play on. What should Joe have suggested women need on Valentine’s Day?

Keep it (relatively) clean if you want to see your revision on the site. Other than that, have at it. Send your altered images to newstips@personalliberty.com with the subject line “Valentine Joe.”

Please indicate whether you would rather remain anonymous, be credited by name, or provide us with a nickname for the photo credit in your email submission. If we get enough quality submissions, we’ll feature our favorites in a post next week.

Oh, and happy Valentine’s Day. If that’s your thing.
