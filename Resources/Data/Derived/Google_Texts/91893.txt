COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Workers are drilling a mile-long tunnel south of Colorado Springs for the last section of a 50-mile water pipeline.

The Colorado Springs Gazette reported Sunday (http://tinyurl.com/lckeb4k ) the tunnel is 85 feet below the surface and will cross under Interstate 25, two sets of railroad tracks and Fountain Creek.

It’s part of the $841 million Southern Delivery System, which will carry water to Colorado Springs from Pueblo Reservoir. Security, Fountain and Pueblo West will also transport water through the pipeline.

The project includes a $125 million water treatment plant in Colorado Springs.

The tunnel is scheduled to be completed in the first three months of 2015. Colorado Springs Utilities says the system could be ready to operate in 2016 after engineers complete tests.
