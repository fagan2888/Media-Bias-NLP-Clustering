The nine Supreme Court justices were split on a 5-to-4 basis in 10 of the 73 cases they decided this term, according to SCOTUSblog. That was 14 percent of the cases, and the average over ten terms is 17 percent.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said many of this term's 5-to-4 decisions were clearly split on ideological lines.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the 5-to-4 split, the nature of the split is so powerful, so visceral \u2026 it\u2019s like two different worlds that the justices are living in,\u201d she said.\n\nTed Olson, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, and a former U.S. solicitor general who successfully argued Bush v. Gore and the Citizens United cases, said this term also had some \u201cvery, very sharp concurring opinions.\u201d\n\nA concurring opinion is issued when justices agree on how a case should be decided, but have different reasons for reaching the same conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn several of the cases, Justice Scalia read aloud concurring opinions, which you don\u2019t do in the Supreme Court,\u201d Olson said.\n\nHe explained that on \u201cdecision day,\u201d the justice who wrote the majority opinion will typically read a summary of his or her decision. And, occasionally, a justice will read a dissenting opinion. But read a concurring opinion? No.\n\n\u201cIn the years that I\u2019ve been watching the court, I\u2019ve never seen anybody read, or summarize aloud, a concurring opinion,\u201d said Olson, who has argued 60 cases in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nRegarding whether the court was truly split or not, Neal Katyal, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former acting solicitor general with 21 cases in front of the Supreme Court, pointed out that the justices also acted with \u201cremarkable unanimity\u201d this term on several important cases.\n\nHe cited Riley v. California, in which the court ruled 9-to-0 that police have to get a search warrant to search the digital information on a cell phone they find on someone they\u2019ve just arrested.\n\n\u201cThis was a very powerful pro-liberty decision signed by every justice on the Supreme Court.,\u201d Kaytal said.\n\nBut Ifill questioned the extent of the court's unanimity.\n\n\u201cWhile I think it\u2019s true there has been some great unanimity in the judgments, the fundamental tensions that have to do with the kind of issues that probably most people in this room care about, remain,\u201d she said to a full house at the Doerr-Hosier Center.\n\nAnd Ifill questioned the practical effect of the decision in the Riley case.\n\n\u201cIn a place like Baltimore, where I\u2019ve lived for the last 20 years, I don\u2019t think that this is going to particularly stop the police,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cThey are quite able to get warrants fairly easily. They enjoy a tremendous amount of deference from judges.\u201d\n\nShe also said she still had concerns about the court\u2019s 2013 decision in Maryland v. King, which allows the police to swab the cheek of someone they\u2019ve arrested for a DNA sample.\n\n\u201cIf your cell phone\u2019s got information in it, your DNA\u2019s got serious information in it,\u201d she said.\n\nViews on Hobby Lobby\n\nThe panel also reviewed the court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which was released on Monday with an opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito.\n\n\u201cThe question in the Hobby Lobby case,\u201d explained Georgetown\u2019s Katyal, \u201cis whether a closely-held corporation that objects to the part of Obamacare that requires them to pay for contraceptives\" can successfully claim that such a mandate \"violates religious freedom principles that Congress has laid down in a statute called RFRA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\"\n\nApparently so.\n\n\u201cWhat Justice Alito said is, this is a closely-held corporation, they have rights, too, just like ordinary people,\u201d Kaytal said.\n\nOlson observed that the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that corporations have various rights under both the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\n\u201cCorporations have rights against searches, they have rights when the government wants to take property of corporations,\u201d he noted.\n\nNonetheless, Olson said he was \u201csympathetic to the dissent\u201d in the Hobby Lobby case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the line can be drawn,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a minefield for lawyers. What in the world is a \u2018closely-held\u2019 corporation? How many shareholders? How small a number is it?\n\n\u201cAnd does the corporation have religious convictions?\u201d Olson asked. \u201cCertainly its owners do, but they have decided to engage in commerce.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Hobby Lobby case has \u201cgot a lot of issues that people are going to be litigating for years.\u201d\n\nIfill was incredulous about the Hobby Lobby decision.\n\n\u201cMany of us are astonished to learn that for-profit corporations have feelings and sincere beliefs,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she raised the question of whether a company can now refuse to extend benefits to a same-sex or interracial couple based on religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThis decision is absolutely astounding to me,\u201d she said to applause. \u201cThis is a powerfully-disturbing decision that we should all be concerned about.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Aspen Journalism and the Aspen Daily News are collaborating on coverage of the Aspen Ideas Festival.
