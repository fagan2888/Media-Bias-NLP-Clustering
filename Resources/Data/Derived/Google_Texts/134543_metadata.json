However, the article, written by Bryan Burrough, reveals a series of ill-advised managerial and business decisions that plagued the network long before Williams admitted that he had invented one of his memories.\n\nHere are some of the most fascinating tidbits:\n\nComcast didn\u2019t really know how to run a news network:\n\nWhile NBC\u2019s primetime lineup has famously struggled to remain competitive in recent years, NBC News remained an industry leader, thanks to the success of programs like \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d the \u201cToday\u201d show, and \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d with Brian Williams. However, when Comcast took over NBC News with the acquisition of its parent company, NBC Universal, it appointed its own leadership \u2014 including Patricia \u201cPat\u201d Fili-Krushel and Steve Burke, neither had experience in journalism \u2014 and stuff started to hit the fan:\n\n\u201cYou have to understand something about Comcast,\u201d says another recently departed NBC executive. \u201cThere\u2019s practically no attention paid to actual domain expertise\u2014like, zero. The fact of the matter is, in certain businesses, certain things matter. If you\u2019re going to be made the head of a shoe business, you need to actually know that shoes need to be sourced and designed. In the big corporate vision of NBCU, there\u2019s almost no regard for that line of thinking. If you fit into a mold, if you fulfill a loyalty obligation or a don\u2019t-make-waves obligation, or if you can just be pegged into the Comcast pegboard, you get to be in charge of stuff. That\u2019s Pat.\u201d\n\nThey in turn appointed people who didn\u2019t know how much about the division they were running:\n\nOne senior NBC executive said that Deborah Turness, the newly-appointed head of NBC News \u2014 who had never worked in American television (she is British) \u2014 was flailing:\n\n\u201cNews is a very particular thing, NBC is a very particular beast, and Deborah, well, she really doesn\u2019t have a fucking clue. She\u2019s letting the inmates run the asylum. You have kids? Well, if you let them, they\u2019ll have ice cream every night. Same thing in TV. If you let the people on air do what they want, whenever they want, this is what happens.\u201d\n\nAnother former executive said,\n\n\u201cI have seen no evidence [Turness] knows what she\u2019s doing, but in fairness, she walked into a complete shitstorm there. \u2018Today\u2019 is a horror show. Brian Williams? He didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what Deborah Turness says. But this is fundamentally not a Deborah Turness problem. She\u2019s just a symptom of the problem\u2026 This is a Comcast problem.\u201d\n\nBrian Williams doesn\u2019t care about politics \u2014 something even \u201cMeet the Press\u201d legend Tim Russert was wary of\n\nTake the following quote, for example:\n\n\u201cWhat always bothered Tim [Russert] was Brian\u2019s lack of interest in things that mattered most, that were front and center, like politics and world events,\u201d said a source who knew both men. \u201cBrian has very little interest in politics. It\u2019s not in his blood. What Brian cares about is logistics, the weather, and planes and trains and helicopters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "We recap the most incredible details from Vanity Fair's explosive new NBC News report", "title": "Inside the NBC News \u201cnightmare\u201d: How Brian Williams sent Tom Brokaw into \u201cspasms of anger\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We recap the most incredible details from Vanity Fair's explosive new NBC News report", "title": "Inside the NBC News \u201cnightmare\u201d: How Brian Williams sent Tom Brokaw into \u201cspasms of anger\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/07/inside_the_nbc_news_nightmare_how_brian_williams_sent_tom_brokaw_into_spasms_of_anger/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/brokaw_williams.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We recap the most incredible details from Vanity Fair's explosive new NBC News report", "title": "Inside the NBC News \u201cnightmare\u201d: How Brian Williams sent Tom Brokaw into \u201cspasms of anger\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/brokaw_williams.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brian Williams, meet the press, NBC, NBC News, The Today Show, Tom Brokaw, TV, TV news, Vanity Fair", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brian Williams?\nTopics: Brian Williams, meet the press, NBC, NBC News, The Today Show, Tom Brokaw, TV, TV news, Vanity Fair, Media News, News, Politics NewsThe May issue of Vanity Fair features an unforgiving in-depth report on NBC News, focused in particular on anchor Brian Williams\u2019 fall from grace.\nHe didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what Deborah Turness says.\nBut this is fundamentally not a Deborah Turness problem.\nWhat Brian cares about is logistics, the weather, and planes and trains and helicopters.\u201d"}
