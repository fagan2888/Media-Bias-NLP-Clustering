She and her husband receive a health insurance subsidy to help them afford coverage. (Courtesy of Ida and Scott Sievers)\n\nIda Sievers, who was diagnosed with leukemia last fall, had been praying that she wouldn\u2019t lose the $620-a-month government subsidy for her health insurance. So she was delighted Thursday when she learned that the Supreme Court had ruled that the financial aid was legal and could continue.\n\n\u201cThank God, hallelujah. That is so awesome,\u201d said Sievers, a 46-year-old resident of Sioux Falls, S.D. \u201cOh, man! I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019ve been so stressed about it and worried, just every day. I\u2019ve been talking to my husband, \u2018What are we gonna do honey?\u2019 And he just says, \u2018Have faith, honey, it\u2019s gonna be okay.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSievers was one of several consumers who expressed relief that the court sided with the Obama administration in the highly anticipated King v. Burwell decision. Under the administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act, about 6.4 million Americans are receiving financial aid to reduce the cost of health plans sold on the federal insurance exchange. The suit challenged those subsidies.\n\nSievers bought her insurance late last year on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, because South Dakota was one of 34 states that did not set up its own marketplace. She got chemotherapy and is in remission. But she has been too weak to go back to her part-time job as a cashier at a convenience store. Her husband\u2019s job, which involves operating machinery for the city\u2019s street department, is seasonal, has limited hours and doesn\u2019t provide insurance.\n\nAbout 85 percent of consumers who have bought insurance on state and federal exchanges receive a subsidy; the average amount is $272 a month, according to government data. If the court had ruled against the administration, consumers who are receiving subsidies on the federal exchange could have seen their costs for insurance almost triple, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe insurance and hospital industry also hailed the decision.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling ensures that millions of Americans can receive financial assistance from the government to help them continue to afford their health insurance coverage,\u201d said a statement from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, whose members play a dominant role on many exchanges.\n\nFor hospitals, the ruling means they don\u2019t have to worry about consumers losing their subsidized benefits and returning as uninsured patients to the emergency room.\n\nTrinity Health, which operates 85 hospitals in 21 states, helped enroll more than 300,000 people in the exchanges. Chief executive Richard Gilfillan was meeting with the board of directors when news of the ruling broke. Members yelled out \u201cYahoo!\u201d and broke into a loud round of applause, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Catholic nonprofit system estimates that 3.8 million people were at risk of losing their subsidies in states where Trinity has a presence.\n\nMary Kitchens, 50, who lives near San Antonio, is paying less than $100 a month for her subsidized coverage. She began crying when informed of the decision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have words,\u201d said Kitchens, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nSam Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Ron Pollack of Families USA weigh in on the Supreme Court's ruling upholding subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act. (AP)\n\nKitchens, who works in marketing for a real estate firm, is a single mother with four children.\n\nThe decision \u201cmeans that I\u2019ll have options\u201d in obtaining medication and treatment, she said. \u201cIt means I won\u2019t be a burden to my children. Without it, I felt so doomed. . . . Without insurance, you succumb to the disease. And I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d With no subsidy, her bill could have jumped to $500 to $600 a month.\n\nAtlanta resident Ted Souris, 62, describes himself as an \u201carch-conservative\u201d who initially opposed the health law. He said he had mixed feelings about the ruling. He receives what he calls \u201ca pretty hefty subsidy\u201d to buy insurance \u2014 he gets $460 and pays $115 a month for insurance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so against Obama, and I hate that he has any kind of victory,\u201d Souris said, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice that I don\u2019t have to worry\u201d about affording health coverage.\n\nHe said that he doesn\u2019t like getting what he calls \u201ca government handout\u201d but that the law \u2014 and the subsidy \u2014 allowed him to retire early and still have coverage. \u201cI am glad I have the Affordable Care Act, and I appreciate that I got the subsidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoo! I\u2019m relieved,\u201d said Susan Scheffler, who along with her husband owns Nickell\u2019s & Scheffler, a cafe in Alexandria\u2019s Old Town neighborhood. \u201cNow I don\u2019t have to cobble some kind of health care together. . . . I couldn\u2019t afford to pay the [full] policy.\u201d\n\nScheffler, 60, pays $119 for her plan and receives a subsidy of about $500. She\u2019s fairly healthy, but \u201cI definitely need insurance,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I work with knives.\u201d\n\nSonja and Brian Blackham had been bracing for a possible decision against the subsidies \u2014 which they say would have compelled them to drop their insurance. When she heard the Supreme Court news, Sonja Blackham, who is 34, said: \u201cI think it was the right decision and a good thing. I feel like there\u2019s no going back now. . . . I don\u2019t think they can just take it away now.\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake City artists had not been able to afford insurance for years before signing up for a plan under the health law in April 2014. They pay $106 a month; without the subsidy, their premium would be $450.\n\nTom Clark, 63, of Waunakee, Wis., who retired from his longtime job at the Canadian National Railway two years ago, called the decision \u201ca huge weight off my chest \u2014 a huge relief.\u201d\n\nIn the months before coverage was available under the health law, he was cashing in his pension fund to pay the $2,000 monthly premium for a plan that covered his wife, a diabetic who works as a clerk in a liquor store, and one of his two college-age sons.\n\nAfter the family signed up for coverage in December 2013, a subsidy reduced his monthly premium to about $580.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to be about $500 a month short,\u201d Clark said Thursday. \u201cIf I had lost [the subsidies], I don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d\n\nSixteen states and the District have created their own exchanges, but three of them \u2014 Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon \u2014 are using the federal exchange because of technical problems. The remaining 34 states rely to varying degrees on the federal exchange. Pennsylvania, Delaware and Arkansas recently received conditional approval from federal health officials to set up state exchanges, if needed, to keep subsidies flowing.\n\nLenny Bernstein contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People who receive subsidies for health insurance said they can continue to afford coverage.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rob.gebelhoff", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "People who receive subsidies for health insurance said they can continue to afford coverage.", "title": "Consumers express relief after health law ruling: \u2018Thank God, hallelujah\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/consumers-express-relief-after-health-law-ruling-thank-god-hallelujah/2015/06/25/78cb900c-15cd-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/25/Health-Environment-Science/Advance/Images/crop_freeIMG_08621434826571.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "RobertGebelhoff"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/consumers-express-relief-after-health-law-ruling-thank-god-hallelujah/2015/06/25/78cb900c-15cd-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rob.gebelhoff"}, "eomportal-uuid": "78cb900c-15cd-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health"}, "article_summary": "She and her husband receive a health insurance subsidy to help them afford coverage.\nPennsylvania, Delaware and Arkansas recently received conditional approval from federal health officials to set up state exchanges, if needed, to keep subsidies flowing.\n(Courtesy of Ida and Scott Sievers)Ida Sievers, who was diagnosed with leukemia last fall, had been praying that she wouldn\u2019t lose the $620-a-month government subsidy for her health insurance.\nUnder the administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act, about 6.4 million Americans are receiving financial aid to reduce the cost of health plans sold on the federal insurance exchange.\n\u201cI\u2019m so against Obama, and I hate that he has any kind of victory,\u201d Souris said, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice that I don\u2019t have to worry\u201d about affording health coverage."}
