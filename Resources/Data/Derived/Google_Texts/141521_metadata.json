He promised similar violence and disruption will occur at future Trump political events leading up to the election. \u0093Mr. Trump and the Republican leaders who support him and his hate-filled rhetoric should be on notice after tonight\u0092s events,\u0094 on the George Soros funded MoveOn web page. \u0093To all of those who took to the streets of Chicago, we say thank you for standing up and saying enough is enough. To Donald Trump, and the GOP, we say, welcome to the general election.\u0094\n\n\n\nMoveOn has consistently functioned as a lobby group for the policies of the Obama administration, including the disaster of Obamacare and the continuation of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the escalation of the war on terror that has turned America into a police and surveillance state. In 2007 it backed a bill trotted out by then Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to continue financing the occupation of Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe group acts as a front for wealthy Democrats. It was founded with the help of the financier George Soros who donated $1.46 million to get the organization rolling. Linda Pritzker of the Hyatt hotel family gave the group a $4 million donation.\n\n\n\nMany of the Democrat and \u0093progressive\u0094 candidates supported by MoveOn have failed to be elected since the organization was formed in 1998.\n\n\n\nThe violent demonstration in Chicago on Friday may represent a precursor to the sort of activity the organization will engage in as it tries to \u0093shut down\u0094 its political enemies and elect either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nOn Friday night many of the protesters shouted \u0093Bernie!\u0094 and held placards announcing their support for the socialist Democrat.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Macedonia news, Balkan news, health articles,stock exchange,loans, elections, world news, credit ratings,money,credit,politics,environment, health.", "description": "Internet News Agency with daily news from Macedonia, the Balkans and Around the world.
