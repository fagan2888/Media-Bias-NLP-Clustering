Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz represents everything wrong with the Republican Party, and he has no real experience to prove his worth. All he has is shock value. Cruz has fought Obamacare, which is strange since he is covered by it, and he denies climate change, probably due to being given $951,882 by oil and gas industries since 2011.\n\nHe lashed out at the gay community, saying a \u201cjihad \u2026 is being waged (against) people of faith who respect the biblical teaching that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nThis biblical bully is either delusional or a hustler. If \u2018President Cruz\u2019 happens, America will be the laughing stock of the world.\n\nThe GOP may find salvation in fiery Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, an unconventional Republican and a true libertarian at heart.\n\nSupporting drug policy reform and, according to CNN, same-sex marriage, he is making an effort to do things differently. He could be just another politician unwilling to forgo partisanship or connect with new constituents. He isn\u2019t.\n\nOn the other hand, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is just another mass-produced politician made off of a faulty design.\n\nHe is astonishingly the only Hispanic currently running \u2013 Cruz doesn\u2019t count \u2013 but that is his only significant trait. He spews the age-old GOP template that makes him commonplace.\n\n\u201cA new American century\u201d is not what he seems to be offering.\n\nThe GOP is rounded out by Dr. Ben Carson, who said \u201cObamacare is the worst thing since slavery,\u201d and Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, who was forced to resign after her company lost half of its stock.\n\nWhat\u2019s odd about the GOP candidates, besides their idiosyncrasies, is they are either junior senators or have never held political office.\n\nClinton, however, has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that tramples virtually every Republican front-runner.\n\nJeb Bush, though not officially running yet, is the only Republican who might be able to match Clinton\u2019s experience.\n\nAnother Bush vs. Clinton matchup will be too much d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for this unfortunate country.\n\nClinton has been a strong voice for women and same-sex rights recently, and after our first black president, a woman in office will continue the fight against the white patriarchy.\n\nThe nomination, in many eyes, is hers already.\n\nBut Clinton has a problem: a reputation as a cold, calculating politician. According to Time Magazine, she voted for the Iraq War and expanded the drone program. These actions are proof of the hawkish, hyper-aggressive nature many opponents have attributed to her.\n\nThis country is ready for a female president, but we need an honest one. Actions speak louder than words, and Clinton\u2019s are but a whisper compared to her challenger, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders is a rare politician who has been consistent in his views and is privy to the average working-class American.\n\nHe has a longer history of experience than Clinton, refuses to accept campaign contributions from corporations and does not believe in negative campaign ads.\n\nSanders will get a lot of heat for being a self-declared democratic socialist, because everyone knows socialism equals communism and communism equals the end of America.\n\nBut this won\u2019t slow him down.\n\nSanders has a twelve-step plan that will create 13 million jobs, reduce climate change, make college affordable and reform the tax system. A Sanders vs. Paul election could help push America into a new age of politics, something the country desperately needs right now.\n\nOr they all might just be full of crap. But citizens must participate. Sanders wants a political revolution, and we should give it to him.\n\nOpinion columnist Anthony Torres is a political science sophomore and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2016 presidential election has begun and diverse candidates are up and running for presidential office.
