The patent system is being roundly condemned as a barrier to public health which must be brought to heel. Efforts range from urging the NIH to misuse the march in provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act to control drug costs to \u201cA simple way for government to curb inflated drug prices\u201c in The Washington Post advising that the \u201cgovernment patent use\u201d authority be invoked to take drugs deemed too expensive. The next step in the campaign is coming from the United Nations.\n\nImproving access to needed medicines for those suffering the ravages of disease in developing countries is a serious issue. There are many factors contributing to the problem including poor transportation systems, lack of available health care and education, endemic poverty, trade barriers, systematic corruption and, of course, the cost of drugs. Yet the U.N. Secretary General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines is focusing on the patent system as the source of the problem. The report is due next month.\n\nThe Panel received predictable statements from both sides of the debate, with one notable exception. The U.S. Department of State undiplomatically pointed out the crucial flaw in the study: \u201d We question the premise that the rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules, and public health are \u201cmisaligned\u201d\u2026\n\nState offered a devastating indictment:\n\nThe Panel has been tasked with examining only two pieces of the larger puzzle, and will be doing so in isolation, pursuant to terms of reference which are based on a description of the problem stated in a way that suggests predetermined outcomes. The United States is concerned that by conducting such a narrow review, the report issued by the Panel may be imbalanced and of limited use, or even counterproductive in building consensus among stakeholders and national governments.\n\nThe Panel\u2019s recent press release \u201cProtests, Patents and Patients Dominate Debate In Johannesburg\u201d shows that the Department\u2019s concerns are justified. According to the release, the Panel is to \u201caddress the policy incoherence between intellectual property laws and access to medicines.\u201d Participants praised several \u201calternatives and/or changes to the current patent based system\u201d being considered. One of the \u201cnew ideas\u201d prominently cited is having government, not industry, pay for R&D. \u201cThis means no monopolies on medicines that are financed with public money. In order to realize this, we need to find a way to work together as a global community so that all governments will contribute fairly to developing R&D costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a worse idea than putting a consortium of governments in charge of drug development\u2013unless it\u2019s putting the UN in charge.\n\nThe statement from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization illustrates why the focus on intellectual property as the source of the problem misses the mark:\n\nAt the outset we note that the scope of the call for contributions appears to be narrower than the apparent mandate of the Commission. In fact, the call presupposes that the concept, and advances that notion that IP protections are inconsistent with public health. We disagree with this assessment and we believe that the facts prove this assertion to the contrary. For example we note that while 95% of essential medicines, as defined by the WHO, are off patent, still one third of the world\u2019s population does not have reliable access to them and, in parts of Africa and Asia, that is true for half the population. And despite all the current mechanisms in place to facilitate no-or-low costs access to non-patented HIV medicines, only 15.8 million of the estimated 36.9 million people living with HIV globally (about 43%) were accessing treatment in 2014. Moreover, despite the wide availability of no-or-very low cost non-patented HIV medicines, in at least 14 African countries, 80% or more of people who were estimated to be eligible for treatment under the WHO guidelines were not receiving antiretroviral therapy as of 2013. First-line treatments for killer diseases like malaria and TB are available as generic products at very low cost, and yet many people are denied access to them. And finally, according to the WHO, and estimated 649 million people, or about 50% of the population in India do not have regular access to the hundreds of non-patented drugs on India\u2019s EML. Despite its large domestic generic drug industry, India\u2019s investment in health as a percentage of its GDP has averaged around 4% for the last decade. India\u2019s current level of 4.5% is one of the lowest figures in the world ranking it below such countries as Haiti and Ethiopia.\n\nThe solution to these problems isn\u2019t destroying the system the world depends on for creating new drugs. And it\u2019s not an accident that most come from the United States.\n\nDrugs are only made in a handful of countries with strong patent systems. The reason is simple: the costs and the risks of bringing a new drug to market are enormous. If you\u2019re looking to get rich quick, drug development isn\u2019t for you. Developing a drug takes more than 12 years, costing an average of $2 billion per drug. For every 5,000 drugs tested, perhaps 5 will proceed to clinical trials, and one may reach the market. Of these, perhaps 20% will turn a profit, and they must pay for the whole system. This effort can only be justified if resulting products are patent protected so they cannot be freely copied around the world. And unlike other countries, many of our new drugs come from small companies and start ups. Patents are crucial for them to receive risk capital and to compete against well established competitors.\n\nThe US enjoys an unparalleled university and federal laboratory research system, an important source of new treatments. However, publicly funded inventions are more like ideas than products. The task of turning these discoveries into drugs that can alleviate human suffering falls on the private sector, which spends many times in development what the government spent supporting the underlying research. If the product is unsuccessful, the company alone takes the hit. Without a strong patent system, no business can afford to assume this burden.\n\nBefore passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, federally funded drug discoveries simply wasted away in the laboratory, benefitting no one. It\u2019s no coincidence that after Bayh-Dole injected the incentives of the patent system into the process that federally supported inventions suddenly became drivers of new therapies, new companies and even a new industry\u2013 biotechnology\u2013 in which we lead the world.\n\nBlaming the patent system for the problem of access to drugs is more than misguided, it\u2019s destructive. The poster boy of bad behavior, Martin Shkreli, who raised the cost of Daraprim 5000% overnight wasn\u2019t using the patent system for his misdeeds. Shkreli knew that rival companies would not go through the lengthy, expensive FDA approval process for a drug with a limited patient population. When the UN launches a study on the costs of regulation, please let me know.\n\nThe Department of State offered some important points to ponder:\n\nThe High-Level Panel\u2019s mandate is too narrow to address the many and often inter-related barriers to access to safe, effective, and affordable medicines. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies four main factors contributing to access to medicines: l) the rational selection and use of medicines, 2) affordable prices, 3) sustainable financing, and 4) reliable health and supply systems. None of these factors are being directly studied by the Panel. With regard to affordable pricing of medicines, the WHO has identified numerous considerations, including pricing and procurement policies, taxes, markups and tariffs, and other national policies (or lack thereof) that ultimately result in higher costs for consumers and for health systems.2 In fact, even common, essential, off-patent medicines often do not achieve their intended health impact due to supply and manufacturing issues\u2026\n\nState \u201cstrongly\u201d advises the UN to \u201cincorporate all relevant factors into a meaningful analysis of why people in low and middle income countries do not have the access to medicines that we all believe is desirable and necessary.\u201d\n\nGood advice. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s taken. It\u2019s advice we should incorporate into our own debate on how to make important new therapies more accessible for those who need them.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTE: For more information on this topic please see UN Panel on Access to Medicines Should Ensure Innovation by Preserving Market Incentives, by Dr. Kristina Lybecker, published on IPWatchdog.com on February 15, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The UN's High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines is to address the policy incoherence between intellectual property laws and access to medicines.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law", "description": "The UN's High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines is to address the policy incoherence between intellectual property laws and access to medicines.", "title": "The UN's Misguided Focus on Patents as the Cause of Drug Shortages - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 350, "identifier": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flags-united-nations.jpg", "height": 234}, "updated_time": "2016-05-15T10:24:46-04:00", "url": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/05/15/uns-misguided-focus-patents-cause-drug-shortages/id=69184/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/flags-united-nations.jpg", "description": "The UN's High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines is to address the policy incoherence between intellectual property laws and access to medicines.", "card": "summary", "title": "The UN's Misguided Focus on Patents as the Cause of Drug Shortages - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Biotechnology", "tag": "un", "published_time": "2016-05-15T09:15:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-15T10:24:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The patent system is being roundly condemned as a barrier to public health which must be brought to heel.\nThe poster boy of bad behavior, Martin Shkreli, who raised the cost of Daraprim 5000% overnight wasn\u2019t using the patent system for his misdeeds.\nBlaming the patent system for the problem of access to drugs is more than misguided, it\u2019s destructive.\nWithout a strong patent system, no business can afford to assume this burden.\nYet the U.N.
