Fox News host Greta Van Susteren took President Obama back to law school to remind him of the Constitution amidst the imminent Iranian nuclear deal.

Van Susteren went ‘off the record’ to remind the so-called “constitutional law professor” that he alone does not have the power to single-handedly make a deal with Iran, according to the Constitution.

“Article two, Section two, Clause two of the Constitution includes the treaty clause, which empowers the president to propose and negotiate agreements between the United States and other nations which become treaties after – yes, after – the advice and consent of a super majority of the U.S. Senate,” Van Susteren said. “Now, that means the president has no power to make a deal solely with Iran. Solely alone, he can’t do that.”

Her response came after she played a clip of White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest saying the administration is hesitant to come to Congress with an agreement before doing so with Iran.

“Ultimately, we can’t put in place an additional hurdle for that agreement to overcome here at the eleventh hour,” Earnest said at a press conference.

“Hurdle? That clause is not a hurdle,” Van Susteren responded. “Josh Earnest may think it trivial, but I don’t. It’s the Constitution, to be respected and adhered to.”
