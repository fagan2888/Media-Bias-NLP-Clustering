In a YouTube video, Rian recounts her incentive: an appendectomy a year earlier.\n\nAlso featured are Patricia and Jon, who were repeatedly turned down by insurers because of their pre-existing conditions \u2014 a practice made illegal by the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Since the two previously spent over $200,000 in out-of-pocket health-care expenses, they were pleased to get covered \u2014 with financial help \u2014 through wahealthplanfinder.org.\n\n\u201cFor many young adults, the thought of getting health insurance occurs only after an accident or illness,\u201d said Michael Marchand, director of communications at the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. \u201cThese new ads use humor and pop-culture references to get people\u2019s attention as well as make a serious message stick.\u201d\n\nThe Exchange has also made deals with hockey teams across the state, including the Everett Silvertips, the Seattle Thunderbirds, Spokane Chiefs and the Tri-City Americans.\n\nRoller-derby campaigns will take place during games by Apple City, Atomic City, Bellingham Roller Betties, Dockyard Derby Dames, Jet City Roller Girls, Oly Rollers, Rodeo City, and the Slaughter Country Roller Vixens.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a cheery note for those of us who could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered \u201cyoung\u201d or \u201cinvincible\u201d \u2014 A new report from the Commonwealth Fund says enrollees\u2019 health status, not age, is more important to keeping premiums low and stabilizing the state marketplaces.\n\nSo fit boomers count, too! We aren\u2019t targeted in campaigns, I\u2019m guessing, because boomers are already signing up in droves, despite premiums that are often triple those for young adults. Sara Collins, Commonwealth\u2019s vice president for health-care coverage and access and author of the report, said very likely the role of young adults has been over-emphasized, and lower-than-expected enrollment this year won\u2019t trigger market failure.\n\nEven so, the best bet for getting those healthy folks is to sign up young people, and that\u2019s what the exchange aims to do. \u201cIn order to break through and reach new audiences, we have to be in unexpected places,\u201d Marchand says.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "If you attend roller derby and ice hockey you may see something new: signs, booths and videos encouraging you \u2014 particularly if you're young \u2014 to sign up for health insurance through Washington Healthplanfinder, the state exchange marketplace.
