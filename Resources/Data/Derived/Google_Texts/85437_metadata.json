Sanderson, program director at the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project, which was one of the groups that filed the complaint, said that sounded like slow-walking the investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty troubled by these comments. He seems to be already setting the groundwork for delaying investigating the mistakes by blaming the children form not remember the names of the officers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the document they sent contained 116 complaints, listed the names of the children involved, and said they showed a \u201csystematic and systemic\u201d problem with the treatment of the kids.\n\nMs. Sanderson said even if the individual officers couldn\u2019t be identified, the commanding officers at the facilities could \u2014 and she said those where repeated complaints have been lodged should get scrutiny.\n\nAll sides agree that the situation is testing the limits of the government\u2019s abilities.\n\nMr. Koskinen described a number of firsts for some of the children \u2014 including the medical checkups.\n\nHe said most of the children \u201chave never been treated by a doctor of a clinician until they\u2019ve been encountered by us.\u201d\n\nAn internal Border Patrol memo from last month pointed to a number of problems, including the inoculations the children require.\n\nAt the time the Defense Department, which was offering some of its facilities to house the children, had insisted the children wait seven days from inoculation before they could enter military bases. That was a problem because U.S. law requires Homeland Security to turn the children over to social workers within three days.\n\nOne Border Patrol agent this week told The Times that agents trained to patrol the border were instead doing \u201cbabysitting\u201d guard duty.\n\nThat agent said some of the more extreme reports included having to separate teenaged boys and girls trying to engage in sex.\n\n\u201cThe agents have to keep an eye on them also to make sure no shady happenings happen between the females and the males,\u201d the agent said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Friday that many of the illegal immigrant children his agents are encountering trying to slip across the U.S.-Mexico border have never even seen a doctor before.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Friday that many of the illegal immigrant children his agents are encountering trying to slip across the U.S.-Mexico border have never even seen a doctor before.", "title": "Border Patrol changing diapers, heating baby formula for surge of children", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/13/border-patrol-change-diapers-heat-baby-formula/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/30/2e054fab22dfa815550f6a70670056b8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/30/2e054fab22dfa815550f6a70670056b8.jpg", "title": "Border Patrol changing diapers, heating baby formula for surge of chil", "description": "Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Friday that many of the illegal immigrant children his agents are encountering trying to slip across the U.S.-Mexico border ha", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Caitlin W Sanderson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec5e\"", "article_summary": "One Border Patrol agent this week told The Times that agents trained to patrol the border were instead doing \u201cbabysitting\u201d guard duty.\nHe described scenes of Border Patrol agents changing diapers and heating baby formula in order to care for some of the youngest children, and said agents are being asked to do things way beyond their skill set \u2014 particularly for so many of the agents who are young, single men.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been down there, a lot, and spent a lot of time and I\u2019ve seen these agents doing incredible things,\u201d he said.\nHe said most of the children \u201chave never been treated by a doctor of a clinician until they\u2019ve been encountered by us.\u201dAn internal Border Patrol memo from last month pointed to a number of problems, including the inoculations the children require.\nThat was a problem because U.S. law requires Homeland Security to turn the children over to social workers within three days."}
