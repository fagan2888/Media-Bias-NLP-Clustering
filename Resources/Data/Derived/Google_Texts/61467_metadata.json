That puts Texas\u2019 Medicaid reimbursements among the bottom quintile of all states, at a time when Medicaid enrollment in the state is rapidly growing.\n\nBut in fiscally conservative Texas, many lawmakers are reluctant to spend more public money on Medicaid, which already constitutes about 25 percent of state expenditures. Several Republican leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have said the program is broken and in need of an overhaul, not expansion. In the belt-tightening 2011 session, lawmakers cut reimbursement rates for most providers by 10 to 20 percent.\n\n\u201cDo you know how much money, and what amount, would be needed to fix the problem?\u201d Sen. Juan \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa, D-McAllen, asked at Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\nThe physicians at the hearing did not provide a dollar amount.\n\nThe fight to raise payments to doctors is one waged every two years by doctors\u2019 groups, who say the program\u2019s reimbursements are so measly that they cover less than half of physicians\u2019 costs. But this year the terms of the battle are different, thanks to federal health reform.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, federal funds made available under the Affordable Care Act boosted Medicaid reimbursements to Medicare levels. The result, according to the Texas Medical Association, was a 5 percent jump in Medicaid participation.\n\nThat money dried up at the beginning of this year, and doctors\u2019 groups say another drop in physician participation is imminent. In 2000, 67 percent of Texas physicians accepted all new Medicaid patients, whereas today\u2019s number is closer to 34 percent, according to the medical association.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Texans receiving Medicaid coverage continues to grow, largely driven by a wave of sign-ups in the wake of the Affordable Care Act. The state\u2019s health agency predicts that Medicaid enrollment will rise from 4.1 million to 4.3 million over the next two years.\n\n\u201cYou do what you have to do to take care of your patients, and I think it\u2019s in our blood to do that,\u201d said Doug Curran, a family physician from Athens. \u201cBut at the same token, my family needs attending to as well.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
