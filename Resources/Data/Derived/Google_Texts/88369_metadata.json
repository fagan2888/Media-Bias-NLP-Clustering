Two such clinics recently opened on Milwaukee\u2019s north side, thanks to Children\u2019s Hospital and Marquette University.\n\nToday, 10-year-old Earron Davis is at the clinic on 23rd and Burleigh for his first visit. A nurse takes his height and weight, temperature and blood pressure, and checks his vision.\n\nAs Earron reads the letters, his mom, Jessica Peterson, says she's thrilled.\n\n\u201cI actually like it because it\u2019s within walking distance and it\u2019s convenient, being able to have a neighborhood clinic cause there\u2019s so many kids in the neighborhood that I\u2019m sure has to go far out to see a doctor, so this is very, very, very convenient,\u201d Peterson says.\n\nAfter a few minutes, nurse practitioner Susan Thaller walks into the exam room to begins to go over the medications Earron is taking. He has asthma, just like many of Thaller\u2019s young patients.\n\nShe says a good number also have chronic bronchitis and increasingly, obesity. Among her adult patients \u2013 the clinic sees them too \u2013 common issues are diabetes and hypertension. But Thaller says typically an urgent care need first brings all ages, through the door.\n\n\u201cAn illness issue, a sports physical, needing immunizations. Nurse practitioners as a family nurse practitioner I offer a holistic assessment and then primary care. In that assessment, mental health issues, growth and development issues,\u201d Thaller says.\n\nIn poor neighborhoods like this one, you find great healthcare needs, but few primary care doctors. That\u2019s because many residents are on Medicaid. Since the government program doesn\u2019t fully reimburse physicians for the cost of services, few are willing to take on a large Medicaid population. So poor people often have to travel miles for a medical appointment, and many don\u2019t have transportation.\n\nIt was a concern neighbors shared with Children\u2019s Hospital during focus groups a few years ago.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s listened to the residents and realized that there was a need to provide closer access to health care in this community so here we are today,\u201d says Kerry Yamat, who oversees the clinic on Burleigh and the other new one at the Northside YMCA.\n\nDonations covered set-up costs, while a foundation has pledged to cover the clinics\u2019 projected losses for at least three years. When it comes to staffing, Children\u2019s Hospital provides administrative services. Marquette supplies nurse practitioners who have advanced training and the ability to prescribe drugs.\n\nNurses are more affordable than physicians. The model is spreading, especially in underserved areas.\n\nTine Hansen-Turton is chief executive officer of the National Nursing Centers Consortium. She says there are about 250 nurse-managed clinics throughout the country, and the number is growing.\n\n\u201cWith Obamacare, there was for the time ever a definition in federal law around what a nurse-managed health clinic is, so now they are recognized, federally,\u201d says Hansen-Turton.\n\nShe says the Affordable Care Act also set aside $15 million to support new clinics. As for the quality of care, Hansen-Turton says the nurses can capably manage much of the care doctors normally provide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s comparable to physician care. In some cases, better, and that has a lot to do with the relationship, and when you\u2019re embedded in the community and have a strong relationship with people that live in a community, you also build up a different kind of trust and are able to see patients more often,\u201d Hansen-Turton says.\n\nBack on Milwaukee\u2019s north side, nurse practitioner Susan Thaller says there\u2019s been a great response to the new clinic so far, and even though it\u2019s targeted for people who live nearby, patients are coming in from all over the city.\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital and Marquette hope to eventually hire more staff and extend the clinics\u2019 evening hours. Eventually nursing students may become involved.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "A new brand of health clinic is cropping up more frequently across the country - clinics run by nurses.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wuwm.com/post/new-brand-nurse-led-health-clinics-target-milwaukees-underserved", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wuwm/files/styles/medium/public/201401/boy.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "A new brand of health clinic is cropping up more frequently across the country - clinics run by nurses.", "title": "New Brand of Nurse-Led Health Clinics Target Milwaukee's Underserved"}, "story_id": 262239967, "twitter": {"site": "@WUWMradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WUWMradio"}, "author": "Erin Toner", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "New Brand of Nurse-Led Health Clinics Target Milwaukee&#039;s Underserved"}, "nid": 22272, "datePublished": "2014-01-13", "keywords": "WUWM News, healthcare, nurses, nurse-led clinics", "wordCount": 703, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0625\"", "article_summary": "A new brand of health clinic is cropping up more frequently across the country - clinics run by nurses.\n\u201cWith Obamacare, there was for the time ever a definition in federal law around what a nurse-managed health clinic is, so now they are recognized, federally,\u201d says Hansen-Turton.\nAfter a few minutes, nurse practitioner Susan Thaller walks into the exam room to begins to go over the medications Earron is taking.\nTwo such clinics recently opened on Milwaukee\u2019s north side, thanks to Children\u2019s Hospital and Marquette University.\nNurse practitioners as a family nurse practitioner I offer a holistic assessment and then primary care."}
