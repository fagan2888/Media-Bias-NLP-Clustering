Fresh from a marathon debate that drew catcalls, praise, criticism and bombastic pronouncements from friends and foes alike, the GOP presidential hopefuls will soon be on the same stage together. Again. Such is the nature of the never-ending campaign, a full 14 months before election day even dawns - though some observers are saying they are developing an early case of debate fatigue. On Friday, 11 hopefuls showed up at the Heritage Action\u2019s Take Back America Forum in Greenville, South Carolina \u2014 hosted by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham and Jim DeMint, former senator and president of the Heritage Foundation. Mr. DeMint describes the forum as \u201ca definitive event for conservative activists.\u201d\n\nOn hand for the big doings, which lasted six hours: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush; Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul; Carly Fiorina; Govs. Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal plus Rick Santorum. Each candidate, Mr. Needham says, will have 25 minutes on the podium to answer some strategic questions.\n\n\u201cVoters saw glimmers of a policy debate,\u201d says Mr. Needham. \u201cFriday\u2019s forum gave the candidates an opportunity to truly articulate their vision for America, and how they would make Washington work for hardworking Americans and not the well-connected special interests.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Carly Fiorina takes on Trump: Women recognize his sexism\n\nBut Iowa is also calling.\n\nThe sold-out Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s \u201cfall family banquet\u201d and presidential forum gets underway Saturday evening at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines, attracting the aforementioned Mssrs. Trump, Cruz, Walker, Jindal, and Santorum plus Mike Huckabee, Sen. Lindsey Graham and George Pataki. \u201cAs in the last presidential caucus cycle, Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition serves a vital role in helping inform and mobilize faith-based voters,\u201d the organizers say.\n\nOh, but it\u2019s complicated. Mr. Walker will also appear at the two-day Mackinac Island GOP Leadership Conference in Michigan \u2014 an event that also features Ms. Fiorina, Mssrs. Bush, Paul, Cruz and Gov. John Kasich. And somehow, Mr. Bush will also appear at a University of Georgia tailgate party in Athens on Saturday afternoon.\n\nSEE ALSO: Carly Fiorina draws interest from undecided Ohio Republicans\n\nTHE NOT SO BUSY DEMOCRATS\n\nDemocratic hopefuls are, well, rustling around in the next 48 hours as well. Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Portland, Maine on Friday and New Hampshire on Saturday, where she just might run into Sen. Bernard Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, both in the Granite State. All will attend the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention in Manchester, along with sundry festivals and town halls across the state.\n\nTHE SUNDAY TALK DERBY\n\nThe busy Mrs. Clinton makes her very first appearance on the Sunday talk shows as a 2016 presidential candidate on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d with John Dickerson. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a very late start,\u201d points out Jeffrey Meyer, a media analyst with Newsbusters.com.\n\n\u201cWhile Clinton has so far avoided interviews with the ABC, CBS, and NBC Sunday shows, 18 other presidential candidates have made a total of 106 appearances since January 1, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, topping the list with 12,\u201d the meticulous Mr. Meyer says.\n\nFrequency of talk show appearances does not necessarily correspond with one\u2019s standing in the presidential field, however. Mike Huckabee is third on the list, followed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, Gov. John Kasich and Rick Perry \u2014 who\u2019s already dropped out of the race.\n\nGETTING RICKETY\n\nSo much for all the happy talk about the Affordable Care Act. Between the end of March and the end of June, 29 states plus the District of Columbia lost Obamacare enrollees, based on an Americans for Tax Reform analysis of recent data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In total, Obamacare exchanges had a net loss of 238,119 enrollees in the three-month period.\n\nEnrollment across all 50 states and DC was 9.9 million as of June 31, down from 10.2 million enrollees at the end of March, the analysis notes. Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey, Indiana and Arizona lost the most \u2014 though 20 states posted increased enrollment numbers.\n\nIn addition, another 423,000 were not legally enrolled due to failure to produce sufficient documentation proving citizenship or immigration status and were thus removed.\n\n\u201cThe poor performance of the program is bad news for the long-term sustainability of the federal and state Obamacare exchanges given their reliance on paying enrollees to meet costs,\u201d the analysis says.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to an economy of scale that just isn\u2019t working,\u201d says Ryan Ellis, tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform, a nonpartisan coalition of taxpayers who oppose all tax increases.\n\nSTILL A JOKE\n\nDespite flagging favorability numbers, Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton continues to make light of what\u2019s now known in the press as the \u201cemail scandal.\u201d Gallup, in fact, discovered that the public most associates her name with variations on the email theme, rather than the more noble aspects of her campaign. But still, she jokes about those old State Department emails.\n\n\u201cMost people have gotten bored after reading ten or twelve, because they\u2019re boring, I mean, they\u2019re kind of \u2018What are we doing, how do we do it, when\u2019s the meeting. Now, the most significant one that has come to light, because, you know, this was a really important issue, and I had to talk about it on the email,. And that is, I was asked if I could get gefilte fish into Israel in order for it to be used in time for Passover,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon during her appearance Wednesday night.\n\nHeadlines should read \u201cGrandma knows how to use email,\u201d Mr. Fallon suggested.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor Sale: Redstone Castle, built on 154 acres in 1897 of hand-cut sandstone in Redstone, Colorado; 23,357 square feet.
