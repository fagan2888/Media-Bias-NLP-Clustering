On Thursday, Paychex (PAYX) again did what it has done around this time in recent years — it boosted its dividend. This time, the company increased its shareholder dividend by 11% to 42 cents a share. That’s the biggest increase in three years. It hiked by single digits in the prior two years.

The new quarterly rate represents an increase of 20% from the amount paid about a couple of years ago.

The company will pay the dividend Aug. 20 to shareholders of record Aug. 3. Investors need to buy shares three days before the record date get the dividend.

On an annual basis, Paychex now pays $1.68 a share, which works out to a yield of about 3.5%. Its yield is larger than the S&P 500, which stands at around 2%.

Paychex has the second-biggest yield among the dividend-paying stocks in IBD’s commercial services outsourcing industry group. Only Crawford & Co. (CRDA), a low-priced and thinly traded issue, has a slightly higher yield, at about 3.8%.

Atlanta, Ga.-based Paychex, which provides human resource and employee benefits outsourcing services, tends to pay out the bulk of its net income to stockholders as dividends. In its fiscal year 2015 ended May 31, the company paid out $552 million, or 82% of net income, as dividends. That’s roughly unchanged from 81% in fiscal 2014 and 84% is fiscal 2013.

Earlier this month, Paychex reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 44 cents a share, up 10% from a year ago. That marked its best performance in five quarters and matched views. Sales grew 8% to $692.2 million. Revenue from jumped 16% for the quarter. The company is benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare.

Paychex’s stock is forming a flat base with a 51.82 buy point. But the stock has seen some volatility and has met resistance at its 10-week moving average.
