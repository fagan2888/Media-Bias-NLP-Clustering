Indeed, Missouri\u2019s numbers eerily reflect the nationwide averages in the 16 categories.\n\nFor instance, there has been improvement in these areas: Children not attending pre-school (from years 2007-09 to 2011-13, the latest data available); the percent of 8th-Graders not proficient in math; and teenagers who abuse alcohol or drugs.\n\nThere are 10 areas that show improvement, but there are five that show worsened conditions and one area that was unchanged from the last version of the KIDS COUNT report.\n\nThat unchanged category is \u201cChildren Without Health Insurance,\u201d which in 2013 stood at 7 percent (98,000 children), the same percentage that was seen in 2008.\n\nChild advocates would argue that number would have decreased significantly if the Missouri General Assembly would have approved an expansion of the Medicaid program offered in conjunction with the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GOP-controlled state legislature has argued that an expansion of Medicaid would bring too large a price tag in later years.\n\nWhile Missouri\u2019s numbers closely overwhelmingly reflect the numbers nationwide, there is one category that shows an interesting disparity, that is both positive yet troubling: \u201cThe Number of Children Living in Households With a High Housing Cost Burden.\u201d\n\nNationally, in 2013 36 percent of children (26,339,000) were in households with a high housing cost, down from 39 percent in 2008.\n\nIn Missouri, 30 percent of children were in homes facing a high-cost burden. That\u2019s much better than the 36 percent national average, but it\u2019s also up from the level of 2008 (29 percent). More than 400,000 Missouri children were in households faced with a high housing cost burden.\n\nIn terms of the number of children living in poverty, Missouri\u2019s figure mirrors that at the national level, 22 percent. Missouri\u2019s figure is up 3 percent from 2008 while the national level is up 4 percent.\n\nOne positive area shows Missouri doing a better job in getting more children into pre-school. The 2013 rate of children not attending preschool was 56 percent, 1 percent better than in the report covering 2009.\n\nNationally, the rate was 54 percent, 1 percent worse than in 2009.\n\nLocal factors\n\nThe KIDS COUNT report also examines quality-of-life issues on a county-by-county basis, as well as nationally and statewide.\n\nIt measures conditions in a number of areas outside the primary 16 examined for the overall rankings.\n\nFor instance, the Average Annual Wage/Salary comparison of several local counties shows Gasconade County lower than most adjoining counties in 2013.\n\nFranklin County had an average of $37,186 while Gasconade County had an average of $30,003.\n\nMaries County was lower at $28,164, but Osage County\u2019s was higher at $30,274.\n\nLikewise, Crawford and Phelps counties posted higher average wage figures than Gasconade County at, respectively, $34,220 and $34,565.\n\nAcross the Missouri River, Montgomery County\u2019s average is lower at $29,945, but Warren County\u2019s average is significantly higher at $33,311.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: More findings of the 2015 KIDS COUNT report will be published in the coming weeks.)", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "vfb-version": "2.7.5", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "article_summary": "(Editor\u2019s note: More findings of the 2015 KIDS COUNT report will be published in the coming weeks.)\nLocal factorsThe KIDS COUNT report also examines quality-of-life issues on a county-by-county basis, as well as nationally and statewide.\nThe 2015 KIDS COUNT report shows Missouri ranking 26th among the states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 smack in the middle \u2014 when comparing the progress or regression in the various categories.\nMore than 400,000 Missouri children were in households faced with a high housing cost burden.\nThere are 10 areas that show improvement, but there are five that show worsened conditions and one area that was unchanged from the last version of the KIDS COUNT report."}
