The 100-page report recommended that GOP lawmakers do a better job listening to female voters, remind them of the party\u2019s \u201chistorical role in advancing the women\u2019s rights movement,\u201d and fight against the \u201cso-called War on Women.\u201d Look no further than recent GOP-led efforts to expand gun rights on college campuses under the guise of preventing campus sexual assault as evidence that conservative lawmakers have failed to take their own advice.\n\nToday, lawmakers in at least 14 states are pushing forward measures that would loosen gun regulations on college campuses. In the last few days a number of them have seized upon the growing public outcry over campus sexual assault to argue that carrying a gun would prevent women from being raped. (So far they\u2019ve been silent on how we might prevent young men \u2013 who, of course, would also be allowed to carry a gun \u2013 from attempting to rape women in the first place.)\n\nRepublican Assemblywoman Michele Fiore of Nevada recently told The New York Times: \u201cIf these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them. The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.\u201d (Really? Hot little girls?) And as the Times highlighted, Florida Representative Dennis Baxley jumped on the \u201cstop campus rape\u201d bandwagon recently when he successfully lobbied for a bill that would allow students to carry loaded, concealed weapons. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a person that\u2019s raped because you wouldn\u2019t let them carry a firearm to defend themselves, I think you\u2019re responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. People aren\u2019t raped because they aren\u2019t carrying firearms. They are raped because someone rapes them. What a sinister new twist on victim blaming. As if anything positive could come from adding loaded weapons to the already toxic mix of drugs, alcohol, masculine group think, and the rape culture endemic in college sports and Greek life on campuses around the country.\n\nThese lawmakers have appropriated the battle cry of students who are demanding more accountability from academic institutions to prevent and respond to campus sexual assault. It\u2019s a vain attempt to advance their own conservative agenda of liberalizing gun laws. This is an NRA agenda, not a women\u2019s rights agenda. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, each of the lawmakers who have supported such legislation has received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). They have enjoyed endorsements from the NRA during election years and some \u2013 including Fiore and Baxley \u2013 received campaign contributions from the organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican lawmakers are trying to loosen gun regulations in schools across the country.
