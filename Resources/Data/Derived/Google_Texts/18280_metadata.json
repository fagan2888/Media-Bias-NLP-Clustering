Since inception, it\u2019s been a key source of complaint for GOP lawmakers and even some Democrats.\n\nCritics of the definition say companies are cutting employees\u2019 hours to stay under the 30-hour cap. Those who worked between 30 to 40 hours were typically thought to be part-time workers, and some companies say they cannot afford to provide them health coverage or pay fines for flouting the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s health care law changes the American work week in a way that hurts the income of workers and discourages new hiring by local businesses,\u201d said Rep.
