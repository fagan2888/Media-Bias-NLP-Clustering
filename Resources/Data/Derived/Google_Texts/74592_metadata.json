My wife, who stays home with our children, is not covered. What would the penalty be if we opt to not get coverage for my wife next year?\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: The fine is often cheaper, but it depends on your income.\n\nObamacare requires all individuals to have health coverage next year, or pay a penalty. The rule is often called the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d but the federal government prefers \u201cindividual shared responsibility provision,\u201d a subtle reminder that the new insurance policies will only work if enough healthy people pay into them.\n\nBut there are some exceptions to the provision:\n\n\u2022 Individuals who can\u2019t find plans costing within 8 percent of their incomes\n\n\u2022 People who make so little they don\u2019t file taxes\n\n\u2022 Individuals with a coverage gap of three or fewer months\n\n\u2022 People who don\u2019t have legal immigration status\n\n\u2022 Indian tribal members and their dependents\n\n\u2022 Members of certain religious sects or health care sharing ministries\n\n\u2022 Individuals who are incarcerated\n\nIf individuals don\u2019t qualify for an exemption, they\u2019ll have to pay $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is more, when filing their 2014 taxes. The fine increases to $695 or 2.5 percent in 2016.\n\nWhether those figures are cheaper depends a lot on income and household size. If Hayes makes $55,000 to support his family of eight, his wife qualifies for substantial subsidies on the Covered California insurance exchange. Annually, he could pay as little as $1,032 to cover her. The 2016 fine for Hayes would cost $1,375.\n\nBut as income increases, subsidies decrease and the annual cost of insurance slowly ticks above the cost of paying the fine.\n\nHow exactly do you pay the fine? It will be folded into your tax filings beginning with tax year 2014.\n\nThe Orders: Know all the rules.\n\nHere\u2019s an important reminder if you\u2019re thinking about skirting the individual mandate: You can\u2019t necessarily enroll once you become sick.\n\nYes, the law says insurance companies can\u2019t withhold coverage because of pre-existing conditions, but you can only get insurance during open enrollment periods. In other words, if you get sick in April, you could have to wait until October to get coverage.\n\nAnd a rule of thumb: Explore all of your options before taking the penalty. The Affordable Care Act has extended access to affordable coverage in ways many people might not expect.\n\nIf Hayes makes just $1,000 less than the example I used above \u2013 so $54,000 \u2013 his family would qualify for Medi-Cal, which is significantly cheaper than paying the fine.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: How Do College Students Fit Into The Obamacare Exchanges?\n\nVoice of San Diego is a nonprofit that depends on you, our readers.
