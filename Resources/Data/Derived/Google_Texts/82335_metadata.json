Well, in the same way, you can't make a healthy portfolio out of five stocks that all do the same thing. You need different types of stock players to fill different needs.\"\n\n\n\nAnd looking at both exceptional players and exceptional stocks Cramer draws more than a few analogies.\n\n\n\nReceivers\n\n\"In football, your wide receivers are the fastest men on the field, the guys you throw the ball to when you're trying to make a big play,\" Cramer explained. \"So, in stock terms, that equals something with momentum, something that can still have a ton of upside.\"\n\nOn the field, Cramer likes Detroit's Calvin Johnson, also known as Megatron, and in his portfolio Cramer likes Amazon.com.\n\n\n\n\"Just like Johnson, Amazon is right now coming back from an injury\u2014the company's most recent quarter, which it reported at the end of July and which many people considered disappointing. But the stock has started to rebound.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course, Amazon's trading at 104 times next year's earnings estimates, and that's absurdly expensive by virtually any metric out there, even when the company has a 36% long-term growth rate. By any sane standard, Amazon is overvalued, but you know what? You could have made that same argument sixteen months ago when this was a $194 stock, and now it's at $294. Amazon's got a cult following, and it's shown a consistent ability to make those big plays that chew up yardage,\" Cramer said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "If you\u2019re a football fan as well as a stock investor, you\u2019re in luck.
