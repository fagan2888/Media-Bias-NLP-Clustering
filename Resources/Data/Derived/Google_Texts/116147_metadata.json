It\u2019s just bad timing.\n\nNew baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has been a Chatty Cathy since he officially took office. He wants to speed up the game, maybe consider stopping fielding shifts, and has basically let everyone know that he is open for business and everything is on the table \u00ad\u2014 including reinstating Rose, the all-time Major League Baseball leader in hits.\n\n\u201cI have heard from his lawyer, and I do anticipate having a conversation about that,\u201d Manfred told ESPN Radio last week when asked about reinstating Rose. \u201cI\u2019ve been very careful not to say anything about the merits of it because ultimately I\u2019ll have to make a decision there. It\u2019s a conversation I\u2019m expecting to have.\u201d\n\nBut just a few days earlier, Manfred also opened the door to baseball dropping its opposition to legalized sports betting when he was asked on ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside The Lines\u201d about the growing movement \u2014 particularly in New Jersey \u2014 for legalized sports betting.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s talking about a situation where anyone, any way involved with the play of the game on the field, would be subject to rules different than they are today,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cThe ban on that type of involvement would stay in place.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, gambling, in terms of our society, has changed its presence,\u201d Manfred continued. \u201cThe legalization. And I think it\u2019s important for there to be a conversation between me and the owners about what our institutional position will be.\u201d\n\nWell, you can\u2019t do both.\n\nYou can\u2019t relax your \u201cinstitutional\u201d position on legalized sports betting, maintain your staunch institutional position on gambling for those in the game, and then welcome back the poster boy for your \u201cban on that type of involvement.\u201d You can\u2019t make a monumental shift in your position on sports betting among the fan base and then relax your standards inside the game to welcome back an icon who bet on his own team as Reds manager.\n\nAgain, bad timing for Rose.\n\nThis time, though, it\u2019s not his fault.\n\nThe last time Rose was close to be reinstated \u2014 so close that a plan appeared to be in place for him to come clean and for then-commissioner Bud Selig to lift the ban \u2014 Rose sabotaged it by instead staging an early release of his 2004 book, \u201cMy Prison Without Bars,\u201d with a Sports Illustrated excerpt where Rose finally admitted what was in the John Dowd report \u2014 that he indeed bet on his team while managing.\n\nIt is the most mortal sin in baseball \u2014 it nearly destroyed the game in the midst of the 1919 \u201cBlack Sox scandal\u201d \u2014 and Rose made his confession for profit instead of standing next to Selig in a press conference that would have paved the way for a lifetime ban issued by then-commissioner Bart Giamatti in 1989 to be lifted. He also did so the week that the National Baseball Hall of Fame election results were being released.\n\nThat scuttled any chance that Rose\u2019s ban would be lifted as long as Selig was commissioner.\n\nIt also brought to light that behind the scenes, among Hall of Famers, Rose\u2019s presence would not be embraced. Ferguson Jenkins, who had been a supporter, wrote a letter to Rose after his book came out that said, \u201cKnowing what I know now, I will never support your reinstatement to the game or your bid for the Hall.\u201d Former teammate and friend Joe Morgan was outraged at Rose\u2019s blatant mercenary decision to profit from his confession.\n\nThose were some of his supporters. Privately, a number of Hall of Famers have never supported Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame bid, which complicates any reinstatement.\n\nThere would have to be some sort of special exemption made for Rose for him to appear on the Baseball Writers Association of America Hall of Fame ballot, since it would be well past the 15-year period a candidate can be on the ballot once he becomes eligible five years after retirement. As it stand now, his future in Cooperstown would rest in the hands of the Hall\u2019s \u201cGolden Committee\u201d \u2014 formerly known as the Veterans Committee \u2014 and it\u2019s uncertain, at best, Rose would receive a warm welcome there.\n\nFirst, though, there is Manfred, who has signaled that baseball may relax its position on legalized sports betting outside of the family.\n\nIf and when he does that, you can\u2019t send the same message inside the family. The message then, if anything, has to be tougher, more diligent, about the influence of gambling inside baseball.\n\nThat\u2019s not the message reinstating Pete Rose delivers.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manfred, the new commissioner of baseball, has basically let everyone know that he is open for business and everything is on the table \u00ad\u2014 including reinstating Rose, the all-time leader in hits, and supporting legalized sports betting.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Manfred, the new commissioner of baseball, has basically let everyone know that he is open for business and everything is on the table \u00ad\u2014 including reinstating Rose, the all-time leader in hits, and supporting legalized sports betting.", "title": "LOVERRO: Rob Manfred can\u2019t have it both ways with Pete Rose, sports betting", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/loverro-rob-manfred-cant-have-it-both-ways-address/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/9da67dfca3fefb2d650f6a706700efff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/9da67dfca3fefb2d650f6a706700efff.jpg", "description": "Manfred, the new commissioner of baseball, has basically let everyone know that he is open for business and everything is on the table \u00ad\u2014 including reinstating Rose, the all-time leader in hits, and s", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "LOVERRO: Rob Manfred can\u2019t have it both ways with Pete Rose, spo"}, "Author": "Thom Loverro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Pete Rose, Rob Manfred, Espn Radio"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e7b\"", "article_summary": "Privately, a number of Hall of Famers have never supported Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame bid, which complicates any reinstatement.\nHe also did so the week that the National Baseball Hall of Fame election results were being released.\nThat scuttled any chance that Rose\u2019s ban would be lifted as long as Selig was commissioner.\nFirst, though, there is Manfred, who has signaled that baseball may relax its position on legalized sports betting outside of the family.\nNew baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has been a Chatty Cathy since he officially took office."}
