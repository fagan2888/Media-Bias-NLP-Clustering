police are investigating the report of two men trying to lure children into their vehicle Saturday evening in east Wichita.

The incident happened around 7 p.m. in the 300 block of North Oliver, near 2nd Street. A woman told officers two men in a gold passenger vehicle approached her 8- and 9-year-old daughters.

One of the men allegedly offered the girls candy in an attempt to get them in the car. When the girls refused, the car took off.

The children said a short time later, the car returned and the two men were watching them. That's when the girls told their mother.

Officers were unable to locate the vehicle.

The suspects are described as two Asian men between the ages of 30 and 40 in a gold passenger vehicle. Anyone with information is asked to call police.
