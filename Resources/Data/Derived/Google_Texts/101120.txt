After the White House declared total victory when Congress approved the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that it’s time to “disband the Republican Party” and start all over again.

“The country was just sold down the river again by your very Republican Party,” an infuriated Limbaugh began, before reading a headline from The Washington Times in which the White House declared total victory in the budget battle.

“There was never a battle,” he said. “None of this was opposed.”

President Obama got pretty much everything he wanted in the spending bill, including a fully funded Planned Parenthood, increased spending for illegal immigrants and Syrian refugees and delaying implementation of the Obamacare “Cadillac Tax” for two years.

Limbaugh noted that Republicans voted in record numbers to take over both chambers of Congress in order to push back at Obama’s agenda.

“And now the Republicans have the largest number of seats in the House they’ve had in Congress since the Civil War,” he said. “And it hasn’t made any difference at all. It is as though Nancy Pelosi is still running the House and Harry Reid is still running the Senate. ‘Betrayed’ is not even the word here. What has happened here is worse than betrayal. Betrayal is pretty bad, but it’s worse than that.”

He called it “out-and-out, in-our-face lying” by GOP candidates on the campaign trail, and their betrayal and lies are what led to the candidacy of Donald Trump.

“If Donald Trump didn’t exist and if the Republican Party actually does want to win someday, they’d have to invent him,” Limbaugh said. “It’s just mind-boggling when you figure out everything that has been granted Obama. All the money, the tax increases, the Cadillac plans in Obamacare. All kinds of punitive things in Obamacare, delayed yet again so that people will not be made aware of the pain and suffering Obamacare’s gonna cause.”
