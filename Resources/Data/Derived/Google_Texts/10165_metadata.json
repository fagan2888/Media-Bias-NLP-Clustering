Ebtesam Ahmed, CC BY 2.0.\n\nDenver television station and ABC affiliate KMGH-Channel 7 planned to air the first commercial advertising the sale of recreational cannabis, but has since put its plans on hold. The two possible ads, which were slated for a 10:35 p.m. slot on July 20 during Jimmy Kimmel Live, are now being debated by E.W. Scripps\u2019 lawyers.\n\nAccording to the Denver Post, KMGH-Channel 7 planned to allow a 15-second spot for The Green Solution, a marijuana dispensary company with a few locations throughout the state, and Neos, a company that sells vape pens filled with cannabis oil. The commercial for The Green Solution was going to feature several real people (in place of actors) speaking in familiar Denver locations and holding signs that read, \u201cI am a construction worker\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a purchasing manager,\u201d with a final sign saying \u201cI shop at The Green Solution.\u201d\n\nThe ad for Neos was also intended to be centered on Colorado as opposed to the actual product, with healthy young people shown hiking and dancing. A printed graphic would then caution viewers that the product was only for Colorado residents, 21 and older.\n\nBoth ads were selected by KMGH-Channel 7 because they complied with Colorado\u2019s strict advertising laws, which state that people featured in a commercial cannot be using the product, and that the ad must be aired after 10 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no product at all. You\u2019re not allowed to show any cannabis at all. It\u2019s more brand-focused,\u201d Olivia Mannix of Cannabrand, the marketing company representing Neos, told The Cannabist. \u201cIt shows various shots of recreation in Colorado: People camping, on a hike, portraying a cannabis consumer who is active and healthy.\u201d\n\nMannix also notes that Neos chose the 10:35 p.m. spot to make sure the targeted audience would be 21 and older. \u201cABC provided us with statistics from Nielsen, the leading global information and measurement company, stating that the affected area\u2019s audience is more than 90 percent over the age of 21,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter acquiring this data, we knew we had found the perfect space for televised cannabis marketing.\u201d\n\nAs for representatives from KMGH, Brad Remington, the vice president and general manager of the channel, told the Denver Post that they were ready to show the advertisement. \u201cIn the old days, Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke slept in separate beds. Now we have Viagra ads. Things evolve,\u201d he said.\n\nRemington also noted that the station is being very smart about the way it presents the advertisement, and which advertisements will be permitted. \u201cThe world is changing, evolving, and we need to constantly take a look at things. After careful deliberations, we have elected to accept ads from what is now a legal business in Colorado and apply some of the same restrictions and standards that we do for similar adult products, like liquor,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the ABC affiliate\u2019s willingness to air these ads, they still seem to have run into some legal trouble. While it is difficult to say why the advertisements have been put on hold, it is likely because of complications that inevitably arise when a substance still regarded as illegal on a federal level is advertised on federally licensed airwaves.\n\nIn the meantime, other stations in Denver seem to be straying away from Channel 7\u2019s bold decision. When talking to Mark Cornetta, the head of KUSA-Channel 9, the Denver Post found that they had no plans to schedule any cannabis commercials for their ad spots.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say if the federal government decides to legalize marijuana,\u201d says Cornetta.\n\nIt seems that for now, strides in advertising cannabis, even in states where recreational use is legal, will have to be put on pause.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tvs, first, recreational, marijuana, advertisement, put, hold, colorado", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "TV's first recreational marijuana ad was slated to air July 20, but has since been put on hold.", "title": "TV's First Marijuana Ad Has Been Put On Hold", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tvs-first-recreational-marijuana-advertisement-put-hold-colorado-343696", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TV's first recreational marijuana ad was slated to air July 20, but has since been put on hold.", "title": "TV's First Marijuana Ad Has Been Put On Hold", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tvs-first-recreational-marijuana-advertisement-put-hold-colorado-343696", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/18/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-18T18:03:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T18:03:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "TV's first recreational marijuana ad was slated to air July 20, but has since been put on hold."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb86\"", "article_summary": "TV's first recreational marijuana ad was slated to air July 20, but has since been put on hold.\nDenver television station and ABC affiliate KMGH-Channel 7 planned to air the first commercial advertising the sale of recreational cannabis, but has since put its plans on hold.\nA printed graphic would then caution viewers that the product was only for Colorado residents, 21 and older.\nIt seems that for now, strides in advertising cannabis, even in states where recreational use is legal, will have to be put on pause.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say if the federal government decides to legalize marijuana,\u201d says Cornetta."}
