The string of altercations also resulted in calls to police, who subsequently arrested several juveniles.\n\n\u201cA subcommittee was formed after the fights to let new immigrants be recognized and be better known, (dispersing) information about our heritage and why we\u2019re here,\u201d said Walter Lanwi, a Marshallese immigrant and a member of the Next Steps Committee, which supports the Marshallese organizationally and financially in community outreach efforts. \u201cRacial tensions got better in the school because the student body came together and said, \u2018What we did was wrong.\u2019 Now, everybody is doing their part.\u201d\n\nKealakehe principal Wilfred Murakami agreed with Lanwi\u2019s assessment of the state of racial tensions at the school, which led to the ugly series of incidents four years prior.\n\n\u201cI would say things have improved quite a bit,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cWhat those incidents did was create a better understanding of the diversity and the need for tolerance here on the campus.\u201d\n\nThe Marshallese are in need of more than tolerance, however, as thousands of immigrants make new lives in Hawaii. Those needs went hand in hand with celebration as the collective purpose of Friday night\u2019s Constitution Day event, which culminated in athletic tournaments for Marshallese youth in the Old Kona Airport Park over the weekend.\n\nThe Department of Health, the West Hawaii Community Health Center and Early Head Start services were among several institutions in attendance to help new arrivals to the island acclimate to life in the United States.\n\nJasmin Kiernan, Director of Innovation and Transformation at the West Hawaii Community Health Center as well as a member of the Next Steps Committee, said immigrant Marshallese face issues ranging from language barriers to a lack of economic opportunities to concerns about adequate healthcare.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeking a better life here,\u201d Kiernan said. \u201cThey want to improve their situation, and language is the first factor. There\u2019s also some stereotyping going on, and we need to dispel that. The more they become a part of the community, the more inclusive we will be. This event is to promote their culture and help facilitate and empower the Marshallese community to come together and find their voice.\u201d\n\nAllied Forces occupied the Marshall Islands during World War II, and in subsequent years, the United States conducted nuclear weapons testing in the area. Kiernan said aside from depriving many Marshallese of their way of life and forcing them from their homes, side effects from nuclear fallout \u2014 such as a susceptibility to thyroid cancer \u2014 are still present within the community today.\n\nKiernan added that healthcare laws, which used to allow all Marshallese immigrants to apply for Medicaid, have been changed. Now, that option is only available for the elderly, children under the age of 18 and pregnant women.\n\nThus, coverage under the Affordable Care Act is essentially the only option for most Marshallese, but acquiring and managing it is a complicated process, particularly for segments of the population unfamiliar with the concept of medical insurance, let alone its intricacies.\n\nThat is where people like Lanwi factor into the equation. Lanwi travels to churches and homes throughout the West Hawaii corridor, dispersing information about deadlines and helping his countrymen and women sign up for coverage.\n\nLanwi\u2019s efforts are emblematic of the value of community that is pervasive within the Marshallese culture, and which groups like the Next Steps Committee \u2014 which assisted with the staging of Constitution Day \u2014 are trying to help the Marshallese community turn to their advantage.\n\nReligion and Marshallese music were heavily emphasized in Friday night\u2019s ceremonies, and speeches were given in or translated to both English and Marshallese. Despite any stereotyping or racism, Lanwi said his community\u2019s cultural values will not change, and the preservation of Marshallese social norms will persist within its Hawaiian factions.\n\nLanwi, who arrived on the Big Island as an adult, added that in his years here, racism has not been a problem he\u2019s encountered consistently. But he\u2019s adopted a sensible and straight-on approach for when it does rear its ugly head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a human being like you,\u201d Lanwi said. \u201cWhen I see racism, I confront it. The color of your blood is the same color as mine.\u201d\n\nEmail Max Dible at mdible@westhawaii today.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News,topnews,", "og": {"site_name": "Hawaii Tribune-Herald", "description": "KAILUA-KONA \u2014 Local politicians, educators and representatives of various Hawaii Island institutions gathered together with members of the Marshallese community at Kealakehe High School Friday night to celebrate the Republic of the Marshall Islands Constitution Day.", "title": "Marshallese community celebrates Constitution Day at Kealakehe High, site of 2012 racial tensions", "url": "http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/marshallese-community-celebrates-constitution-day-kealakehe-high-site-2012-racial", "image": "http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/sites/hawaiitribune-herald.com/files/field/image/3456527_web1_Marshallese_0018.jpg", "type": "article"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "KAILUA-KONA \u2014 Local politicians, educators and representatives of various Hawaii Island institutions gathered together with members of the Marshallese community at Kealakehe High School Friday night to celebrate the Republic of the Marshall Islands Constitution Day.", "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "KAILUA-KONA \u2014 Local politicians, educators and representatives of various Hawaii Island institutions gathered together with members of the Marshallese community at Kealakehe High School Friday night to celebrate the Republic of the Marshall Islands Constitution Day.\nThe Department of Health, the West Hawaii Community Health Center and Early Head Start services were among several institutions in attendance to help new arrivals to the island acclimate to life in the United States.\nDespite any stereotyping or racism, Lanwi said his community\u2019s cultural values will not change, and the preservation of Marshallese social norms will persist within its Hawaiian factions.\nLanwi\u2019s efforts are emblematic of the value of community that is pervasive within the Marshallese culture, and which groups like the Next Steps Committee \u2014 which assisted with the staging of Constitution Day \u2014 are trying to help the Marshallese community turn to their advantage.\nLanwi travels to churches and homes throughout the West Hawaii corridor, dispersing information about deadlines and helping his countrymen and women sign up for coverage."}
