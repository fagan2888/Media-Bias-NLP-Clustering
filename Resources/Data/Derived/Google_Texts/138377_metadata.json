(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nHere\u2019s a surprisingly complex question: Can President Obama recover, politically speaking? And if so, what would that recovery look like?\n\nThe president is mired in the worst extended polling dip of his five years in office, dragged down by a series of scandals (National Security Agency spying, IRS targeting) and fumbles (the rollout of HealthCare.gov).\n\nGallup\u2019s month-by-month breakdown of Obama\u2019s 2013 job-approval numbers shows a steady decline, from 52 percent in January to 41 percent by December. The Washington Post-ABC News poll pegged Obama\u2019s job-approval rating at 55 percent in January 2013; he ended the year with just 43 percent of Americans approving of the job he was doing as president.\n\nObama is now far closer to the approval trajectory of George W. Bush during his second term than that of Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan. Pew Research Center data show that a year into their second terms, Reagan\u2019s approval rating stood at 62 percent, while Clinton\u2019s was 58 percent. Obama was at 41 percent as of November 2013, more on par with Bush\u2019s 36 percent in November 2005.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to get to Reagan or Clinton levels from where Obama is now, especially since there are more problems looming for Obamacare,\u201d said Glen Bolger, a partner at the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies. \u201cHowever, to get back to the low 50s, the president needs to rally with independent voters. Betting on that happening, however, is like betting on Andy Reid in the playoffs \u2014 not advisable!\u201d\n\nDigging into the numbers largely bears out Bolger\u2019s assessment. The 12-point drop in Obama\u2019s approval rating from January 2013 to December 2013 was attributable not to Republicans (17 percent approved in January, 13 percent in December) but rather to precipitous declines among independents (down 14 points) and, interestingly, Democrats (down 15 points).\n\nThe dip among Democrats explains why Obama has of late focused on economic inequality (unemployment insurance, a minimum-wage increase, etc.) in his speeches and policy proposals. Those moves are aimed at rallying the party\u2019s base and, with it, Obama\u2019s approval numbers.\n\nBut his standing among independents and Republicans speaks to the broader difficulties for the president in rebounding to Clinton or Reagan territory in his second term.\n\nAmong Republicans, Obama\u2019s disastrous year had remarkably little impact on how they regarded him. (The decline from 17 percent approval to 13 percent was statistically insignificant.) Given that, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that nothing will move the president\u2019s number among Republicans \u2014 in much the same way that, by this time in Bush\u2019s second term, he had lost Democrats completely. If one in five (or fewer) self-identified Republicans approves of the job Obama is doing, it\u2019s virtually impossible for his numbers to ever come close to the Clinton-Reagan range.\n\nThen there is the independent problem. There\u2019s little doubt that the debacle that was the rollout of the health-care Web site \u2014 and the resultant negative news coverage \u2014 damaged Obama among unaffiliated voters.\n\n\u201cThe president is being weighed down by one issue, his health-care law,\u201d Democratic pollster Fred Yang told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fair to say that as goes health care, so goes the Obama presidency for the next year.\u201d\n\nThe issue for Obama in Yang\u2019s statement is that opinions about the health-care law have remained remarkably stable (and negative) for the past several years. With a single exception in September 2012, support for the law has been in the low-40s-to-high-30s percentage range since the summer of 2010, according to monthly tracking polls conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That consistency suggests that changing the opinion of independents (or anyone else) on the law is an extremely difficult task.\n\n(Worth noting: Many Democrats argue that \u201cindependent\u201d voters are increasingly Republicans, as GOPers disaffected with the tea party wing move to the unaffiliated ranks, skewing what \u201cindependent\u201d numbers really mean. That said, among \u201cpure\u201d independents, who lean toward neither party, just 25 percent had a favorable view of the health-care law in the December Kaiser tracking poll, while 52 percent had an unfavorable opinion.)\n\nAdd it all up, and you can conclude two things: 1) Obama\u2019s best (only?) strategy to move the needle on his approval numbers in the near term is to rally Democrats, and 2) even if that happens, he will still find himself well short of the lofty ratings enjoyed by Reagan and Clinton in their second terms.\n\nIn the longer term, Republican pollster Jon Lerner argues, the best chance for an Obama approval surge is actually a GOP victory. \u201cIt will only happen if the Republicans take over the Senate in 2014 and Obama moves to the center in 2015-16, including accepting some changes to Obamacare,\u201d Lerner argued. \u201cIn his second term, Clinton made deals with the GOP-controlled Congress. In his second term, Reagan made deals with Gorbachev.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He will probably find himself far short of the lofty ratings enjoyed by Reagan and Clinton in their second terms.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He will probably find himself far short of the lofty ratings enjoyed by Reagan and Clinton in their second terms.", "title": "Can Obama raise his job-approval ratings enough for a political recovery?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-obama-raise-his-job-approval-ratings-enough-for-a-political-recovery/2014/01/05/405a3268-7624-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/05/National-Politics/Images/Obama-0a512-3943.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thefix"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-obama-raise-his-job-approval-ratings-enough-for-a-political-recovery/2014/01/05/405a3268-7624-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama poll numbers, Obama, Obama approval, Obama 2013, Obamacare, health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza"}, "eomportal-uuid": "405a3268-7624-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama poll numbers, Obama, Obama approval, Obama 2013, Obamacare, health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89b2\"", "article_summary": "(Carolyn Kaster/AP)Here\u2019s a surprisingly complex question: Can President Obama recover, politically speaking?\nThose moves are aimed at rallying the party\u2019s base and, with it, Obama\u2019s approval numbers.\nIn the longer term, Republican pollster Jon Lerner argues, the best chance for an Obama approval surge is actually a GOP victory.\nIn his second term, Reagan made deals with Gorbachev.\u201d\nPresident Obama and his daughter Malia leave Air Force One as they arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Sunday after their annual family vacation in Hawaii."}
