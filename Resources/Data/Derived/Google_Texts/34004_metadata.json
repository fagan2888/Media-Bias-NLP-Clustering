They studied the pictures of 850 individual corpses and did more detailed studies on 150.\n\nThe experts found obvious torture injuries on most of the bodies. One man\u2019s body was covered \u201cover every inch\u201d in bruises and lacerations. Many victims showed signs of internal bleeding so severe that it caused their abdomens to turn various shades of black, blue, and purple.\n\nSixty-two percent of the victims that were studied in-depth also showed signs of severe starvation. According to CNN:\n\n\u201cThis is not just somebody who is thin, or who maybe hasn\u2019t had enough food because there\u2019s a war going on,\u201d Dr. Stuart Hamilton, a forensic pathologist who examined the evidence, told Amanpour. \u201cThis is somebody who has been really starved.\u201d The forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope, piece of rubber, or other such object, as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging. \u201cStrangulation of this kind is also consistent with strangulation being used as a method of torture,\u201d the report reads. Digital imaging expert Stephen Cole also offered his assessment that the images were not digitally altered or manipulated.\n\nPresident Barack Obama did not intervene in the Syrian Civil War until late-September 2013 when he brokered a deal with Russia, which required Syria to give up its chemical weapons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New report details gruesome war crimes by Assad", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A new report provided to CNN\u00a0 contains thousands of pictures showing evidence of war crimes committed by President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian government.
