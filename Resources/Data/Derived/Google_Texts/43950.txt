Mississippi Valley State University alumni from all around this area were in Meridian Saturday for a special banquet.

Close to 150 men and women were there Saturday evening. Each year, the alumni come together to reminisce about old times and discuss the future of the university. There was food, beautiful songs performed by the Valley Choir and fellowship.

"It's a very festive environment. As you can hear right now, our choir is singing. And it's really an opportunity for us to fellowship. For us to continue to recognize the significance the Mississippi Valley State University had in our lives," exec. vice president chief operating officer Jerryl Briggs says.

Briggs says this is something the alumni look forward to each year.
