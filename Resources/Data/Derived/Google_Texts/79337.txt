In its annual survey, Jackson Healthcare found that primary care physicians employed by hospitals in America jumped from 10 percent in 2012 to 20 percent in 2014 while those who owned a stake in single-specialty private care dipped from 12 percent to 7 percent during that same period.

“The shift from private practice to employment continues,” reads the survey. “And the ripple effects of this trend continue to impact patient satisfaction, compensation, practice environment, workload, and patient access.”

The researchers asked physicians why they shifted from private to hospital employment. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they “did not want to deal with the administrative hassles” of private practice. Another 33 percent said they didn’t want to be a businessperson and wanted to focus on medicine.

There’s also high overhead for private practice. Cuts to reimbursements—only 60 percent reported taking new Medicaid patients, compared to 85 percent for Medicare—and a lack of resources to handle the new requirements from the Affordable Care Act were also motivators to revert to hospital employment.

The survey was based on responses from 1,527 physicians taken between April 18 and June 5. Head here for the whole thing.
