Icons appear only in hindsight and are created in a very specific fashion. First, one party will hail the president as great, while the other claims he has wrecked the country. Then the opposing faction realizes the president wasn\u2019t that bad, and reckons with his policies and broader influence, changing its own policies in the process. And finally, both parties fight to claim the president as their own, that they are his true heirs.\n\nSo, who makes the cut? Washington, Jefferson, Jackson (maybe), Lincoln (definitely), both Roosevelts, and \u2026 Reagan. Deceased barely a decade, he is already in the second stage of iconographic development. Liberal Democrats, who despised him and everything he stood for, are reckoning with Reagan and his legacy. Bill Clinton made \u201cthe era of big government is over\u201d his cri de coeur, reformed welfare, and deregulated Wall Street. Barack Obama called Reagan a \u201ctransformational president.\u201d And Rick Perlstein has written The Invisible Bridge.\n\nYes, the last is a big slide down the world-historical food chain. But Perlstein\u2019s work is worth noting, because he is one of the few liberal writers to take conservatism seriously. The Invisible Bridge follows Perlstein\u2019s Before the Storm and Nixonland, which, respectively, charted the presidential campaigns of Barry Goldwater (his first, in 1964) and Richard Nixon (his second, in 1968). Both books were provocative and fair-minded. If conservatives needed a guide to the liberal reckoning with Reagan, Perlstein seemed to be the man to do it.\n\nBut he isn\u2019t. The Invisible Bridge is intensely frustrating and ultimately flawed.\n\nThe Invisible Bridge is divided into three parts: Nixon\u2019s second term, biographical sketches of Ronald Reagan, and a social-cultural history of mid-1970s America. The chapters on Nixon are a slog. Every literate person knows the story, and Perlstein\u2019s version adds nothing new.\n\nBut Perlstein needs Nixon\u2019s fall for the sake of his broader argument, which ties the otherwise disparate sections of his book together. Put simply, he thinks that Watergate, Vietnam, and Nixonian sleaze led many Americans to a \u201cnew definition of patriotism, one built upon questioning authority and unsettling ossified norms.\u201d This approach involved \u201cquestion[ing] leaders ruthlessly \u2026 throw[ing] aside the silly notion that American power was always innocent, and think[ing] like grown-ups.\u201d\n\nAccording to Perlstein, this new conception of patriotism was on the verge of national acceptance in the mid-1970s. And he thinks that was a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, one man messed it all up: Ronald Reagan. In the aftermath of Watergate and defeat in Vietnam, he encouraged \u201ccitizens to think like children, waiting for a man on horseback to rescue them\u201d from these national calamities.\n\nThe remainder of The Invisible Bridge is all about Reagan, and the societal divisions Perlstein believes he exploited and helped deepen. Biographical chapters are interspersed throughout the books\u2019 narrative on the social and cultural history of the mid 1970s. These sections span Reagan\u2019s boyhood and acting career, continue with his work for GE and governorship, and end at his failure to unseat Gerald Ford as the 1976 Republican nominee.\n\nPerlstein\u2019s portrait is not kind. Reagan fibs about his past, lurches from one business-appeasing policy to the next, and uses homespun (and inaccurate) anecdotes to hoodwink Middle America into hating government. While he is in awe of Reagan\u2019s political abilities, Perlstein loathes what they have wrought, and he keeps lamenting the America that might have been\u2014the America of the \u201cnew definition of patriotism,\u201d where Americans \u201cunsettl[e] ossified norms,\u201d \u201cquestion authority,\u201d and \u201cthink like grown-ups.\u201d\n\nPerlstein gives Reagan both too much and too little credit. Too much because Reagan didn\u2019t destroy the \u201cnew definition of patriotism\u201d\u2014most Americans hated it from the moment of conception. And too little because Reagan also \u201cunsettled ossified norms\u201d and \u201cquestioned authority\u201d in his quest to save the nation.\n\nLiberal Democrats were the main purveyors of Perlstein\u2019s \u201cnew definition of patriotism\u201d during the 1970s\u2014not the happiest time for the party or the nation. This sentiment was actually a liability, because most Americans viewed \u201cquestion[ing] leaders ruthlessly\u201d and \u201cthrow[ing] aside the silly notion that American power was always innocent\u201d as blame-America-first nonsense. And they felt this way well before Reagan, as evinced by the almost 61 percent majority that pulled the lever for Nixon-Agnew in 1972.\n\nPerlstein avers that Watergate changed everything. And, once again, he is wrong. Yes, Watergate gave the Democrats a massive congressional majority in 1974, and (barely) delivered Carter the presidential election in 1976. But these victories were wavelets in a conservative tide. The same issues that gave Nixon his landslide\u2014anger at the failures of the Great Society, fear of rising crime, and disgust at the for-thee-but-not-for-me noblesse oblige of the limousine liberals\u2014remained issues after Watergate and his resignation, and hobbled Democratic candidates all over the country.\n\nThe American people were thus predisposed to like any politician who wasn\u2019t a left-wing Democrat. Reagan\u2019s genius was to turn this anti-liberal conservatism into pro-conservatism conservatism. His effort to do so was derided by establishment figures on all sides. They sniffed at his tax-cutting economic policy, laughed at his unironic invocation of American exceptionalism, and scorned his full-throated denunciation of Soviet communism. But many more Americans listened to Reagan, and liked what they heard.\n\nThis is where The Invisible Bridge falls down. Reagan didn\u2019t destroy Perlstein\u2019s \u201cnew conception of patriotism\u201d because that version of patriotism never had popular acceptance. And left-wing flower children weren\u2019t the only people \u201cquestioning authority\u201d and \u201cunsettling ossified norms\u201d in 1970s America. Ronald Reagan was too. But he did so by suggesting new ways for vital institutions to function, not the wholesale destruction of those institutions. Perlstein recognizes this tension\u2014in fact, he repeatedly acknowledges the arrogance of the chattering class, and their blindness to the popularity of Reagan\u2019s new approach\u2014yet he won\u2019t bend his thesis to reality.\n\nIn spite of Perlstein\u2019s obsession with Reagan\u2019s supposedly malign influence, The Invisible Bridge does have some merits. The writing is excellent. Some sections are well drawn and exciting. Perlstein has a journalist\u2019s feel for place and character, and paints set pieces\u2014from race riots in Boston to school-curriculum meetings in Charleston\u2014with ease.\n\nBut technical skill can only get one so far. To paraphrase his b\u00eate noir, the trouble with Perlstein isn\u2019t that he\u2019s ignorant, he just knows so much that isn\u2019t so. He ends The Invisible Bridge on the last night of the 1976 Republican convention. Reagan gave the final speech, one of the best of his career. Perlstein reveals that the address, long viewed as impromptu, was actually scripted. Does it matter? Reagan, ever the actor, dealt in illusions\u2014that America\u2019s economy could be revived, her military strength recovered, her totalitarian enemy vanquished. Those seemed impossible aims in the 1970s. But the American people believed. And under Reagan\u2019s leadership, they made the illusion real.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Though America has had quite a few great presidents, iconic presidents are much rarer.
