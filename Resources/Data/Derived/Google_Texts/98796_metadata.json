Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan -- the 53-year-old Obama, still young by global statesman standards, claimed to have reached, with Iran, a tentative deal for the ages.\n\n\n\nIn doing so, Obama said, he and his Big Power partners were showing how, in the 21st century, military might is not the only way, or even the primary way, to advance the cause of peace.\n\nAt one point, Obama remarked that at the height of an earlier, more dangerous era of confrontation with the Soviet Union, a young President Kennedy had said, \u201cWe should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.\u201d Kennedy ultimately negotiated, as did Nixon and Reagan in later years. Arms limitation deals arose. The Soviet Union collapsed.\n\n\n\nThe Iran deal, if and when finalized, will be to Obama\u2019s second term what the Affordable Care Act was to his first: an unforced, high-risk, presidency-defining choice. Once again he is diving into a complex, seemingly insoluble problem. Once again, he risks not only failure but also further division in an already dysfunctional American political system.\n\n\n\nHis critics took only minutes to begin denouncing the tentative deal. The Republicans who control Congress will almost certainly try to derail it. And even if they act in good faith, they may well modify the deal so severely that Iran will walk away.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt Iran\u2019s intentions -- not least because, as Obama himself acknowledged, Iran continues to deploy terrorists worldwide, build missile systems and use proxies to control capitals like Baghdad, Beirut and Damascus, as well as, now, the country of Yemen.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Israelis who fear Iran. The Arab Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, have sectarian and ethnic fears about Shiites and Persians that stretch back a thousand years.\n\n\n\nBut if there has been one consistent motif to Obama\u2019s public life, it has been his willingness to look for answers that do not begin and end with military force.\n\n\n\nIt was an anti-war speech about Iraq in 2002 that ultimately allowed Obama to get the inside track on Hillary Clinton in 2008. His pledges to end military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan were key to his victory in the general election.\n\nThe American people wanted the opposite of what they had come to see in President George W. Bush -- a bombs-away \u201cdecider\u201d who knew little and cared less about other cultures, and who had no imagination for solutions not military in nature.\n\nWill the Iran deal work? Will it fall apart politically in the U.S.? No one knows, but Obama can perhaps take some comfort from the fact that he has already lived the domestic version of this narrative.\n\n\n\nConsider Obamacare.\n\nIt was complex beyond measure, with so many interrelated parts that even experts had trouble comprehending it all.\n\nRepublicans in Congress hated it, and tried to defeat it any way they could.\n\nObama had staked everything on the deal, seeing it as the crown jewel of his economic and domestic agenda. He was constantly on the phone with the negotiators. He knew the details.\n\nIn the end, Obama won. And Obamacare is working much better than its GOP critics claimed it would.\n\n\n\nOn Iran, the president is arguing, in effect, that he is even more skeptical than Reagan was in his day. While dealing with Soviet leaders on nuclear arms control in the '80s, Reagan vowed to \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama insists that he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust\u201d Iran at all, and he assures us that the world -- specifically, the International Atomic Energy Administration -- can indeed \u201cverify.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, the Iranians have successfully hidden secret nuclear facilities for years. Now Obama is saying that \u201ca diplomatic solution is the best way\u201d to prevent Iran from doing it again.\n\n\n\nIt may take many years to know whether Obama is right. But no one should be surprised that he has faith in his own strategy.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 11 Paranoid Obama Conspiracy Theories 11 Paranoid Obama Conspiracy Theories\n\n1 of 11 Obama Is Not An American Citizen Lou Dobbs, One of the most popular Obama conspiracy theories (aka the Birther Movement), endorsed (or not denied) by the likes of Tom Delay Chuck Norris and Liz Cheney , it claims that Obama is not an American citizen, thus rendering his presidency illegitimate, or something.
