NEWTON, Iowa — The man who allegedly called in two bomb threats to the Jasper County Courthouse last month is scheduled for arraignment Monday morning.

Martin Meloche, 39, has pleaded not guilty and will go to trial on March 4.

In December, police say he called the courthouse and treasurer’s office saying there was a bomb in the courthouse.

But authorities did not find anything.

Meloche is charged with two counts of false report of an explosive device. He’s also facing drug charges after deputies say they found drug paraphernalia in his possession.
