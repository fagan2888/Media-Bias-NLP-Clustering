The \u2018why\u2019 really tells the story of what Denverites love about their city.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, the brainchild of Brad Buchanan, the city\u2019s new head planner, will continue through September.\n\nThere won\u2019t be any rankings or final votes, Burns said \u2014 although a few lucky participants will win tickets to a concert at Red Rocks, courtesy of Denver Arts & Venues. Trends and overall results will be shared at the end of the campaign.\n\nMark Eskanos, a third-generation Denverite and real estate agent, takes many of his new-to-town clients to his favorite place as part of a \u201cnickel tour\u201d of the city.\n\nThe small monument in the parking lot of Key Bank, 2776 Speer Blvd., may not be much to look at initially, but it memorializes an important piece of Denver history, Colorado\u2019s first drive-in restaurant, the Humpty Dumpty.\n\nIts owner, Louis Ballast, so the monument notes, registered for the trademark for \u201ccheeseburger\u201d in 1935, Eskanos said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they say the cheeseburger was created,\u201d Eskanos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a good story.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things I tell people is Denver isn\u2019t a throwaway city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in preserving our history.\u201d\n\nConfluence Park, where Cherry Creek and the South Platte meet on the northwestern edge of downtown, has been a favorite place of Mike McDaniel since he moved to Denver in 1990.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the natural \u2014 the water \u2014 and the urban \u2014 the bridges, buildings, walkways, railings \u2014 is what keeps bringing him back, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a neat intersection of the river, architecture and cool views,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an ugly urban waterway.\u201d\n\nEmilie Rusch: 303-954-2457, erusch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/emilierusch\n\nMy favorite place in Denver\n\nShare your favorite place, now through the end of September, in one of three ways:\n\n\u2013 Tweet with the hashtag #favoriteplacedenver\n\n\u2013 Instagram with the hashtag #favoriteplacedenver\n\n\u2013 Post on Facebook at facebook.com/favoriteplacedenver", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver planners want to know: What\u2019s your favorite place?", "title": "Denver planners want to know: What\u2019s your favorite place?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/19/denver-planners-want-to-know-whats-your-favorite-place/", "image": {"width": 496, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__Denver_zoop1-1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__Denver_zoop1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T14:24:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:32:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf68b\"", "article_summary": "City planners want to know: What is your favorite place in Denver?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an ugly urban waterway.\u201dEmilie Rusch: 303-954-2457, erusch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/emilieruschMy favorite place in DenverShare your favorite place, now through the end of September, in one of three ways:\u2013 Tweet with the hashtag #favoriteplacedenver\u2013 Instagram with the hashtag #favoriteplacedenver\u2013 Post on Facebook at facebook.com/favoriteplacedenver\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just what place is your favorite, but why is it your favorite.\nDenver Community Planning and Development launched a social media campaign this week to get city residents talking about their community and what makes Denver special, all with the hashtag #favoriteplacedenver.\nMark Eskanos, a third-generation Denverite and real estate agent, takes many of his new-to-town clients to his favorite place as part of a \u201cnickel tour\u201d of the city."}
