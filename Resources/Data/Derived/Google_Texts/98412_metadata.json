And getting to the doctor without one can be tough.\n\nOrlando resident David Williams knows this reality well, especially since the brand new Orlando VA Medical Center moved from the downtown core to the suburbs.\n\nTo get to and from his doctor\u2019s appointment at the new Orlando VA Medical Center, it involves a VA shuttle, a city bus and a walk back home.\n\nIn a car, it would take Williams a little less than 30 minutes to make the 21-mile trip. Hop on an expressway in downtown, head south on a secondary highway, and you're there.\n\nOn his most recent trip, he arrives at the VA already thinking about the ride back home.\n\n\"Hey sir, where does the shuttle come?,\" he asks as he checks in at the front desk. \"I gotta catch the 4 o\u2019clock shuttle back.\"\n\nIt's 1:09 p.m. Williams has a 2:30 appointment. He\u2019s worried the doctor is running late, which could make him make him miss the last shuttle back.\n\n\"I need to be gone by 3:05 p.m. to take the last shuttle back to Orlando. Because if not, we\u2019re gonna be walking,\" he says with a laugh.\n\nTim Liezert is director of the Orlando VA Medical Center. He said the massive clinic doesn\u2019t just serve one county, but six, all the way from Disney World to Daytona Beach. That\u2019s more than 6,600 square miles with 375,000 veterans. So having close access to major highways is a plus.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been open now for about three months,\" he said. \"The transportation infrastructure is in place now and will only get better.\"\n\nAt 3:40 p.m. Williams finishes up with his doctor, and picks up his blood pressure medication and arthritis drugs.\n\nHis sits outside the Orlando VA Medical Center, flags whipping in the wind, waiting for the shuttle to come at 4 p.m. It arrives 10 minutes late.\n\nThe shuttle takes Williams to Lake Baldwin, the area where the clinic used to be. It pulls in around 4:45 p.m. and Williams spies the city bus that is his ride to downtown.\n\n\"It\u2019s coming out. There\u2019s the bus. See the bus? ....We missed it,\" he sighs.\n\nSo he waits.\n\n\" The way I do it, I try to arrange my schedule so I\u2019m not stressed out if the bus is a little late,\" he said. \"If I miss a bus, OK, I\u2019m not stressed out, I\u2019m not missing anything.\"\n\nIt was 1:09 p.m. when Williams arrived at the VA hospital. He steps off the bus and finishes up his trip with a short walk from the bus stop to his place. It's 5:10 p.m.\n\nFour hours and one minute to see the doctor, the nurse, get prescriptions, and get back.\n\nNormally, it would be six hours: Two hours to get there, two hours for the appointment, and two hours to get back.\n\n\"Six hours for a one-hour doctor visit. Go figure,\" he said.\n\nWilliams doesn\u2019t mind the six hours. It doesn\u2019t cost him anything, he says.\n\nAnything but time.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
