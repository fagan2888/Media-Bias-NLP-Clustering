Probably not. Anyway, the administration of George W. Bush began its tenure with a recession, followed by an extended \u201cjobless recovery.\u201d By the summer of 2003, however, the economy began adding jobs again. The pace of job creation wasn\u2019t anything special by historical standards, but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph, a vindication of the Bush tax cuts.\n\nSo what should we say about the Obama job record? Private-sector employment \u2014 the relevant number, as I\u2019ll explain in a minute \u2014 hit its low point in February 2010. Since then we\u2019ve gained 14 million jobs, a figure that startled even me, roughly double the number of jobs added during the supposed Bush boom before it turned into the Great Recession. If that was a boom, this expansion, capped by last month\u2019s really good report, outbooms it by a wide margin.\n\nDoes President Obama deserve credit for these gains? No. In general, presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy\u2019s performance than most people imagine. Times of crisis are an exception, and the Obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference. But that stimulus faded out fast after 2010, and has very little to do with the economy\u2019s current situation.\n\nThe point, however, is that politicians and pundits, especially on the right, constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot. And Mr. Obama, in particular, has been attacked at every stage of his presidency for policies that his critics allege are \u201cjob-killing\u201d \u2014 the former House speaker, John Boehner, once used the phrase seven times in less than 14 minutes. So the fact that the Obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks.\n\nWhat did Mr. Obama do that was supposed to kill jobs? Quite a lot, actually. He signed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform, which critics claimed would crush employment by starving businesses of capital. He raised taxes on high incomes, especially at the very top, where average tax rates rose by about six and a half percentage points after 2012, a step that critics claimed would destroy incentives. And he enacted a health reform that went into full effect in 2014, amid claims that it would have catastrophic effects on employment.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet none of the dire predicted consequences of these policies have materialized. It\u2019s not just that overall job creation in the private sector \u2014 which was what Mr. Obama was supposedly killing \u2014 has been strong. More detailed examinations of labor markets also show no evidence of predicted ill effects. For example, there\u2019s no evidence that Obamacare led to a shift from full-time to part-time work, and no evidence that the expansion of Medicaid led to large reductions in labor supply.\n\nSo what do we learn from this impressive failure to fail? That the conservative economic orthodoxy dominating the Republican Party is very, very wrong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a way, that should have been obvious. For conservative orthodoxy has a curiously inconsistent view of the abilities and motivations of corporations and wealthy individuals \u2014 I mean, job creators.\n\nOn one side, this elite is presumed to be a bunch of economic superheroes, able to deliver universal prosperity by summoning the magic of the marketplace. On the other side, they\u2019re depicted as incredibly sensitive flowers who wilt in the face of adversity \u2014 raise their taxes a bit, subject them to a few regulations, or for that matter hurt their feelings in a speech or two, and they\u2019ll stop creating jobs and go sulk in their tents, or more likely their mansions.\n\nIt\u2019s a doctrine that doesn\u2019t make much sense, but it conveys a clear message that, whaddya know, turns out to be very convenient for the elite: namely, that injustice is a law of nature, that we\u2019d better not do anything to make our society less unequal or protect ordinary families from financial risks. Because if we do, the usual suspects insist, we\u2019ll be severely punished by the invisible hand, which will collapse the economy.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nEconomists could and did argue that history proves this doctrine wrong. After all, America achieved rapid, indeed unprecedented, income growth in the 1950s and 1960s, despite top tax rates beyond the wildest dreams of modern progressives. For that matter, there are countries like Denmark that combine high taxes and generous social programs with very good employment performance.\n\nBut for those who don\u2019t know much about either history or the world outside America, the Obama economy offers a powerful lesson in the here and now. From a conservative point of view, Mr. Obama did everything wrong, afflicting the comfortable (slightly) and comforting the afflicted (a lot), and nothing bad happened. We can, it turns out, make our society better after all.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160111032105, "twitter": {"description": "Dire warnings from Republicans about the effect of President Obama\u2019s policies on employment have simply not come true.", "title": "The Obama Boom", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/opinion/the-obama-boom.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004133342"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/11/opinion/11krugmanWeb/11krugmanWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/opinion/the-obama-boom.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004133342", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/opinion/the-obama-boom.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The  Obama  Boom", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 11, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "United States Economy,Obama  Barack,Labor and Jobs,United States Politics and Government", "CN": "paul-krugman", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/11/opinion/11krugmanWeb/11krugmanWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Dire warnings from Republicans about the effect of President Obama\u2019s policies on employment have simply not come true.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/11/opinion/11krugmanWeb/11krugmanWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Dire warnings from Republicans about the effect of President Obama\u2019s policies on employment have simply not come true.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 11, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2016-01-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160111172857, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/opinion/the-obama-boom.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/11/opinion/11krugmanWeb/11krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dire warnings from Republicans about the effect of President Obama\u2019s policies on employment have simply not come true.", "title": "The Obama Boom"}, "pdate": 20160111, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004133342, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Obama Boom", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "The point, however, is that politicians and pundits, especially on the right, constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot.\nTimes of crisis are an exception, and the Obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference.\nIn general, presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy\u2019s performance than most people imagine.\nSo the fact that the Obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks.\nFrom a conservative point of view, Mr. Obama did everything wrong, afflicting the comfortable (slightly) and comforting the afflicted (a lot), and nothing bad happened."}
