Connie Mack, R-Fla., sparked Heidi Wilson\u2019s interest in health care, an issue that led her to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association.\n\nWilson started as an intern for Mack before moving up to legislative assistant, where she learned to be a jack of all trades on Capitol Hill. But the debate on the health care overhaul law pushed her focus toward health issues.\n\n\u201cWorking on legislation with Congress surrounding the Affordable Care Act, sparked an interest [for me] in health care,\u201d she told CQ Roll Call.\n\nAfter working for Mack from 2009 to 2011, she took her experience and contacts into the private sector going to Universal American Corp., an insurance, finance and administrative services company that specializes in offering products to the senior and self-employed markets. There she worked as director of government relations, growing relationships in the private health care sector and using her background on the Hill to work on the company\u2019s priorities.\n\nWilson joined GPhA\u2019s government affairs team last week as director of federal government affairs.\n\nGPhA represents manufacturers and distributors of finished generic pharmaceuticals, manufacturers and distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals, and suppliers of other goods and services to the generic industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s day two, so we are kinda in the working process of settling on what my actual duties will be,\u201d Wilson quipped to CQ Roll Call last week. She added, \u201cThe focus will be promoting our big issues, of course, and advocating access to affordable prescriptions.\n\n\u201cGeneric pharmaceuticals fill 84 percent of the prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. but consume just 27 percent of the total drug spending,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson also noted that the relationships she established while working on the Hill will be essential to championing GPhA\u2019s message of safety and cost savings of generic therapies to Congress at some point.\n\nSend news of hires and promotions on Capitol Hill to climbers@rollcall.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Working for Rep.
