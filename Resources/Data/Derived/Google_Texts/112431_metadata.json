He had been putting it off for weeks, avoiding the emergency room because of the potentially hefty bill in his future. He tried using Aspirin and other home remedies. Little did he know he was having minor heart attacks and by the time he made it to the ER he was having a full-blown heart attack. To Maura\u2019s surprise, the man was not as concerned about the status of his health as he was the cost.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things he asked was if this hospital was in his (insurance) network,\u201d Maura said. \u201cWe are seeing it more often.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by Marketing General Incorporated, on behalf of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) found that 8-in-10 emergency physicians have witnessed patients avoid healthcare due to out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles and co-insurance \u201cBy waiting that long, it ends up being the worst situation for him (heart attack patient) and the insurance company,\u201d Maura said.\n\nThe man with the heart attack, flirting with death, was not the first Maura has seen avoiding the ER due to an impending fear of a bank account draining ER bill.\n\nShe said that insurance companies have been misleading patients by offering \u201caffordable\u201d premiums for policies with less coverage.\n\nMaura noted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The EMTLA is a federal law and was enacted in 1986. It stated that \u201canyone coming to an emergency department to be stabilized and treated, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance companies know the law and how to take advantage of the law,\u201d Maura said.\n\nThe ACEP president Dr. Jay Kaplan noted how insurance companies have created small networks of health care providers. This potentially leads insurance companies to higher profits for those patients who have to receive care outside of their network.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies are exploiting federal law [EMTALA] to reduce coverage for emergency care knowing emergency departments have a federal mandate to care for all patients, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nThis would mean that when patients visit an out-of-network emergency room the price of the deductible would be exponentially higher because the lack of coverage.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) is the national trade association that represents insurance companies throughout the country. From employer-sponsored insurance to public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, AHIP has worked with it.\n\nAHIP Press Secretary, Clare Krusing addressed the statements of insurance companies misleading patients. She noted that health plans are not the sole responsibility for the charges in emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cAll stakeholders \u2014 hospitals, physicians, health plans \u2014 have a responsibility to provide patients with the information they need to make informed choices about their care,\u201d Krusing said.\n\nKrusing added that a solution to the problem could be if hospitals ensured that billing would be balanced between a reasonable number of physicians and specialists.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why any proposals to address balance billing should address the core issues at hand \u2014 lack of transparency and excessive charges billed by certain specialists and doctors who choose to forego participation in health plans\u2019 networks,\u201d Kursing said.\n\nThe lack of transparency seen on the insurance company\u2019s end with the inconsistent billing between specialists is not the same lack of transparency Dr. Maura has seen on the health providers\u2019 end.\n\nMaura expressed how insurance companies needed to be upfront with patients on the details of the premiums they are paying for. This is especially to know the coverage out-of-network emergency room situations.\n\n\u201cPeople need to know that low premiums are not always an affordable plan,\u201d Maura said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Dylan Deprey From broken bones to bronchitis, Dr. Lisa Maura had seen many life-threatening situations walk through the doors of Wheaton Franciscan -", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Milwaukee Courier Weekly Newspaper", "description": "By Dylan Deprey From broken bones to bronchitis, Dr. Lisa Maura had seen many life-threatening situations walk through the doors of Wheaton Franciscan \u2013 Saint Joseph Hospital.
