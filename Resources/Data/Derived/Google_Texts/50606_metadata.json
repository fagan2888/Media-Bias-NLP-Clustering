But today, the Food and Drug Administration issued its first approval of a drug that is \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to an existing biotech medication; a development that could possibly result in billions of dollars in savings.\n\nBut biotech drugs are sometimes so complex as to make exact replication for generic versions too expensive or difficult.\n\nAnd so the 2010 Affordable Care Act allows for drugmakers to create biosimilar medications that will be if they can demonstrate they are highly similar to an already-approved \u201creference\u201d product, and that the new drug \u201chas no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product.\u201d\n\nThe first FDA-approved biosimilar is Zarxio from New Jersey-based Sandoz, which the agency says is effectively the same as Amgen\u2019s Neupogen (filgrastim), a drug given to chemotherapy patients to increase white blood cell counts. Zarxio will be approved for all the same therapeutic uses as Neupogen, and is in fact only approved for the indications and conditions of the older drug.\n\nWhile the FDA says the two drugs are biosimilar, it does not deem them \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d meaning patients currently on Neupogen can\u2019t just switch over to Zarxio unless the original prescribing physician approves the change.\n\nAnd because the two drugs are not entirely identical, Zarxio can\u2019t yet share the filgrastim nonproprietary name of Neupogen. For now, the FDA is assigning the placeholder name of \u201cfilgrastim-sndz,\u201d until the issue of nonproprietary names for biosimilars is resolved.\n\nThe ultimate hope for biosimilar drugs is that, much like the availability of generic drugs give consumers and physicians lower-cost treatment options, biosimilar drugs will result in more affordable biotech medications.\n\n\u201cBiosimilars will provide access to important therapies for patients who need them,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement. \u201cPatients and the health care community can be confident that biosimilar products approved by the FDA meet the agency\u2019s rigorous safety, efficacy and quality standards.\u201d\n\nPrescription benefits giant Express Scripts believes that the introduction of just Zarxio could save consumers and the healthcare system $5.7 billion over the next decade. If the 11 leading candidates for biosimilar status are also approved, the company projects a total savings of $250 billion in ten years.\n\nAmong the potential big-ticket drugs facing competition from biosimilars is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription drug, Humira (adalimumab), which brought in more than $12 billion worldwide for AbbVie last year.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "Biotech drugs \u2014 which are generally derived from a living organism, as opposed to traditional purely chemical medications \u2014 are currently among the most expensive medicines available.
