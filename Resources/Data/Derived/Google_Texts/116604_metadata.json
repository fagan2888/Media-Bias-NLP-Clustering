Sunday, Talansky finished 11th overall in the general classification \u2014 and was the top American \u2014 after the 21st and final stage of the 102nd Tour, a largely celebratory ride into Paris and along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. It marked the end of three weeks of punishing racing on windswept roads in northern France and the Netherlands and steep ascents through the Pyrenees and Alps in the country\u2019s south.\n\n\u201cAndrew rode a very gutsy and honorable Tour, but he didn\u2019t have the momentum needed from races earlier in the year, he lacked punch when it mattered to go top five,\u201d Cannondale-Garmin manager Jonathan Vaughters told The Denver Post on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if he can use his effort at the Tour to succeed in the Vuelta later on in August.\u201d\n\nTalansky was one of two Americans left in the peloton after part-time Aspen resident Tejay van Garderen dropped out in Stage 17 while in third place overall because of exhaustion brought on by a respiratory illness. MTN-Qhubeka\u2019s Tyler Farrar who finished 154th overall, more than 4\u00bd hours behind yellow jersey winner Chris Froome, was the other American.\n\nTry as the team did with its three leaders \u2014 Talansky, Dan Martin and Ryder Hesjedal \u2014 Cannondale-Garmin ended this year\u2019s Tour without a stage win. The squad gathered one fourth-place finish, one third-place finish and three runner-up finishes. Vaughters said he gave this Tour a B grade for his team.\n\nCannondale-Garmin\u2019s final effort Saturday up Alpe d\u2019Huez \u2014 the most revered and famous climb in the sport \u2014 netted Hesjedal a third-place finish in the stage, 41 seconds back of winner Thibaut Pinot of France. On numerous occasions, when it appeared Hesjedal had cracked, he maintained the punishing pace up the switchbacks before getting passed by Pinot and eventual Tour runner-up Nairo Quintana of Colombia. Hesjedal, dealing himself with less-than-ideal form after racing at the Giro d\u2019Italia, was also battling sickness at the Tour.\n\n\u201cThe effort was there, the planning, the work, just the cards didn\u2019t fall our direction a few times, which limited our performances,\u201d Vaughters said of his squad\u2019s performance.\n\nThe squad will now prepare for the final grand Tour of the season, the Vuelta a Espana in August, and is expected to race in the fifth USA Pro Challenge in Colorado (Aug. 17-23). For the near term, though, the team will be looking back at this Tour de France not as a failure, but one that didn\u2019t meet its lofty expectations of placing Talansky in the top five or six overall.\n\n\u201cWe can always improve,\u201d Vaughters said. \u201cThe specifics of that will take some time to unpack and analyze.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "For Cannondale-Garmin, an \u2018honorable\u2019 Tour de France, but one short of expectations", "title": "For Cannondale-Garmin, an \u2018honorable\u2019 Tour de France, but one short of expectations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/for-cannondale-garmin-an-honorable-tour-de-france-but-one-short-of-expectations/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T15:58:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T15:58:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33ac\"", "article_summary": "Andrew Talansky\u2019s slow start to this year\u2019s cycling season was a sign the 26-year-old American with Cannondale-Garmin was either underprepared or just quietly building momentum headed into the Tour de France.\nTry as the team did with its three leaders \u2014 Talansky, Dan Martin and Ryder Hesjedal \u2014 Cannondale-Garmin ended this year\u2019s Tour without a stage win.\nHesjedal, dealing himself with less-than-ideal form after racing at the Giro d\u2019Italia, was also battling sickness at the Tour.\nSunday, Talansky finished 11th overall in the general classification \u2014 and was the top American \u2014 after the 21st and final stage of the 102nd Tour, a largely celebratory ride into Paris and along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\nThe squad gathered one fourth-place finish, one third-place finish and three runner-up finishes."}
