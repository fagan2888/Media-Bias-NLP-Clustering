I\u2019m not saying politically, but geologically shale is probably one of the most abundant rock sources there is. It\u2019s all over,\u201d said Chris Neuzil, a hydrogeologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va.\n\nNeuzil will present his research on the topic today to colleagues attending this week\u2019s Geological Society of America conference in Denver.\n\nHis associate, Alden Provost, provided modeling for their analysis.\n\nThe Department of Energy invested heavily in scientific studies of Yucca Mountain, spending $13 billion over a quarter of a century, only to realize that surface water moving downward through the porous ridge would require expensive titanium drip shields to prevent metal waste containers from corroding.\n\nMeanwhile, little attention was paid to studying shales and other clay-rich rocks, unlike the efforts of scientists from European countries saddled with a nuclear waste disposal burden.\n\n\u201cShale has essentially been off the radar for the whole repository program. That\u2019s the contrast with countries like France, Belgium and Switzerland,\u201d Neuzil said Thursday. \u201cOnce that Yucca Mountain was killed, I said, \u2018Let\u2019s look at this. Maybe we need to consider shale.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhat makes shale a good medium for containing nuclear waste is its low permeability, he said.\n\nThe key to selecting a shale site is to find one thick enough and deep enough to drill a large shaft for lowering equipment and crews to mine a horizontal tunnel that follows the middle of the formation. The consensus among European scientists who have been studying shale sites is to find ones that are 1,500 feet to 3,000 feet deep, enough for safe isolation of the waste but \u201cnot so deep that it becomes a technical nightmare,\u201d Neuzil said.\n\nHe explained that shale acts like a sponge in slow motion. Once water has been squeezed out, it takes a relatively long geologic time for the shale to soak it back up.\n\nEntombing waste containers in shale for the time it takes their radioactive contents to decay to safe levels hopefully wouldn\u2019t require drip shields to protect the containers.\n\n\u201cMy understanding suggests if it did, that would be a major disappointment,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. researchers are intrigued by what Canadian scientists learn from shale permeability observations at a proposed, 1,200-foot-deep nuclear waste repository, the Bruce Nuclear Site in Ontario.\n\n\u201cThis is usually difficult to demonstrate, but some shales have natural groundwater pressure anomalies that can be analyzed \u2014 as if they were permeability tests \u2014 on a very large scale,\u201d Neuzil said in a news release about the Geological Society of America conference.\n\nContact reporter Keith Rogers at krogers@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0308.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/shale-sites-studied-possible-alternative-yucca-mountain", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "KEITH ROGERS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Shale sites studied as possible alternative to Yucca Mountain", "twitter": {"description": "With Yucca Mountain now an afterthought for disposing the nation\u2019s highly radioactive waste, one federal geologist says he might have other places to put it than the volcanic-rock ridge, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.", "title": "Shale sites studied as possible alternative to Yucca Mountain", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/shale-sites-studied-possible-alternative-yucca-mountain", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_yucca_mt_4.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "description": "With Yucca Mountain now an afterthought for disposing the nation\u2019s highly radioactive waste, one federal geologist says he might have other places to put it than the volcanic-rock ridge, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-805656"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=367772", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=367772", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "With Yucca Mountain now an afterthought for disposing the nation\u2019s highly radioactive waste, one federal geologist says he might have other places to put it than the volcanic-rock ridge, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.", "title": "Shale sites studied as possible alternative to Yucca Mountain", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/shale-sites-studied-possible-alternative-yucca-mountain", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_yucca_mt_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "KEITH ROGERS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "News,Yucca Mountain, Nevada and West,", "parsely-section": "News", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-27T00:21:14-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "News,Yucca Mountain,Nevada and West", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_yucca_mt_4.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-27T07:21:14Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda4a\"", "article_summary": "Moving the waste from reactor sites and surface storage facilities to a maze of tunnels planned for Yucca Mountain was put on hold indefinitely when the Obama administration halted the Yucca Mountain Project in 2009.\nMaybe we need to consider shale.\u2019 \u201dWhat makes shale a good medium for containing nuclear waste is its low permeability, he said.\n\u201cOnce that Yucca Mountain was killed, I said, \u2018Let\u2019s look at this.\nU.S. researchers are intrigued by what Canadian scientists learn from shale permeability observations at a proposed, 1,200-foot-deep nuclear waste repository, the Bruce Nuclear Site in Ontario.\nWith Yucca Mountain now an afterthought for disposing the nation\u2019s highly radioactive waste, one federal geologist says he might have other places to put it than the volcanic-rock ridge 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas."}
