DEMOCRATS

CHRISTINE QUINN

WHO IS SHE? If elected, Quinn, 47, would be the first woman and first openly gay mayor. She has had an astonishing climb up the ladder, from housing advocate to City Council speaker. Her close working relationship with Mayor Bloomberg has helped and haunted her. It’s enabled her to get things done, but some voters won’t forgive her for agreeing to repeal term limits. Supporters adore her but opponents are fierce. An “Anyone but Quinn” group is fighting to defeat her.

BIG IDEA: Building 80,000 units of affordable housing.

WHAT’S SHE LIKE: Her boisterous laugh when she’s in a good mood — and her famous temper when she’s not.

STAR POWER: Endorsed by actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Lorraine Bracco, fashion guru Tim Gunn and gay rights advocate Edith Windsor.

ANTHONY WEINER

WHO IS HE? Weiner, 49, began his career as an aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer. He served in the City Council and spent a dozen years in Congress, gaining attention for defending Obamacare and his cable TV appearances. Backed out of 2009 mayoral run when Bloomberg sought a third term — and dropped out of Congress in 2011 because of a sexting scandal. Was riding high in polls before new sexting allegations emerged in July.

BIG IDEA: Universal health care for New Yorkers through a single-payer system; “oligarch tax” on sale of expensive apartments.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: He had a shouting match with a heckler, hammed it up at parades.

STAR POWER: His wife, Huma Abedin, stumped for him before new sexting revelations. Schoolteacher mom Frances stars in TV ad for him.

BILL de BLASIO

WHO IS HE? De Blasio, 51, was an aide to then-Mayor David Dinkins, worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and managed Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate campaign before becoming a city councilman and public advocate. His anti-Bloomberg message and depiction of New York as a “Tale of Two Cities” has resonated with voters, but rivals paint him as a flip-flopper on term limits and other issues. Has showcased his multiracial family, especially his Afro-wearing son Dante, earning points with black voters.

BIG IDEA: Hiking taxes on New Yorkers earning over $500,000 a year to pay for pre-K and after-school programs.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: At 6-foot-5, could be tallest mayor ever.

STAR POWER: Endorsed by celebs Alec Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, Cynthia Nixon and Susan Sarandon.

BILL THOMPSON

WHO IS HE? The son of a prominent judge, Thompson, 60, has been a fixture in New York politics as president of the old Board of Education and city controller. He ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and came within five percentage points of beating the billionaire mayor, who spent $102 million to win. He then receded from public life, taking a $700,000-a-year job at investment bank Siebert Brandford. He has struggled to define himself to voters this year.

BIG IDEA: Longer school days; expanded pre-K system.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: Sober. Has attempted to show fire in the belly with not one but two 24-hour campaign swings.

STAR POWER: Endorsed by salsa star Willie Colon, union boss Randi Weingarten, former Mayor David Dinkins and former Gov. David Paterson.

JOHN LIU

WHO IS HE? Liu, 46, would make history as the city’s first Asian-American mayor. He was a city councilman for eight years before being elected city controller in 2009. He has inspired immigrant communities — but his campaign has been dogged by a federal investigation of his fund-raising, and two former aides were convicted of conspiring to break campaign finance laws. The Campaign Finance Board denied him millions of dollars in public matching funds, crimping his candidacy. Calls himself the only true progressive running.

BIG IDEA: Raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: Tireless campaigner who pulls out all the stops. Once had two dancing Chinese dragons perform before his State of the City address.

STAR POWER: Endorsed by Sierra Club and District Council 37.

REPUBLICANS

JOE LHOTA

WHO IS HE? Lhota, 58, has spent his career hopping between the public and private sectors. He was a deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani and was Giuliani’s point man in a battle with Brooklyn Museum over a dung-covered painting of the Virgin Mary, a role he now says he regrets. Worked as an executive for Cablevision and Madison Square Garden before Gov. Cuomo appointed him to run the MTA, where he won plaudits for getting the transit system up and running after Hurricane Sandy.

BIG IDEA: Frames crime as the biggest quality-of-life issue and says maintaining stop-and-frisk policing is key to city’s future health.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: Gained a following for his frank and funny Twitter feed, where he rooted for Yankees and sometimes admitting to imbibing “too much wine.”

STAR POWER: Backed by old boss Rudy Giuliani.

JOHN CATSIMATIDIS

WHO IS HE? Born in Greece, the son of a busboy, Catsimatidis, 65, is the embodiment of the American dream, becoming a billionaire who owns the Gristedes supermarket chain, real estate and an oil refining company with 375 food marts and gas stations. A longtime donor to the Clintons and Gov. Cuomo, Catsimatidis has run a Bloomberg-style campaign, spending millions of his own money, but not as much as the wealthier mayor.

BIG IDEA: Bringing a world’s fair to New York; putting cops on tricycles to improve their mobility.

WHAT’S HE LIKE: Prone to quirky, off-the-cuff comments, as in, “I have a love factor with the minorities.”

STARPOWER: Endorsed by former Gov. George Pataki.
