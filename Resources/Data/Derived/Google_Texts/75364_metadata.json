White label health technology startup Zipari, which got started 10 months ago, launched its customer experience platform this week.\n\nIt sees a niche for its consumer services, with back office analysis, for the emerging group of Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, CO-OPs. These new businesses on the health insurance scene are seeking insights on their members\u2019 behavior to do a better job of retaining them.\n\nCO-OPS were set up by the Affordable Care Act to provide more competition in the health insurance market. The non-profit organizations are formed at a national, state, or local level and can include doctors, hospitals, and businesses as member-owners. They offer insurance through the health insurance marketplace. About 23 have launched to date, but as Wharton healthcare management professor Scott Harrington, who did a report on the financial health of CO-OPS, their performance has varied widely and some have \u201cvirtually no enrollment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with CEO Mark Nathan, he noted that with the shift in purchasing decisions from company HR executives to consumers, within three years he estimated the value of these purchase decisions will amount to $650 billion.\n\nIt has rolled out a set of navigation tools to help consumers understand what different plans on private health insurance exchanges cover and know what to expect based on their needs and age. It also provides a way for members to look up providers based on specialty and view their ratings. A formulary app lets users look up whether certain drugs are covered by their plans and make price comparisons for out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIt shares insights on \u201cconsumer sentiment,\u201d an oft-repeated phrase that basically means the data analysis that provides customer insights to payers, something Zipari sees as a big value-add.\n\n\u201cWe generate a member sentiment figure that reflects the engagement of users. By understanding member sentiment, we can drive it up and can improve re-enrollment,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cIf you move the dial by 1 percent, that can make all the difference. That\u2019s the power behind the customer experience platform. It is not just about the tools but capturing all this information about the members.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Nathan pointed to the health questionnaires that users fill out. If users decide to stop before they\u2019ve completed it, the software platform can recall the stage they quit and sends prompts queued up to that question.\n\nHe explained that because the co-ops have only been around for two to three years, they have the ability to create higher customer satisfaction. Of course by that logic, the opposite could happen for many of them, too. That\u2019s the kind of risk that could help them attract more co-ops.\n\nNathan added that Zipari is courting small to midsized carriers. Eventually it will pursue large carriers but for now, it\u2019s simply a matter of getting them to dip their toe in the water.\n\nGiven the reluctance of young invincibles to dip their own toes in the insurance coverage pools, does Nathan see its own company being able to help them get through the challenging health insurance jargon barriers?\n\nNathan\u2019s optimistic and said it\u2019s got a health literacy component that could help. He also points out that the issue is far from limited to young people. The newly insured are navigating a brave new world of sorts, one that inevitably raises more questions than answers. They also are learning which questions they need to ask to get the information they need.\n\nHe noted that the amount of time insurers are spending more and more time on the phone helping people new to health insurance navigate the basics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hand holding.\u201d\n\nIt raised $500,000 in seed funding recently from Vertical Venture Partners. Although Nathan noted that it is generating income from customers it wanted institutional funding to support sales and marketing. When it got started 10 months ago it had 10 employees, and has since doubled its staff numbers. With the funding, Nathan projects it will add 30-40 employees primarily in sales, engineering and some product development. By 2017, it projects it will have 110 employees.\n\nNathan\u2019s background has shifted a lot since he worked as a robotics engineer at NASA. He was later a director of professional services at Apple. He moved over to the insurance industry and worked for Guardian Life Insurance where he spent 10 years, most recently as the director of technology strategy, planning and governance. It has an inside track to the CO-OP market through Diallo Powell, who heads up business development. He worked in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the CO-OP loan program in 2012. He led the development of the proposal and business plan that provided $341 million in funding to launch CO-OPS in three states: New York, New Jersey, and Oregon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It sees a niche for its consumer services, with back office analysis, for the emerging group of Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, CO-OPs.
