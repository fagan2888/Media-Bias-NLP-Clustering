Plant growth can be hampered by a haze of pollution.\n\nA 2011 U.N. study estimated that measures to limit air pollutants such as methane and soot could slow the pace of global warming by 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 Fahrenheit) by mid-century.\n\nA study in August 2013, however, said benefits will be far less. Temperatures have risen by about 0.8 C (1.4 F) since before the Industrial Revolution.\n\nAlmost 200 nations will meet in Warsaw from November 11-22 to consider ways to combat global warming. They have agreed to work out by the end of 2015 a deal that will enter into force from 2020.\n\n(Reporting By Alister Doyle; editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle", "Author": "Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Release at 2301 GMT, Sunday Nov 3) Simple measures to reduce pollution from cooking stoves in developing nations could save a million lives a year and help slow global warming, a World Bank study showed on Monday.", "title": "World Bank urges better cookstoves in developing states to curb deaths", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131103&t=2&i=808586365&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9A21S4400", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
