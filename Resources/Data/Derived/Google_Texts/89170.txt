NEW YORK (AP) — A man who stabbed his wife about 150 times as their three children tried to stop him has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Oscar Novakovsky was sentenced Monday on his manslaughter plea.

The children — ages 3, 5 and 9 — cried, screamed and pleaded with their father to stop attacking Diane Sharma in January 2012. They also tried to pull him off their mother. She was found with a knife sticking out of her neck.

Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown says that the victim had an order of protection when the attack occurred. The prosecutor noted that the children will "have to bear the emotional scars" for the rest of their lives.
