(Delaware State News/Jen Rini)\n\nDOVER \u2014 \u201cHey mom,\u201d Lovella Seward, 62, called to Betty Talley, of Smyrna, 76, from across the table at the Modern Maturity Center Friday afternoon. Lunch, sweet potatoes, greens and turkey, was served.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I started to come her, I took her to be my mom,\u201d Ms. Seward, of Dover, explained.\n\n\n\nThe ladies are close, intimately knowing the intricacies of the other\u2019s medical care.\n\n\n\nThough they both have different needs one thing remains constant \u2014 Medicare is extremely necessary.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverything seems to be pretty straight,\u201d Ms. Talley said, but having Medicare as a service has been invaluable.\n\n\n\nMs. Seward, though three years shy of 65, has been on disability and Medicare due to her medical conditions.\n\n\n\nThough a series of health care reforms are on the horizon per the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, a national social insurance program, administered by the federal government since 1965, has been relatively untouched.\n\n\n\nThe program guarantees health insurance for individuals 65 and older and young people with disabilities.\n\n\n\nOnce individuals turn 65, they are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A, which covers hospital costs and hospice care.\n\n\n\nIf an individual would like Medicare Part B, which covers out patient services such as scheduled physician check-ups, home health care and medical equipment; Medicare Part C, which is run by private insurance companies and can include extra benefits for a supplemented cost; or Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs, those costs are additional.\n\n\n\nFor the past three years, Judy Taggart, volunteer with AARP Delaware, has made it her mission to educate senior citizens about Medicare. And how most importantly, Medicare coverage is protected under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nMedicare is not a part of the health insurance marketplace established by the ACA, so seniors are not required to shop online for health insurance once the marketplace, www.choosehealthde.com, kicks off for open enrollment Oct. 1.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is easy to get mixed up,\u201d Ms. Taggart, 71, said.\n\n\n\nJust last week she was educating low-income seniors on the annual Medicare open enrollment, which is from Oct. 15 until Dec. 7, and how to avoid online scams.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know people are very anti-Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ms. Taggart said. \u201c[But] I think in the long run I have faith and it will help people tremendously.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the provisions of the ACA, individuals on Medicare have expanded coverage for preventive services such as mammograms, without being charged a deductible. Also, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d is predicted to be completely closed by 2020.\n\n\n\nWith Delaware\u2019s aging population as the fastest growing demographic, facilitating information on Medicare is crucial.\n\n\n\nMore than 150,000 people are enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, said Kim Iapalucci, spokeswoman for AARP Delaware. And nearly 168,000 are members of AARP.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a good percentage of the population,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cBenefit changes could harm older Delawareans,\u201d she added. \u201cThings are changing very quickly. This is the time to make sure members of Congress know that older Americans need these programs.\u201d\n\n\n\nInterested individuals can visit AARP\u2019s ACA information, www.healthlawanswers.org, for supplemental information.\n\n\n\nCurrently there has been a movement among congressional leadership, mostly Republican, to defund the ACA, or \u201cObamacare.\u201d However, no votes have been taken on the matter.\n\n\n\nWhile he is appreciative of Medicare, Tim Murray, of Dover, is still skeptical of the ACA. He said with the new health law, his prescription drug bill has actually increased.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to be able to fix it,\u201d Mr. Murray, 76, said over lunch at the Modern Maturity Center Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you get a certain age you don\u2019t like people messing with your stuff,\u201d his friend, Jim Horan, of Dover, echoed.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be good customers, but we are.\u201d\n\n\n\nStaff writer Jen Rini can be reached at\n\n741-8250 or jrini@newszap.com.\n\nFollow DSNJen_Rini on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 273275172795109}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda470\"", "article_summary": "All three ladies are appreciative and piece of mind they receive with their Medicare health insurance.\nHealth care can be a maze for seniorsFrom left, Betty Talley, of Smyrna, Lovella Seward, of Dover, and Priscilla Lynch of Dover enjoy a lunch at the Modern Maturity Center Friday.\nMedicare is not a part of the health insurance marketplace established by the ACA, so seniors are not required to shop online for health insurance once the marketplace, www.choosehealthde.com, kicks off for open enrollment Oct. 1.\nThe program guarantees health insurance for individuals 65 and older and young people with disabilities.\nThough a series of health care reforms are on the horizon per the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, a national social insurance program, administered by the federal government since 1965, has been relatively untouched."}
