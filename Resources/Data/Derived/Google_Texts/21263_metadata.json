It is\u2026 the military\u2019s newest experimental drone. The Defense Advanced Research Projects agency, or DARPA, on Friday released new footage from it\u2019s Fast Lightweight Autonomy, or FLA, program and announced that the program had achieved a major milestone: a lightweight drone capable of flying 20 meters per second while carrying a high-resolution camera,LIDAR, sonar, and inertial measurement sensors.\n\nThe demo took place at an airplane hanger at Otis Air National Guard Base, in Cape Cod, Mass. The drone in that video is a super-charged DJIFlamewheel 450. The FLA program, which DARPA launched in December of 2014, isn\u2019t looking for new platforms so much as for new algorithms to help smaller drones fly better, on their own, and without GPS. The recent test confirmed that the platform could hit those speeds. One of the three research teams also used the test as an opportunity to show that their drone could do a bit of navigating and maneuvering around objects on its own, albeit not that fast.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some teams also demonstrated basic autonomous flight ahead of schedule was an added bonus,\u201dDARPA program manager Mark Micire, said in a statement. \u201cThe challenge for the teams now is to advance the algorithms and onboard computational efficiency to extend the [unmanned aerial vehicles\u2019] perception range and compensate for the vehicles\u2019 mass to make extremely tight turns and abrupt maneuvers at high speeds.\u201d\n\nBut why does the military need fast-flying bird-robots? \u201cMilitary teams patrolling dangerous overseas urban environments and rescue teams responding to disasters such as earthquakes or floods currently can use remotely piloted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of the situation, but to know what\u2019s going on inside an unstable building or a threatening indoor space often requires physical entry, which can put troops or civilian response teams in danger,\u201d DARPAwrote in a press release.\n\n\u201cThe program seeks to develop and demonstrate autonomous UAVs small enough to fit through an open window and able to fly at speeds up to 20 meters per second (45 miles per hour, while avoiding objects within complex indoor spaces independent of communication with outside operators or sensors and without reliance on GPS.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the tiny drones have to not only fly fast, but display some very rudimentary understanding of where they are going. That\u2019s no easy technological feat, as a group ofNASA and IEEE scientists write in this paper titled \u201cTowards Autonomous Navigation of Miniature UAV.\u201c\n\n\u201cA major algorithmic challenge is to process sensor information at high rate to provide vehicle control and higher level tasks with real-time position information and vehicle states,\u201d the group wrote.Since micro rotorcrafts can only carry a few grams of payload including batteries, this has to be accomplished with a very small weight and power budget.\u201d\n\nThe smaller the frame, the harder it is to fit a computer on it that can crunch all of the video data that the machine needs to fly\u2014if it\u2019s not going to fly without GPS or remote guidance.\n\nThe recent demonstration shows the feasibility of that goal.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Defense One.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It bobs and weaves with the dexterity\u00a0of a bird.", "title": "Here Comes the Muhammad Ali of Military Drones", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Here-Comes-Muhammad-Ali-Military-Drones", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02172016_DARPA_Drone_Quadcopter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Here-Comes-Muhammad-Ali-Military-Drones", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02172016_DARPA_Drone_Quadcopter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It bobs and weaves with the dexterity\u00a0of a bird.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The demo took place at an airplane hanger at Otis Air National Guard Base, in Cape Cod, Mass.\n\u201cThe fact that some teams also demonstrated basic autonomous flight ahead of schedule was an added bonus,\u201dDARPA program manager Mark Micire, said in a statement.\nThe drone in that video is a super-charged DJIFlamewheel 450.\nThe FLA program, which DARPA launched in December of 2014, isn\u2019t looking for new platforms so much as for new algorithms to help smaller drones fly better, on their own, and without GPS.\nIt is\u2026 the military\u2019s newest experimental drone."}
