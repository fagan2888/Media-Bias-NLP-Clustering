If only the website would work.\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed a group of 200 health care activists Monday at an event sponsored by the grassroots group he founded after his 2012 campaign. His message: They must now work to implement the Affordable Care Act. A month after the health care exchanges opened, Obama is facing criticism for a web of complex technical problems that have gripped HealthCare.gov, jeopardizing his ability to hit the enrollment targets required to make the exchanges solvent.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, a lot of us didn\u2019t realize that passing the law was the easy part,\u201d Obama quipped at the Organizing for Action gathering. He devoted a large part of his address to deflecting from the struggles facing the website, highlighting the parts of the law that are already benefiting Americans, including free preventive care and an end to considering pre-existing conditions when granting insurance.\n\nAs for the website, \u201cI\u2019m taking responsibility to make sure it gets fixed, and it will be fixed,\u201d Obama said.\n\n(PHOTOS: Obamacare: Promise vs. Reality)\n\nObama also addressed criticism that over his promise that people who were happy with their insurance could keep it under the law, as thousands of Americans in the individual marketplace with plans that don\u2019t meet the law\u2019s standards are receiving cancellation notices. \u201cWhat we said was you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Plouffe, former Obama senior adviser and now an adviser to Organizing for Action, also spoke to the group. \u201cIt\u2019s an inexcusable error and these things happen,\u201d Plouffe said. \u201cSo long as the website is completed and works error-free and delay-free by the end of this month, and we think it will, we\u2019re going to have plenty of time to do what we need to do.\u201d The state and federal-run insurance marketplaces must maintain a careful ratio of Americans to keep rates affordable, with the young and healthy balancing our older, sicker customers. If the young and healthy don\u2019t enroll because of the technical difficulties, it could threaten the financial stability of those markets.\n\nBefore Obama and Plouffe spoke, a group of top administration allies, including representatives from Americans United for Change, Planned Parenthood and the Service Employees International Union, which are working to make the health care law a success, also spoke to the group.\n\nOrganizing for Action\u2019s executive director Jon Carson referred to its members as Obama \u201carmy,\u201d spreading news of the law to those eligible for its benefits. Last week the group released a video encouraging Obama supporters to make sure their family members sign up for the exchanges.\n\nNoting that he was first elected five years ago to the day, Obama said that while he\u2019s done with campaigns for office, \u201cI\u2019ve got one more campaign in me: the campaign to make sure that this law works for every single person.\u201d\n\nMORE: Long-Standing Fears Help Explain the Latest Wave of Obamacare Outrage", "article_metadata": {"description": "He has his army.
