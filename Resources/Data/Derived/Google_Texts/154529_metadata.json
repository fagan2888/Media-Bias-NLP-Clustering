In August, the first Republican debate drew 24 million viewers on Fox News Channel, a record for a presidential primary debate and the highest non-sports telecast in cable TV history.\n\n\"The prime time debate averaged a 14.7 household rating, indicating that 1 in 7 American homes with TVs tuned in\" on Wednesday, CNN said in a statement.\n\nFinal ratings for the debate will be available later on Thursday. CNN said the 14.7 rating is likely to translate to more than 20 million viewers once final figures are released, which would make it the highest-rated event in CNN history.\n\nCNN charged up to $200,000 for a 30-second commercial during the three-hour event, according to people familiar with the matter. Before the debate, Trump called on CNN to donate $10 million to charity.\n\nCable audiences traditionally rank below the most-watched events on broadcast television. The Super Bowl in January attracted 114 million viewers, while February's Academy Awards pulled in 37.3 million.\n\n. Fox News Channel is owned by 21st Century Fox .
