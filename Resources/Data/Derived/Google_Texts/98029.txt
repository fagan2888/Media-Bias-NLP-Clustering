Check out this Obamacare-themed version of Jeremih’s ‘Don’t Tell ‘Em’

Don’t tell ’em — the Obama administration, that is — but Reason’s Remy Munasifi just blew the cover off of their Obamacare strategy.

Remy is at it again with his incredible remixes, this time singing his own version of Jeremih’s hit “Don’t Tell ‘Em” that spotlights Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber’s comments about the health care law passing because of its “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter.”

In the video, Remy acts out what he imagines a 2009 Obamacare “strategy meeting” looked like, using Gruber’s remarks for inspiration.

What exactly was the Obama administration’s strategy when it came to marketing the Affordable Care Act? According to Remy, it was simply, “Don’t tell ’em.”

The lyrics spotlight several untruths that Remy imagines the Obamacare architects cooked up to pass the law.

“It’ll bring prices down with it,” he sings. “You’re health care plan will stick around with it.”

What’s more, the song even includes references to Bill Cosby and Lena Dunham.

Watch the video below, and when you’re friends ask you what you’re listening to, “tell ’em.”
