More than a storefront, or a website. It\u2019s working together as a community, creating the things people want, today. It\u2019s the smile at the end of every transaction and the effort and innovation that customers don\u2019t see. Retail businesses \u2013 98% of which are small businesses \u2013 are at the heart of many towns and neighborhoods nationwide. That\u2019s why when retail thrives, communities thrive.
