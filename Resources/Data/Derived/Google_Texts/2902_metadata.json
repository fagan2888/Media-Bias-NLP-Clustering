It was all a crock.\u201d\n\nClass warfare has been a potent campaign tactic in the Obama era, a great motivator to keep voters at home in big elections. Approximately 6 million eligible white voters and 1.5 million eligible nonwhite voters didn't vote in 2012, calculated by the baseline of 2008's turnout. (The 2008 election was about inspirational \u201chope and change,\u201d while 2012 was divisional \u2014 \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem.\u201d)\n\nMidterm elections historically are a referendum on the party in power. You saw that in 2010, when Democrats and independents joined Republicans to vote out majority House Democrats. Republicans would have swept the Senate, too, if not for a few fringe GOP candidates who lost what should have been easy races.\n\nThat election served as a message to Obama that Americans wanted to put the brakes on his policies, specifically ObamaCare (unpopular from the get-go) and federal overspending on economic stimulus and bailouts.\n\nToday, Democrats deride the Republican-led House as a \u201cdo-nothing Congress.\u201d That may be true to an extent. But people voted Republicans into power to do exactly that, not to allow the White House to do any more to hurt their pocketbooks or the economy. In short, to do nothing.\n\nCongress is a reflection of the national mood \u2014 divided, polarized, unhappy with the status quo, but lacking a majority to do a thing about it.\n\nAs we head into the 2014 midterm elections, one thing is certain: Class warfare will be the campaign stage again \u2014 it is the only way this president knows how to win, by dividing and conquering \u2014 with the tea party, Main Street and businesses large and small cast as the villains.\n\nDemocrats and the media have done an effective job of demonizing the \u201ctea party\u201d brand and detaching its followers from their original aspirations.\n\nSo have some Republicans, notably moneymaking strategists who co-opted the movement by running untested, unvetted candidates with no business running for anything, and hard-line egocentric elected officials who care more about their own political gain or cable-news stardom and less about their grandstanding impact on people and the party.\n\nIncome inequity will be 2014's attack line for Obama and Democrats, this election cycle's class-warfare rhetoric. The first example is their pledge to rebuild the middle class with a minimum-wage increase.\n\nAccording to Keystone College political science professor Jeff Brauer, the major difficulty of relying on such a strategy is one word: demographics. \u201cWhile raising the minimum wage is popular with several segments of the population, many of these segments simply do not come out to vote in midterm elections \u2014 youth, minorities, and low-income populations,\u201d he said.\n\nBrauer argues that Democrats have a host of unpopular things to defend, such as health care, government intrusion into personal privacy, taxes, overregulation and the federal debt.\n\nRepublicans always get pegged for their supposed fidelity to the rich and to Wall Street. But the irony is that income inequality between Wall Street and Main Street has flourished under Obama and the Democrats.\n\nThe true political story today is the disconnect between the interests of working-class Americans and the Democrats' devotion to the interests of certain extremely wealthy segments of society.\n\nIt will be a tough sell to harp about income inequality when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer under this administration.\n\nBesides, such sloganeering sounds an awful lot like income redistribution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 14 months, one Pittsburgh businessman still wonders: If everyone like him had voted in 2012, how differently might 2013 have turned out?\nThe lifelong Democrat, who runs a five-man machine shop,...", "title": "Democrats Continue Class Warfare Rhetoric | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/01/05/democrats_continue_class_warfare_rhetoric_121130.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "description": "After 14 months, one Pittsburgh businessman still wonders: If everyone like him had voted in 2012, how differently might 2013 have turned out?\nThe lifelong Democrat, who runs a five-man machine shop,...", "title": "Democrats Continue Class Warfare Rhetoric | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Democrats Continue Class Warfare Rhetoric | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "class warfare,economy,Democrats,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9585\"", "article_summary": "But the irony is that income inequality between Wall Street and Main Street has flourished under Obama and the Democrats.\nYou saw that in 2010, when Democrats and independents joined Republicans to vote out majority House Democrats.\n\u201cWall Street boomed under Obama, Washington is still at a stalemate, and the economy is still at a standstill.\nIncome inequity will be 2014's attack line for Obama and Democrats, this election cycle's class-warfare rhetoric.\nRepublicans always get pegged for their supposed fidelity to the rich and to Wall Street."}
