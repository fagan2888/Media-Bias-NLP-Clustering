Mississippi is consistently ranked as having one of the best highway system in the nation and mid-south, but that comes at a cost.

Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall says the state still operates on an income that was set nearly 30 years ago. With the lack of resources at both the state and federal levels, Hall says it is becoming increasingly difficult for projects across the state to start.

"We're just having a most difficult time trying to stretch our dollars," Hall stated. "We've got to have some kind of long range national program and a long range state program, if we are going to maintain and build the kind of infrastructure we need in this state and this country."

In a 2014 report put out by the Reasons Foundation. Mississippi was ranked 8th in overall highway performance while Alabama was ranked 21st.
