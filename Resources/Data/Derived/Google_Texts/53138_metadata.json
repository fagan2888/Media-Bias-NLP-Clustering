Is there a generational divide? A: Here\u2019s what I see: a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.\n\nCuriously, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s fellow pro-aborts were among the most offended:\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund executive vice president Dawn Laguens: \u201cThere are millions of young women and men across the country who would disagree at the idea that they\u2019re apathetic. Whether it\u2019s organizing a \u2018shout your abortion\u2019 movement, or the millions who took action across the country this past September in Pink Out Day, one thing is clear: Young people care deeply about their reproductive health and rights, and are hellbent on making sure they\u2019re protected.\u201d\n\nFeminist Majority Foundation founder Eleanor Smeal: \u201cI love Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but I do disagree with her on this [\u2026] The young people not only turn out, they turn out bigger, and they vote consistently overwhelmingly for reproductive choice.\u201d\n\nURGE executive director Kierra Johnson: \u201cNot only are young people engaged in pro-choice activism, but they\u2019re embracing abortion as something positive. They are more unapologetic about it and are really frustrated with many politicians including pro-choice ones who let abortion be used as a bargaining chip in legislative negotiations.\u201d\n\nFeeling the heat, Wasserman Schultz walked it back later in the day:\n\nI want to be clear about this: Many in *my generation* got complacent after Roe, thinking the fight for safe, legal abortion was over. Millennials know that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 they are leaders in the fight to protect abortion rights. They know progress isn\u2019t final. They\u2019ve also been leaders in advancing marriage equality, expanding health care, and so many other huge, consequential battles. But even when we\u2019ve achieved big victories, like with Obamacare, we continue to see the other side try to roll back progress. Remaining vigilant is not only important in our fight to protect & advance women\u2019s equality, it is essential to defend all our victories. The mantle must be carried by each generation. We have 10 months to elect the next Democratic president. Let\u2019s keep fighting, together.\n\nThat\u2019s gotta be some kind of record for quickest surrender from a party leader.\n\nIn any event, Debbie was right about young people the first time (if wrong about the reason why). It\u2019s telling that she assumes the reason the current generation isn\u2019t more adamant about the need to kill their kids must be because they already agree with her so much they assume abortion must be safe. But that\u2019s not the case at all\u2014in June, the Boston Globe\u2019s Jeff Jacoby wrote:\n\nYoung Americans \u2014 voters under 30 \u2014 were once the most gung-ho in support of unfettered legal abortion. In 1991, fully 36 percent believed abortion should be legal under any circumstances. But by 2010, 18-to-29-year-olds had become more pro-life than their parents \u2014 only 24 percent still wanted to keep abortion legal in all cases. More than any other age cohort, in fact, young adults are now the most likely to think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.\n\nIndeed, Wasserman\u2019s theory that their inaction stems from a false sense of security is hard to square with the fact that their media and celebrities are constantly telling them abortion is both the key to their freedom and under relentless attack from religious nutjobs who want to enslave them.\n\nMore importantly, her observation that this generation has lived their entire lives in a post-Roe country is more true than she realizes. That means they\u2019ve grown up seeing firsthand the ways abortion has physically and emotionally tortured friends, classmates, mothers, and sisters.\n\nIt means they\u2019ve grown up with much clearer facts about how alive the preborn really are readily available to them.\n\nIt means they\u2019ve seen countless prenatal images of abortion\u2019s victims, humanizing these babies to the point where the current generation can\u2019t discount them as organic waste as casually as the DNC wants them to.\n\nIt means forty years\u2019 worth of pro-life thought, argument, love, and support\u2014and forty years\u2019 worth of pro-abortion lies, crimes, and outrages\u2014are also in the mix, giving them a more informed and balanced understanding of the issue.\n\nIn short, Madam Chair, it\u2019s not complacency keeping today\u2019s young women from championing Hillary Clinton and abortion-on-demand in the numbers you want\u2026quite the opposite, in fact. It\u2019s precisely because so many of them are passionate\u2014passionate about saving preborn children from the violence of your agenda.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s not complacency keeping young women from championing abortion-on-demand; it\u2019s because so many of them are passionate about saving preborn children.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "It\u2019s not complacency keeping young women from championing abortion-on-demand; it\u2019s because so many of them are passionate about saving preborn children.", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz in denial over pro-life passion of current generation | Live Action News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/debbie-wassserman-schultz.jpg", "height": 283}, "updated_time": "2016-01-08T11:48:07-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/debbie-wasserman-schultz-denial-pro-life-passion-current-generation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s not complacency keeping young women from championing abortion-on-demand; it\u2019s because so many of them are passionate about saving preborn children.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/debbie-wassserman-schultz.jpg", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz in denial over pro-life passion of current generation | Live Action News", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "public opinion", "published_time": "2016-01-08T09:27:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T11:48:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But by 2010, 18-to-29-year-olds had become more pro-life than their parents \u2014 only 24 percent still wanted to keep abortion legal in all cases.\nIt means they\u2019ve grown up with much clearer facts about how alive the preborn really are readily available to them.\nA: Here\u2019s what I see: a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v.
