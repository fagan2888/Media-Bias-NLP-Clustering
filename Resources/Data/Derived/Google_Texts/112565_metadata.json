In 2013, that number was 43.5 million, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWith the last of the baby boomer generation turning 50 this year and increased health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, Stew\u00adart and Crowder said fraud is expected to expand.\n\nGoing after health care fraud holds the promise of getting money back for the government, Stewart said, which is another reason the Jus\u00adtice Department has set that as a top goal.\n\nThe attack on those defrauding Medicare and military health care provider TriCare occurs in criminal and civil courts. The difference between prosecution and a civil lawsuit is intent, Stewart said. And intent can be difficult to prove.\n\nIn the Sponseller case, the defense attorney tried to portray the optometrist\u2019s act as more billing errors than intentional fraud because of the complexity of the Medicare billing process.\n\nBut in cases such as Spon\u00adseller\u2019s \u2013 who billed for 177, 45-minute comprehensive exams performed in a single day \u2013 the intent to defraud becomes clear. The more outrageous cases are the ones that are criminally prosecuted, Stewart said.\n\nIn another case from the Sou\u00adthern District, two nutritionists bilked Medicaid of $4 million by billing for services to Head Start programs throughout the state. The intent to defraud became clear when investigators uncovered bank records that proved they were on Florida vacations at the same time they were allegedly visiting Head Start sites, Stewart said.\n\nCrowder, who was the chief of the civil division for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Georgia, said that in 10 years the investigation of health care fraud became the largest part of their work.\n\nSpecial strike forces have been sent to areas deemed as hot beds of Medicare fraud. In May, teams working in eight cities made 89 arrests while uncovering $223 million in fraudulent\n\nbilling.\n\nThe fraud can take the form of medical professionals billing for services they do not perform, or when thieves obtain Medicare billing and patient numbers and create scam operations, Stewart said.\n\nBut the government is fighting back. Medicare has contracts with businesses that patrol for fraudulent activity, has established a hot line for whistle-blowers, and has increased the number of investigators who hunt suspected fraud and abuse. Data specialists are now searching for suspicious billing practices in the billions of claims filed every year.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, federal investigators and the Justice Depart\u00adment have new tools to combat fraud and waste, which helps recover more money to put back into the health care system, Stewart said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Crime & courts, Health, Metro, Latest News, Sandy Hodson", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Georgia ranks 12th in investigations, seventh in the number of fraud cases, and sixth in total recovered - almost $98.95 million in 2012.", "title": "Health care fraud a growing criminal enterprise", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/crime-courts/2014-02-01/health-care-fraud-growing-criminal-enterprise", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13042210.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2937\"", "article_summary": "As the prolific bank robber Willie Sutton reportedly said of robbing banks \u2013 because that\u2019s where the money is \u2013 health care fraud has become a huge problem throughout the country.\nThe attack on those defrauding Medicare and military health care provider TriCare occurs in criminal and civil courts.\nFederal investigations into Medicare fraud have exploded in response to the problem, said David Stewart, who recently left the U.S. attorney\u2019s office where one of his duties was health care fraud coordinator.\nGoing after health care fraud holds the promise of getting money back for the government, Stewart said, which is another reason the Jus\u00adtice Department has set that as a top goal.\nSpecial strike forces have been sent to areas deemed as hot beds of Medicare fraud."}
