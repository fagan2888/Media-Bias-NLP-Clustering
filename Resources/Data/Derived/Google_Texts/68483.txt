MARK LEVIN: The FCC, call it whatever you want, Barack Obama's henchman, Barack Obama's comrades, there, that's right, all over the federal government have hijacked the institutions of government and are now turning them on the people. Whether it's the EPA, or the Department of Justice, the Interior Department, NOAA, this, that or the other, they're using the government, they are using a law against us. Which is the definition of tyranny.



They have abused the First Amendment with wiretaps, and other forms of government action against the media in this country and the media in this country apparently is sadistic. As long as their guy is doing it, well then, do it. So the media in this country no longer stands for free anything. Free speech, free press, any of it. It is the Praetorian guard media -- as I've been saying for years -- protecting this president, protecting his ideology because the people in the media, for the most part, are of the same ilk.



No respect for the rule of law. No respect for the constitution. Now they'll use those things to attack Republican presidents, but they don't give a damn about it when it comes to a radical leftist like Obama. And so it is necessary to remind ourselves who we are, what our power is, what our heritage is as we fight what is increasingly the battle that the Framers fought against tyranny.
