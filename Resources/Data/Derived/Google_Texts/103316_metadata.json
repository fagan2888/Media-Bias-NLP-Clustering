According to Sotheby\u2019s auctioneer David Redden, who gaveled down the sale in two and half minutes of concerted bidding, Rubenstein, a well-known antiquities buyer and donator, intends to loan the ancient Puritan hymnal to libraries around the country, eventually putting it on long term loan to one of them.\n\nIf the buyer of the Bay Psalter (its full title is \u201cThe Whole Booke of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre,\u201d) wasn\u2019t present in the hall, the seller was.\n\nThe Rev. Nancy Taylor, senior minister and CEO of Old South Church in Boston, stood smiling next to the 4-inch by 7-inch psalm book, which was nestled in velvet in a tall rectangular case.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

This means the world to us in terms of the continuation and the building up of our ministries in Boston.\u201d\n\nThough the world record price was on the low end of estimates by Sotheby\u2019s, which had suggested the psalter could go for $30 million, Taylor said, \u201d In the rarified world of some people this may not be much, but for a church, this is huge. It\u2019s going to make all the difference in the world. \u201d\n\nRubenstein, a co-founder of the private equity firm the Carlyle Group, whose worth Forbes has estimated at $2.5 billion, has given away tens of millions, if not hundreds, in philanthropy, and is famous for buying important copies of iconic documents such as the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation and loaning them to branches of the federal government.\n\nHe is also a large benefactor for Duke University, which renamed its special collections the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library.\n\nRubenstein edged out a $12 million dollar pre-set bid by Steve Green of Oklahoma City. Green had already been in the news once on Tuesday. He is scion of the billionaire Green family, owners of the 500-store Hobby Lobby chain. Seven hours before the auction, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a novel corporate religious-speech challenge they have brought against President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Greens had been bidding on the BPB as part of a biblical museum the family plans to build just off the Washington Mall in early 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting day,\u201d Green said after the sale. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the news. It\u2019s was disappointing that we didn\u2019t get the Bay Psalm Book, but it was kind of secondary to the news from the Court.\u201d\n\nThe Bay Psalm Book has been referred to as \u201ca crown jewel\u201d and \u201cthe icon of American Printing.\u201d It is also a landmark in American faith, or one of its strongest colonial strains. Like all good Calvinists of the time, the Bay Colony Puritans revered the entire Bible \u2014 but after the sermon, the most important part of every church service was unison psalm singing. Since the colony was a theocracy, that meant hymnals for all its citizens. Their first run was about 1,700 copies.\n\nOf those, there are now only 11 left. Since almost all belong to blue-chip institutions that will never need to put them up for resale, the copy sold on Tuesday could well be the last BPB ever to hit the open market. Given the laws of supply and demand there was every expectation that the bidding would beat the record.\n\nTaking the psalter on a pre-sale, nine-city tour and meeting an enthusiastic public had left Redden, who is also Sotheby\u2019s Worldwide Chairman of Books and Manuscripts, a little melancholy. While museums display their treasures, libraries reserve them for scholars. To see a Bay Psalter in most of the places where they now reside one would need an appointment and probably an institutional affiliation.\n\n\u201cIt would be inconceivable, for a public institution to, say, keep ten Rembrandts in the basement,\u201d Redden said. \u201cBut it\u2019s par for the course\u201d for libraries to do the equivalent.\n\nAfterwards, he declared himself delighted. \u201cAs I understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cRubenstein wants the libraries he sends this to around America to display it to the general public. That\u2019s a fantastic outcome. I think we made the Bay Psalm book famous again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s was disappointing that we didn\u2019t get the Bay Psalm Book, but it was kind of secondary to the news from the Court.\u201dThe Bay Psalm Book has been referred to as \u201ca crown jewel\u201d and \u201cthe icon of American Printing.\u201d It is also a landmark in American faith, or one of its strongest colonial strains.\nI think we made the Bay Psalm book famous again.\u201d\nTo see a Bay Psalter in most of the places where they now reside one would need an appointment and probably an institutional affiliation.\nIf the buyer of the Bay Psalter (its full title is \u201cThe Whole Booke of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre,\u201d) wasn\u2019t present in the hall, the seller was.\nNancy Taylor, senior minister and CEO of Old South Church in Boston, stood smiling next to the 4-inch by 7-inch psalm book, which was nestled in velvet in a tall rectangular case."}
