You created only 65 laws this year and cost the country $24 billion due to the shutdown, but at least you succeeded in killing one of the internet's favorite memes!\n\nThis is hardly the first time an elected official has used a meme to make a political message.

Issa as a congressman from Ohio. He represents California.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Out-Of-Touch Politicians Out-Of-Touch Politicians\n\n1 of 11 Rudy Giuliani And The Price Of Milk While running for president in 2007, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told a reporter at a Montgomery, Ala., supermarket that he estimates \"a gallon of milk is probably about a $1.50, a loaf of bread about a $1.25, $1.30, last time I bought one.\" It must have been a few election cycles since his last trip: The grocery store's website listed milk for $3.38 and bread up to $3.49.
