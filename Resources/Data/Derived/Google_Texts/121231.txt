Sofia Vergara has been nominated for an Emmy four times for her work on “Modern Family.” But to the TV academy, she’s a good-looking object to put on display.

Vergara introduced television academy CEO Bruce Rosenblum, who delivered a speech about the state of television, or something — it was frankly hard to pay attention, as Vergara had stepped onto a rotating pedestal so that the audience could view her from 360 degrees. The actress is game for anything and usually makes fun of herself first (as when she made a strange joke about her unfamiliarity with American TV customs, as “Modern Family” prepares for its sixth season). Maybe she shouldn’t!
