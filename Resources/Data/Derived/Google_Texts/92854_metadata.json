You paid for that. That on-field swearing-in ceremony for soldiers at a New York Mets game? You paid for that, too.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Department of Defense paid at least $6.8 million in taxpayer money to professional sports teams for military tributes over the last few years, according to a new report by U.S. Senators John McCain (R) and Jeff Flake (R), both of Arizona.\n\nRelated: The 15 Highest Paid NFL Players in 2015\n\nThe document shows that 72 of the 122 contracts between the Pentagon and pro sports teams issued since fiscal 2012 contained items dubbed \u201cpaid patriotism.\u201d These events included enlistment and re-enlistment ceremonies, as well as those emotionally-charged reunions in which a service member surprises his or her family on camera, drawing many tears in the arena.\n\nOverall, the department spent $53 million on marketing and advertising contracts with sports teams since 2012, but that figure also included genuine outreach campaigns like stadium banners and enlistment tents.\n\nSpeaking at a Capitol Hill press conference on Wednesday, Flake said that people rightly assume that such events are paid for by the teams themselves, out of the goodness of their hearts. The incidents detailed in the new report \u201ccheapens the whole lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about what Flake and McCain uncovered:\n\nHow did the investigation start?\n\nIt began last spring, around the time of the National Football League\u2019s annual draft, according to Flake.\n\nRelated: Where It Costs the Most to Watch an NFL Football Game\n\nHis office puts out weekly \u201cPork Chop\u201d reports that skewer government programs he sees as wasteful. He came across an advertising and promotion contract between the New Jersey National Guard and the New York Jets for between $98,000 and $115,000.\n\nThat \u201cdidn\u2019t sound right,\u201d said Flake. So he and McCain, chair of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, asked the Pentagon for more information, a process he said was \u201clike pulling teeth.\u201d\n\nA third of the contracts detailed in the report were discovered by congressional staff and weren\u2019t handed over by the Pentagon, he noted.\n\nWho benefited the most from these contracts?\n\nIn all, 50 teams across five major sports leagues had contracts with the Department of Defense. NFL teams were the biggest beneficiaries. The Atlanta Falcons received $879,000 from the state\u2019s National Guard and other armed services; the New England Patriots got $700,000, and the Buffalo Bills received $650,000.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, the Atlanta Braves were paid $450,000. The Minnesota Wild was the National Hockey Leagues\u2019 top bread-winner, raking in $570,000.\n\nRelated: NFL\u2019s Image Deflated Further by Charging to Honor Vets\n\nDid service members know they were being used?\n\nMcCain said he had a \u201ctalked to a few\u201d of the service members involved in the various ceremonies and \u201cobviously they did not know their appearances were being used to monetarily benefit\u201d the teams.\n\nHe and Flake called on the clubs involved to donate any money from the contracts to veterans\u2019 service organizations, such as the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nDid the team owners know?\n\nFlake said the duo talked to a \u201ccouple owners\u201d and they \u201chad no idea this was going on,\u201d suggesting each team\u2019s marketing department was likely to blame.\n\nMcCain, known for his fiery temper, wasn\u2019t so forgiving, saying \u201cthey should have known this is going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you own a team, then you\u2019re responsible for what a team does,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat about the Pentagon?\n\nThe Arizona lawmakers charged that the department knew its practices wouldn\u2019t sit well with the American public and that\u2019s why it dragged its feet cooperating with their investigation.\n\nThe Pentagon was \u201cunusually and especially aggressive in trying to withhold this information from us,\u201d said McCain, adding that the reasoning behind the scheme is \u201chard to figure.\u201d\n\nFlake said the policy was shared both by the National Guard and the Department of Defense. He, too, railed against the Pentagon for trying to \u201cdiscount the importance of the whole situation,\u201d at one point telling him he wouldn\u2019t get answers until March 2016.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe Pentagon and the National Guard instituted some changes earlier this year, with leaders issuing memos banning \u201cpaid patriotism.\u201d Meanwhile, the NFL has said it will conduct a full audit of its books to make sure the practice is no longer happening.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Wednesday said league intends to refund money its teams received for tributes to the troops\n\nMcCain and Flake also added a provision to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which serves as a policy roadmap for the Pentagon, expressly prohibiting the practice. The measure will likely be signed by President Obama as soon as next week.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "That time 80 members of the National Guard unfurled an American flag on the turf during an Atlanta Falcons football game?
