The U.S. Supreme Court will rule soon on a key part of the Affordable Care Act. It governs federal subsidies for insurance in states like North Carolina that did not set up their own exchange or marketplace. The result could be disastrous for many low-income Americans and for insurance markets in about three dozen states.\n\nA few years ago, Harlena Harris lost her health insurance after she stopped working to care for her husband, who was battling lung cancer.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even raise his hands or do anything for himself,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to feed him. I kept him clean. I did everything for him.\u201d\n\nAs he got better, her own health deteriorated. The 62-year-old has Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Without insurance, she couldn\u2019t afford her medications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I did get to go to the doctor, I was very, very, very ill,\u201d she said. \u201cMy doctor told me that she didn\u2019t know how I was still standing.\u201d\n\nThat doctor\u2019s visit was the first thing Harris did after getting insurance on the Obamacare exchange in 2014. Since then, she\u2019s been doing much better with the help of doctor\u2019s visits and medication.\n\nShe can afford it because of a federal subsidy that leaves her paying about $20 a month for insurance. Across North Carolina, more than 90 percent of people insured through healthcare.gov receive a subsidy.\n\nBut the Supreme Court case King v. Burwell has put those subsidies in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cI think there is a reasonable argument that the statute is ambiguous,\u201d said Neil Siegel, who teaches constitutional law at Duke University in Durham, N.C.\n\nIn one section of the Affordable Care Act, it reads that subsides are available through \u201can exchange established by the state.\u201d But North Carolina and about three dozen other states decided not to establish an exchange. They use the federal healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSiegel says here\u2019s where it get complicated.\n\n\u201cThere are other provisions of the law that don\u2019t really make a lot of sense if the subsidy is invalidated,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are reporting requirements that require federal exchanges to report on the subsidies that individuals are receiving.\u201d\n\nAlso, the whole point of the exchanges is to make it easier to buy health insurance.\n\nSara Collins is vice president of the research group The Commonwealth Fund. She said if the Supreme Court strikes down subsidies in states like North Carolina, \u201cit would likely completely eliminate the gains that we\u2019ve seen in insurance coverage over the past five years.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina ranked seventh in the nation for the percentage of people eligible for ACA insurance who actually signed up. Across the state, about half a million people would lose subsidies. Collins said that would make insurance unaffordable for most of them.\n\nAs they drop their coverage, Evan Saltzman of the RAND Corporation said premiums would go up considerably. \u201cWe estimated that premiums would go up 47 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s across states that use the federal exchange.\n\nHere\u2019s why: healthier people drop out of insurance pools first, then insurance companies raise premiums to cover the costs of the remaining, sicker customers, \u201cwhich then leads to more people saying I don\u2019t want to pay those premiums, and you can get sort of this spiraling effect or death spiral that leads to the collapse of the market,\u201d Saltzman said.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s the individual market, which includes people buying from the exchanges or directly from an insurance company.\n\nMost people get insurance through their jobs, and their premiums shouldn\u2019t be affected, said anaylst Collins of Commonwealth.\n\n\u201cThe employer market is pretty much walled off,\u201d she said.\n\nThink of it as a separate pool. Insurance companies set premiums for each based on only the costs for that pool. The bottom line is this: for anyone not covered through work, Collins and Saltzman say health insurance could become exorbitant.\n\nThe decision could also have a large impact on hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf suddenly a lot of people who are currently insured become uninsured again, that really leaves hospitals in the crosshairs,\u201d says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a consulting firm.\n\nThe health law included payment cuts to hospitals since, in theory, more people would have insurance and therefore be able to pay for their care. Those cuts don\u2019t go away if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies and insurance rates plummet.\n\nPearson said the result could be some hospitals with thin margins closing.\n\n\u201cThese are the providers of last resort, and they are often the only place that low-income uninsured people can go to get care \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s why folks show up in those emergency departments,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so to put more fiscal strain on those providers is a very dangerous thing in terms of maintaining a safety net.\u201d\n\nIn Charlotte, Harlena Harris\u2019s subsidy is nearly $700 a month. Without that, she says she couldn\u2019t afford insurance.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just take it away and we\u2019re setting here in limbo,\u201d she said, addressing state and federal officials. \u201cHave something ready to go in place.\u201d\n\nA few states are aiming to protect their subsidies by creating a state-supported exchange \u2013 basically, sticking with the healthcare.gov website while taking on more responsibility on the state level such as regulation and consumer assistance.\n\nWhen asked about a backup plan for North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory\u2019s administration said that it is closely monitoring the case.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes WFAE, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
