Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., for this master hearing\u2014his first appearance at Arlington Immigration Court.\n\n\u201cWere the kids cool?\u201d\n\nThe immigration court backlog shows no signs of easing, so one judge keeps it fun.\n\n\u201cSi,\u201d the boy nods in Spanish.\n\n\u201cTeachers OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cSi.\u201d\n\nLate last month, The Daily Signal sat in on a morning in Bryant\u2019s Courtroom 6, a day when the gregarious judge heard 38 juvenile cases\u2014all master hearings, preliminary affairs that take place before any rulings are made.\n\nA lawyer representing a child that day said it likely will be two years from the first appearance until the child faces his individual hearing, when the judge will rule on the youth\u2019s status.\n\nYesterday, Bryant saw 71 juvenile cases in a small and cramped courtroom. It was so busy, the judge required the service of a security guard to monitor traffic and keep people out in the hallway until their name was called.\n\nThe master hearings, which occur most Tuesday and Wednesdays in Arlington Immigration Court, were typical of any other here, where Bryant eases the children with jokes and happy birthday shout-outs, delivers listings of free legal services and asylum packets, and schedules the next court appearance\u2014set for months from now.\n\nMost of the children appearing in court\u2014there with family and without a lawyer\u2014were given a new court date of Jan. 21, when the juvenile and (possibly) his lawyer will present a formal asylum package.\n\nThe children will be in the United States longer than that.\n\nA Pew Research Center report released Wednesday shows that though the number of people living in the United States illegally last year was steady at 11.3 million, the illegal population now has been in the country much longer than in previous years.\n\nIn 2013, the typical illegal resident had been living in the United States for 12.7 years, Pew found, up from a median of less than eight years a decade earlier.\n\nThere is a backlog of more than 375,000 pending cases in U.S. immigration courts.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security reported the number of immigrant children caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States\u2014the demographic represented in Bryant\u2019s Arlington courtroom\u2014continued to decline in August.\n\nLast month, Border Patrol agents apprehended 3,129 children, mostly from the Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nIn July agents found more than 5,400 children, while in June the number was more than 10,600.\n\nStill, federal immigration courts have a backlog of more than 375,000 pending cases.\n\nSome 3,000 of those are being heard at Arlington Immigration Court, Bryant said.\n\nSo if the two parties\u2014the immigrant children and Bryant\u2014will continue to have dates together into the foreseeable future, why not make the experience pleasant?\n\nOne boy facing his master hearing Wednesday will celebrate his birthday September 12.\n\nBryant got the festivities rolling early.\n\n\u201cOn the count of three, everyone shout out, \u2018Happy birthday, Jacob,\u2019\u201d Bryant commanded the courtroom.\n\n\u201cOne, two, three.\u201d\n\nThe audience applauds.\n\nThere are 11.3 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.\n\n\u201cYou will never forget this birthday, Jacob,\u201d Bryant says, before giving the boy his new Jan. 21 court date, ensuring Jacob will celebrate his birthday in the United States.\n\nAnother boy, a 10-year-old whom Bryant declares \u201cthe winner\u201d because he is unofficially the youngest of the cases heard Wednesday, traveled to Arlington with his mom from Blacksburg, Va., home of Virginia Tech University.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going to go to school in a couple of years, right?\u201d Bryant teases the child. \u201cJust like my son.\u201d\n\nBryant then tries to talk Virginia Tech football with the 10-year-old, noting that the Hokies \u201cplayed very well this weekend.\u201d\n\nThe boy and his guardian grin without a retort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make you smile,\u201d Bryant says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal immigration courts have a backlog of more than 375,000 pending cases.
