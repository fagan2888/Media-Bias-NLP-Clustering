Forgive us for not puddling up.\n\nThe New York Times reports that thousands of Upper West Side writers, musicians, actors, photographers, artists, doctors and lawyers are starting to get the same cancellation letters that middle-class Americans across the country have received.\n\nAnd like other victims of ObamaCare\u2019s unintended consequences, they\u2019re discovering they\u2019re going to have to pay more to get comparable coverage \u2014 if they can find it. Many can\u2019t locate their doctors and hospitals on the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nThese are the same liberal elite who supported Obama and his takeover of the private health-care sector. During the 2012 presidential race, they derided \u201ccold-hearted\u201d Romney voters critical of Obama\u2019s new big-government entitlements. Now they\u2019re paying for their own idealism, and they don\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep because of it,\u201d said Manhattan lawyer Barbara Meinwald of her cancellation notice. Her group plan through the New York City Bar didn\u2019t meet the ObamaCare mandates. So now she whines she has to pay $5,000 more for a plan covering fewer doctors.\n\n\u201cIt is not lost on many of the professionals that they are exactly the sort of people \u2014 liberal, concerned with social justice \u2014 who supported the Obama health plan in the first place,\u201d the Times said.\n\n\u201cWe are the Obama people,\u201d exclaimed New York writer Camille Sweeney, as if to say, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t happen to us!\u201d She had her Authors Guild plan canceled. Now she is \u201cdismayed,\u201d the Times reports, that neither her pediatrician nor her general practitioner appears on ObamaCare\u2019s exchange plans.\n\nYes, Ms. Sweeney, that\u2019s what happens when the government tries to control the marketplace.\n\nMany still don\u2019t get it.\n\n\u201cAt first they think it\u2019s the association or the insurance company doing it,\u201d an insurance broker said about the cancellations. \u201cWe have to explain that this is the Affordable Care Act; that\u2019s what was put into law.\u201d\n\nMeinwald, the lawyer, told the Times she was a lifelong Democrat who supported \u201cbetter health care for all.\u201d But had she known what ObamaCare had in store for her, she said she would have voted for Mitt Romney.\n\nAnother bleeding-heart liberal mugged by reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Socialized Medicine: Members of New York's cultural elite who voted for President Obama are learning that their health insurance plans are being canceled", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Socialized Medicine: Members of New York\u2019s cultural elite who voted for President Obama are learning that their health insurance plans are being canceled because of ObamaCare.
