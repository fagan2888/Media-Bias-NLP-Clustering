Rand Paul said that Hillary Clinton should give back the donations that the Clinton Foundation received from Saudi Arabia because of their horrendous record of abuse toward women.\n\nThe senator from Kentucky, appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Patriot radio channel 125, told guest host Breitbart senior political reporter, Matthew Boyle, that in one particular case a young Saudi women was gang-raped by seven men, and when she went to the police to report the crime, they arrested her and gave her 90 lashes in a public whipping.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThat kind of activity is just so disturbing,\u201d said Paul, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Hillary Clinton is accepting money from this country.\u201d Senator Paul predicts that many questions will need to be answered by former Secretary of State Clinton about how she used the Clinton Foundation, as the country draws closer to the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAre they using it in any personal way? Are they using it to pay their expenses? What does the foundation own and what are its assets? Who gets to use them? And who are employed by them?\u201d are the types of inquires that need to be addressed, suggested Paul. He added that the foundation has an \u201cunseemly connection with foreign countries. They took millions from Brunei, which is a country where women don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t sit on juries, and in the case of adultery, the punishment is death by stoning.\u201d\n\nPaul says that he finds it \u201cincredibly hypocritical\u201d that a woman who wants \u201cto be the leader of this country and champion women\u2019s rights is accepting money from countries that are the worst abusers of women\u2019s rights in the world.\u201d\n\nBoyle switched gears and reminded the senator of a previous interview he conducted with him, in which Rand said that Hillary Clinton broke the law regarding her jettisoning thousands of emails and maintaining a private computer server at her home in Chappaqua. The senator explained that when Clinton became the secretary of state, she should have signed an agreement that government records will be kept by government officials.\n\nAdditionally, the senator postulated that Clinton\u2019s effort to explain away her use of private emails as a way for her to use only one cell phone doesn\u2019t make sense. Paul quipped that \u201cshe needs to get with the 21st Century, you can put two email accounts on one phone.\u201d Clinton\u2019s assertion that she did this for convenience seems incredible to the senator. \u201cI don\u2019t think convenience should trump national security,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul disputed Clinton\u2019s claim that she never sent any classified information. He pointed out that her calendar is classified \u201cfor her own protection and for the protection of those who protect her.\u201d All conversations she may have had with the president \u201cif not classified, are very sensitive at the least,\u201d the potential 2016 presidential candidate stated.\n\nPaul told the Breitbart senior writer that he expects to be making a decision in the next few weeks as to whether he will be tossing his hat into the presidential ring for 2016. He has been traveling the country speaking not only to conservatives, but to young people at UC Berkeley and Austin Texas at the South by South West festival, spreading the message of the 4th Amendment. Paul feels that young people and Democrats understand that the protection of their privacy is important. They connect with the notion that their phone records should be private and \u201cthe government shouldn\u2019t be rifling through them at their own discretion.\u201d\n\nBoyle moved to a different topic, asking the senator what he thought about the Common Core educational system favored by liberals and establishment Republicans like 2016 presidential hopeful and former governor of Florida Jeb Bush. \u201cI think we shouldn\u2019t have a national school curriculum,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cThe potential for bias entering into the curriculum is great. I\u2019m not much of a fan of a department of education.\u201d Paul added that he would like to eliminate the department of education, and he is not in favor of \u201cmore people in Washington telling us what to do with education.\u201d\n\nPaul concluded the interview by agreeing with Boyle that there is disdain across the country for the permanent political class. He believes that one way to solve the problem is by instituting a constitutional amendment to establish term limits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saturday Senator Rand Paul said that Hillary Clinton should give back the donations that the Clinton Foundation received from Saudi Arabia because of their horrendous record of abuse toward women.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Saturday Senator Rand Paul said that Hillary Clinton should give back the donations that the Clinton Foundation received from Saudi Arabia because of their horrendous record of abuse toward women.", "title": "Rand Paul: Hillary Should Give Back Donations", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Rand-Paul-temple-fingers-Andrew-A.-Nelles-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-03-21T15:15:08-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/21/rand-paul-tells-breitbart-news-that-hillary-should-give-back-donations-from-saudi-arabia/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saturday Senator Rand Paul said that Hillary Clinton should give back the donations that the Clinton Foundation received from Saudi Arabia because of their horrendous record of abuse toward women.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Rand-Paul-temple-fingers-Andrew-A.-Nelles-AP.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul: Hillary Should Give Back Donations", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Rand Paul, Saudi Arabia,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-21T14:27:54-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T15:15:08-07:00", "tag": "Saudi Arabia", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, Sen.
