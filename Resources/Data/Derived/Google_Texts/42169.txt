NORWICH, England (AP) - Jamie Vardy scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season Saturday to help give Leicester a 2-1 away win at Norwich.

Vardy converted a penalty in the 28th minute after he was brought down in the area by Sebastien Bassong, and Jeffrey Schlupp doubled the visitors’ lead shortly after the break by finishing off a quick counterattack.

Norwich pulled one back through substitute Dieumerci Mbokani as the striker converted a cross from Jonny Howson in the 69th, having previously hit the crossbar.

The win gives Claudio Ranieri’s side 15 points from eight games, having lost its unbeaten record last weekend against Arsenal.

Norwich has nine points.
