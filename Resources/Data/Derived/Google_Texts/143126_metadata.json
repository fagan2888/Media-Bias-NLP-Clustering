This ensures there is no breach of confidence whilst maintaining the integrity and availability of patient records.\n\nAccording to Gareth Tungatt, a director of Ascent Underwriting, says medical practitioners have spent thousands of dollars on new technology as a result of the HIPAA changes and have been forced to redesign business processes and software to ensure compliance.\n\n\u201cWhile there are established frameworks around the billing practices, the current regulatory environment has also seen authorities actively pursuing practices that do not correctly bill, code or process healthcare claims correctly,\u201d he says.\n\nAscent\u2019s new CyberPro Medical Billings product for U.S. healthcare professionals combines protection for both the healthcare data protection risk and the business risks associated with non-compliance of HIPAA billing legislation. The cover also includes reimbursement for billing audit investigations and regulatory fines or penalties to minimise the potential financial threat.\n\nThe new product complements Ascent\u2019s other products for professional and non-tangible risks. It is part of a number of new initiatives that Ascent is planning to develop during over the next 12 months that will enhance its niche insurance product portfolio.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Ascent Underwriting, the Managing General Agent (MGA) specialising in emerging risks, has launched a medical billings errors & omissions insurance prod", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Ascent Underwriting, the Managing General Agent (MGA) specialising in emerging risks, has launched a medical billings errors & omissions insurance prod", "title": "Ascent Launches Medical Billings E&O Coverage for U.S. Healthcare Professionals", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2013/12/13/314445.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ascent Underwriting, the Managing General Agent (MGA) specialising in emerging risks, has launched a medical billings errors & omissions insurance prod", "title": "Ascent Launches Medical Billings E&O Coverage for U.S. Healthcare Professionals", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "creator": "@ijournal", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2013-12-13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "physician", "published_time": "2013-12-13T12:56:56-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde33d\"", "article_summary": "CyberPro Medical Billings offers financial protection against HIPAA billing and coding regulation violations and features broad network security coverage.\nAscent Underwriting, the Managing General Agent (MGA) specialising in emerging risks, has launched a medical billings errors & omissions insurance product specifically aimed at U.S. healthcare professionals.\nAscent\u2019s new CyberPro Medical Billings product for U.S. healthcare professionals combines protection for both the healthcare data protection risk and the business risks associated with non-compliance of HIPAA billing legislation.\nIt is part of a number of new initiatives that Ascent is planning to develop during over the next 12 months that will enhance its niche insurance product portfolio.\nThe cover also includes reimbursement for billing audit investigations and regulatory fines or penalties to minimise the potential financial threat."}
