It\u2019s expensive, but Brooke Lee says the alternative is worse.\n\n\u201cEven though costs are high, I\u2019ve just always been somebody who has health care. And I would be really nervous\u2026 for the unknowns to happen, some major accident or health problem that would put us out of business and pretty much ruin everything we\u2019ve worked so hard on if we didn\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nThey would love to have company benefits and are curious about a feature of the Affordable Care Act called the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP. It offers tax credits for up to half of the premium costs an employer covers.\n\nThe online rollout of the program \u2013 as part of the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace -- was delayed a year ago. Companies with 50 or fewer workers instead had to work with an insurance agent, and submit the application on paper.\n\nAndrew Lee -- who co-owns Roundhouse Creative Studio with his wife -- wonders if it can help them afford something they can't provide now - health benefits to their one full-time employee.\n\n\u201cWe would definitely be interested in seeing what those costs are. It is a value that we would love to offer to our employee. It makes their lives better, it makes our lives better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes them want to stay with us for a longer term, so we definitely would be absolutely be interested in that.\u201d\n\nSabrina Corlette is Project Director at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. She says the Affordable Care Act created SHOP to provide options to employers priced out of the traditional group plan market. But it's not a mandate.\n\n\u201cUnlike for large businesses, there is no mandate that small employers cover or provide coverage to their employees,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you work for a small employer that currently does not offer health benefits there is nothing in the affordable care act that requires them to start offering it.\u201d\n\nAbout three-quarters of all American companies employ 50 or fewer full time workers, and most don't offer health benefits, according to the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation. In 2012, just 30 percent of small businesses in Florida offered coverage to their employees.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many business owners in Florida and other states purchased SHOP plans last year through the paper application process. But a federal review of small business signups in states that operated their own online exchanges shows little enthusiasm for the option.\n\nThe General Accounting Office report released last week, found that fewer than 12,000 companies with 50 or fewer fulltime workers bought plans. Those businesses employed a total of about 78,000 workers, the report said.\n\nBrooke Lee says it may be just a matter of being able to afford costly health premiums.\n\n\u201cIt can be doable if you have one, two employees depending on how you\u2019re doing that year businesswise,\u201d Brooke Lee said. \u201cBut we have some friends who are up to about to 10 fulltime employees and I just don\u2019t know if that kind of cost burden is manageable.\u201d\n\nTampa insurance agent Eric Brown has helped small businesses sign up for the SHOP exchange plans for the past year. Even with the employer tax credit, insurance may be out of reach for workers who still have to pay monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cThe out-of-pocket expenses are too high. And when you have employees who are low to moderate income employees, they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe bottom line is when you boil it down, and you look at the policy do you really have insurance if you can\u2019t afford to use it?\u201d\n\nSHOP insurance - like other employer-based insurance - doesn't provide subsidies for individuals. Instead, companies get a tax credit for their investment in employee insurance.\n\nThe tax credit \u2013 which only lasts for two years - is why Brown predicts SHOP won't stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, I do think that the SHOP will eventually go away because I really don\u2019t see the benefit,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like traditional health insurance, except that you get a subsidy, but the subsidy is only there for a short period of time and then it goes away.\"\n\nIn fact, he's already watched a few businesses drop health benefits all together, and instead ask Brown to help educate workers about the individual marketplace.\n\nEmployers, Brown says, think workers can get more affordable health insurance by heading to HealthCare.gov on their own.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
