The firm has hired 53 people just this year.\n\n\n\nAnd Hall Render isn\u2019t done growing. Managing Partner John Ryan said the firm would likely add \u201ca handful\u201d more offices in the next few years to fully serve the entire country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout five years ago, we had been courted by a number of national law firms that want to beef up their health care practice group. We could have gone that road, joined a large national firm that already had the national scaling,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut the firm leadership set the vision then to become the preeminent health care law firm in the country. We knew that part of that required us to geographically scale ourselves across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat need for scale is growing each year, as Hall Render\u2019s main type of clients\u2014hospitals, physician practices and long-term care providers\u2014combine at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, there were 752 mergers and acquisitions valued at $62 billion in the health care services sector, according to a March report by Connecticut-based research firm Irving Levin Associates Inc. That was up about 18 percent from the previous year.\n\n\n\nAmong just hospitals, there were 95 mergers last year and 98 in 2013\u2014both totals running about 50 percent higher than was the case in 2010, according to data collected by Chicago-based consulting firm Kaufman Hall & Associates.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of the deal-making activity in 2014 was a direct result of the mega-mergers of 2013,\u201d when two of the industry\u2019s biggest chains\u2014Tenet Healthcare and Community Health Systems\u2014 made major acquisitions, said Lisa E. Phillips, editor of Irving Levin\u2019s 2015 Health Care Services Acquisition Report. \u201cSmaller hospitals were ready to merge with larger systems in order to stay afloat.\u201d\n\n\n\nHall Render\u2019s Ryan said he expects the consolidation trend to continue for many years.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably scratched the surface on the amount of consolidation that we\u2019re going to see in the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. He noted that the Affordable Care Act, better jknown as Obamacare, is pushing hospitals and doctors to get larger. And the pending mergers of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers\u2014Anthem Inc.\u2019s purchase of Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.\u2019s purchase of Humana Inc.\u2014could have the same effect.\n\n\n\nMergers mean the more than 1,500 health care entities operated by Hall Render's clients are strewn around the country. For example, one of the Hall Render\u2019s largest clients, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, owns 131 hospitals and more 1,900 sites of care, which are located in 24 states and Washington, D.C. Ascension is the parent organization of Indianapolis-based St. Vincent Health.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou typically see clients that have operations in multiple states, and sometimes across the entire nation,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIn order for us to stay relevant to that ever-consolidating health care industry, we need to remain scaled.\u201d\n\n\n\nRyan said Hall Render is looking to add offices in the southwest and southeast regions of the country, because it has clients operating there, but no physical presence.\n\n\n\nBeing larger helps Hall Render have experts in specialized areas of health care law, wherever they happen to live.\n\n\n\nOther firms that are much larger than Hall Render have placed health lawyers in all their offices around the country, and Hall Render needs compete with that, Ryan said.\n\n\n\nFor example, Morgan Lewis, a law firm based in Washington, D.C., has 265 health lawyers spread among its 28 office locations worldwide\u2014with 17 of those in the United States, according to a 2014 ranking by Modern Healthcare magazine.\n\n\n\nAlso , Boston-based Ropes & Gray had 202 health lawyers in its 11 office locations, six of which are in the United States, according to the Modern Healthcare ranking.\n\n\n\nAnd major firms\u2014such as New York-based Epstein Becker & Green and Atlanta-based King Spalding\u2014have significant health care practices, with 127 and 139 health lawyers, respectively, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\n\n\nHall Render, with 166 health lawyers, ranked third in Modern Healthcare\u2019s list, which was based on 2013 data. Now, after adding offices in Denver, Dallas, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., Hall Render has 199 health lawyers.\n\n\n\nMore than half of those\u2014105\u2014are in Indianapolis. The new office in Seattle, which joined Hall Render on Sept. 1, added five attorneys, and the Dallas office, which joined Hall Render Oct. 1, added another six.\n\n\n\nBefore its recent expansion, Hall Render\u2019s offices were exclusively in the Midwest\u2014Detroit, Indianapolis, Louisville and Milwaukee.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith a few more offices, we should feel comfortable that we\u2019ve got a physical presence in every region in the country,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd then from there, we will contemplate additional offices in those regions in order to provide comprehensive health care services. Just like we did in the Midwest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care providers are getting bigger, and Hall Render Killian Heath &amp; Lyman is trying to grow with them.
