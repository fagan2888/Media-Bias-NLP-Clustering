The signatures of Volunteer State Community College faculty, staff and donors are now a permanent part of the new $30 million Humanities Building, currently under construction on the Gallatin campus.

People had the opportunity to sign a beam that was used during a topping-off ceremony for the new building recently. The beam was then raised by a crane and bolted into place.

The three-story structure is officially named the Steinhauer-Rogan-Black Humanities Building. Lead gift donors Dr. David and U.S. Congressman Diane Black, who gave $1 million for the project, decided to share the naming with two well-known Sumner County families, John and Jane Steinhauer and Marion and Clara Rogan.

Construction is due to be completed in summer of 2016. When finished, the 88 thousand square foot facility will have 44 classrooms and labs, 56 faculty offices, a recording studio, music practice rooms and an art gallery.
