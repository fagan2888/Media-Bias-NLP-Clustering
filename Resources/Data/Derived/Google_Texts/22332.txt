Among dozens of tiny cowgirls and cowboys at the final day of the National Western Stock Show, 3-year-old Zoe Clawser donned a pink cowboy hat, red boots and clutched a stick horse.

The 16-day show corralled 682,539 visitors this year and dished out events for the whole family. Attendance was the second- highest in the stock show’s 109-year history.

The last day featured the professional rodeo finals along with the cutest rodeo in the West. Young buckaroos were given old-fashioned stick horses and scored on their wild, pretend rides.

Zoe left the event with a blue ribbon and a hearty smile. “She said she was having the best day of her life,” said Matt Clawser, Zoe’s father.

The Clawser family recently moved to Highlands Ranch from South Carolina. Matt said he brought Zoe to the stock show to give her a taste of life in the West.

Shannon Stewart, the 12-year-old Jefferson County Fair and Rodeo Junior Princess of 2015, said celebrating Western life is what the stock show is all about. She was helping out at stock show events in her tiara-adorned cowboy hat. “I just love the whole scene of rodeos,” said Stewart, of Evergreen. “I love horses, I love the events, the people and preserving the Western way of life.”

Back in the Coliseum where the rodeo finals were up and running, the atmosphere was less adorable, but just as friendly.

Mike and Madeline Spilman watched in awe as horses bucked and riders held on tight. “We come for the excitement of it all,” Madeline said. “It’s just a thrill to watch.”
