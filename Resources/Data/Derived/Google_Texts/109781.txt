The two suspects in connection with a gang rape captured on video during Spring Break in Panama City Beach appeared before a judge Saturday morning.

Delonte' Martistee and Ryan Calhoun, both Troy University students are being charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators.

A Bay County Judge set both their bonds at $50,000 each.

Martistee, Calhoun and a third suspect, who has still not been apprehended, sexually assaulted a 19-year-old back in the beginning of March in broad day light on the beach behind Spinnaker.

Bay County Sheriff's officials have identified the victim, and have been in contact with her.

All we know at this time is that she is from out-of-state.

Both suspects have been suspended from Troy University, and Martistee has been suspended from the schools track team.

Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen told Newschannel 7, we need to get control of our beaches, and changes need to be made.

"I am sick and tired of it. And we can wear t-shirts that say save our beaches all we want too but that is not going to restore this girl who was viciously violated by these individuals last month on our beaches. And I am sick of it, there are no excuses for this, if you condone this you should be in jail right a long with them as I am concerned," said Sheriff McKeithen.

Both Martistee and Calhoun will return to court May 19th.
