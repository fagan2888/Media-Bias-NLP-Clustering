Wheaton, MN

There comes a time in life when, like it or not, it's time to say good bye. Sometimes there's a little of the 'like' and the 'not.'

"I miss all the people; I don't miss the work anymore," Ray Crandall said.

Just shy of 38 years Ray and Yvonne Crandall ran a café in Wheaton, MN.

"I've had a lot of their food over the years," Dawn Julson said.

In fact, a lot of people have had a lot of their food over the years. But the Crandalls will admit age caught up to them.

"Three or four months before we retired everyone was saying, you should do a cookbook," Yvonne said.

They served a lot of dishes people counted on eating every week. So the couple took favorite recipes and compiled a cookbook.

Selling at $20 a piece, pre-orders almost reached 1,000. Those were, for the most part, from the Wheaton area.

As they signed copies of the book in Wheaton this past week, people told them the recipes were special.

"We used to hang out a lot at Crandall's café and we used to have just a wonderful, wonderful time," Julson said.

The cookbook sale is very special to the Crandalls, too.

"After I got into it I thought to myself, 'wouldn't this be a neat thing to do for John,'" Yvonne said.

Last year their 55-year-old son John died after suffering from an autoimmune disease called scleroderma. There were only weeks between his diagnosis and death.

They don't even know what caused it. Proceeds from the books go to a foundation that might help find that answer and others related to the disease.

"If we sell all the ones that we'd like to sell, which is about 1500, we should be able to donate about $10,000 to the foundation," Ray said.

"It's a wonderful feeling, all these people supporting us," Yvonne said.

Obviously, saying goodbye to their son was not something the Crandalls liked going through. But they have enjoyed the love shown by a town they called home so many years.

"Words can't describe it," Yvonne said. "No, it's wonderful."
