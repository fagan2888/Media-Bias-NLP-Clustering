Surprisingly, their pharmacy distributed cousin, opioid painkillers, took the first-place prize. These highly addictive painkillers are America\u2019s most abused, most misused, and most prescribed medication, but a recent move by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) hopes to curb the drug\u2019s popularity, a decision that some feel will do little if anything to stop illicit drug use.\n\nOpiod painkillers, such as Vicodin and other pills containing hydrocodone, will soon move from the \u201cmoderate-to-low\u201d Schedule III classification to the more-restrictive Schedule II, Reuters reported. This categorization includes drugs \u201cwith a high potential for abuse \u2026with use potentially leading to severe psychological dependence.\u201d Other drugs labeled as Schedule II are cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine, and oxycodone. \u201cToday's action recognizes that these products are some of the most addictive and potentially dangerous prescription medications available,\" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said.\n\nThe move is hoped to help curb the illegal use of opioid painkillers, which are abused by \u201calmost seven million Americans\u201d and cause more deaths than car accidents, Leonhart explained in a statement. Empirical figures reflect Leonhart\u2019s words, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's database showing that nearly three in every four drug overdoses are caused by opioid painkillers. However, while the move is meant to make it harder for addicts to obtain the drug, ultimately it will also make it more difficult for legitimate pain patients to receive the drugs as well.\n\nOpponents of the reclassification cite that the restrictions will cause issues for patients with chronic illnesses or those who have issues with physical mobility, such as the elderly, as it calls for more revisits to the doctor\u2019s office in-between refills. Under the new Schedule, physicians will also no longer be able to call in a prescription to a pharmacy, and patients will be required to have a written prescription.\n\nOthers foresee even more dangerous consequences, predicting that the new categorization may cause a \u201ctrend of [teens] skipping the pills and going straight to heroin,\" Janina Kean, president and CEO of High Watch Recovery Center in Kent, Conn., told HealthDay. Experts have already reported increased usage of heroin, a trend that they believe is partly due the increasing price of prescription painkillers. Heroin and prescription painkillers are chemically similar. Often, addiction begins with opioid painkillers, and users switch to heroin due to either increased prices or difficulty obtaining pills. \"Now we have people openly admitting a heroin habit of 20 bags a day, and I haven't talked to a single person who did not get started by using the pills,\" Jim Baer, chief of police of Rutland City in Vermont, told The Enquirer.\n\nStill, there is always the chance that the new classification may have little effect on current and future drug use. Historically speaking, prohibition of a substance has rarely led to decreases in its use. For example with the passing of the 18th amendment in 1920, which prohibited the sale of alcohol, consumption of alcohol rose to record levels, with experts predicting it surpassed pre-prohibition levels by 60 to 70 percent. Cannabis is labelled as a Schedule I drug, a category reserved for the \u201cmost dangerous of all the drugs \u2026 with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.\u201d But based on the 2014 Global Drug Survey, it is third most widely used drug in the world, surpassed only by alcohol and tobacco.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dea, increases, restriction, prescription, painkillers, move, may, possibly, increase, already", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The DEA has announced its plan to move opioid painkillers from a Schedule III drug classification to the more restrictive Schedule II.", "title": "DEA Puts Heavier Restrictions On Painkillers, May Increase Illicit Drug Use As A Result", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-increases-restriction-prescription-painkillers-move-may-possibly-increase-already-299346", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/drugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The DEA has announced its plan to move opioid painkillers from a Schedule III drug classification to the more restrictive Schedule II.", "title": "DEA Puts Heavier Restrictions On Painkillers, May Increase Illicit Drug Use As A Result", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-increases-restriction-prescription-painkillers-move-may-possibly-increase-already-299346", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/drugs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/22/drugs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-08-22T13:31:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-22T13:31:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The DEA has announced its plan to move opioid painkillers from a Schedule III drug classification to the more restrictive Schedule II."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd77f\"", "article_summary": "Experts have already reported increased usage of heroin, a trend that they believe is partly due the increasing price of prescription painkillers.\nHeroin and prescription painkillers are chemically similar.\nOften, addiction begins with opioid painkillers, and users switch to heroin due to either increased prices or difficulty obtaining pills.\nSurprisingly, their pharmacy distributed cousin, opioid painkillers, took the first-place prize.\n\u201cToday's action recognizes that these products are some of the most addictive and potentially dangerous prescription medications available,\" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said."}
