(AP) \u2014 A spike in suicides and attempted suicides has prompted corrections officials to step up oversight at a California women\u2019s prison as inspectors try to pinpoint the cause of the troubling increase.\n\nFour women have killed themselves at California Institution for Women in San Bernardino County in the last 18 months, according to state records. The suicide rate at the facility is more than eight times the national rate for female inmates and more than five times the rate for the entire California prison system.\n\nSuch deaths in custody have drawn scrutiny since Sandra Bland was found hanging in a Texas jail cell after a traffic stop that gained national attention amid increased focus on police practices, though she died in a county jail and not a state prison.\n\nIn California, the Institution for Women is the only women\u2019s prison in the state to have had any suicides in the last five years, and another 20 of the prison\u2019s 2,000 inmates have attempted suicide during the last year and a half.\n\nIt is a shocking turnaround at a facility that last year was cited as a rare example of California providing proper mental health treatment for inmates. All four women who died were receiving mental health treatment in the days before their deaths.\n\nThe prison\u2019s psychiatric program was promoted as a positive example in May 2014 by Matthew Lopes, a federal court-appointed overseer who monitors mental health treatment for inmates. Of six inpatient programs for mentally ill inmates statewide, he found that only the one at the women\u2019s institution was providing proper care.\n\nBut this January, court-appointed suicide expert Lindsay Hayes labeled the prison \u201ca problematic institution that exhibited numerous poor practices in the area of suicide prevention.\u201d They included inadequate suicide risk evaluations and treatment and not checking on inmates as often as required by department regulations.\n\nThat was before Gui Fei Zhang, 73, killed herself a day after being released from suicide watch in February, according to the advocacy group California Coalition for Women Prisoners. Stephanie Feliz, 34, hanged herself less than a month later after several previous attempts and after seeking emergency mental health care the same day she died, the group said, citing letters from her fellow inmates.\n\n\u201c(W)e have women dropping like flies, and not one person has been questioned as to why we believe they are killing themselves,\u201d inmate April Harris, who has been in prison since 1998, wrote to the coalition after Feliz\u2019s death. \u201cI have never seen anything like this.
