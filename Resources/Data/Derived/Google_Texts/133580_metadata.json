For perennial losers such as the Rockies, unanswered questions become the very essence of spring training.\n\nWhere to start with the 2016 club? Here are a few of the most compelling questions:\n\nWho will play shortstop? The question used to be whether Troy Tulowitzki could stay healthy. That\u2019s been replaced by the legal status of Jose Reyes, along with concerns about his glaring lack of productivity.\n\nReyes is scheduled to go to trial April 4, the day the Rockies open the regular season at Arizona. Reyes was arrested Oct. 31 for allegedly assaulting his wife in their hotel room in Wailea, Hawaii. Regardless of what is decided in a court of law, commissioner Rob Manfred likely will hand down a suspension under baseball\u2019s new domestic violence policy.\n\nIf Reyes is suspended for any length of time, does that open the door for prospect Trevor Story to break camp with the Rockies? And what kind of player will Reyes be in 2016? He turns 33 in June, is making $22 million per year and his offensive numbers have declined, annually, in nearly every category. His defensive range and arm strength pale in comparison with Tulo\u2019s.\n\nUnless Reyes rebounds, the question will become, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Rockies trade him, even if they would have had to eat a chunk of his salary?\u201d\n\nCan Tyler Matzek bounce back? First a confession: I\u2019m a big Matzek fan. He\u2019s smart, competitive and has great stuff. His willingness to open up to me about his battle with performance anxiety left me rooting for the left-hander to find his way back. If he can, the Rockies\u2019 rotation will get a bonus boost. If he struggles this spring, his career will be in jeopardy.\n\nDid the Corey Dickerson trade make sense? We will get a better feel as spring training progresses. On the surface, it seems like a win for Tampa Bay. The Rays got a wonderful talent in Dickerson, a player I believe is capable of hitting .290 to .300 with 30 homers. What\u2019s more, he is under the Rays\u2019 control for four years.\n\nIn return the Rockies received left-handed reliever Jake McGee, who becomes a free agent after the 2017 season. He will be paid $4.8 million in 2016, up from the $3.55 million he earned in his injury-shortened 2015 season.\n\nIf McGee emerges from spring training as the Rockies\u2019 closer, I might not be as skeptical. He does strike out a lot of batters, fanning 32 percent of the hitters he has faced in each of the past four seasons, good enough for 14th in the majors.\n\nThen again, perhaps McGee becomes trade bait at the deadline when relievers are a hot commodity. I\u2019m still scratching my head over this deal.\n\nHow good is Jeff Hoffman? Forget Reyes for a minute. The real centerpiece of the Tulo deal with Toronto was Hoffman, a powerful right-handed starter. Though not on the Rockies\u2019 40-man roster, he did get an invitation to spring training, so we will at least get a peek.\n\nHoffman underwent Tommy John surgery in 2014, a month before the Blue Jays drafted him ninth overall. The Rockies are very high on him, but we don\u2019t know how soon we will see him pitch in the big leagues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you exactly what our plan would be,\u201d general manager Jeff Bridich said last month. \u201cI think we have to sit down with Jeff in spring training and make sure that everybody is on the same page. But we all look forward to Jeff pitching for us and hopefully advancing his career at the highest levels here.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Rockies bringing questions to camp", "title": "Saunders: Rockies bringing questions to camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/saunders-rockies-bringing-questions-to-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__6100af4cbbb4a4028d0f6a706700d224p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__6100af4cbbb4a4028d0f6a706700d224p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T14:02:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:25:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "For perennial losers such as the Rockies, unanswered questions become the very essence of spring training.\nReyes is scheduled to go to trial April 4, the day the Rockies open the regular season at Arizona.\nUnanswered questions play a huge part of every spring training.\n\u201cI think we have to sit down with Jeff in spring training and make sure that everybody is on the same page.\nThough not on the Rockies\u2019 40-man roster, he did get an invitation to spring training, so we will at least get a peek."}
