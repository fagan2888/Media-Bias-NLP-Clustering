What it asks: "Shall Sections 4.17 and 5.1 of the city of Lafayette, Colorado, Home Rule Charter be amended to eliminate the requirement that, with the exception of Planning Commission, all board and commission members be residents and electors of the city, provided that the chair and all but two members reside in the city?"

What it means: Residency in the city of Lafayette would not be a requirement for applicants seeking positions on city boards and commissions except for the Planning Commission, which would still require proof of residency. Board and commission chairs would still require residency. Non-resident members are limited to two seats per board or commission.

What supporters say: Removing the requirement would open positions to stakeholders that are not documented residents of the city, including some people that have expressed interested in the Latino Advisory Board, professionals who work in Lafayette but do not live in city limits and parents of children who attend Lafayette schools.

What opponents say: People who do not live in Lafayette should not have the ability to affect change in the city.
