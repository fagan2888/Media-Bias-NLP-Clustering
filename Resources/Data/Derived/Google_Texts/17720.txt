JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - More than fifty veterans and supporters held a rally Sunday in Five Points raising awareness of the high veteran suicide rate.

The Department of Veterans Affairs finds an estimated 22 veterans take their own life every DAY.



Today's rally helped veteran's connect with some of the organizations in the area that provide support.

In the state of Florida, veterans make up about 8-percent of the population.



Anyone who knows a veteran who needs help can contact the event's coordinator Justin Rigdon by emailing rigdon@teamrubiconusa.org.
