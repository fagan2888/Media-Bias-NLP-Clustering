China is close to winning its first starring role in Hollywood.

Chinese real estate and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Co. is close to completing a deal for a majority stake in Legendary Entertainment that would value the U.S. film and television company at nearly $4 billion, according to people close to the deal. Its announcement could come as early as next week in China, one of those people said.

If completed, the deal would make Dalian Wanda the first Chinese owner of a Hollywood production and finance company and move China closer to its goal to become a global film powerhouse. It also illustrates Wanda’s broader ambitions amid a Chinese rush to grab entertainment content to show to quickly growing audiences at the movies and at home.

A deal would demonstrate “the Chinese film industry’s growing resource and clout,” said Rance Pow, founder of Asian film industry consulting company Artisan Gateway. “It would be precedent setting,” Pow said.

China is already pushing to build its own film studios that can create blockbusters with appeal beyond the country’s borders. The world’s second-largest movie market has become a voracious consumer of Hollywood films, but its own homegrown productions haven’t proven popular world-wide.

Closely held Legendary already has a proven reputation with film franchises like “The Hangover” and “The Dark Knight” Batman movies. It co-financed films such as “Jurassic World” and “Inception” and made its own movies including “Godzilla” and “Pacific Rim” -- the latter a big hit in China.
