(AP) - If the Birddog Club was just starting out, its members probably would not be eating breakfast together every Friday morning. There is a good bet that instead of meeting in person, they would be connecting electronically.\n\nForty-seven years ago, the Birddogs were young pups starting their business careers and meeting weekly to discuss what was going on in Owensboro and how they could be a part of it. The only change in their almost half-century together is their meeting places.\n\nThe group said they finally hit on a stable place to meet. In their 47 years, the Birddogs closed down several eateries.\n\n\u201cWe started out at O\u2019Henry\u2019s,\u201d said David Leeper, president of Leeper Heating & Cooling Service. When that closed, they met at Gabe\u2019s until it closed and then they closed down the Days Inn restaurant. He joked that they warned Cracker Barrel of their record.\n\nAll of the Birddogs are members of the business community. Five of the members sat at a round table Friday morning at the Barrel to discuss the week\u2019s local, national and global news. Areas represented at Friday\u2019s table included building, heating and cooling; insurance; real estate; restaurants; and bluegrass music.\n\nBy 8 a.m., they had covered the potential closing of Century Aluminum in Hawesville and its effect on the surrounding area.\n\nGordon Barnett, a real estate professorial with Real Living, Home Realty, had worked in the aluminum industry and said Russian and Chinese imports are part of Century\u2019s problem.\n\nWhen they talked of Owensboro, they didn\u2019t bring up anything negative about their city. The group applauds the work at Smothers Park and the growth on Kentucky 54.\n\nOthers at the morning meeting were Bill Jones, a partner in Lake Forest Community LLC; David Edds Sr., insurance agent; and Ross Leazenby, who is former owner of Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza restaurant franchises.\n\nSince Leazenby\u2019s retirement, he has been involved with the International Bluegrass Music Museum, including serving as board chairman.\n\nThe former restaurateur, who is a native of Michigan, told his wife upon his retirement that he was going to give back to the community that helped make him successful.\n\nJones has been in the building business for more than 40 years. One of his projects is Lake Forest Town (retail) Center on Kentucky 54. When asked what he thought about the latest news on Towne Square Mall\u2019s foreclosure he replied, \u201cI think (our) new mall will do well.\n\n\u201cAll but one space is filled,\u201d Jones said.\n\nJones, a Daviess County native, was instrumental in bringing Scott Paper, now Kimberly-Clark, to town in the early \u201890s. He was chairman of the 110 Percent For Scott Paper Committee.\n\nThe men talk politics, but not for public consumption. Edds did share a story about former Mayor David C. Adkisson.\n\n\u201cHe passed by our table and stopped and asked if he should run for mayor,\u201d Edds said.\n\n\u201cWe told him it was a great idea, and he said he would since he had the endorsement of the Birddogs,\u201d Edds said. Adkisson was elected mayor twice.\n\nBefore local elections, the Birddogs take a straw vote, Edds said. The friends are almost always in agreement and right about who got into office.\n\nBarnett said Edds likes telling stories that they\u2019ve all heard before. \u201cHe starts out by saying, \u2018I\u2019ve told this story before, but I like hearing myself tell it, so I\u2019m going to tell it again,\u2019 \u201d Barnett said.\n\n\u201cI look forward to this every week,\u201d Edds said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, http://www.messenger-inquirer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the Birddog Club was just starting out, its members probably would not be eating breakfast together every Friday morning.
