Or early November Joffrey.\n\nThose were the times when he was playing his best. Those were the times when he not only won the job as Denver\u2019s starting center in the absence of projected starter Jusuf Nurkic, he was running away with it.\n\nLauvergne is getting back to that now.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely rounding back into form,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that it took a little time to get back to that, when you miss that many games \u2014 and the kind of injury he had, the back, he couldn\u2019t do anything. When you have a bad back, it really inhibits the movements you\u2019re able to do.\u201d\n\nHis back injury cost the 6-foot-11, 220-pound Lauvergne nearly a month of time. He has played in nine games since returning, gradually getting better each game. And in the last week, Lauvergne has started to bump his performance to a higher level.\n\nIn his last three games, Lauvergne has two double-doubles and is averaging 12.3 points and 10.3 rebounds while shooting 57 percent from the field, including 50 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nAfter initially coming off the bench while Malone worked him back into the rotation, Lauvergne has returned to the starting lineup and is averaging 21.3 minutes per game. He scored 12 points and grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds Friday night in the Nuggets\u2019 97-88 loss to the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.\n\nLauvergne has given Malone another legitimate big man to turn to in the post. The former second-round draft pick has regained most of his touch around the rim, and he has been more than capable of scoring from the block when the Nuggets need a high-percentage shot.\n\nLauvergne, 24, started this season with three consecutive games in double-figure scoring, including 11 points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes against the Thunder on Nov. 1 at Oklahoma City. He was on his way to having a big night when his back wouldn\u2019t allow him to play the majority of the second half.\n\nFrom that point, there was plenty of downtime to rest his back until he returned Nov. 28. An anti-inflammatory injection helped get him back on the court.\n\nNow, his effectiveness will keep him in the rotation.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s getting his confidence and his rhythm back, which is great to see,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe need him. He had a great preseason and a great training camp. We\u2019re seeing that Joffrey Lauvergne again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joffrey Lauvergne clearly back in business", "title": "Joffrey Lauvergne clearly back in business", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/19/joffrey-lauvergne-clearly-back-in-business/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__Joffrey-Lauverngep1.jpg", "height": 521}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__Joffrey-Lauverngep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T21:28:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:17:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re seeing that Joffrey Lauvergne again.\u201d\nAfter any game, you\u2019re likely to find second-year Nuggets center Joffrey Lauvergne on the locker room floor contorting his body to stretch out his ailing back.\nLately, December Joffrey has started to look a whole lot like September Joffrey.\nLauvergne has given Malone another legitimate big man to turn to in the post.\nAnd in the last week, Lauvergne has started to bump his performance to a higher level."}
