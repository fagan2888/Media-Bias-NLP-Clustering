And in the latter, the Senate candidate, Chris McDaniel, has given a keynote to a group that considers Abraham Lincoln a war criminal. It\u2019s not hard to make the case that the Tea Party has been distilled down to it logical essence.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to the moon,\u201d said the comedian Bill Maher. \u201cThey want to howl at it.\u201d Still, the Tea Party has also been around long enough to have a record, of sorts. Let\u2019s look at the legacy:\n\nNo significant legislation, no changes for the better in American life, and no compromise, of course, with the majority of voters who say in numerous polls that the Tea Party has been mostly a negative force in politics. One follows the other, since by the absolutist nature of their philosophy Tea Party members believe that any effort to govern with those they disagree with is traitorous.\n\nBut they did bring us \u2014 drumroll \u2014 the government shutdown! Remember last fall, an extortionate attempt to deprive millions of Americans access to health care through an established law? It was ruinous. The economy took a direct hit of more than $20 billion, and 800,000 people were without a paycheck. An extremist fringe of one party in one house of one branch of government brought the day-to-day functions of the United States to a standstill.\n\nIt could have been worse. Because the other big Tea Party idea is government default \u2014 walking out on your commitments. This is the debt ceiling, in which Congress validates the spending that it has already agreed to pay for. The Tea Party came up with the idea of making the government not unlike the rancher in Nevada who refuses to pay his bills for grazing cattle on the public range. A deadbeat. You can see why Cliven Bundy became a Tea Party hero, until his overt racism made him toxic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo, no legislation. A shutdown that cost billions. A near-default that almost threw the United States back into recession. What else? Oh, science denial. Evolution, climate change, medicine \u2014 all a hoax, in one form or another.\n\nBut the Tea Party does have something to show for its five years of annoyance: Ted Cruz, senator from Texas. Cruz is probably best known for reading \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d on the floor of the Senate during a 21-hour talkathon designed to ensure his place as the most hated man in that august chamber. But Cruz, in trying to kill funding for the Affordable Care Act, missed the point of the Dr. Seuss classic: don\u2019t criticize something until you actually try it. And now that more than eight million Americans are trying insurance that won\u2019t deprive them of health care just because they got sick, green eggs and ham is likely to be a dish served cold to Cruz.\n\nElsewhere on the personnel front, the Tea Party kept writers on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d busy. There was Christine \u201cI\u2019m not a witch\u201d O\u2019Donnell, routed in a Senate race the Republicans could have won in Delaware. They put forth Todd \u201clegitimate rape\u201d Akin in Missouri, and Richard \u201crape is something that God intended\u201d Mourdock in Indiana, both gifts to the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the soon-to-be-retired member of Congress Michele Bachmann, founder of the Tea Party Caucus. If Bachmann were to put out a greatest-hits compilation of her craziest statements, she would need a double album. Her most harmful outburst was a claim that a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer in young women was dangerous. She knows this because \u201ca lady\u201d told her that her child \u201csuffered from mental retardation\u201d after getting the vaccine.\n\nWhich brings us to the last Tea Partiers standing. All along, surveys have shown that the Tea Party is thick with aging white men, angry, fearful, in open revolt against the new American demography. And their ideas came not from Republican Party elites or conservative think tanks, but from the true fount of Tea Party philosophy \u2014 talk radio.\n\nNo surprise, then, that the leaders of the last skirmishes being fought in the Tea Party rear guard are people who came out of the fear-breeding hothouse of far-right broadcasting. The latest Tea Party star in Texas is Dan Patrick, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor \u2014 not to be confused with the likable sports radio host of the same name.\n\nThe Texas Patrick is of course a climate-change denier, and he warns of a Mexican \u201cinvasion\u201d by illegals who bring \u201cthird world diseases\u201d with them, like polio. He keeps the fact-checkers fully employed. But he embodies other Tea Party heroes because of his glaring hypocrisy: This strong advocate for fiscal responsibility once declared personal bankruptcy, walking out on about $800,000 in debts in the 1980s. The people he stiffed are still angry.\n\nIn Mississippi, Chris McDaniel, the candidate who forced aging Senator Thad Cochran into a runoff later this month, is an even better distillation of Tea Party essence. For old whites, he can count on the support of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose members claim the Emancipation Proclamation was illegal, and have put up billboards wishing a happy birthday to \u201cPresident Jefferson Davis.\u201d McDaniel gave a keynote last summer to one of their affiliates.\n\nHe\u2019s likely to be Mississippi\u2019s next senator. The Tea Party could have been useful, in the way that some fringe groups bring new ideas into the system. Here, they just brought the fringe, looking in only one direction \u2014 backward.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140605194021, "twitter": {"description": "A legacy of no significant legislation, no changes for the better in American life, no compromise with the majority of voters.
