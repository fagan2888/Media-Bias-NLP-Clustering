AB1825 requires employers with at least 50 employees to provide regular and legally compliant training to supervisors. The new FEHA regulations add to the already lengthy list of compliance requirements for training in terms of process, recordkeeping, and content.\n\nProcess Requirements:\n\nWhile the existing regulations have referred to other means of training such as audio, video, or computer technology in conjunction with classroom, webinar, and e-learning trainings, the new regulations clarify that these \u201cother\u201d methods are merely \u201csupplemental\u201d and, by themselves, cannot fulfill the AB 1825 training requirements. Accordingly, employers should not rely on training that consists solely of these methods.\n\nThe requirements for trainers have also been expanded. In order to be considered a qualified trainer, in addition to previously outlined requirements, the trainer also must now have the ability to train supervisors on identifying behavior that may constitute unlawful harassment, discrimination, and retaliation under both California and federal law, as opposed to just defining these concepts. Additionally, trainers must be able to train on supervisors\u2019 obligation to report harassing, discriminatory, or retaliatory behavior of which they become aware.\n\nRecordkeeping Requirements:\n\nThe new regulations set forth more stringent requirements for tracking compliance. These include:\n\nE-learning training \u2013 Requiring trainers to maintain all written questions received and responses or guidance provided for a period of two years after the date of the response.\n\nWebinar training \u2013 Requiring employers to keep a copy of the webinar, all written materials used by the trainer, and all written questions submitted during the webinar. Employers also must document all written responses or guidance the trainer provided during the webinar. These records must be kept for two years after the date of the webinar.\n\nDocumentation of training \u2013 In addition to previous recordkeeping requirements, employers now must keep documentation of the training provided, including: the names of the supervisors trained, the date of the training, the sign-in sheet, a copy of all certificates of attendance or completion issued, and a copy of all written or recorded materials.\n\nContent Requirements:\n\nAdditional content requirements under the new amended regulations expand the list of topics for discussion to include:\n\nExamples of questions to utilize during trainings \u2013 The new regulations spell out examples of methods trainers can use to engage participants, such as pre- or post-training quizzes or tests, small group discussion questions, discussion questions that accompany hypothetical fact scenarios, brief scenarios discussed in groups, any other learning activity geared towards ensuring interactive participation as well as the ability to apply what is learned to the supervisor\u2019s work environment.\n\nRemedies available for victims in civil actions, and potential employer or individual exposure or liability.\n\nSupervisory obligations to report sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation of which they become aware.\n\nDiscussion of strategies to prevent harassment and steps necessary to take appropriate remedial measures to correct harassing behavior.\n\nReview abusive conduct (which was added as a training topic in January 1, 2015) in a \u201cmeaningful manner.\u201d\n\nNext Steps\n\nEmployers subject to California\u2019s AB1825 should review their training procedures and material content carefully to ensure they are up to date with these new requirements.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New California Fair Employment and Housing Act regulations that went into effect April 1, 2016, requiring employers to have a discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and prevention policy also set new benchmarks for mandatory sexual harassment training procedures.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "New California Fair Employment and Housing Act regulations that went into effect April 1, 2016, requiring employers to have a discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and prevention policy also set ne", "title": "California\u2019s Mandatory Sexual Harassment Training Requirements Amended", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/california-s-mandatory-sexual-harassment-training-requirements-amended", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1092/group%20of%20business%20people%20in%20office%20around%20computer.jpg?itok=oFYlHTDa", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "California, Fair Employment and Housing Act, sexual harassment training, employers, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, prevention policy, e-learning training, record keeping, AB1825", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, California, Fair Employment and Housing Act, sexual harassment training, employers, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, prevention policy, e-learning training, record keeping, AB1825"}, "article_summary": "Since its enactment in 2005, California\u2019s AB1825 has governed mandatory sexual harassment training by employers.\nWebinar training \u2013 Requiring employers to keep a copy of the webinar, all written materials used by the trainer, and all written questions submitted during the webinar.\nThe new FEHA regulations add to the already lengthy list of compliance requirements for training in terms of process, recordkeeping, and content.\nSunday, April 24, 2016New California Fair Employment and Housing Act regulations that went into effect April 1, 2016, requiring employers to have a discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and prevention policy also set new benchmarks for mandatory sexual harassment training procedures.\nAB1825 requires employers with at least 50 employees to provide regular and legally compliant training to supervisors."}
