Home Depot Inc. logged stronger-than-expected earnings growth in its latest quarter as Americans continued to snap up products for home improvement projects.

Shares added 1.7% in premarket trading.

The Atlanta-based company has continued to report rising sales, bucking a larger retail trend marked by deeper discounting and softer sales as consumers dial back spending on items like apparel and electronics.

In 2015, sales at Home Depot stores open at least a year rose a better-than-expected 5.6%--capped off with a 7.1% jump in the fourth quarter, driven by domestic sales and showing that consumers continued to shell out to refurbish their homes. Home Depot has pointed to aging housing stock in the U.S., noting late last year that nearly two-thirds of American homes are at least 30 years old, a trend it says will buoy home-improvement spending.

For the solid fourth-quarter results, Chief Executive Craig Menear credited, in part, a continued recovery in the U.S. housing market, and Home Depot lifted its quarterly dividend 17% to 69 cents a share. The company cautioned, though, that the strong U.S. dollar may hurt results this year. The company guided for earnings of $6.12 to $6.18 a share and roughly $93.01 billion to $93.81 billion in sales, bracketing analysts' average estimates.

Over all for the fourth quarter, Home Deport reported a profit of $1.47 billion, up from $1.38 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.17 from $1.05 a year earlier. Revenue grew 9.5% to $20.98 billion. Analysts projected $1.10 in adjusted per-share profit and $20.39 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.

The company's gross margin held relatively steady at 34.1%.
