Bush in 2007, the New York Daily News reported this week, but they have been routinely shunned largely due to the lobbying efforts of the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, however, lawmakers are renewing calls for gun control in hopes of hindering any plans for a potential assault on American soil.\n\n\u201cI am still amazed at how long it has taken our society to deal with the problem of gun violence,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd when you add terrorism now, on top of every other threat, it makes the gun issue even more dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same nefarious individual we monitor and bar from our planes, we turn the other way when it comes to allowing them to get guns and explosives,\u201d added Sen. Chuck Schumer, New York Democrat, the Daily News reported. \u201cThe NRA has fought tooth and nail to prevent these individuals from the terror watch list from being added over the past several years.\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office determined previously that at least 2,233 suspected terrorists attempted to buy guns from dealers within the U.S. between 2004 and 2014, and succeeded more than 9-out-of-10 times.\n\n\u201cMembership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law,\u201d the GAO found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mayor of New York is urging members of Congress to act on a dormant gun control bill that would ban suspected terrorists from owning firearms but has been unable to clear Capitol Hill despite eight years of effort.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The mayor of New York is urging members of Congress to act on a dormant gun control bill that would ban suspected terrorists from owning firearms but has been unable to clear Capitol Hill despite eight years of effort.", "title": "Bill de Blasio, N.Y.
