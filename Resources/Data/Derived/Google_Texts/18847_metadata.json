Lisa Murkowski in the Republican primary.\n\nPerhaps just as surprisingly, Murkowski was able to hold onto her seat less than three months later when she won a general election write-in campaign, taking advantage of Miller\u2019s growing reputation as a loose cannon to defeat him and a Democratic challenger.\n\nFour years later, Miller is again a candidate in the GOP Senate primary (set for Aug. 19), this time vying for the right to take on Democratic incumbent Mark Begich in a key general election matchup that will help determine control of the Senate.\n\nThough he is polling in third place in the three-way race, Miller actually appears to be in far better position than he was four years ago. A survey conducted around this time in 2010 showed Miller trailing Murkowski by 32 points -- before a late endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin helped put him over the top.\n\nAccording to the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls, Miller (at 14.5 percent) now trails both former Alaska Attorney General Dan Sullivan (36 percent) and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell (24.5 percent) by more manageable margins -- on paper, at least.\n\nThough Sullivan has a massive financial advantage over his two opponents, most Alaska political watchers agree that the primary race remains fluid.\n\nWhether it is indeed winnable for Miller, however, is open to dispute.\n\nAlaska Democrats, who see him as by far the weakest potential Republican nominee, make the case that he is very much capable of pulling off another upset.\n\n\u201cFor folks on the ground in Alaska, Miller is actually running a lot better campaign than last time,\u201d said Alaska Democratic Party Communications Director Zack Fields. \u201cAnd I would say, based on what we know of the unreliable polling in Alaska, he has a very clear chance to win.\u201d\n\nMiller has largely avoided the kinds of glaring public relations nightmares that plagued him the last time around, such as the bizarre incident that made headlines when members of his private security team handcuffed a reporter to a chair after a town-hall meeting at an Anchorage middle school.\n\nOn Monday, Alaska\u2019s largest Tea Party organization -- Conservative Patriots Group -- announced its endorsement of Miller, and he previously earned the backing of other grassroots conservative groups, including Gun Owners of America and Alaska Right to Life.\n\nMiller also has drawn relatively large crowds for an Alaska politician in his public events around the state -- a sign that his supporters remain dedicated.\n\n\"All this indicates to me, that our campaign has grassroots support,\" Miller spokesperson Randy DeSoto said in an email. \"The next weeks will be filled with Joe traveling the state to participate in campaign events, parades, festivals, and debates/forums, making the case why he is the only true conservative in the race.\"\n\nAlaska remains a notoriously difficult state to poll accurately, and many of the libertarian-leaning GOP primary voters who compose Miller\u2019s base live in some of the more remote enclaves of the state, where they can be difficult for pollsters to reach.\n\nIn recent campaign appearances, the challenger has cited Dave Brat\u2019s stunning defeat of Eric Cantor in Virginia\u2019s 7th District GOP primary last month as reason to believe that the polls and national pundits once again have his race all wrong.\n\nAnd he has is unwavering in presenting himself as the most hardline option available to the deeply conservative Alaska Republican primary electorate.\n\n\u201cObamacare is not a compromise issue,\u201d Miller said at a recent town-hall meeting, according to the Homer News. \u201cSarah Palin said death panels will become a reality. That\u2019s a fact. Your treatment is going to be decided by the government -- you\u2019re going to lose treatment options.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s mentioning of Palin and death panels may sound like an outdated throwback to his last campaign, but he is clearly cognizant that the woman who helped push him over the top in the 2010 primary still has the potential to move some conservative votes in 2014.\n\nBut Palin has stayed out of her home state\u2019s marquee primary race, focusing instead on trying to boost other Tea Party-aligned candidates in the Lower 48. \u201cShe has bigger fish to fry,\u201d one source close to Palin said when asked if the former vice presidential candidate intended to get involved in the Alaska primary this year.\n\nAnd Palin isn\u2019t the only prominent former Miller-backer who has thus far sat this race out.\n\nIn 2010, the Tea Party Express was the most significant source of outside funding for Miller\u2019s successful primary bid, spending almost $600,000 to keep a supportive message on the state\u2019s airwaves.\n\nBut in an interview with the Associated Press this week, Sal Russo -- the group\u2019s co-founder and chief strategist -- noted that the ideological differences between the three candidates in this year\u2019s primary are \u201cnot as dramatic\u201d as they were in the Miller/Murkowski bout.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all pretty much running on a conservative platform,\u201d Russo said, according to the AP.\n\nThough they have generally been careful not to disparage him in public remarks, national Republicans have insisted that Miller\u2019s consistently low unfavorability ratings mean that he has lost his ability to play the spoiler role.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an afterthought,\u201d one Washington-based Republican operative said of the challenger.\n\nIn Alaska, however, the Yale Law School graduate and Gulf War combat veteran is being taken more seriously.\n\nHe recently participated in his first full debate with Sullivan and Treadwell in Anchorage, during which he lambasted \u201cthe corrupt power within the Republican Party,\u201d according to the Anchorage Daily News. Such proclamations generated a strong reaction from his dedicated supporters.\n\nNo one disputes the continued intensity of Miller\u2019s following within the state party, and the unpredictability of a three-way contest remains clear. However, evidence that Miller has expanded his appeal is less clear, so sneaking up on the frontrunners this time around is likely to be a far more difficult task.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2010, Fairbanks attorney and Tea Party firebrand Joe Miller pulled off one of the biggest upsets in recent political history by defeating Alaska\u2019s incumbent Sen.
