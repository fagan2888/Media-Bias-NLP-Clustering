The Wisconsin company recently stopped making its Rush Creek Reserve due to concerns about FDA regulation, as reported by the Chicago Reader.\n\nRelated: America\u2019s 10 Best New Restaurants\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed over the last year or two is that [the FDA] has taken [its] concern with soft, raw milk cheese and increased the pressure on producers making those cheeses,\u201d Uplands cheese maker Andy Hatch told the Reader. The FDA isn\u2019t transparent or predictable in the way it\u2019s addressing their concerns, he added.\n\n\u201c[This] creates uncertainty, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m reacting against,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple precautionary measure and a preemptive reaction to a regulatory climate that just feels opaque and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nRush Creek is a cheese loosely based on a French and Swiss cheese known as Vacheron Mont d\u2019Or, which isn\u2019t sold in the U.S. because it is aged for only 25 to 30 days. For decades the FDA has required cheesemakers to age raw milk cheeses such as Rush Creek for more than 60 days.\n\nRelated: Sneaky Ways Food Companies Make You Eat Price Increases\n\nThe FDA is currently reviewing this rule, with many academics speculating that the duration could be increased to 90 or 120 aging days within the next year, noted cheese expert Jeanne Carpenter on her blog. The FDA\u2019s goal is to avoid unsafe cheese, but there\u2019s little clarity about which direction it will go.\n\nThis is the kind of unpredictability that prompted Hatch to stop making his cheese \u2013 and it isn\u2019t the first time the FDA is confusing cheese makers.\n\nIn the spring, a policy statement from the FDA declaring that cheese makers will no longer be able to age their cheese on wooden boards created havoc in the cheese community. The FDA quickly backed away, saying it actually didn\u2019t issue the new policy, according to Forbes.\n\n\u201cThe death of Rush Creek Reserve should act as the canary in the coal mine for all American raw milk artisan cheeses, because just as our great American artisan cheese movement is in serious full swing, the FDA has basically declared a war on raw milk cheese,\u201d wrote Carpenter.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The artisanal cheese world in the U.S. is in danger of extinction due to regulatory uncertainty from the Food and Drug Administration.", "title": "The FDA\u2019s \u2018War\u2019 on Artisanal Cheeses", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/FDA-s-War-Artisanal-Cheeses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10122012_Junk_Food_Cheese_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/FDA-s-War-Artisanal-Cheeses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10122012_Junk_Food_Cheese_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The artisanal cheese world in the U.S. is in danger of extinction due to regulatory uncertainty from the Food and Drug Administration.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3aa\"", "article_summary": "For decades the FDA has required cheesemakers to age raw milk cheeses such as Rush Creek for more than 60 days.\nThe FDA isn\u2019t transparent or predictable in the way it\u2019s addressing their concerns, he added.\nThe Wisconsin company recently stopped making its Rush Creek Reserve due to concerns about FDA regulation, as reported by the Chicago Reader.\nThe artisanal cheese world in the U.S. is in danger of crumbling because of regulatory uncertainty from the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe FDA\u2019s goal is to avoid unsafe cheese, but there\u2019s little clarity about which direction it will go."}
