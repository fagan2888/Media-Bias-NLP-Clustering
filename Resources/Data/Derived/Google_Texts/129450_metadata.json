Last week the president\u2019s proposed budget tipped his hand, in that even though he says he has brought home over 90 percent of the ground troops from the Iraq-Afghanistan theater, there was no peace dividend in the proposed FY2016 spending plan.\n\nThe president\u2019s freshly minted National Security Strategy is first and foremost self-congratulatory and disconnected from reality. It reads like what could be the introduction to a sequel to the president\u2019s \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d which he could title \u201cI Did My Best Under the Circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlobally, we have moved beyond the large ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that defined so much of American foreign policy over the past decade. Compared to the nearly 180,000 troops we had in Iraq and Afghanistan when I took office we now have fewer than 15,000 deployed in those countries,\u201d the president writes. \u201cWe possess a military whose might, technology and geostrategic reach is unrivaled in human history.\u201d\n\nAnd so, the inference is those ground wars are over because, well, we say they are. Yet now, as the Times reports, the president has a new and improved kind of war he\u2019s selling. Now might be the time to pause and ask just what kind of practical real-world results has our unparalleled military machine produced so far?\n\nAll the Beltway reporting about the prospects of new war powers for the president focus on the parlor politics of whether he can get it through Congress, not on the efficacy of his strategy. Funny, how we insist on results-based assessments on everything else but lose all reason when we hear the battle bugles blare.\n\nAre we living in a safer world with a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya? Isn\u2019t there, as some experts have posited, a possible casual link between the way we prosecuted the war on terror so far, and the proliferation of violence so much of the world is still living with today? Did the U.S.\u2019s last 13 years of our \u201cshoot-\u2019em-up\u201d unilateralism with fuzzy justifications, because we were afraid, make it easier for Putin to flex his muscles because he\u2019s feeling insecure?\n\nSo just what did several thousand dead Americans, and at least tens of thousands of civilian casualties, plus a couple of trillion dollars get us?\n\nEven as the president says we are heading \u201chome\u201d from Iraq and Afghanistan records are being set for the numbers of killed and wounded civilians caught in these seething pits of sectarian violence we\u2019ve left behind. The U.N. reported last month that for 2014 in Iraq more than 12,000 civilians were killed in the deadliest year for noncombatants since 2008. In Afghanistan the U.N. Assistance Mission there said close to 3,200 civilians were killed and more than 6,400 wounded, the deadliest year since the conflict started.\n\nIn the president\u2019s 29-page National Security Strategy there is no mention of the fact that after thousands of lost American and Iraqi lives, and hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars, the Iraqi state we stood up came close to collapsing after a near-death experience at the hands of ISIL, a threat the U.S. did not see coming. Now, ever so quietly, the Obama administration is sending U.S. troops back in to Iraq.\n\nThere is some truth telling coming out of the federal government. According to the latest quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction the \u201cAfghan economy is weakening, government revenues are falling, far short of targets, and the need for foreign assistance to close the resulting fiscal gap is growing.\u201d At the same time the oversight agency reports external grants coming in are on the decline.\n\nThis deteriorating fiscal condition will leave the central government in Kabul precious little money for the gun buy-back program they will need. SIGAR recently reported that officials may have lost track of 43 percent of the almost half-million small arms the U.S. shipped into Afghanistan.\n\nSusan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security advisor, had a pretty frank appraisal on the facts on the ground for her audience at her briefing on the president\u2019s new National Security Strategy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cYes, it is a region where the violence is spilling across the borders, not only between Iraq and Syria frankly, but other nations in that same region.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we plan another war, it's time to ask: Just what kind of real-world results has our war machine produced so far?", "title": "\u201cWhat did thousands of dead Americans get us?\u201d Before granting war powers, let\u2019s see where the last two got us", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As we plan another war, it's time to ask: Just what kind of real-world results has our war machine produced so far?", "title": "\u201cWhat did thousands of dead Americans get us?\u201d Before granting war powers, let\u2019s see where the last two got us", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/what_did_thousands_of_dead_americans_get_us_before_granting_war_powers_lets_see_where_the_last_two_got_us/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/kerry_rumsfeld.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As we plan another war, it's time to ask: Just what kind of real-world results has our war machine produced so far?", "title": "\u201cWhat did thousands of dead Americans get us?\u201d Before granting war powers, let\u2019s see where the last two got us", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/kerry_rumsfeld.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Hennelly", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghanistan, aumf, Barack Obama, Budget, Iraq, ISIL, isis, mid east, War", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The president\u2019s freshly minted National Security Strategy is first and foremost self-congratulatory and disconnected from reality.\nAre we living in a safer world with a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya?\nSo just what did several thousand dead Americans, and at least tens of thousands of civilian casualties, plus a couple of trillion dollars get us?\nYet now, as the Times reports, the president has a new and improved kind of war he\u2019s selling.\nSusan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security advisor, had a pretty frank appraisal on the facts on the ground for her audience at her briefing on the president\u2019s new National Security Strategy at the Brookings Institution."}
