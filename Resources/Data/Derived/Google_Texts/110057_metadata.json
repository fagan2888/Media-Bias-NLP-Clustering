But when his monthly cost hit $1,800, he considered skipping it.\n\n\u201cI thought it was ridiculous, and especially for something as common as diabetes,\u201d he says.\n\nBill Young\u2019s co-pay with private insurance was running into the hundreds for kidney anti-rejection drugs.\n\n\u201cThis is medication I need to live,\u201d he says.\n\nBoth men went looking for help. Lambert found a federal program called 340B. Instead of $1,800, he now pays $34.\n\nYoung found a discount card on the drug manufacturer\u2019s website, and his cost dropped from $875 to $15.\n\n\u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d he says.\n\nEven the pharmacy where you pick up your prescriptions can save you money.\n\nYou can save an extra $10 to $30 using Walgreens\u2019 Prescription Savings Club. Other stores have similar programs.\n\nMany also offer common generic medications for less than $5. Some are even free.\n\nThe discounts are needed because according to a Kaiser report co-pays are skyrocketing forcing 41 percent of people to skip filling some prescriptions.\n\nMarlowe Djuric Kachlic of the University of Illinois Chicago College of Pharmacy says that since the Affordable Care Act, insurers offer more health plans with lower premiums, but higher deductibles.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is there\u2019s been a lot more help for patients,\u201d she says.\n\nApps like Good RX can point you to discounts.\n\nJanet Irvine got a card from her doctor, which took her $60 co-pay down to $25.\n\n\u201cGet your physician to see if they can help you out with making the cost of getting better a little less,\u201d Irvine says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As CBS 2\u2019s Dorothy Tucker reports, there are ways for everybody to save money on medicine.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/26/ways-to-save-money-on-your-prescription-drugs/", "image": {"width": 420, "secure_url": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/pills.jpg?w=420", "identifier": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/pills.jpg?w=420", "height": 315}, "type": "article", "description": "As CBS 2\u2019s Dorothy Tucker reports, there are ways for everybody to save money on medicine.", "title": "Ways To Save Money On Your Prescription Drugs"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/pills.jpg?w=420", "description": "As CBS 2\u2019s Dorothy Tucker reports, there are ways for everybody to save money on medicine.", "site": "CBSchicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ways To Save Money On Your Prescription Drugs"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Chicago - CBS 2 TV | WBBM Newsradio 780 | 670 The Score", "msvalidate.01": "0FD6BCBEF9479095CF623C15833E1E08", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Chicago", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago"}, "keywords": "prescription drugs, medicine", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/87568ef37c252bc5ea7c1d183167347b?s=16", "news_keywords": "dorothy tucker, prescription drugs, savings"}, "article_summary": "As CBS 2\u2019s Dorothy Tucker reports, there are ways for everybody to save money on medicine.\n(CBS) \u2014 It\u2019s a horrible choice for anybody to have to make, and half of Americans are doing it: skipping their prescription drugs because the co-pays are just too high.\nYou can save an extra $10 to $30 using Walgreens\u2019 Prescription Savings Club.\nEven the pharmacy where you pick up your prescriptions can save you money.\n\u201cGet your physician to see if they can help you out with making the cost of getting better a little less,\u201d Irvine says."}
