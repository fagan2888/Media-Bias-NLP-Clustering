A 16-year-old Westminster boy died Sunday afternoon almost two weeks after he set himself on fire in the cafeteria at Standley Lake High School, the Westminster Police Department said.

Vincent Nett was burned over 80 percent of his body, and about 40 percent of the burns were third-degree, a Westminster Fire Department spokeswoman said after the Jan. 27 incident.

He died just before 5 p.m. Sunday, Westminster police said.

Witnesses said Nett entered the cafeteria at 7:12 a.m. carrying a 1-gallon Coleman fuel jug. When he set himself on fire, there were more than 60 students present.

None of the other students were injured, but a school worker was cut breaking glass to retrieve a fire extinguisher.

Nett posted a suicide note on his Facebook page.

“This is not someone’s fault, I had this planned for years so shut your face if you think that this was because of something recent or because of someone,” he wrote. “There was nothing that anyone could have done.”

Counselors will be available to students at the school Monday, the police department said.
