Our early human ancestors were more concerned with hunting and gathering and not getting eaten by bears than they were with elections, Gallup polls and hating on Obamacare.\n\nBut it is safe to say that the ideologies associated with each political leaning goes well beyond the ballot box.\n\nIn 2008, researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, conducted a study with a group of 26 adults with \u201cstrong political beliefs\u201d to determine if there was a correlation between physical sensitivities and political beliefs. The researchers discovered that individuals with lower physical sensitivities to sudden noises and threatening visual images were more likely to support \u201cliberal\u201d issues such as foreign aid, open immigration policies, pacifism, and gun control, while those displaying higher physiological reactions to those same stimuli were more likely to favor \u201cconservative\u201d issues such as high defense spending, capital punishment, patriotism, and the Iraq War.\n\nThe research indicated that people who have strong basic emotional responses to threats tend to develop more conservative political views.\n\nA separate UK study concluded that \u201csubstantial differences exist in the cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures.\u201d The researchers found that conservatives tended to have larger amygdalas, a part of the brain that learns emotional responses.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House, Tip O\u2019Neill, once coined the now-famous phrase: \u201cAll politics is local.\u201d Perhaps it would be more accurate to say: \u201cAll politics is emotional.\u201d\n\nWhat does emotion have to do with genetics? Well, everything. According to biopsychologist Victor Johnston, author of Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions, emotions are not an accident of nature but are the basis of learning and reasoning, which helps us to adapt to a complex, rapidly changing environment. What we see, hear, smell and feel is has been shaped by millions of years of evolution.\n\nRemarkably, it is even possible to predict the future political proclivities in children. In 1969, Jack and Jeanne Block, psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley devised an experiment aimed at determining how deep our political leanings run and how early in life these leanings begin to form. The Blocks placed a group of 128 nursery school children under the close observation of several teachers for a period of seven months. Each of the caretakers then measured the three-year-olds\u2019 personalities and social interactions, using a single standardized test. At age four, the same children underwent this process again with a different set of teachers at a second nursery school. After cataloguing the scores for each child, the Blocks locked the numbers away.\n\nSeveral decades later, in 2005 the results were published by the Journal of Research in Personality. According to the study\u2019s abstract:\n\n\u201cPreschool children who 20 years later were relatively liberal were characterized as: developing close relationships,self-reliant, energetic, somewhat dominating, relatively under-controlled, and resilient. Preschool children subsequently relatively conservative at age 23 were described as: feeling easily victimized, easily offended, indecisive, fearful, rigid, inhibited, and relatively over-controlled and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEach of us has around 20,000 genes, the working subunits of DNA that contains a particular set of instructions, usually coding for a particular protein or for a particular function. In layman\u2019s terms, genes determine everything about who we are, such as if we are short or tall, have blue eyes or brown eyes, or can roll our tongues or not.\n\nThe evidence shows genetics indeed affects our personal politics, but there is no \u201cpolitical gene.\u201d You could not isolate a \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d gene and insert them into an embryo to produce a Hillary Clinton- or Rand Paul-loving baby. Rather, genes provide the biological context which guides, through emotion, how we interact with our environment and ultimately determines what we believe.\n\nBased in San Francisco, Mike Hower is a writer, thinker and strategic communicator that revels in driving the conversation at the intersection of sustainability, tech, politics and law.
