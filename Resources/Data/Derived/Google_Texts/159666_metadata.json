The coalition aims to draw attention to what it calls \"moral\" legislation, such as strengthening voting rights, gun control, affordable housing, reproductive rights and public education.\n\n\"The Georgia state government\u2019s right-wing agenda promotes corporate greed over people\u2019s needs; denies healthcare to over 600,000 uninsured Georgians; has cut over $7.6 billion from public education in the past 10 years; accelerates income inequality by restricting workers\u2019 rights and benefits; attacks women\u2019s reproductive freedom; promotes bigotry towards the LGBT community; enables gun violence through 'Stand Your Ground' and 'Carry Anywhere' laws; and seeks to restrict our voting rights,\" the coalition explained in a press release sent last week.\n\nThe group says this is the ninth such protest that has been organized in conjunction with the NAACP this legislative session.\n\nTwenty-three activists were arrested at a protest at the state capitol last week as they protested legislative resistance to repealing Georgia's \"Stand Your Ground\" law:\n\nHuge crowd flooding the GA Capitol at @MoralMondayGA \"The people united will never be defeated!\" @AtlantaJwJ @ncnaacp pic.twitter.com/vqMhaDlwlK \u2014 Raise Up For 15 (@RaiseUpfor15) March 10, 2014\n\nThis week's rally, scheduled for 1 p.m. on Tuesday, will feature local religious, labor and community leaders, including the Rev.
