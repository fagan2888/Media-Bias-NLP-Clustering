In today\u2019s edition, we make the rounds at a Memphis hospital, look in on \u2018The Most Prevaricating Man in the World,\u201d check Bill Belichick\u2019s basketball pulse and find out if Jim Calhoun has had a change of heart. Without further ado:\n\n___\n\nWOULD A WIN BE TOO MUCH TO ASK?\n\nAfter what she went through the other night, 81-year-old Memphis resident Colleen Beck isn\u2019t going to let three broken ribs and a collapsed lung keep her from watching her beloved Tigers play Virginia on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a tough old bird,\u201d Bob Beck, her son, told The Commercial Appeal. \u201cThey did a CT scan and found out the lung was collapsed. They had to put a needle between the ribs, insert it into the lung and fill it up with air.\u201d\n\nBut first, Colleen Beck asked the emergency room doctors at Methodist Hospital, \u201cCould we wait until we see how this ends?\u201d\n\nBy \u201cthis,\u201d she meant the basketball game on the overhead TV. The one that was showing Memphis battling George Washington on Friday for a spot in the second round.\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Colleen Beck said, \u201cit didn\u2019t take much persuading. Everyone wanted to watch.\u201d\n\nBeck suffered the injuries after falling at home Wednesday, but couldn\u2019t get an appointment until Friday. Referred to the emergency room, she drove herself to Methodist instead. As soon as the Tigers had the game locked up, the doctors ordered the room cleared and went to work on Beck.\n\nUncomfortable after the surgery, but otherwise fine, she plans to watch Sunday night\u2019s game in her hospital room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx \u2019em. I think I\u2019ll just keep my mouth shut on that one. But it would just be wonderful if they could do it,\u201d Beck said finally, \u201cit really would.\u201d\n\n___\n\n\u2018THE MOST PREVARICATING MAN IN THE WORLD.\u2019\n\nBracketRacket has often wondered how NCAA president Mark Emmert gazes into the mirror every morning without cracking up.\n\nHe\u2019s a tone-deaf monarch whose organization is being sued left and right, mostly by former college players seeking a few crumbs from the ever-expanding NCAA revenue pie they helped bake. Making money \u2014 and keeping plenty \u2014 might be the only thing the NCAA has done right since he showed up in 2010.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that during a contentious question-and-answer session following last year\u2019s \u201cState of the NCAA\u201d address, Emmert described his tenure this way: \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting sued today, you\u2019re not doing anything,\u201d\n\nSo naturally, he doubled down this year with yet another self-serving commercial mythologizing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d \u2014 an increasingly rare specimen in big-time college basketball and football, which provide nearly every penny of the NCAA\u2019s $6 billion annual budget, not to mention Emmert\u2019s nearly $2 million compensation package. And just as naturally, the commercial mostly features distance runners, soccer players, gymnasts and rowers.\n\nWe see them fail at first and then finally succeed. A solemn voice-over calls them \u201cthe provoked, the determined, the unified.\u201d But just like basketball and football players, you could also accurately call them as \u201cthe unpaid.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not time nor space to litigate the \u201cpay-for-play\u201d issue here; that\u2019s why we have courts. But if you\u2019re up early before Sunday\u2019s games with nothing to do, catch Emmert defending his version of shamateurism on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nEspecially if you happen to be a lawyer.\n\n___\n\nCELEBRITY ALUM OF THE DAY\u2014 NOT!\n\nYou know this guy: http://bit.ly/1h7AbDz\n\nHe was watching Florida overpower Pitt, but he\u2019s really a football guy and besides, his B.A. in economics is from Wesleyan University and not Florida, despite the \u201cGators\u201d logo on his visor.\n\nOK, so maybe he\u2019s just a huge fan of \u201cSwamp Brothers.\u201d\n\nBut even that may not explain what New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was doing Saturday in Orlando, Fla.\n\n\u201cWell, he put the scouting report in today,\u201d Gators coach Billy Donovan said after the game.\n\n\u201cCoach has been great to me,\u201d Donovan continued, once the laughter died down. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many years it\u2019s been, I went to Boston and met with him maybe after their third Super Bowl and have developed a very, very good relationship with him and got a great respect for him.\n\n\u201cHe was in Gainesville, I guess. It may have been a pro day or watching practice, and he called me and said he wanted to come down for the game. I left him a couple tickets.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Patric Young stands 6-foot-9, weighs 240 pounds and is such a good athlete that he\u2019s often described \u2014 in sporting parlance \u2014 as a \u201cbeast.\u201d The senior center is projected as a second-round NBA pick, but last year Young showed up at Florida football practice and looked good enough catching passes to touch off speculation he could play tight end in the NFL.\n\nNew England\u2019s incumbent at that position, perpetual party animal Rob Gronkowski, hasn\u2019t been healthy enough to count on recently and is up to his usual offseason antics (video courtesy of TMZ here: http://tmz.me/OJ2nG9 ). Another of Belichick\u2019s once-outstanding (and now former) tight ends, Aaron Hernandez, is in jail facing murder charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Put the scalpel down and turn up the volume.
