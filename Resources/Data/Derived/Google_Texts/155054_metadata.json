David Ige (D).\n\nThe state invested $130 million in the Connector, but the exchange has been plagued by low enrollment numbers and technological issues, making it noncompliant with the federal requirements outlined in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt was a failed project,\" state Sen. Sam Slom (R) told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \"It was a boondoggle from the very beginning, and our residents deserve better than that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hawaii Health Connector CEO Jeff Kissel, Hawaii's health exchange will become a state-run exchange that uses HealthCare.gov, which is similar to the setup in Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon.\n\n\"The viability of state health insurance exchanges has been a challenge across the country,\" Ige said in a statement, \"particularly in small states due to insufficient numbers of uninsured residents.\"\n\nUnder Hawaii's Prepaid Healthcare Act of 1974, businesses in the state are required to offer health insurance to employees who work more than 20 hours per week. As a result, Hawaii has consistently had one of the lowest uninsured rates in the country.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
