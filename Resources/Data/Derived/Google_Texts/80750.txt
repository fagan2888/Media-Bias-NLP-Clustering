US bishops' key pro-life staffer retiring after 36 years

April 28, 2016

Richard Doerflinger, who has served on the US bishops’ pro-life committee for 36 years, will retire on April 29.

Beginning as a legislative assistant, Doerflinger earned several promotions, eventually becoming associate director of the pro-life secretariat at the US bishops’ conference. Over the years he became a fixture in pro-life activities in Washington, DC.

Looking back across his tenure in a CNS interview, Doerflinger reflected on the successes:

The high points would involve the passage of the ban on partial-birth abortion and the Supreme Court decision upholding that ban, the Weldon Amendment on conscience rights in 1994 and the Dickey Amendment on federal funding of embryo research in 1995.

He also recalled some low points of his experience, including the failure to block funding of abortion under Obamacare and to enact a ban on human cloning or restraints on assisted suicide.
