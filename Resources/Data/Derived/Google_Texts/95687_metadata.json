Players wear pink on their uniforms to show support for those diagnosed with breast cancer and to stimulate greater awareness.\n\nEach November, our country celebrates National Alzheimer\u2019s Awareness Month. The Broncos can wear purple in November to show support for all those diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and to stimulate greater awareness. Bronco announcers can promote Alzheimer\u2019s awareness.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s is the sixth-leading cause of death in this country, and the only disease among the top 10 killers that has no effective means of prevention, treatment, or cure. In September 2012, the federal Centers for Disease Control issued a report based upon a study of nearly 3,500 NFL retirees that concluded, \u201cNFL players are three times as likely as the general population to die from a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that honoring Pat Bowlen and more than 5 million other Americans dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s would be a natural fit for the Broncos, as well as for all NFL teams. Broncos and all NFL radio and TV broadcasts in November can increase awareness to help find a way to prevent, treat, and finally cure Alzheimer\u2019s. That would be a wonderful tribute to Bowlen and an immense public service to others.\n\nCancer is a horrible disease. My mother died of cancer. I hope that NFL players continue wearing pink and NFL announcers continue promoting cancer awareness and research every October. But Alzheimer\u2019s is also a horrible disease. My wife has Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nI hope that Bronco players begin wearing purple and NFL announcers begin promoting Alzheimer\u2019s awareness and research each November.\n\nPink is extremely important. So is purple.\n\nAllan Vann lives in Commack, N.Y.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bowlen, Broncos can raise awareness of Alzheimer\u2019s", "title": "Bowlen, Broncos can raise awareness of Alzheimer\u2019s", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/bowlen-broncos-can-raise-awareness-of-alzheimers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__20140728_Z00_OP28G_VANNp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__20140728_Z00_OP28G_VANNp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T15:57:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:24:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe32ed\"", "article_summary": "I hope that NFL players continue wearing pink and NFL announcers continue promoting cancer awareness and research every October.\nI hope that Bronco players begin wearing purple and NFL announcers begin promoting Alzheimer\u2019s awareness and research each November.\nBronco announcers can promote Alzheimer\u2019s awareness.\nEach November, our country celebrates National Alzheimer\u2019s Awareness Month.\nEach October, the Broncos and all NFL teams promote breast cancer awareness."}
