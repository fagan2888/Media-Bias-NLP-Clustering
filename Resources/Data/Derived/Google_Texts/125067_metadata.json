They do this because it\u2019s less complicated than dealing with an official health insurance plan, however, after July 1, they may be fined hundreds of dollars each day.\n\nThis is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses that are unaware of it, say business groups.\n\nWatchdog.org quoted Kevin Kuhlman, policy director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest penalty that no one is talking about. The penalty for compensating employees for health care-related expenses is enough to destroy most small businesses. It\u2019s hard to believe Congress or the President intended to punish employers much more severely for actually helping their workers, nevertheless, that\u2019s the consequence and most small businesses don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nKuhlman says that reimbursing employees for the cost of insurance or medical services is a way for small businesses to help their workers without the administrative headache of setting up a costly group plan. Most small employers don\u2019t have HR departments or benefits specialists, so this is a simpler, easier way to help their employees.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity for a bipartisan improvement toward affordable healthcare, this has to be it,\u201d said Kuhlman. \u201cThere\u2019s no real justification for penalizing small businesses that do what the law\u2019s strongest supporters claim to want, which is to help employees obtain coverage or pay medical bills. This is a rigid and thoughtless bureaucratic rule that undermines the purpose of the law, and it ought to be repealed immediately.\u201d\n\nThe penalties only affect businesses with fewer than 50 employees because those with more than 50 employees are already required to offer a health insurance plan. The rule is based on an IRS interpretation of part of Obamacare that seems intended to force employers to offer a group health insurance plan or dump their employees onto the health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe prohibition against employer reimbursements should have started last year but the IRS postponed implementing it until July 1.\n\nThere has been bipartisan support in Congress for eliminating the penalty on small businesses, but bills have failed to gain any traction.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote on his website in January, \u201cI\u2019ll keep looking for opportunities to fix this problem. Small businesses shouldn\u2019t face steep penalties just for trying to help their employees. This is the kind of problem Obamacare created because it was poorly thought out.\u201d\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is managing editor of Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b6e\"", "article_summary": "This is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses that are unaware of it, say business groups.\nThere has been bipartisan support in Congress for eliminating the penalty on small businesses, but bills have failed to gain any traction.\nThe penalty for compensating employees for health care-related expenses is enough to destroy most small businesses.\nSmall businesses shouldn\u2019t face steep penalties just for trying to help their employees.\nThey do this because it\u2019s less complicated than dealing with an official health insurance plan, however, after July 1, they may be fined hundreds of dollars each day."}
