Remains of an 18-year-old woman who went missing in December were found Saturday by Mesa County officials near Cactus Park.

Kelly Mae Myers, of Grand Junction, was reported missing by her family in late December. An autopsy was completed by the Mesa County Coroner’s Office on Sunday, but the cause of death has not yet been released.

“At this time, it is considered a suspicious death investigation,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release.

The sheriff’s office first released a statement about Myers on Jan. 19, noting that her family had not heard from her since Dec. 18. The last activity on her Facebook account was logged on Dec. 17.

Investigators received reports that Myers may have been attempting to hitchhike to the Salt Lake City area, where she has friends. At the time of the Jan. 19 statement, Myers’ family members said it was unusual behavior for her and expressed their concern.

The sheriff’s office said further information about this case will be released as it becomes available.
