What is jaw-dropping is that Iowa ranks eighth (for a $300,000 home) and ninth (for a $150,000 home) among the highest property taxes in the nation. Example: Des Moines commands $6,242 on a $300,000 home compared with the national average of $4,130. (Cite the Minnesota Taxpayers Association 50-state property study 2010.) Taking in account all the counties in the nation, Iowa can boast 10 of the largest counties (Linn, Johnson, Blackhawk and Polk included). These are in the top 10 percent nationwide for the highest tax or millage rate. (See www.limitedgovernment.org/brief20-7html).

Why is Iowa taxing so much compared with the other states?

Can the people directly responsible — the county supervisors, city council members, school board members and lawmakers — justify this without a dress rehearsal in front of a mirror and posturing for the public?

Everyone is receiving new tax assessments in the mail. The majority of people think property taxes are way too high.

So what's the answer? Extreme, unrelenting pressure to all entities responsible would be a start.
