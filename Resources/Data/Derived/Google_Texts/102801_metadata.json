For now, though, fresh off the plane in Manchester, frontman Dylan Baldi took a few minutes to chat about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.\n\nBonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & More\n\n\"I used to not like this at all,\" Baldi tells Billboard of the festival circuit, a far cry from the DIY house shows that birthed the Cleveland quartet, \"but then I started thinking, 'Well, not many people get a chance to even play at stuff like this,' so it's exciting, in its own way.\"\n\n\"We only play stuff from the most recent two records,\" he continued, \"and luckily those records are a half hour long each, so we can just play 'em both, pretty much all the way through, every song. It's really rewarding to know that working really hard at something for a long time actually pays off. It's nice to know that that's real.\"\n\nNext week, the band heads to the Phillippines, Thailand and Japan for a short splash of Asia dates before continuing their tour through the west and Midwest U.S. Check out more Bonnaroo video interviews and performances below.\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Fresh off the plane in Manchester, Cloud Nothings' frontman Dylan Baldi talks to Billboard about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Cloud Nothings' Dylan Baldi Talks Hard Work, Adjusting to Festival Stages (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121379/bonnaroo-2014-cloud-nothings-dylan-baldi-talks-hard-work", "image": {"width": 617, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/stylus/1508269-cloud-nothings-ryan-manning-617-409.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 409}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fresh off the plane in Manchester, Cloud Nothings' frontman Dylan Baldi talks to Billboard about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Cloud Nothings' Dylan Baldi Talks Hard Work, Adjusting to Festival Stages (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121379/bonnaroo-2014-cloud-nothings-dylan-baldi-talks-hard-work", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/stylus/1508269-cloud-nothings-ryan-manning-617-409.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Fresh off the plane in Manchester, Cloud Nothings' frontman Dylan Baldi talks to Billboard about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Cloud Nothings' Dylan Baldi Talks Hard Work, Adjusting to Festival Stages at Bonnaroo 2014 (Video) | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ba4\"", "article_summary": "For now, though, fresh off the plane in Manchester, frontman Dylan Baldi took a few minutes to chat about the benefits of writing short records, adjusting to and the rewards of hard work.\nCheck out more Bonnaroo video interviews and performances below.\nIt's really rewarding to know that working really hard at something for a long time actually pays off.\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video\n\"We only play stuff from the most recent two records,\" he continued, \"and luckily those records are a half hour long each, so we can just play 'em both, pretty much all the way through, every song."}
