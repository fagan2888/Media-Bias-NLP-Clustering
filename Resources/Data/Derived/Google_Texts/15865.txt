A parade of military helicopters flew over MetLife Stadium in formation yesterday afternoon and last night in a practice run for Sunday’s Super Bowl.





From The Jersey Journal’s new headquarters in Secaucus, Journal photographer Molly Smith snapped shots of the formation and Deputy Managing Editor Ron Zeitlinger shot video as they flew from the stadium eastward. Then at 6:15 p.m., the nine helicopters, hardly visible in the dark, made another pass.

According to CNN, nine helicopters will participate in Sunday’s flyover at a cost of $100,000.

Earlier this week, residents of some Essex County communities received reverse-911 calls from County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo advising them not to worry if they saw military helicopters taking off from Essex County Airport; it was all part of the Super Bowl festivities.
