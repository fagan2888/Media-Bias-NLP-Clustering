However, S&P said it is too soon to assess recent volatility in investment markets on the nonprofit sector's credit quality.\n\nS&P also considered the sector's challenges, such as continued uncertainty on multiple fronts and the expectation of longer term revenue pressures.\n\nS&P's outlook upgrade comes about two weeks after Moody's Investors Service revised its outlook on the U.S. nonprofit healthcare sector to stable from negative.\n\nMore articles on healthcare finance:\n\nAHA backs bundled payment approach for joint replacement, but with changes\n\nWhy HCA is taking the road less traveled when it comes to expansion\n\nCleveland Clinic Q2 operating margin grows: 5 things to know\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
