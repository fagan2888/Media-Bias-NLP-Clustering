You’ve probably been pooping wrong your whole life, but fear not, because the makers of the Squatty Potty have enlisted the help of a mythical unicorn to set you back on the path for a healthy colon.

In an effort to promote a poop-related product without grossing consumers out too much, Squatty Potty — a handy foot stool that fits into the base of your toilet seat and is designed to make it easier to have a bowel movement — compared poop to something a bit more palatable: soft serve ice cream that falls effortlessly from a unicorn’s backside. Though strange, the idea quickly went viral, with over eight million views since it was posted in early October.

But while a rainbow ice cream pooping unicorn is entertaining, is there any science behind the Squatty Potty’s actual design? Apparently, yes. The human body was designed to defecate in a squatting position, something that gets lost during modern pooping habits, The Guardian reported. When we squat, we take pressure off from our bottoms. Too much pressure on the anus can cause individuals to develop uncomfortable and sometimes painful hemorrhoids, or swollen veins in the anal canal. These hemorrhoids occur both from strained bowel movements and come about when we spend too much time on the toilet — two behaviors the Squatty Potty claims to correct.

The Squatty Potty company was launched in 2011 and received funding from Shark Tank last November, Newser reported. Now, thanks to the viral video, created by The Harmon Brothers, the same company behind 2013’s Poo Pourri, the affordable and discreet toilet stools are getting more exposure than ever before.
