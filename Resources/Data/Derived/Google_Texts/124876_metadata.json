Last year, they lost in the Hobby Lobby case, and they lost again in the Wheaton College case,\u201d said Blomberg.\n\nIn EWTN v. Burwell, heard last Wednesday, the Catholic media standard-bearer challenges a key provision in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a.k.a. \u201cObamacare\u201d\u2014 which requires even Catholic-run EWTN to cover the cost of abortion-inducing drugs and sterilization procedures in employer-sponsored health care plans\u2026 or face massive government fines.\n\nWhile religious organizations are supposedly \u201cexempt\u201d from the mandate, neither EWTN nor the Little Sisters of the Poor are deemed \u201creligious enough\u201d for the exemption.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor await a decision from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, one of the significant federal cases pro-life advocates are watching closely.\n\nCloistered nun Mother Angelica founded Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) in 1981, with an unwavering mission to serve the Catholic Church and broadcast its teachings.\n\nNot formally affiliated with any diocese, the nonprofit EWTN has become the world\u2019s largest religious media network. To comply with the HHS abortion-related mandate would be a clear violation of deeply held religious convictions \u2014 that every life, including of a pre-born baby developing in the womb, has precious value and is worthy of legal protection.\n\nAs EWTN challenges the Obama Administration\u2019s mandate, an important question emerges: will these three judges have a sympathetic ear on the issues of life and religious liberty?\n\nIn a new interview, EWTN General Counsel John Manos indicates that two of the three 11th Circuit judges seemed receptive to their claims regarding free exercise of religious beliefs.\n\nThe two senior judges, Robert Lanier Anderson and Gerald Tjoflat, were appointed to serve federal courts decades ago and are considered moderate by many observers. Judge Jill Pryor is the newest addition to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed by President Obama in 2014.\n\nManos said there is one question often ignored by media reporting on these cases: \u201cWhere do individuals who don\u2019t want to pay for this go to get their health insurance?\u201d Under current policy, even the government\u2019s eighth attempt at religious accommodation triggers insurance provisions for abortion-related services.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nWith over 140 religious nonprofit groups seeking relief from the HHS abortion-related mandate, knowing when the U.S. Supreme Court will weigh in becomes only a matter of time and sequence.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s this term or next term, one of these cases is going to get to the Supreme Court,\u201d said Michael Carvin of Jones Day, one of the legal firms involved in these cases. \u201cBecause the stakes are very important.\u201d Clearly these challenges to the HHS mandate are pivotal in the fight to protect religious liberties in America.\n\nA recent video tells the story of Eternal Word Television Network, revealing why it is vital for this faith-based nonprofit to be able to practice what it preaches:\n\nMarisa Lengor Kwaning is a writer, editor and health policy analyst who resides in Washington, D.C.
