The Rockies memorialized his tumble in chalk.\n\nAnd the mystery of his demise ran through to the deepest of conspiracies.\n\nButler on Friday got on base for the first time in his career, with a one-out bunt. He ate dirt \u2014 twice \u2014 before he got back to the dugout. Butler moved to second after Charlie Blackmon singled to center. Then DJ LeMahieu hit a line drive to right. That sent Butler charging for third. He could have scored with little trouble.\n\nBut the rookie pitcher, rumblin\u2019 and tumblin\u2019, stumbled in the dirt before he reached third. Blackmon raced right behind him. Butler got up, rounded the base, then bumbled again, face first, in the dirt. He was tagged out. But the Rockies went on to win, 6-5.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I chuckled at the time. But I certainly did afterward,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cThat might make him famous. He\u2019ll be on a lot of highlights.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nOn Saturday, chalk outlines of his fall showed up, in front of third and after, and in the tunnel from Colorado\u2019s clubhouse to the dugout. And when Butler took the field for pre-game stretching, the Coors Field PA booth played \u201cI\u2019ll Tumble 4 Ya\u201d by the Culture Club.\n\nBut who was responsible? The Butler didn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cI figure it was (Brandon) Barnes or (LaTroy) Hawkins,\u201d Butler said.\n\nHawkins, when told Butler blamed him, said: \u201cHe did?!\u201d\n\nBarnes, when faced with the allegation, said: \u201cI was going to, but it was already out here.\u201d\n\nWeiss also didn\u2019t know who drew the chalk. \u201cI wish I would have thought of that. They were appropriate.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Zapruder-level video surfaced from Root Sports broadcaster Cory Sullivan. The grainy footage, shot from the grassy knoll near the third base dugout, shows Coors Field head groundskeeper Mark Razum painting the outlines.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get hurt and we won, so it\u2019s funny now,\u201d Butler said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "clubhouse,Cory Sullivan,Eddie Butler,Mark Razum", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Eddie Butler's base-running adventure at Coors Field turned into a crime scene.
