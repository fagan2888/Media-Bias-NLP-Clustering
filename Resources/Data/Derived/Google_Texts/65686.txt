As expected, "Saturday Night Live" spoofed the recent infamous President Barack Obama's speech at Nelson Mandela's memorial. A sign language interpreter, played by Kenan Thompson, took everything literally what Obama, played by Jay Pharoah, said, and communicated it in the way he understood.



The President's trip to Mandela's memorial service in Johannesburg, South Africa made headlines earlier this week when a phony sign language interpreter made up gestures. In a press conference, Pharoah's Obama addressed the progress of his ObamaCare website, explained his selfie picture with fellow world leaders, and his controversial handshake with Cuban President Raul Castro.



Obama was addressing the phony sign language interpreter incident and HealthCare.Gov when Thompson appeared behind him and mimicked his words. The interpreter pretended to shoot webs like Spider-Man when translating the word "website". He also translated "thrilled" with Michael Jackson's "Thriller" moves. Later, he began rubbing his nipples as Obama said, "I'm just relieved the website has been turned on again."



The December 14 episode presented John Goodman as host and Kings of Leon as musical guest. Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro guested as two of three wise men meeting baby Jesus in a Christmas-themed sketch.
