At 5 feet 6 inches, Bonaparte would not have been the \u201cLittle Corporal\u201d he was nicknamed by his enemies. He would have been close to the average height of a Frenchman in the early 19th century, the author said.\n\nAndrew Roberts Where: Literary Evenings, Monday Night Lecture Series at Carnegie Music Hall, Oakland.

That small opening allowed him to keep an eye on the British sentries assigned to watch him.\n\nMr. Roberts, who is himself 5 feet 6 inches, found that the hole was made at exactly the right height for Napoleon to observe the guards.\n\nMr. Roberts will speak at 7:30 p.m. Monday in Oakland\u2019s Carnegie Music Hall. His \u201cLiterary Evenings, Monday Night Lecture Series\u201d talk is part of a 10-author series presented by Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures.\n\nMr. Roberts, 51, was born in London and educated at Cambridge University. He is the author of more than a dozen books and the editor of several more. His previous works include two related histories: \u201cNapoleon and Wellington\u201d and \u201cWaterloo: June 15, 1815.\u201d\n\nHe also has written for many British and American newspapers and has appeared as a television presenter and commentator.\n\nMr. Roberts said there had been many more books written with the word \u201cNapoleon\u201d in their titles than there have been days since he died 193 years ago. Why another?\n\nMr. Roberts said his is the first one-volume life to appear in English since the publication of all 33,000 of Napoleon\u2019s letters. The varied correspondence shows what Mr. Roberts called the \u201cextraordinary compartmentalization\u201d of Napoleon\u2019s mind and his ability to pursue multiple goals and interests simultaneously.\n\nBorn Napoleone di Buonaparte in 1769 on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, his parents were of Italian ancestry.\n\nTrained as a soldier, the young Napoleon had a meteoric rise in the years after the French Revolution. His many military victories allowed him to seize power, initially as France\u2019s First Consul and later as Emperor of the French.\n\nCritics have complained that despite his many battlefield triumphs, Napoleon appears to have had a pattern of abandoning armies in trouble. Mr. Roberts said Bonaparte\u2019s conscience and reputation should remain clean on that point.\n\nWhen Napoleon returned to France in 1799 after an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Egypt, he was needed desperately at home to fight Austria.\n\n\u201cHe was the nation\u2019s best general,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t abandoning his troops but marching toward the sound of the guns.\u201d\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon led an apparently successful invasion of Russia, capturing Moscow. When the Russians declined to negotiate, he and his Grande Armee were forced to make a winter retreat.\n\nOnce again, it made military and political sense for Napoleon to leave the struggling army and hurry back to Paris, Mr. Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThere was no point in his being isolated in central Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cThe army had to be rebuilt and that rebuilding could only take place in Paris.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Bonaparte didn\u2019t have second thoughts. Looking back during his years in exile, Napoleon expressed regret that he hadn\u2019t been killed during his 1812 victory at the Battle of Borodino outside Moscow, Mr. Roberts said.\n\nNapoleon was deposed and exiled twice. The first time was in 1814 to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean, and then after his defeat at Waterloo in 1815 to far off St. Helena.\n\nNapoleon and the world would have been much better off had the ex-emperor remained on Elba, Mr. Roberts said. The deaths of an additional 100,000 soldiers and civilians would have been avoided, and Napoleon would have had a much more comfortable exile \u201cin a lovely palace on a sun-drenched island.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mr. Roberts, who speaks here Monday night, has written the first one-volume life of Napolean since the publication of his 33,000 letters.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "When no one was looking, author Andrew Roberts lay down on the bed in which Napoleon Bonaparte died.
