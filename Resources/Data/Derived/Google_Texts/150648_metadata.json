The council held a special study session last week and will consider possible solutions within four to six months.\n\nParking is an ongoing source of squabbles. Robert Jones, the director of EPA CAN DO, a community development organization focused on affordable housing, pointed out the obvious: cars often come with people. Secondary dwellings have led to vehicles spilling over from parking spots to sidewalks, he said. \u201dNow, [children] have to walk on the streets \u2026 so it becomes unsafe.\u201d\n\nCity officials say they are even more concerned about units that fail to meet building and fire codes. These range from garage conversions without proper plumbing to rented tool sheds lacking electricity and insulation.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there is the community and human need for housing, which in this area is ruthless,\u201d East Palo Alto Mayor Ruben Abrica said. \u201cThe other frame is the responsibility we have as a government to make sure that codes are not being violated.\u201d\n\nAccording to city officials, the median house price is $450,000 and median rents for a one-bedroom apartment exceed $2,000. Those prices are out of reach for a number of residents in East Palo Alto, where median income is barely above $50,000 a year.\n\nAbrica emphasized that the city wants to get people to comply with housing regulations, not to displace them. \u201cTo me, what does that do? That creates more homelessness,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth and safety inspections generally are triggered by complaints. Based on a single complaint, a dwelling can be inspected when \u201dthe house down the street could be 10 times worse, but nobody complains about them,\u201d said the Rev. Lawrence C. Goode of Saint Francis of Assisi Church. Goode called on the city to add inspectors to more effectively determine whether secondary dwelling units are safe.\n\nAngel Santuario, a community leader for Peninsula Interfaith Action, believes the majority of complaints fall under the category of personal animosity. \u201cThat\u2019s where it gets really ugly,\u201d Santuario said. \u201cMost of the reports that are made are because people are upset for some reason with their neighbor or their landlord. It\u2019s not really based on the safety of the unit. It\u2019s more like I don\u2019t like this neighbor, so I\u2019m going to tell on him.\u201d\n\nAngelica Rubio, an East Palo Alto resident, lived in a friend\u2019s garage conversion between 2008 and 2010. She said efforts should be focused on providing additional affordable housing and on making secondary dwelling units comply with city codes.\n\nRubio, who no longer lives there, described the converted garage as the cheapest place she could find for the space available. For $400 a month, she had a studio-size bedroom equipped with a bathroom and kitchen. The same unit now goes for between $600 and $700 a month, she said.\n\nBoth Jones and Santuario said that while some secondary dwelling units are legal, others present unsafe living conditions. In many cases, occupants are too frightened to complain due to fear of eviction or the prospect of having to spend thousands of dollars to bring the units up to standards, according to Santuario.\n\n\u201cWe have meetings and most people don\u2019t put down their address,\u201d Santuario said.\n\nAbrica, the mayor, cautioned that the city is in the early stages of gathering information and deciding how to proceed. \u201cAt some point the staff will summarize the main points that come up and present some options,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the council will weigh in \u2026 that may involve changing codes that we can change.\u201d\n\nThe strategy inevitably will take into account the growing housing pressures in the Bay Area, including the new Facebook campus in east Menlo Park and its potential to drive up property values nearby.\n\n\u201cIn the bigger picture, because of the economic forces, working-class and moderate-income communities are going through the same thing we are going through across this country,\u201d Abrica said. \u201cWe are not an island. We\u2019re interconnected with this whole region and we end up suffering the consequences. And this is one of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable housing,East Palo Alto,East Palo Alto City Council,EPA CAN DO,garage conversions,Housing,Marianne Levine,Mayor Ruben Abrica,Peninsula Interfaith Action,Saint Francis of Assisi Church,secondary dwelling units,Frontpage Featured,Politics & Gov", "description": "Complaints over parking, noise and safety issues tied to \u201csecondary dwelling units\u201d \u2013 sometimes the only option for low-income residents \u2014 have prompted\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "Those prices are out of reach for a number of residents in East Palo Alto, where median income is barely above $50,000 a year.\nShe said efforts should be focused on providing additional affordable housing and on making secondary dwelling units comply with city codes.\nGoode called on the city to add inspectors to more effectively determine whether secondary dwelling units are safe.\nBoth Jones and Santuario said that while some secondary dwelling units are legal, others present unsafe living conditions.\n\u201cOn the one hand, there is the community and human need for housing, which in this area is ruthless,\u201d East Palo Alto Mayor Ruben Abrica said."}
