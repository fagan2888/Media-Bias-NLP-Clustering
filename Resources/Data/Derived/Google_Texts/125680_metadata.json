He doesn\u2019t feel the need to make his presence known. But this season, especially in the Broncos\u2019 30-24 overtime victory against New England last Sunday, the eighth-year pro has done just that.\n\nWith 1:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, Caldwell caught a 4-yard, go-ahead touchdown pass from Brock Osweiler before the Broncos sealed their victory in overtime.\n\nA week earlier, in a victory at Chicago, Caldwell played in his 50th game as a Bronco. He recently spoke with The Denver Post about his clutch catch against the Patriots, lessons learned in the NFL and more.\n\nQ: Walk me through that fourth-quarter touchdown against New England.\n\nA: When we broke the huddle, I know I had a fade (route) to the back pylon. I didn\u2019t know it was coming to me, because if it was all coverage, it would have gone to the other side. But it was press. So when I saw press, I knew the ball was coming and I beat him \u2014 he was on my hip \u2014 and Brock just threw a perfect pass, right on my chest. I came down with it. It was just crazy after that. I don\u2019t even remember what happened.\n\nQ: Aqib Talib says when he gets a pick-six, it\u2019s all silence until he reaches the end zone. Is it a similar feeling for you during a play?\n\nA: Yeah, as the play is going through and as I\u2019m running my route, I don\u2019t hear anything. I feel like I\u2019m out there by myself half the time. After you catch it and there\u2019s that initial shock, everybody\u2019s going crazy.\n\nQ: Does it feel like a new offense for you guys in these past couple of games?\n\nA: Yeah, it feels like a fresh start for us. We\u2019ve put in different plays, it\u2019s a different style quarterback \u2014 a more athletic guy, a big-arm guy \u2014 so we tweaked some of the things that we do and it just feels fresh to us.\n\nQ: You\u2019ve been in the league for a while. What is something you have learned in your later years?\n\nA: One of the biggest things I\u2019ve just learned is how to be a professional. I try not to get too excited and I try not to get too low. Just stay even-keeled and play the game and let it play itself out. Sometimes I would get too high in a game and everything went down. Sometimes I was too low and didn\u2019t take advantage of the opportunities later. So I just try to stay even-keeled.\n\nQ: Do some of the younger players seek your advice now?\n\nA: Yeah, I talk to a lot of the guys \u2014 people who start, some people who don\u2019t play, some of the younger guys \u2014 and try to help them get through a long NFL season.\n\nQ: How does this year\u2019s team compare to previous ones in Denver?\n\nA: It\u2019s another great group of guys. This is probably one of the more talented teams that I\u2019ve been around, from offense to defense to special teams. You can\u2019t kill us. We\u2019re going to keep fighting to get through whatever situation we\u2019re in in a game.\n\nQ: Do you have a favorite moment since you entered the league?\n\nA: Probably my second year (2009, with the Bengals). I have two of them. They\u2019re neck and neck. I had a game-winner against Pittsburgh and a game-winner against Baltimore that year. Those are my two favorite moments.\n\nAbout Caldwell\n\nHeight: 6 feet\n\nWeight: 200 pounds\n\nAge: 30\n\nBirthplace: Tampa, Fla.\n\nCollege: University of Florida\n\nNFL experience: Eighth year\n\nAcquired: Unrestricted free agent, 2012\n\nDrafted by Bengals in third round (No. 97) in 2008\n\nLeft Florida as school\u2019s all-time reception leader (185)\n\nCaught 124-of-204 targets for 1,172 yards, 11 TDs from 2008-11 with Cincinnati\n\nHas played in 102 games and has 156 receptions for 1,509 yards and 11 TDs in his career", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos Q&A: Andre Caldwell talks TD vs. Patriots, top NFL moments, more", "title": "Broncos Q&A: Andre Caldwell talks TD vs. Patriots, top NFL moments, more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/broncos-qa-andre-caldwell-talks-td-vs-patriots-top-nfl-moments-more/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__BN20151206_C4_BNSP06FBNBRONXQAp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__BN20151206_C4_BNSP06FBNBRONXQAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T19:46:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:02:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a09\"", "article_summary": "He recently spoke with The Denver Post about his clutch catch against the Patriots, lessons learned in the NFL and more.\nA week earlier, in a victory at Chicago, Caldwell played in his 50th game as a Bronco.\nA: Yeah, as the play is going through and as I\u2019m running my route, I don\u2019t hear anything.\nJust stay even-keeled and play the game and let it play itself out.\nI didn\u2019t know it was coming to me, because if it was all coverage, it would have gone to the other side."}
