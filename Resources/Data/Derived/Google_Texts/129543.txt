On June 16, Let’ s Move! in Indian Country (LMIC) celebrate its third anniversary at the Pueblo of Zuni in New Mexico. The celebration will include the opening of the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project summer camp, a lunch at the Zuni Comprehensive Community Health Center, and youth soccer activities.

LMIC is part of the Let’ s Move! White House initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama to help address the problem of childhood obesity. The goal of Let’ s Move! is to have a healthy start on life, develop healthy learning communities, increase opportunities for physical activity, and ensure families have access to healthy and affordable foods.

Childhood obesity and diabetes affects American Indian and Alaska Native youth with some of the highest rates in the country. LMIC is a federal interagency team coordinated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) that works in partnership with tribal governments, urban Indian health centers, and private organizations to advance the health of Native youth. LMIC accomplishes this goal by encouraging daily physical activities and good nutritional choices among individuals, families, and tribal communities.

The Pueblo of Zuni was chosen for this year’s celebration because of its longstanding commitment to community-based approaches to preventing childhood obesity. The Pueblo of Zuni offers interactive, fun, and free activities for children all year round to help them stay active and healthy.

The event will be hosted by a number of organizations, including the IHS, Notah Begay III Foundation, Nike N7 Fund, Zuni Youth Enrichment Project, and Zuni Wellness Center.

The IHS, an agency in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of federally recognized tribes.
