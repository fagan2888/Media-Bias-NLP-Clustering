However, an analysis of his proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy in order to cut taxes on everyone else shows the Obama plan doesn\u2019t do much at all for families in the middle income bracket.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nObama has been championing the middle class, in part to build support for a potential Democratic successor in 2016. But when plans that are meant to benefit the \u201cmiddle class\u201d actually do nothing for those in the middle income distribution, how long will the public will keep buying his claims?\n\n\u201cWe break people up into income quintiles, and for people in the middle quintile, it\u2019s pretty much, \u2018No story here. Move on,\u2019\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the Urban Institute and the editor of the Tax Policy Center\u2019s TaxVox blog. \u201cThere are winners and losers, but on average the tax change for people in that middle quintile are very small one way or the other.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Could Get More Expensive for 5 Million People\n\nThe losers? That\u2019s very plainly the very wealthy. Under the proposal, the top one percent would see a nearly 2 percent decline in cash income, while the top 0.1 percent would see income fall by over 2.5 percent.\n\nThe winners are earners in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, who would see an increase of about 1.2 percent, or about $175 per year, Gleckman found. For everyone above the bottom quintile up to the 90th percentile, the changes would be trivial \u2014 amounting to perhaps one-tenth of one percent.\n\nFor those in the middle quintile \u2013 identified by Gleckman as those earning between $49,000 and $84,000 per year \u2013 the net change would actually be a decline in after-tax income of $7.\n\n\u201cBoth critics and supporters describe the Obama plan as a major redistribution of income through the tax code,\u201d Gleckman writes. \u201cIn reality, it would significantly boost taxes on the rich and only modestly cut them for many low income households, though for some, especially those with young children, the boost in after-tax income would be substantial. For most of the rest of us, the net impact would be relatively small, though some people would enjoy hefty tax cuts and others would face big tax hikes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s About-Face on 529 Plans Could Save the Middle Class a Bundle\n\nGleckman also warned of the trade-offs that go with such a plan.\n\nMuch of the tax increase on the wealthy comes from an increase in the capital gains tax, triggered when an investment is sold for a profit. People wishing to avoid a high capital gains tax might avoid selling assets that they would otherwise prefer to invest somewhere else \u2013 meaning that capital that might be more productive somewhere else is effectively locked up.\n\nUpdate: Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center writes in an email: \u201cNot sure I agree on your lock-in point...It\u2019s true that the higher capital gains tax rate would tend to increase lock-in, but taxing capital gains at death would vastly reduce the incentive to hold. I can\u2019t say with certainty how the package would affect lock-in, but I\u2019d guess that on balance, lock-in would be reduced.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama talked up \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d in his State of the Union, but an analysis of his tax proposals suggests the benefits of his plan to redistribute wealth among U.S. earners bypasses the middle class entirely.", "title": "Obama\u2019s New Tax Plan: So Much for Middle Class Economics", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/29/Obama-s-New-Tax-Plan-So-Much-Middle-Class-Economics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06152012_Middle_Class_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/29/Obama-s-New-Tax-Plan-So-Much-Middle-Class-Economics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06152012_Middle_Class_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama talked up \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d in his State of the Union, but an analysis of his tax proposals suggests the benefits of his plan to redistribute wealth among U.S. earners bypasses the middle class entirely.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb757\"", "article_summary": "WHY THIS MATTERSObama has been championing the middle class, in part to build support for a potential Democratic successor in 2016.\nMuch of the tax increase on the wealthy comes from an increase in the capital gains tax, triggered when an investment is sold for a profit.\nBut when plans that are meant to benefit the \u201cmiddle class\u201d actually do nothing for those in the middle income distribution, how long will the public will keep buying his claims?\n\u201cWe break people up into income quintiles, and for people in the middle quintile, it\u2019s pretty much, \u2018No story here.\n\u201cBoth critics and supporters describe the Obama plan as a major redistribution of income through the tax code,\u201d Gleckman writes."}
