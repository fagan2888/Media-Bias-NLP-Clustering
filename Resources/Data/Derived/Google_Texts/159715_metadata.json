Last year, Blue Cross reported it lost $68 million in net income on its overall operations in 2015 \u2013 its first loss in at least five years.\n\nIn an email Wednesday to Blue Cross employees, CEO Dan Loepp announced that six executives would assume the promotions and additional duties. Loepp also described Blue Cross\u2019 strategy, which calls for \u201cinvesting in opportunities to expand business into markets of significant growth potential \u2013 including Medicare Advantage \u2013 while we work to strengthen our core health business to improve our financial and market strength.\u201d\n\nThe changes at the top include:\n\nMark Bartlett, CFO and executive vice president, will also become enterprise CFO. He will continue to lead the Blues\u2019 merger and acquisition strategy and oversee its Medicaid joint venture business line with AmeriHealth Caritas for Blue Cross Complete , its Medicaid HMO.\n\nfor , its Medicaid HMO. Ken Dallafior, executive vice president for commercial business, will also become president of Blue Cross\u2019 Core Health. This business line represents most of the Blues\u2019 enterprise revenue, including Blue Care Network and LifeSecure Insurance Co .\n\nand . Elizabeth Haar, CEO of the Accident Fund Group and senior vice president for subsidiary operations, will also become president of Emerging Markets. This business line is responsible for Blue Cross\u2019s Medicare Advantage program, which has been targeted for growth nationally.\n\nCrain's confirmed with Blue Cross that it now handles Medicare Advantage claims for Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield. Talks are underway with several other Blues plans about similar arrangements or joint ventures, said Helen Stojic, Blue Cross' director of corporate affairs.\n\nLoepp said a search is underway for a president and COO of the Accident Fund Group.\n\nTricia Keith, senior vice president and corporate secretary and services, has been promoted to executive vice president, chief of staff and corporate secretary. Keith, who was one of Crain's 40 under 40 winners in 2010, will continue to serve the Blue Cross corporate board as secretary, but will also assume responsibilities in the office of the president.\n\nTwo other Blues\u2019 executives \u2014 Julie Smith and Mary Smith who have been responsible for Medicare Advantage growth \u2014 will report to Haar.\n\nMary Smith has been promoted to senior vice president for quality and risk adjustment products and services.\n\nJulie Smith has been promoted to senior vice president for senior health services.\n\nIn a statement, Blue Cross said the promotions are intended to improve the company\u2019s core business \u201cwhile expanding into emerging markets to help continue to diversify the company\u2019s revenue sources beyond health insurance.\u201d\n\nIn February, Crain\u2019s learned that the Michigan Blues was one of at least 10 Blues plans to meet last December and January with the executives of Philadelphia-based Independence Health Group Inc. about a possible merger or expanded joint business opportunities.\n\nIn his employee email, Loepp explained that Blue Cross plans to \"partner with other health plans \u2014 particularly Blue plans in other states \u2014 to assist them with offering high-quality Medicare Advantage products and services in their regions of the country.\"\n\nHowever, Andy Hetzel, Blue Cross\u2019 vice president of corporate communications, said Blue Cross isn\u2019t interesting in merging with another Blues\u2019 plan.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly talking to other Blue plans about ways we can partner and work better together,\u201d Hetzel said in a statement to Crain\u2019s last week. \u201cIndependence is a good example of a strong partner with our joint ownership of AmeriHealth Caritas.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Blue Cross Michigan paid $215 million for a minority interest in AmeriHealth Caritas, a 15-state Medicaid HMO, which it now co-owns with Independence Health. Blue Cross Complete is now a for-profit member of AmeriHealth Caritas.\n\nOver the past two decades, some formerly independent state-chartered Blue Cross plans have merged into larger entities. Some, like the Anthem Group Inc., which operates 14 Blues plans, have converted to for-profit health insurers.\n\nIn 2014, Blue Cross Michigan converted into a nonprofit mutual health insurer after being the state\u2019s insurer of last resort for 34 years. But it requires permission of the state Legislature to sell or merge with another entity.\n\nCost cutting continues\n\nLast November, Blue Cross embarked on a three-year, $300 million administrative cost reduction program that has so far resulted in more than 50 layoffs in the information technology and health care values divisions.\n\nBlue Cross and its related subsidiaries employ about 7,900 total workers.\n\nMore layoffs or reductions from attrition are expected over the next several months as division department heads complete employee needs assessments and expense reduction reviews, Blue Cross officials have confirmed.\n\nDocuments Crain's has obtained show Blue Cross\u2019 plan to reduce rising administrative costs \u2014 costs up to 30 percent higher than national insurers and other competing plans in Michigan, according to one Blue Cross report.\n\nSources tell Crain\u2019s there are multiple factors forcing the Blues to cut costs. They include right-sizing the workforce after a huge expansion to prepare for changes and new customers from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The moves are believed to be part of a larger \u201cstrategic business transformation\u201d effort that began last November and is intended to reduce the Michigan Blues' administrative costs and increase revenue.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "The moves are believed to be part of a larger \u201cstrategic business transformation\u201d effort that began last November and is intended to reduce the Michigan Blues' administrative costs and increase revenue.", "title": "Blue Cross promotes executives as it reveals national expansion plans", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160324/NEWS/160329903/blue-cross-promotes-executives-as-it-reveals-national-expansion-plans", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20160324/NEWS/160329903/V2/0/V2-160329903.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "People", "published_time": "2016-03-24T12:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-30T16:56:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "Crain's confirmed with Blue Cross that it now handles Medicare Advantage claims for Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nHowever, Andy Hetzel, Blue Cross\u2019 vice president of corporate communications, said Blue Cross isn\u2019t interesting in merging with another Blues\u2019 plan.\nIn his employee email, Loepp explained that Blue Cross plans to \"partner with other health plans \u2014 particularly Blue plans in other states \u2014 to assist them with offering high-quality Medicare Advantage products and services in their regions of the country.\"\nBlue Cross promotes executives as it reveals national expansion plansSeveral top executives at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan have been promoted to help the state\u2019s largest health insurer as it expands into new markets and develops partnerships with Blues plans in other states, Crain\u2019s has learned.\nTricia Keith, senior vice president and corporate secretary and services, has been promoted to executive vice president, chief of staff and corporate secretary."}
