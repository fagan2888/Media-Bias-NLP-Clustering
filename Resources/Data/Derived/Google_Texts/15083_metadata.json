But that figure is still roughly 5 percentage points higher than the center\u2019s 2013 estimate of 40.4 percent.\n\nRelated: How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying $620 Billion in Taxes\n\nThe uptick doesn\u2019t mean more folks have moved off the tax rolls. Rather, the surge from 2013 is largely thanks to better data tracking tools, according to the Center's Roberton Williams. \u201cThose additional non-payers were there all the time -- we just failed to count them,\u201d he said in a blog post.\n\nThat said, the Center still projects that the percentage of non-payers will fall over time, just more gradually than previously thought.\n\n\u201cWe now estimate that 40 percent of tax units won\u2019t pay tax in 2025, higher than our previous projection of about one-third,\u201d Williams said.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nWhile the Center, the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation all try their best to give a proper estimate of the amount of non-payers, their figures shouldn\u2019t be accepted as gospel truth, in part because some people don\u2019t file returns or may have had taxes withheld during the calendar year.\n\nWilliams stressed that just because people don\u2019t pay federal income taxes doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t contribute in some way. In fact, a majority of them work and therefore are on the hook for payroll taxes.
