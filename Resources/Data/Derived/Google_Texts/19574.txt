‘ARKANSAS IN DOUBT’: As the New York Times’ Amy Chozick characterized the race this week, “Democrats face tough challenges in a state that is drifting right.

UPHILL BATTLE FOR DEMOCRATS: If the major focus of this year’s midterm elections is whether or not the Democrats will keep control of the Senate after November 4, then Arkansas is the state to watch–and a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll shows why: current Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor only leads his Republican challenger Tom Cotton by 2 points, with 7% of those polled still undecided. The poll also notes that health care is a top issue for Arkansas voters–which could help Pryor, who voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act, in the end.

The governor’s race doesn’t look any better for Democrats either: Republican candidate Asa Hutchinson currently leads Democratic candidate Mike Ross by 2 points with 11% undecided. (More: USA TODAY)
