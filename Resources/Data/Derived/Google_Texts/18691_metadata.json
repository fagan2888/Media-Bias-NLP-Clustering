Early adopters have seen significant improvements in operational performance:\n\nIncreases of 20-25 percent in patient access to care\n\nReductions of 50-70 percent in staff overtime\n\nReductions of 15-20 percent in the unit cost of service\n\nReductions of 30-35 percent in median patient wait times\n\nImprovements in overall patient and care provider satisfaction ratings\n\nWith market and political pressures converging on healthcare, demand for patient access to high quality care is growing relentlessly. The Affordable Care Act is expected to add 30 million new patients to the U.S. healthcare system. Moreover, the portion of the U.S. population aged 65 and over is projected to grow by 46 percent between 2013 and 2025. Because the prevalence of chronic disease is highest among the elderly, these changes are expected to increase demand for specialty care.1 To further understand the scope of the healthcare industry challenge, please see the infographic \u201cStill Waiting for Dr. Godot?\u201d at http://ow.ly/SjwTe.\n\nHealthcare service providers must find ways to deliver the access to care that the Affordable Care Act promises while simultaneously managing the delivery of care cost-effectively. To meet this growing demand, healthcare providers have no choice but to utilize their resources to the fullest extent and ensure smooth patient flows throughout the day. The operational paradox in healthcare is that scarce resources (surgery suites, infusion chairs, radiology equipment) are both overbooked and under-utilized within the same day. For example, studies show that surgery room utilization is only 53 percent today, even though patients often wait months to secure an appointment.2\n\nClinical Practice Administrator Karen Craver at Wake Forest Baptist Health, Hematology and Oncology, said, \u201cWe selected LeanTaaS iQueue because it uses a mathematically sophisticated approach to solve the problem of chair utilization at the infusion center. This has been a long-standing problem for everyone in healthcare, so this represents a real breakthrough for us.\u201d\n\nHow LeanTaaS iQueue Overcomes Scheduling Complexity\n\nAt the heart of LeanTaaS iQueue lies a data-science-driven service that optimizes the scheduling of patient appointments based on a holistic view of healthcare operations\u2014including historical volume and mix levels, staff scheduling and room/equipment availability. Most patient scheduling today is done on an ad hoc basis, with patients slotted into whatever appointment time is open or requested in an undifferentiated matrix of appointment start times. This leads to a suboptimal sequencing of appointments because there is no mechanism to assign appointment slots based on the number and mix of patients likely to be \u201cin the system\u201d at the specific time slot that is being offered to an individual patient. As a consequence, there are peaks and valleys over the course of the day resulting in long wait times, high overtime levels, inconsistent workloads and expensive capital assets remaining under-utilized.\n\n\u201cWe have struggled to manage that same mid-day peak that many facilities know,\u201d said Jamie Bachman, executive director of Oncology Services at the University of Colorado Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult to add patients and difficult to match nursing schedules to patient requirements. With LeanTaaS iQueue, we are confident that scheduling improvements will be tangible and visible within the next few weeks of our deployment.\u201d\n\nLeanTaaS iQueue uses advanced patented algorithms to model all the possible schedule sequences that could exist at a customer\u2019s site. Data scientists at LeanTaaS build the site\u2019s real-world constraints into the iQueue analytical engines\u2014factors such as number of seats, number of possible procedure start times, number of specialty staff such as doctors or nurses, duration of appointment types and more\u2014and then execute the models. Ultimately, LeanTaaS iQueue produces an optimized appointment sequence that can be imported as a scheduling template for seamless use in the site\u2019s existing scheduling system, thereby enabling the transformation from a rule-of-thumb-based schedule to a data-science-based schedule without needing to change existing workflows.\n\n\u201cLegacy EMRs such as the ones deployed by Epic or Cerner were built to be the single repository of all patient information in the healthcare institution; the schedules built on EMRs are largely based on reserving resources using well-known rules of thumb such as scheduling longer appointments earlier in the day,\u201d explained Mohan Giridharadas, founder and CEO of LeanTaaS. \u201cThere is no attempt at building sophisticated constraint-based optimization algorithms that search for the optimal schedule from trillions and trillions of possible solutions. Even a small care center may have an enormous number of possible appointment sequences. We\u2019re talking about 1060, 1070, even 10100 different ways to slot appointment sequences\u2014just for a single day. With numbers that large, there is absolutely no chance of stumbling onto the optimal combination of appointment slots; it takes rigorous analytic methods to find the best solution and machine learning methods to ensure that the solution remains optimized over the long-term.\u201d\n\nPatient scheduling is a complex math problem ready to be solved by data science.

LeanTaaS iQueue for Clinics is currently being field-tested in select specialty clinics across the country. LeanTaaS iQueue for Surgery is in active development.\n\nDeployment is estimated at three to four weeks for setup, forecasting and creating the initial scheduling template. Ongoing support provides refinement, compliance, refreshing forecasts and measuring performance.\n\nPricing for LeanTaaS iQueue is based on the size and complexity of the healthcare center.
