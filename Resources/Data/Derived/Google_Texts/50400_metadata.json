Even so, career experts say that competition for the best jobs remains fierce, and the search process has changed since the recession.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about job-hunting in today\u2019s environment:\n\nForget about \u201cgrabbing coffee.\u201d While social networks have gotten infinitely more important, real-life networking is still key to the job hunt. Alumni events and industry gatherings are prime time for making new connections, with whom you can follow up online.\n\nOne-on-one meetings have become rare. \u201cWith the pace of work today, a lot of people can\u2019t spare the time to leave the office and meet you for coffee,\u201d says Michele Woodward, a career strategist in the Washington, D.C. area. Instead, ask for a 20-minute phone conversation.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Parents Can Hurt Their Child\u2019s Job Chances\n\nMake your resume mobile-friendly. Like everything else, the hiring process now begins on mobile devices\u2014for both job seekers looking for listings and human resource managers looking for potential hires. A third of recruiters now use phones and tablets to search for candidates, and more than half surveyed in October said they planned to increase their investment in mobile this year, according to Jobvite, a social recruiting system for employers.\n\nTo make the best digital first impression, be sure that your resume is easily downloadable and formatted to be read clearly via a mobile device.\n\nHighlight only high-tech skills. Nothing says out-of-touch like a resume that includes the line \u201cProficient in Microsoft Word and Excel,\u201d says career expert Kerry Hannon. Employers expect new hires to have expertise in those basic programs as well as social media and basic content management systems. Use the space on your resume to highlight accomplishments or more in-demand tech skills like coding or data analysis.\n\nBroaden your horizons. The jobs recovery has taken place nationwide, but some cities are experiencing faster growth than others. As the economy improves, more companies are willing to help foot the relocation bill for qualified candidates. In its most recent relocation survey, moving company Atlas Van Lines found that 41 percent of firms had relocated more employees. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to find better opportunities if you\u2019re willing to relocate,\u201d says David Boggs, the head of WK Advisors, which is a division of executive recruitment firm Witt/Kieffer, based in Oak Brook, IL.\n\nBe ready to interview virtually. Companies may be willing to move you across the country once you\u2019re hired, but they won\u2019t fly you across the country for your first interview. Instead, be ready to chat via phone or videoconference. Treat that first conversation just like you would an in-person interview: dress in business attire, smile throughout, and keep your eyes just to the right of the camera to simulate eye contact. Also, be sure to eliminate noise like barking dogs or any background distractions. \u201cNo one wants to see the beer and wine bottles in your kitchen,\u201d says Jane Horowitz, a career coach who runs More Than a Resume.\n\nDouble up on the Thank You\u2019s. Sending a quick email \u2018Thank You\u2019 right after the interview will keep you top of mind right away. Writing one by hand and sending it by snail mail will surface your name again a few days later, and help you stand out from applicants who no longer take the time for the hand-written note.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For millions of", "title": "How to Land the Job You Really Want\u2014Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/03/How-Land-Job-You-Really-Want-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11042011_Just_Hired_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/03/How-Land-Job-You-Really-Want-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11042011_Just_Hired_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For millions of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd629\"", "article_summary": "Sending a quick email \u2018Thank You\u2019 right after the interview will keep you top of mind right away.\nFor millions of under-employed or unhappily employed workers, the time may have finally come to take the plunge back into the job market.\nRelated: 10 Ways Parents Can Hurt Their Child\u2019s Job ChancesMake your resume mobile-friendly.\nLike everything else, the hiring process now begins on mobile devices\u2014for both job seekers looking for listings and human resource managers looking for potential hires.\n\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to find better opportunities if you\u2019re willing to relocate,\u201d says David Boggs, the head of WK Advisors, which is a division of executive recruitment firm Witt/Kieffer, based in Oak Brook, IL."}
