Bob Riley: \"He's now contract lobbyist Bob Riley...\" Dan Roberts, Montgomery.\n\nDoctor Robert Bentley: \"...A medical doctor's first duty is to do no harm. Bentley has done harm to the poor and old by refusing to take part in the Affordable Care Act which would help so many in our state.\" Clair Houston, Birmingham.\n\nJournalist Chuck Dean: \"You're just a click ho now buddy.\" Sam Carter, Moundville.\n\nThe People's House: \"Lawmakers in both the state house and the U.S. House of Representatives like to say they serve in the 'people's house.' The truth is they serve in the house of the bankers, the fat-cat industrialists, the National Rifle Association or the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), and most especially the lobbyists who buy their votes.\" Richard Cooper, Mobile.\n\nChief Justice Roy Moore: \"...How about we just drop chief justice and sub chief magistrate of the Court of Oyer and Terminer (Salem witch trials).

Orwell would understand.\" Ruth Johnson, Huntsville.\n\nThe I-10 Causeway: \"I-10 parking lot,\" Gill Aaron, Fairhope.\n\nClean Coal: \"Just stop it. There is no such thing and every time you write it or say it you look stupid or you tell people you're a tool.\" Linda Cook, Tuscaloosa.\n\nThanks for all the suggestions, including you Mr. Carter.\n\nIf you guys think of others, you know where to find me.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "robert bentley, roy moore, opinion", "title": "More things we should stop saying including \"journalist Chuck Dean.\" What!
