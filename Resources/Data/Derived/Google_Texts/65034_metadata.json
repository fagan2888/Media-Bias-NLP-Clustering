This year the deadline is Jan. 31 to get a plan through the federal government, and what\u2019s different this time is that the fines if you don\u2019t get insurance go up quite a bit. Obamacare requires adults to get health insurance one way or another\u2014many have become newly eligible for Medicaid in Ohio. The marketplace is designed for those who don\u2019t meet the income requirements or have employer-supplied health care.\n\nPeople without insurance in 2016 could have to pay a minimum of $695 dollars in fines, or 2.5 percent of their income.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act rolled out, Ohio has reduced the number of people in the state without health insurance by half\u2014many have gotten coverage through the expansion of Medicaid for low-income adults.\n\nThe federal health department says more than 226,000 people in the state have already renewed or signed up this year\u2014more than 21,000 in the Dayton area. And most people\u2014four out of five in Ohio\u2014get federal subsidies and don\u2019t pay the full sticker price for their plans. Many get steep discounts and pay under $50 per month for insurance, but shopping can still be confusing as the website shows the full price before subsidies, and subsidies change based on income.\n\nOf course, as with previous years, lots of folks wait til the last minute to figure it out. If that\u2019s you, you can still get help at a series of all-day events at local health centers this week. A new feature this year from the non-profit Enroll America is an online sign-up for an appointment to get help.\n\nWednesday, January 27, 2016\n\n8:00AM-7:00PM\n\nCorwin Nixon Health Center\n\n2351 Stanley Ave.\n\nDayton, OH 45404\n\nThursday, January 28, 2016\n\n9:00AM-4:00PM\n\nVictor Cassano Health Center\n\n165 Edwin C.
