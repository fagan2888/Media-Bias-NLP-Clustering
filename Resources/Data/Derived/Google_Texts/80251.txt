McGraw Wentworth's owner acquires Troy benefits consultant

Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC, parent company of Troy-based McGraw Wentworth, has acquired Great Lakes Employee Benefit Services, also in Troy, for an unspecified amount.



Great Lakes' co-owners Jim Scoggin and Joseph Coan and their staff of 12 will move to McGraw Wentworth's offices during the second quarter.



Founded in 1997, Great Lakes reported annual revenue last year of $3.4 million. The company offers employee benefit consulting services to self-funded and fully insured midsized organizations, but is not a broker.
