The expansion in Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare has led to a 43 percent drop in the number of uncompensated hospital cases, he said.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid was the right decision for New Jersey,\u201d he said during the 90-minute session in an elementary school gym. \u201cIt\u2019s helping to save us money. Our state taxpayers are seeing more federal dollars and we\u2019ve also added more people covered so they don\u2019t go for their primary care in a hospital emergency room.\u201d\n\nChristie, 52, has formed a federal political action committee to finance travel and raise visibility ahead of a possible White House run in 2016. Back home, he is dealing with record-low approval ratings as the state\u2019s economic recovery lags behind the nation\u2019s.\n\nAgenda Pitch\n\nThe Somerville event was his 130th since taking office, and his third in less than two weeks. The gatherings are an opportunity for Christie to pitch his agenda to mostly friendly crowds during the workday. The governor is trying to gain support for his plan to curb pensions and benefits for state workers.\n\nAt a South River town-hall meeting a year ago, Christie called Obamacare a \u201cfailed federal program.\u201d During the Somerville gathering, he never called the program by name, only referring to it as the \u201cMedicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nChristie had refused to establish a state-run health exchange, leaving the task to the federal government. Then in 2013, he agreed to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known locally as FamilyCare. Since then, more than 390,000 uninsured New Jersey residents have enrolled in Medicaid through FamilyCare and another 250,000 have secured private health insurance through the federally-operated marketplace, according to state budget documents.\n\nDuring a budget briefing with reporters last month, Christie\u2019s treasurer, Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, said that the \u201cdramatic reduction in documented charity-care clients\u201d and the Affordable Care Act enrollments were \u201can opportunity to realize some state savings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing for providing appropriate care to our most vulnerable populations,\u201d the treasurer said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Terrence Dopp", "description": "Medicaid spending will drop 43 percent as a result of the expansion under Obamacare, he says.", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOct9beoGcHw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Medicaid spending will drop 43 percent as a result of the expansion under Obamacare, he says.", "title": "Christie\u2019s 2016 New Jersey Budget Benefits From Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-10/christie-s-2016-new-jersey-budget-to-benefit-from-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOct9beoGcHw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-10/christie-s-2016-new-jersey-budget-to-benefit-from-obamacare", "twitter": {"description": "Medicaid spending will drop 43 percent as a result of the expansion under Obamacare, he says.", "title": "Christie\u2019s 2016 New Jersey Budget Benefits From Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-10/christie-s-2016-new-jersey-budget-to-benefit-from-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOct9beoGcHw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Barack H Obama,New Jersey", "fb": {"status": "Medicaid spending will drop 43 percent as a result of the expansion under Obamacare, he says."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Christie\u2019s 2016 New Jersey Budget Benefits From Obamacare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NL068W6TTDSD01", "parsely-author": "Terrence Dopp", "parsely-type": "post", "date": "2015-03-10T15:41:20.461Z", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-10T15:41:20.461Z", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,New Jersey,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama,New Jersey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef34\"", "article_summary": "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a second-term Republican who has called President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul a \u201cfailed federal program,\u201d is benefiting from it in his fiscal 2016 budget.\nThen in 2013, he agreed to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known locally as FamilyCare.\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid was the right decision for New Jersey,\u201d he said during the 90-minute session in an elementary school gym.\nThe state will spend $150 million less on charity care for uninsured patients next year, Christie said Tuesday at a town-hall meeting in Somerville.\nThe expansion in Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare has led to a 43 percent drop in the number of uncompensated hospital cases, he said."}
