Everybody knows that Bloomberg Businessweek's design team is damn good at what they do. What's truly impressive is how often they out-do themselves. Take this week's cover about e-cigarettes, for instance. It's a hypnotic animated GIF!

Of course, the magazine on the newsstands just has a regular cover: a portrait of a Marlboro man obscured by vapor, smoking an e-cig. But online, where the Bloomberg Businessweek covers arguably attract more attention, the cover is literally smoking—and blinking.

Why yes, I would like to read the full cover story about e-cigs on the eve of FDA regulations… [Richard Turley]
