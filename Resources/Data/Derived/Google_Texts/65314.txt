Washington (CNN) The John Kasich "maybe running for President" tour continued for a second day in Washington on Friday, with the Ohio Republican governor speaking at the New America Foundation's annual conference.

In a question-and-answer session on stage with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, Kasich came no closer to divulging his plans, but did say that "if I can win, I'm likely to run."

In recent weeks, Kasich has ramped up his pre-presidential activities, making media appearances, spending time in South Carolina and New Hampshire, and establishing a so-called 527 political committee. That advocacy group -- "New Day for America" -- allows him to raise funds and provides a litmus test of financial support for any eventual run.

Later, in an interview that aired on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Kasich told Borger that at least one formally declared candidate -- Hillary Clinton -- could win his key battleground state of Ohio.

"Of course she could win. I think anybody on those lists is capable. It's just a matter of how they project themselves," Kasich said. "She'll be a very formidable candidate."
