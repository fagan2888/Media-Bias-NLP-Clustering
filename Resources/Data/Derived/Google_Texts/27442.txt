Republicans are at their strongest level in nearly 90 years, according to a detailed analysis by Real Clear Politics.

The data shows the party has an index score of 33.8 on Real Clear Politics' proprietary scale, the highest figure for the GOP since 1928.The score is calculated by looking at presidential performance, House performance, Senate performance, gubernatorial performance, and state legislative performance. A score of more than 45 means a party is doing unusually well, while a score over 90 indicates a party is doing exceptionally well.Real Clear Politics looked back to 1856 when the Republican Party was founded and assigned an average score of -4 and a median score of -6, meaning the parties have mostly been evenly matched over the years.A negative score for the GOP means the Democratic Party is stronger, while a positive number means the opposite is true."Before the 2014 elections, the parties were pretty close to parity: The index stood at 7.98. This indicated an insignificant advantage for the Republicans, although it placed them well above their post-World War II average of -20," the Real Clear Politics analysis reads."It goes without saying that Republicans improved upon their showing in the 2014 elections. Their 54 Senate seats represent the second-best tally for the party since 1928. Their 247 House seats is the most the party has won since 1928, although when combined with the popular vote percentage, it drops to the second-highest since then (in 1946, the party did slightly better)."At the state level, the GOP's share of governorships is the ninth-highest since Reconstruction, and the third-highest in the post-war era (1996 and 1998 were higher). The party's showing in state legislatures is the highest since 1920, the ninth-highest ever, and the third-highest since the end of Reconstruction."Despite the positive observations, the GOP remains fractured over several issues, including the Patriot Act. Other members of the party were not in line with voting-in John Boehner to another term as House Speaker in January. A month later, there was talk of a coup to oust him from his position.And GOP voters, at least according to one poll in January , would like to see change in the Senate and House leadership.
