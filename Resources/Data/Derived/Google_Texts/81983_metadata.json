Cooking with a small amount of oil will help enhance the flavors of food, make eating more enjoyable, and increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. There is a lot of confusion out there on \u201cWhat is the best oil to cook with?\u201d And the truth is, cooking with a variety of oils can expand your nutrition profile and diversify your taste buds.\n\nHowever, before we go into further detail on cooking oils, it is important to address the topic of oil \u201csmoke point.\u201d Smoke point is the temperature at which oil begins to smoke; this is traditionally used as a reference for when the chemical breakdown begins to occur. Changes in the chemical profile may not only affect the taste of the oil, but also the nutritional value of the oil. Heating oil beyond the smoke point can result in the release of cancer causing agents. Therefore it is recommended to not heat oil beyond its smoke point.\n\nHere are some notes on a few of my favorite cooking oils:\n\nOlive Oil: Pure olive oil can be used for stir-frying foods, however it is not recommended to use extra virgin grades because of its lower smoke point. Avoid deep frying with olive oil because of the smoke point. Extra virgin olive oil is an excellent flavor enhancer served on cold foods such as pastas, salads or bread.\n\nPeanut Oil: Peanut oil is a monounsaturated fat with a higher smoke point than olive oil, and therefore can be used for deep frying and high heat cooking methods. Will add a nice flavor to the meal!\n\nAsian Sesame Oil: Asian sesame oil has a very delicate heat point and therefore should not be used for cooking. Use instead for flavor enhancement.\n\nGrapeseed Oil: One of the newest oils being talked about for its health benefits and high smoke point include Grapeseed Oil. Grapeseed Oil has a very neutral flavor profile and will not affect the taste of your meal.\n\n\u200b\u200bAdditional Oils with a higher smoke point to enhance the flavor of your food:", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Ask any gourmet chef what is their secret ingredient to make their food taste so good and they most likely answer some type of herb.\n\u200b\u200bAdditional Oils with a higher smoke point to enhance the flavor of your food:\nSpices not only enhance the flavor of your food, but also provide a variety of health benefits.\nCooking with a small amount of oil will help enhance the flavors of food, make eating more enjoyable, and increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\nGrapeseed Oil: One of the newest oils being talked about for its health benefits and high smoke point include Grapeseed Oil."}
