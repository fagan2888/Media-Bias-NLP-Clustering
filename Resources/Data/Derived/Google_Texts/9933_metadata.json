The ultraconservative right-wing blog apparently now features its own Sunday news program titled, \u201cBreitbart News Sunday,\u201d hosted by Matt Boyle.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stand the thought of a black person who is a conservative, who hasn\u2019t had to make it on their handout and be at their beck and call and doing the things that they want them to do,\u201d Carson said of the media. \u201cIt just infuriates them.\u201d\n\nOf course, Carson\u2019s statement won\u2019t be construed as pulling that oh-so-popular \u201crace card\u201d by his conservative supporters but just as a logical conclusion to their ongoing narrative of mainstream media victimization. Carson continued:\n\nSo none of that surprises me. In fact, because I fly in the face of the secular, progressive ideology, I expect them to continue to attack me constantly. The only thing that they don\u2019t seem to be bright enough to realize that the more they attack me, the stronger I get.
