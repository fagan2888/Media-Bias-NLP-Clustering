The Nashville actress even had to be told about the rumors by an Us Weekly reporter.\n\n\"Am I in the National Enquirer?\" she asked when Us brought up news of the rumor. \"You're breaking it to me! What did I do?\"\n\nKimberly Williams-Paisley is absolutely certain that the only thing her husband and Carrie Underwood did together recently was perform an amazing monologue, mocking Obamacare, at the 2013 CMAs. She certainly can't fault him for that--it's part of his job. Plus, Carrie Underwood recently said in Redbook magazine that she trusts her husband, Mike Fisher, more than anyone she knows. Why would she jeopardize something as precious as that kind of contentment?\n\nBrad and Kimberly Paisley-Williams's marriage seems quite strong. They try to maintain as normal a family life as possible for themselves and their children, Huck, who is 6 and Jasper, who is 4.\n\n\"We have family Sundays together,\" Williams-Paisley says. \"We spend as much time as we can. We're very down-to-earth people. We come from good families, and we appreciate family.\"\n\nThis is pretty impressive for a family where both Mom and Dad are celebrities. Sometimes the average American family can't manage to eat dinner together once a week.\n\nGood for Kimberly Williams-Paisley for laughing off rumors about Brad Paisley cheating on her with Carrie Underwood--or with anyone, for that matter. Kimberly trusts in her husband the way Carrie Underwood trusts in hers. How nice that both of these country music couples are able to enjoy such strong and loving marriages.\n\nImage via Wikipedia", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WebProNews", "description": "Kimberly Williams-Paisley knows hubby Brad Paisley wouldn't cheat on her, so when rumors of him cheating on her with Carrie Underwood recently ran wild, she simply laughed them off.
