So researchers are still trying to figure out what could convince the estimated 40 million smokers in the U.S. to kick the habit for good. Is there a more creative way to tackle the problem?\n\nThat was the subject of an innovative study that tracked a group of CVS employees who were recruited to participate in an incentive-based cessation program. According to the researchers, who published their results in the New England Journal of Medicine this week, offering smokers varying financial rewards and penalties in exchange for cutting out cigarettes worked better than they expected.\n\nParticipants were recruited through CVS and randomly assigned to several different groups that offered different kinds of rewards for quitting. They could choose whether or not they wanted to join their assigned group or drop out of the study.\n\nThe control group offered standard counseling with free smoking cessation tools, like nicorette gum. The other groups were divided between \u201cdeposit\u201d and \u201creward\u201d strategies. In the \u201cdeposit program,\u201d smokers were required to fork over $150. If they successfully quit, they got their deposit back as well as a $650 bonus; if they didn\u2019t quit, they lost their $150 for good. In the \u201creward program,\u201d meanwhile, smokers weren\u2019t required to make an initial deposit and simply received a $800 reward for quitting.\n\nSmokers were significantly less likely to consent to participate in the deposit program; about 14 percent of people agreed to join it, compared to 90 percent of people who agreed to try for the $800 reward. However, the people who did agree to pay out the $150 deposit upfront were much more successful at quitting.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to part with their money,\u201d Dr. Scott Halpern, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who led the study, explained to NBC News. \u201cAmong those who would have accepted either program, the deposit-based programs were twice as effective as the rewards-based programs and five times more effective than the standard of care which was provision of free access to behavior modification therapy and nicotine replacement therapy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to convince people to stop smoking. Even in the context of Halpern\u2019s innovative financial experiments, most people weren\u2019t able to successfully quit. More than 80 percent of smokers in the largest rewards-based group had not given up cigarettes by the end of the study.\n\nStill, the researchers say their findings are significant because their financial incentives returned such dramatically better results than the traditional smoking cessation programs that rely on patches and gum \u2014 something they say big employers should seriously think about as they\u2019re grappling with rising health costs.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare the fact that employers spend approximately $4,000 to $6,000 more per year to employ a smoker than to employ a non-smoker, then an incentive program that pays $800 only to those who succeed in quitting is obviously a win-win situation,\u201d Halpern told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s cost-saving for the employer and it\u2019s health-promoting for the employee.\u201d\n\nThe results are especially pertinent as more large companies are attempting to implement wellness programs to nudge their workers toward healthier decisions \u2014 like exercising more, eating healthier, and quitting smoking. Obamacare now provides more incentives for employers to pursue these types of preventative health efforts, helping wellness programs swell to a $6 billion dollar industry. Despite their growing popularity, however, it\u2019s still unclear whether these programs are actually effective at changing Americans\u2019 behavior.\n\nHalpern says that his study offers a new path forward in this area. Instead of investing so much in wellness programs that rely on traditional smoking cessation tools like gum, companies could actually end up saving a lot of money in the long run by doling out around $800 to try to encourage their works to quit.\n\nCVS Health, for one, isn\u2019t wasting any time. The company, which helped fund the study, is already designing a new cessation program that will require its workers to put down a $50 deposit. If they\u2019re still not smoking a year later, they\u2019ll get their $50 back as well as an additional $700 bonus.\n\nCVS has strategically positioned itself as a leader in the field of public health. Last year, the pharmacy chain announced that it would phase out the sale of all tobacco products at its stores. The move didn\u2019t hurt the company\u2019s revenue because the cigarette losses were offset by rising pharmacy profits.\n\nWhile other pharmacies didn\u2019t follow suit and drop cigarettes from their own shelves, it will probably be easier to push CVS\u2019 competitors toward more effective smoking cessation programs that are better for their bottom lines. \u201cWith respect to public policy, deposit programs, which enlist loss aversion, are the better way to help people to quit smoking (and perhaps to alter many kinds of health-related behavior),\u201d an editorial accompanying Halpern\u2019s new study concludes.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "An innovative study has discovered a more effective way to convince smokers to quit.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "An innovative study has discovered a more effective way to convince smokers to quit.", "title": "CVS Experiment On How To Get People To Stop Smoking Has Fascinating Results", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/14/3658925/smoking-quit-experiment-incentive/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_176089412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An innovative study has discovered a more effective way to convince smokers to quit.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_176089412-321x214.jpg", "title": "CVS Experiment On How To Get People To Stop Smoking Has Fascinating Results", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_176089412.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_176089412.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-14T14:34:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The control group offered standard counseling with free smoking cessation tools, like nicorette gum.\nWhile other pharmacies didn\u2019t follow suit and drop cigarettes from their own shelves, it will probably be easier to push CVS\u2019 competitors toward more effective smoking cessation programs that are better for their bottom lines.\nIn the \u201cdeposit program,\u201d smokers were required to fork over $150.\nThat was the subject of an innovative study that tracked a group of CVS employees who were recruited to participate in an incentive-based cessation program.\nIn the \u201creward program,\u201d meanwhile, smokers weren\u2019t required to make an initial deposit and simply received a $800 reward for quitting."}
