Yes, Obamacare will endanger people who cannot afford healthcare because they are young and healthy, all in order to pay for government benefits for those who are sick. And yes, in order to control the resulting costs, care will have to be cut for the elderly.\n\nGruber isn\u2019t the only Obamacare architect to tell the truth about Obamacare\u2019s view of redistribution. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who has said that he wishes to die at age 75, wrote in February 2008 in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n\nVague promises of savings from cutting waste, enhancing prevention and wellness, installing electronic medical records and improving quality of care are merely \u2018lipstick\u2019 cost control, more for show and public relations than for true change.\n\nHe added that the Hippocratic Oath was to blame, since it encourages doctors to care for the patients before them without concern for \u201ccost or effect on others.\u201d He told the Washington Post, \u201cWe had a big controversy in the United States when there was a limited number of dialysis machines. In Seattle, they appointed what they called a \u2018God committee\u2019 to choose who should get it, and that committee was eventually abandoned. Society ended up paying the whole bill for dialysis instead of having people make those decisions.\u201d\n\nIf the idea of a God committee sounds rather like Sarah Palin\u2019s death panel, that\u2019s because that\u2019s what it is.\n\nThen there\u2019s former Clinton Labor Secretary and Obama economic advisor Robert Reich, who explained in September 2007: \u201cif you\u2019re very old, we\u2019re not going to give you all that technology and all those drugs for the last couple of years of your life to keep you maybe going for another couple of months. It\u2019s too expensive\u2026so we\u2019re going to let you die.\u201d\n\nThese are the great minds behind Obamacare. Or we could just listen to Dr. Howard Dean, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, who said in July 2013 in the pages of the Wall Street Journal that the so-called Independent Payment Advisory Board \u201cis essentially a health-care rationing body. By setting doctor reimbursement rates for Medicare and determining which procedures and drugs will be covered and at what price, the IPAB will be able to stop certain treatments its members do not favor by simply setting rates to levels where no doctor or hospital will perform them.\u201d He added, \u201cThere does have to be control of costs in our health-care system.\u201d\n\nSo are those who worry about healthcare rationing simply paranoid? Of course not. Everyone with a shred of brainpower understands that government cannot create independent supply of medical care, but can merely redistribute what is already present. That means redistributing cost from old to young, and care from the elderly to everyone else. Anyone who argues to the contrary is merely mimicking the strategy of Jonathan Gruber: lying to the \u201cstupid\u201d American people.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
