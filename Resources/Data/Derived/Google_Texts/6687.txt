Two Bayonne siblings were arrested after being caught holding several clear bags of heroin in front of undercover officers, police said.

Christopher Wolhltman, 27, was charged with multiple heroin possession and distribution offenses, police said. His sister, Lisa Marie Wohltman, 29, was charged with possession of heroin and possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana, police said.

Undercover police in the area of 21st Street and Prospect Avenue Wednesday night watched a Nissan Maxima, driven by Christopher Wohltman, park directly in front of them, police said.

Police said they watched the siblings get out and walk to the sidewalk. Christopher Wohltman then reached into his pocket and removed a bundle of suspected heroin and gave three of the small bags to his sister, police said.

Police got out of their car and spoke with the two, who were found to have nine small bags of suspected heroin clenched in their fists, police said. Both were arrested without incident, police said.

Police searched Christopher Wohltman and found a hypodermic needle, a syringe, a shoelace and a spoon, police said. Lisa Marie Wohltman had a plastic wrap containing marijuana in her purse, police said.

Lisa Marie Wohltman was released on a summons while her brother was taken to Hudson County jail and held on $20,000 bail.
