Camille Lilly, D-Chicago, is sponsoring the legislation that would have Illinois\u2019 Department of Health Care and Family Services enroll inmates automatically upon their release.\n\n\u201cYou cannot get Medicaid in a state prison,\u201d Mark Heyrman a University of Chicago professor and advocate for Mental Health America Illinois, told lawmakers last month. \u201cThe Illinois Department of Corrections is paying for every nickel of your health care, including your mental health care. It is illegal to bill the federal government for that.\u201d\n\nBut once inmates are free, it is in Illinois\u2019 best interest to enroll them into Medicaid, where the feds pay the freight.\n\nIllinois\u2019 prison system released 30,083 people last year, more than 27,000 men and nearly 2,500 women.\n\nWomen, particularly single mothers, have long been eligible for Medicaid in Illinois. But thanks to Illinois\u2019 Medicaid expansion as part of Obamacare, young, single, low-income men are now eligible as well.\n\n\u201cBefore the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion in Illinois, 90 percent of the people going in and out of the criminal justice system neither had insurance nor were eligible for Medicaid. Now more than 90 percent will be eligible,\u201d Heyrman said, adding that making sure mentally ill inmates are enrolled in Medicaid is the \u201cmost efficient\u201d use of Obamacare in Illinois.\n\nHelp is needed\n\nIllinois had 47,962 people in prison as of March 31, and the DOC says about 23 percent of them are being treated for mental illness.\n\nForty seven percent of inmates who are released will return to prison.\n\nLilly said last month some inmates end up back in prisons because that\u2019s the only place they receive treatment.\n\n\u201cSince there is not a current system of ensuring medical coverage upon release many people discontinue their medications and treatments\u2026Such a gap in coverage is one of driving the forces for the high recidivism rate in Illinois,\u201d she told fellow lawmakers.\n\nIt is expensive to keep someone, particularly someone who is mentally ill, in prison.\n\nThe budget for prisons in Illinois tops $1 billion, and estimates put the per-inmate cost between $25,000 and $38,000 per person. Illinois spent $146 million on prison health care alone last year.\n\nIllinois\u2019 empty piggy bank\n\nAdding more people to Illinois\u2019 Medicaid system could swamp an already costly program.\n\nIn 2000, Illinois had a little over 1 million people on its Medicaid rolls. Today there are over 3 million enrollees, including 534,200 young, able-bodied, childless men.\n\nThose men are Obamacare enrollees, and their numbers are growing. DHFS expects 650,000 young men to be enrolled in Medicaid by July 2016. That would dwarf the 445,700 disabled adults and senior citizens on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion is already over budget. Last year alone, the Obamacare expansion cost taxpayers $788 million more than the Quinn administration projected. Nearly twice as many able-bodied adults have signed up as the state thought would even be eligible,\u201d said Jonathan Ingram, research director for the Foundation and Government Accountability. \u201cEnrollment has exploded, costs are soaring, and now some state lawmakers are proposing plans to make it grow even faster.\u201d\n\nIllinois will spend nearly $12 billion of state taxpayer money on Medicaid in the next budget; the federal match will push the total price tag to almost $20 billion. By comparison, Illinois\u2019 total budget will be $31.5 billion.\n\nGov. Bruce Rauner has proposed cutting about $1.4 billion in Medicaid spending next year.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s immoral funding formula creates a perverse incentive for states to protect the expansion at the expense of poor kids, individuals with disabilities, seniors and other truly needy patients,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cIf the state wants to save a single state dollar in 2017, when we have to start paying our share of the costs, it has to cut either $2 from those who\u2019ve always been part of the safety net, or $20 from the new class of able-bodied childless adults.\u201d\n\nLilly\u2019s prison plan is now headed for a vote in the full Illinois House.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "One Illinois lawmaker wants to make sure inmates are enrolled into Obamacare as soon as they walk out of prison.", "title": "Illinois proposes taking Obamacare to prison - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/prison.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T00:42:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/210106/illinois-proposes-taking-obamacare-prison/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "Camille Lilly,expansion,Illinois,immoral math,Jon Ingram,medicaid,ObamaCare,prisons,state Rep.,The Foundation for Government Accountability", "published_time": "2015-04-06T04:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T00:42:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "One Illinois lawmaker wants to make sure inmates are enrolled into Obamacare as soon as they walk out of prison.", "title": "Illinois proposes taking Obamacare to prison - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/prison.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "One Illinois lawmaker wants to make sure inmates are enrolled into Obamacare as soon as they walk out of prison."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc84a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Illinois Department of Corrections is paying for every nickel of your health care, including your mental health care.\nIllinois\u2019 empty piggy bankAdding more people to Illinois\u2019 Medicaid system could swamp an already costly program.\nIllinois\u2019 prison system released 30,083 people last year, more than 27,000 men and nearly 2,500 women.\nBut thanks to Illinois\u2019 Medicaid expansion as part of Obamacare, young, single, low-income men are now eligible as well.\nIllinois spent $146 million on prison health care alone last year."}
