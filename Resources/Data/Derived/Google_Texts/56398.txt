ALBUQUERQUE (AP) – Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico is requesting a major premium hike for individual Affordable Care Act plans in 2016.

The Albuquerque Journal reports that the insurer made a request for increases of an average of 51.6 percent in a preliminary rate proposal filed with New Mexico Insurance Superintendent John Franchini. Blue Cross and Blue Shield says the proposal affects an estimated 35,000 customers.

Franchini has the final authority to approve or not approve Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s request.

Franchini says he will also consider a 6 percent rate increase proposal from Presbyterian Health Plan on individual plan premiums and a bump of 4 to 5 percent for New Mexico Health Connections individual plans.

The new rates would go into effect Jan. 1.
