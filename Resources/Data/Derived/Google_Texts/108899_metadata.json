Of the total, 6,036 \u2013 81 percent \u2013 were in the city, with 338 on Long Island and 1,068 in the entire rest of the state, according to the data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.\n\nMost of the charges brought were already crimes before the SAFE Act took effect. Eighty-four percent of the cases were possession charges that would have been misdemeanors prior to 2013 but were elevated to a felony under the SAFE Act.\n\nEnforcement varies widely among different areas of the state. In New York City, there was one SAFE Act arrest or arraignment for every 1,407 residents. In the rest of the state, the rate was one case for every 8,040 residents.\n\nSupporters say the bump in charges show the law is gaining its footing and is having its intended impact of reducing gun violence. Critics say the opposite: That the data shows many parts of the law are difficult or impossible to enforce and aren\u2019t making the state any safer.\n\nIn a statement, Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2013 the law\u2019s primary booster \u2013 called the SAFE Act the \u201cstrongest gun-safety laws in the nation.\" The law, he said, proves it is \u201cpossible to both respect the Second Amendment and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill.\n\n\u201cThis latest data shows that not only is the SAFE Act effective \u2013 it is also helping to ensure safer communities for all New Yorkers,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nDebate continues\n\nThe SAFE Act \u2013 passed during a late-night session at the Capitol in January 2013 shortly after the Newtown school massacre \u2013 made more than a dozen changes or additions to the state\u2019s gun laws. Those included a boost in penalties for illegal gun ownership, an expanded ban on assault weapons and bolstered background-check requirements for ammo and private gun sales.\n\nIts hasty passage spurred an often-heated, polarizing debate on gun control in New York that has spilled into the courts, which threw out a portion of the law that prevented firearms owners from loading more than seven rounds into their 10-round magazines.\n\nThe majority of the law has remained intact, however, though some of the charges have been rarely used.\n\nBy far the most popular SAFE Act charge levied has been Penal Law 265.01-b(1) \u2013 criminal possession of a firearm, a class E felony generally charged against those who illegally possess an unloaded handgun.\n\nThrough Jan. 21, there were 6,104 such felony charges filed \u2013 about 82 percent of the total SAFE Act charges, according to the state data. A total of 5,360 of those were in New York City.\n\nPrior to the SAFE Act, an illegal, unloaded handgun drew a class A misdemeanor charge, which remains on the books. Under the 2013 law, prosecutors and police have the option of levying the felony charge.\n\nFar less used has been the SAFE Act\u2019s new laws governing assault weapons, defined in the law as semi-automatic weapons with a combat-style feature like a telescoping stock or a bayonet.\n\nThe law broadened the state\u2019s ban on assault weapons, but allowed owners of since-outlawed rifles to keep their firearm if they register it with the state.\n\nOnly 31 people have been charged with possessing an unregistered assault weapon, according to the state data. Eight have been charged with failing to register, a separate charge that took effect in April 2013.\n\nSafer or not?\n\nTom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, said the data shows the state\u2019s pre-SAFE Act gun laws were \u201cmore than adequate.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the fact that the majority of SAFE Act charges have been for offenses that were crimes long before the law took effect.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that the state of New York has done in the SAFE Act that will make anybody in the state any safer,\u201d said King, a National Rifle Association board member. \u201cThe laws that were on the books prior to it were more than adequate to keep guns out of the hands of criminals as long as the district attorneys and the police forces of New York state wanted to pursue enforcing those laws.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans in the state Legislature have supported efforts to repeal the SAFE Act, but they haven\u2019t gotten far. Democrats control a majority of more than 2-to-1 in the Assembly, and Cuomo would have to sign off on any repeal.\n\nGun-control advocates said the data is indicative of many major new laws, which often take time before enforcement ramps up and law-enforcement officials become more familiar with the changes.\n\nLeah Gunn Barrett, executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, said her organization believes the statistics show the SAFE Act is being enforced uniformly, despite some of the charges being rarely used.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have the State Police going door to door seeing if you have an AR-15 and if it\u2019s registered,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe that will start to happen, particularly if there\u2019s a massacre using one of these weapons in the state.\u201d\n\nBarrett said she believes charges will continue to rise as the years go on.\n\n\u201dYou always sort of go through a learning curve with a new law,\u201d she said.\n\nRegions of NY\n\nThe SAFE Act charges vary widely from county to county.\n\nThe Bronx has the highest rate of SAFE Act arrests and arraignments: one in every 677 residents, according to the state data and the most recent Census estimates.\n\nNorth of the city, some rural, less-populated counties have seen hardly any: Chemung County, for example, has seen just two SAFE Act charges, or one for every 43,885 residents.\n\nCounties housing some of the state\u2019s larger cities fall somewhere in between. Westchester County, home of Yonkers, had 54 charges, or one for every 18,012 residents. Monroe County, which includes Rochester, had 116 charges, or one for every 6,464 residents.\n\nChemung County Sheriff Christopher Moss, an outspoken critic of the SAFE Act, said the charges in the SAFE Act are \u201cnot high on the priority list.\u201d\n\nWeapon owners in upstate New York \u201cgenerally know how to use them and for the most part use them responsibly,\u201d said Moss, who was the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not seeing a lot of violations here,\u201d Moss said. \u201cGranted, we\u2019re not out actively looking for them either. But if somebody violates the law and we know it, obviously we have to investigate it. We just don\u2019t see that happening in upstate New York or in Chemung County.\u201d\n\nDaniel Feldman, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said the variation among counties stands to reason and tends to mirror the public support \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 for firearms and gun control in the different regions of the state.\n\nA prosecutor in New York City or other cities where gun violence is a prevalent issue will likely be more willing to actively prosecute gun crimes, Feldman said. In rural counties where support for gun control is lower, prosecutors may be less likely to aggressively use the law.\n\n\u201cProsecutorial discretion is a deep-seated precedent,\u201d said Feldman, a former state assemblyman. \u201cSo the local culture will have an impact. In areas in which people\u2019s attitudes toward guns is that everybody ought to have one, then the local prosecutor probably shares the public\u2019s point of view \u2013 they\u2019re elected locally.\u201d\n\nRockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe, a Democrat who is president of the state District Attorneys Association, said he personally supports the SAFE Act, calling it a \u201cpositive step forward\u201d that the total number of arrests and arraignments is increasing.\n\nBut the law hasn\u2019t had much of a presence in Rockland: There have only been 11 SAFE Act charges, or one for every 29,442 residents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a major gun issue here in Rockland County,\u201d Zugibe said. \u201cBut I happen to believe that the SAFE Act is very progressive and needed. The problem is it isn\u2019t a national program. We don\u2019t have a wall around New York state keeping us safe.\u201d\n\nJCAMPBELL1@gannett.com; Twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN\n\nFindings\n\nSince the SAFE Act was passed in 2013, there have been 7, 442 arrests and arraignments under the law as of Jan. 21.
