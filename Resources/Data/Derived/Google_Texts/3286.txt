The Food and Drug Administration published regulatory advice on how businesses can comply with a menu-labeling rule mandated by Obamacare to combat obesity. The agency will enforce the rule starting in early May 2017, about a year after the guidance is published in the Federal Register.

The agency delayed enforcement until next year after the December omnibus spending bill included a provision that struck the rule's original implementation date of Dec. 1, 2016.

The rule mandates that calorie information must be listed on menus and menu boards in chain restaurants, grocery store eateries and vending machines.
