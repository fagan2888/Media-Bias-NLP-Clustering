In 2015, it\u2019s probably best for contractors to proceed assuming health care reform will be a part of business for the foreseeable future. And, even if this embattled version of reform ultimately is repealed, it likely would have to be replaced by some other plan as simply returning the roughly 10 million Americans who have signed up for insurance under the ACA to uninsured status is an unlikely (and probably unwise) scenario.\n\nLeveling the Playing Field\n\nBy now, most contractors are familiar with the basic tenets of the ACA, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The law created a marketplace for insurance plans offered by private companies. All of the plans present the same essential health benefits, with financial assistance for eligible individuals to help them pay the premiums.\n\nCompanies with fewer than 50 employees are not required to offer health plans to employees, but may choose to do so as a way of attracting and retaining talent. Even if your company doesn\u2019t provide health insurance, your employees still are required to have it, thanks to the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. Therefore, it makes sense to be aware of the options available to help your employees obtain a qualifying plan.\n\nAn unexpected benefit of the ACA for small businesses is the way it has leveled the playing field when competing for quality employees.\n\n\u201cMost small businesses want to offer insurance to their employees,\u201d said James E. Brooks, spokesman for the U.S. Small Business Administration, South Florida District. \u201cBefore the ACA, small businesses often were faced with losing good people to larger firms because those firms could offer a better benefits package. But, now, small-business owners can find affordable health care policies for their employees that are just as good as those offered by larger firms.\u201d\n\nBrooks added that small businesses should remember they might not stay small forever.\n\n\u201cMany small businesses may know the law doesn\u2019t affect them because they don\u2019t have 50 employees, but most small businesses want to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, they\u2019ll need to understand the law so they can include it in their strategic plans.\u201d\n\nChanges on the Table (and in the Air) for 2015\n\nThe ACA is still being phased in, and at least a few changes are expected in 2015.\n\nThe employer mandate, which takes effect this month, requires employers with 100 or more full-time employees to offer health coverage to at least 70 percent of their full-time-equivalent employees or pay a penalty. For more information on the IRS\u2019 definition of a full-time-equivalent employee, visit http://bit.ly/full-time-equivalent.\n\nThere are new IRS reporting requirements for employers that sponsor self-insured plans, as well as separate reporting requirements for employers that have 50 or more full-time or full-time-equivalent employees. (Ask your accountant whether your company is subject to the new Section 6055 or 6056 rules.)\n\nAnother important change \u2014 one that is behind the scenes for HVACR contractors \u2014 is that on Jan. 1, physicians will be paid on value, not volume. This new provision will tie physician payments to the quality of care they provide.\n\nBut, the biggest potential change hinges on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell, a lawsuit challenging the federal government\u2019s authority to provide financial assistance to people who buy insurance through federally operated insurance exchanges, which is the situation in 37 states. This decision could deny financial assistance for insurance premiums to millions of Americans and would effectively cut the legs out from under the ACA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s uncertainty surrounding the case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear,\u201d said Charlie McCrudden, senior vice president, government relations, ACCA. \u201cThis case could upend the law because of how it affects individuals in states that haven\u2019t set up their own health insurance exchanges. It could have far-reaching effects on the overall law.\u201d\n\nArguments in the case are expected to begin this month, with a ruling expected sometime this summer, McCrudden said. In the meantime, many states, companies, and individuals find themselves in somewhat of a holding pattern as they await the result.\n\nThe ACA got off to a rough start with well-publicized website problems. Many individuals and companies were also forced to update their plans after discovering their existing coverage did not meet government standards. Things have been going better of late, with the 2015 sign-ups now underway and people better understanding the minimum basket of services their plans must contain. Keeping up with the ACA, however, still can be an onerous task for contractors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always changing,\u201d McCrudden said. \u201cSome deadlines and certain requirements of the act have been delayed \u2014 sometimes more than once \u2014 and that can be hard for contractors to keep track of. When you\u2019re running a business and you select a health care provider for your employees, you hope you can move along and get back to focusing on your business.\u201d\n\nMcCrudden said contractors can find an impartial resource at the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s website (www.kff.org) to help them stay up to date on the latest changes.\n\nMaking the ACA Friendly for Small Businesses\n\nAs individuals and companies get used to the ACA, they are finding the law offers provisions that attempt to make it as friendly as possible for small businesses.\n\nFor example, enrollment is available year-round in the small employer marketplace known as SHOP. In 2015, small businesses can apply for SHOP, choose a plan or plans, complete the coverage offering, determine how much they want to contribute toward employee premiums, manage employee participation, and pay premiums, all online. Employees can enroll online, too.\n\nIn addition, companies that enroll in SHOP coverage and have fewer than 25 employees may qualify for a small business health care tax credit worth up to 50 percent of their premium costs.

And, it makes sense for the companies because of the tax credits that are available.\u201d\n\nOf course, HVAC contractors and their companies are all different, and they will employ different solutions to meet their specific needs.\n\nIn 2014, Isaac Heating and Air Conditioning, Rochester, New York, joined forces with a number of other area companies in a captive insurance plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically running an insurance company,\u201d said Ray Isaac, president. \u201cWe\u2019re determining what the premiums are going to be for our employees, what we\u2019re going to charge them, and what we\u2019re going to provide as far as benefits and added-value services. It\u2019s complicated and requires a different kind of mindset, but being part of a captive plan is the only real way to take control of your company\u2019s insurance costs.\n\n\u201cWe could have saved a considerable amount of money by simply paying the penalty and sending our employees out to find their own health care policies on the open market,\u201d Isaac added. \u201cBut we wanted to take good care of them and didn\u2019t feel as if we could rely on the health insurance companies to provide a level of pricing we were comfortable with. We\u2019re only one year in, but, so far, the captive plan has been a good choice for us.\u201d\n\nAt 12-employee DiFilippo\u2019s Service Co. in Paoli, Pennsylvania, Laura DiFilippo, vice president, said the company chose to stick with its current \u201cCadillac\u201d health care plan in 2015, but was forced to cap its monthly contribution and ask employees to pay their premium costs over the set limit.\n\n\u201cWe were paying the entire premium, but just can\u2019t afford to anymore,\u201d Laura DiFilippo said. She noted that she and her husband, Vince, who serves as company president, are employees of the company, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sacrifice great care for fewer dollars for my family, and I don\u2019t want to ask my employees to do so, either,\u201d Laura DiFilippo said.\n\nShe laments that health insurance premiums are based almost solely on age, which creates the potential for age discrimination in the hiring process. \u201cWhen it comes to benefits packages, companies know younger guys are going to cost them less than older guys because that\u2019s what\u2019s on the premium charts,\u201d she said.\n\nGoing into 2015, the world of health insurance is still transforming, and contractors and their employees have more options than ever. That makes it vital for contractors to involve their business teams in the process.\n\n\u201cInvolve your accountant and your legal adviser,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThere\u2019s the counting of employees and various IRS requirements. Take your questions to your business team and make sure you\u2019re compliant.\u201d\n\nPublication date: 1/26/2015\n\nWant more HVAC industry news and information?
