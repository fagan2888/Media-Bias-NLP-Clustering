Mark Dayton in the fall, but the Cottage Grove man doesn\u2019t have much patience left for MNsure.\n\nIn late May, Taylor, 61, filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit against the exchange. According to court documents, Taylor struggled through repeated attempts to enroll in insurance coverage and eventually appealed the exchange\u2019s rejection of his eligibility for MinnesotaCare.\n\nAfter that appeal got thrown out on May 20, Taylor (who declined to be photographed for this story) filed a lawsuit in Washington County. His case is emblematic of the technical issues that have plagued the marketplace since its launch last October.\n\nDespite the problems that have followed his journey toward health coverage \u2014 Taylor was ultimately determined eligible for MinnesotaCare and now is covered under that public program typically aimed at the working poor \u2014 he\u2019s an affable man who doesn\u2019t come across as bitter. A supporter of the federal health care overhaul, Taylor said in an interview Tuesday at his home that he\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s had so many problems getting coverage.\n\n\u201cI think Barack Obama is one of the greatest presidents in history for coming up with this idea, but the implementation of it here \u2014 and Gov. Dayton [is] great for supporting this idea \u2014 but somewhere in that hierarchy things fall apart, and it\u2019s been widely publicized that that\u2019s the case,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe former 3M employee is representing himself in the suit. He\u2019s seeking $2,127 for medical expenses he incurred between January and March when he says the state incorrectly denied him access to public programs or tax credits to help him pay his premiums.\n\nIn its rejection of Taylor\u2019s appeal, the state said he didn\u2019t qualify for public programs or tax credits because he still had an employer-sponsored health plan during that time.\n\nA quiet retiree who bikes frequently, Taylor was reluctant to explain some of the other details of his case, but his knowledge of the exchange was clear. There isn\u2019t a hearing scheduled yet as part of the lawsuit, which Taylor filed on May 29.\n\nThe Department of Human Services (DHS) ultimately determined him eligible for MinnesotaCare beginning in March, and now Taylor pays a $50 premium each month. That\u2019s down from $714 a month for his employer-based coverage, according to a state appeals document.\n\nSimilar to his support for the Affordable Care Act, Taylor is quite happy with the coverage he has now. He\u2019s just frustrated with the path it took him to get here.\n\nTaylor said he had four different health plans at various points in the period he\u2019s suing over. Just getting logged into the website took almost six weeks, he said, and ultimately technical glitches \u2014 he couldn\u2019t access the correct application at home or at the local library \u2014 forced him to use a paper application.\n\nThough he began attempting to purchase coverage on Oct. 1, technical issues delayed his application until mid-December. \u201cThis was a process that was supposed to take 20 minutes,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it said right on the website when I first sat down and looked at it.\n\n\u201cI am saving a lot of money, I will say that, but it\u2019s taken me a long time to get there.\u201d\n\nDHS: no comment\n\nMNsure CEO Scott Leitz and Department of Human Services Commissioner Lucinda Jesson were named in the suit. Representatives of DHS and MNsure said their organizations don\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n\n\u201cThis is the first lawsuit against MNsure, but MNsure can\u2019t comment further on this case due to pending litigation and privacy laws,\u201d exchange spokeswoman Jenni Bowring-McDonough said in a written statement. \u201cHowever, in general, administrative and judicial review of eligibility determinations is not unexpected, and is, in fact required to be made available to individuals under state and federal law. MNsure is committed to the principles of due process, including individual access to independent and objective reviews of an eligibility determination.\u201d\n\nThe exchange has received slightly more than 1,200 appeals, Bowring McDonough said. According to MNsure documents, 81 percent of appeals are ultimately withdrawn by the consumer. The state\u2019s decision is reversed in just 2 percent of appeals cases.\n\nConsumers contesting MNsure\u2019s decision have 90 days to protest an eligibility determination, or 30 days if they\u2019re attempting to access a public program. A state appeals examiner then conducts a hearing and eventually offers a written decision.\n\nTaylor acknowledged that it could appear outlandish for a consumer to go into a lawsuit lacking professional legal representation. And to him, it isn\u2019t as much about the money as the principle of the situation. He firmly believes MNsure is wrong.\n\n\u201cI try to explain my situation to friends or family and I know they\u2019re thinking, \u2018What are you doing? Why are you spending all this time on this? You don\u2019t have a chance,\u2019\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do something like this if I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, and I\u2019ve put in a lot of research on this.\u201d\n\nTaylor said he also wants to feel like he\u2019s being heard, which hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Cottage Grove man is suing for $2,127 after he claims his initial application was wrongfully denied.", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "author": "James Nord", "og": {"site_name": "Politics in Minnesota", "description": "A Cottage Grove man is suing for $2,127 after he claims his initial application was wrongfully denied.", "title": "First enrollee lawsuit filed against MNsure", "url": "http://politicsinminnesota.com/2014/06/first-enrollee-lawsuit-filed-against-mnsure/", "image": "http://politicsinminnesota.com/files/2014/06/MNsure-lawsuit_C.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "First enrollee lawsuit filed against MNsurePolitics in Minnesota", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "3m,affordable care act,minnesota department of human services,minnesotacare,mnsure", "google-site-verification": "dnN1C5Z65Ze_i1uc3Tt9NprFbHKWIGMpydo4V-WEmyY", "thumbnail": "http://politicsinminnesota.com/files/2014/06/MNsure-lawsuit_C-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the first lawsuit against MNsure, but MNsure can\u2019t comment further on this case due to pending litigation and privacy laws,\u201d exchange spokeswoman Jenni Bowring-McDonough said in a written statement.\nThere isn\u2019t a hearing scheduled yet as part of the lawsuit, which Taylor filed on May 29.\nIn late May, Taylor, 61, filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit against the exchange.\nAfter that appeal got thrown out on May 20, Taylor (who declined to be photographed for this story) filed a lawsuit in Washington County.\nA state appeals examiner then conducts a hearing and eventually offers a written decision."}
