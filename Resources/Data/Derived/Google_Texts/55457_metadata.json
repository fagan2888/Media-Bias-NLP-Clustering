But doctors say there\u2019s another important reason to boost payments for providing government-funded care. They\u2019re worried that failure to address the Medicaid issue could create a physician shortage, and put independent practices out of business.\n\nDr. Joe Haddock isn\u2019t used to television cameras, or advocating for political causes. But Haddock arrived at the Cedar Creek room of the Statehouse last week ready to play a leading role in a well-attended press conference.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d Haddock said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, so bear with me.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the $90 million payroll tax that Gov. Peter Shumlin wants to use to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates to providers like Haddock.\n\nShumlin says the measure would reduce what\u2019s known as the Medicaid cost shift, and act as a relief valve on rising private insurance premiums. But Haddock says lower insurance rates aren\u2019t the only good reason to boost Medicaid reimbursements.\n\n\u201cPractices can\u2019t continue paying only overhead, and not paying the physicians for Medicaid patients,\u201d Haddock says. \u201cWe\u2019re all happy to do so for an ethical reason and a moral reason, but if we can\u2019t pay our staff, and we can\u2019t attract new physicians, there won\u2019t be any primary care physicians here in four or five years.\u201d\n\nReimbursement rates for Medicaid on average cover only about 60 percent of the cost to provide the care. About 15 percent of the patients in Haddock\u2019s family care practice in Williston are eligible for Medicaid.\n\nRecent developments in the Medicaid program related to the federal Affordable Care Act have lent urgency to the issue of reimbursements. An expansion of the program, created to provide insurance for low-income people, brought about 23,000 people onto the Medicaid rolls in Vermont.\n\nThat\u2019s put even more pressure on the state\u2019s Medicaid budget. And the federal government at the beginning of this year rolled back temporary increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates that had been designed to accommodate the surge in enrollees.\n\n\u201cAt our practice alone, the change in Medicaid reimbursement this year means a loss of about $125,000 to $150,000,\u201d Haddock says.\n\nHaddock says his practice prides itself on welcoming Medicaid patients in need of care.\n\n\u201cBut with many of the dramatic changes in reimbursement over the last two years, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be able to afford to do that,\u201d he says.\n\nBill Young, director of the Maple Leaf Treatment Center in Underhill, says the inadequacy of Medicaid payments is only getting worse. Young\u2019s facility provides residential substance abuse treatment.\n\n\u201cAnd gradually the gap between what it costs to provide services and what Medicaid pays for them has widened, and now each year we lose between $350,000 and $500,000 by serving Medicaid patients,\u201d Young says.\n\nYoung says the problem is so acute that he\u2019s begun recruiting patients with private insurance from out of state. But he says that\u2019s not a good solution for the state of Vermont.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re successful, then you\u2019re turning away in-state people that need our services,\u201d Young says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to do that. And then you\u2019re creating more barriers for the local Vermonters, who are really the people we\u2019re most interested in serving.\u201d\n\nShumlin\u2019s proposal got its highest-profile support to date last week when Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility signed on to the plan.\n\nJennifer Chiodo is a managing principal at Cx Associates in Burlington, and a member of the VBSR board of directors. Chiodo says businesses that provide quality health benefits should see their payroll tax increase returned in the form of lower insurance costs. And she says it would help even the playing field between companies that provide decent benefits and those that don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe current approach is a hidden and inequitable tax on people who pay health care premiums. So those of us who are paying premiums are already covering this cost,\u201d Chiodo says.\n\nLawmakers say they want to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates. But they\u2019ve given a cold reception to the payroll tax, and have yet to propose an alternative revenue source.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Lawmakers are still trying to figure out if increasing Medicaid rates will help curb the cost of private health insurance.
