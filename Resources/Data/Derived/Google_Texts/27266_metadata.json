He\u2019s adopted the view, unfathomable in modern Republican politics, that support programs for the elderly shouldn\u2019t be tampered with, and not just for today\u2019s seniors, but for at least a generation. By doing so he\u2019s violated the GOP\u2019s implicit pact that discourages members from accentuating the tensions between the party\u2019s fiscal priorities and its aging political base. If he makes good on this cynical strategy, he will probably still lose, but his candidacy will have served a valuable and revealing purpose.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear up front that Huckabee\u2019s positioning here is 100 percent cynical. As John McCormack of the neoconservative Weekly Standard reminded us last month, Huckabee was a proponent of the Republican consensus as recently as August 2012, when he wrote on his Facebook page that \u201cPaul Ryan is being demonized for his suggested Medicare reforms. But the alternatives may be scarier.\u201d\n\nToday, Huckabee says he wouldn\u2019t sign legislation codifying Ryan\u2019s Medicare reforms if he were president, and lambasted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s proposal to further raise the Social Security retirement age over time. In Iowa this week, Huckabee told a crowd of supporters, \u201cIt is a foolish thing for the government to involuntarily confiscate money from your pockets and paychecks for 50 years, and then suddenly tell you, oh, we were just kidding.\"\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t mention is that his proposed \u201cFair Tax\u201d\u2014a hefty tax on consumption\u2014would disproportionately increase costs for fixed-income seniors, who spend most of their money, and thus operate in effect much like a Social Security benefit cut.\n\nBut for political purposes, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Huckabee isn\u2019t acting out of compassion for the elderly or the poor. What matters is that he\u2019s motivated enough to pull back the curtain on the party\u2019s double dealing.\n\nFor the entirety of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Republicans have taken an awkward, cynical, schizophrenic view of entitlements. They have voted with near unanimity for a budget that would radically overhaul Medicare, but have promised (unworkably) to isolate the old and nearly old from any disruptions. They have largely sidelined their preferred Social Security reforms, but salivated over the prospect of voting for a cut to Social Security benefits when they thought Obama might sign it. They have railed against the Affordable Care Act for reducing spending on Medicare while voting for budgets that preserve those very cuts.\n\nThe only way to make sense of this mishmash is to remember that the GOP owes its political livelihood to the elderly. To pursue conservative goals, without obliterating their coalition, Republicans must twist themselves into pretzels. They must detest spending, but only on those other people. Their rhetorical commitments are impossible to square with their ideological and substantive ones, though, and the agenda they\u2019ve promised to pursue when they control the government again would not exempt retirees and near retirees in any meaningful way. At the end of the day they can only keep their promises to one interest group, and it\u2019s not going to be the elderly.\n\nIn effect, Huckabee is promising to lay this all out for Republican primary (i.e. older) voters, and place his rivals in the exquisitely awkward position of having to explain themselves. Normally the way things work in Republican primaries is that candidates seek advantage by drawing attention to their opponents\u2019 insufficient commitment to conservatism. Huckabee\u2019s big bet is that\u2014in this one substantive realm, where conservatism and voter self-interest point in opposite directions\u2014he can do the same by running to the left. Watching him test this theory, even in defeat, will be fascinating.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "By the time the sixth or seventh candidate enters a Republican presidential primary, it\u2019s usually tough to identify a unique quality that distinguishes him from those who came before.
