Super Bowls leave legacies. But Von Miller\u2019s effort Sunday provided another encouraging sign that his career continues to trend upward. Miller didn\u2019t expect to play in the game, figuring that the Broncos would be in the title game.\n\nHowever, he made good on his promise earlier in the week to bring intensity. He finished with a game-high eight tackles.\n\n\u201cHe was seeking out there. I mean seeking,\u201d said Baltimore\u2019s Elvis Dumervil said of his former teammate. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he\u2019s in this game. He\u2019s a great player.\u201d\n\nMiller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how \u201cproud of him\u201d he was after the Ravens\u2019 star posted two sacks. Miller was surprised he didn\u2019t match that total, saying \u201cthat was kind of how the end of my season went.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos defense proved tough against the run, setting a franchise record for yards allowed per game. Still, Denver struggled to consistently cause havoc and create turnovers. If Miller builds on this past season, when he had 14 sacks, it could be the catalyst.\n\n\u201cHe was full go tonight. I think I saw him lift a guy off his feet. We all know what kind of player he is,\u201d cornerback Aqib Talib said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aqib Talib,Elvis Dumervil,Von Miller", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Von Miller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how \"proud of him\" he was after the Ravens' star posted two sacks.", "title": "Von Miller brings intensity in Pro Bowl with eight tackles", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/25/von-miller-brings-intensity-pro-bowl-eight-tackles/32330/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/von-miller-495x343.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Von Miller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how \"proud of him\" he was after the Ravens' star posted two sacks.", "title": "Von Miller brings intensity in Pro Bowl with eight tackles", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/25/von-miller-brings-intensity-pro-bowl-eight-tackles/32330/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/von-miller-495x343.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Von Miller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how \"proud of him\" he was after the Ravens' star posted two sacks."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21ba\"", "article_summary": "Miller didn\u2019t expect to play in the game, figuring that the Broncos would be in the title game.\nIf Miller builds on this past season, when he had 14 sacks, it could be the catalyst.\nBut Von Miller\u2019s effort Sunday provided another encouraging sign that his career continues to trend upward.\nHowever, he made good on his promise earlier in the week to bring intensity.\nHe\u2019s a great player.\u201dMiller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how \u201cproud of him\u201d he was after the Ravens\u2019 star posted two sacks."}
