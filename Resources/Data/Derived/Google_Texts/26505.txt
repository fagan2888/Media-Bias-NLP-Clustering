A man who lost his disabled son and home in a southwest Denver fire has died from injuries he suffered in the blaze, officials said Saturday.

Ralph Andrade III, 72, died Saturday at Denver Health Medical Center where he had been hospitalized since a fatal fire on Jan.12.

Days after the fire, Andrade’s son-in-law B.J. Purvis mourned the loss of Ralph Andrade IV and said that Ralph III was “in bad shape.”

The elderly man fell from a second-story window in his home while trying to escape the flames. Purvis said his father-in-law had a head injury on top of pre-existing medical conditions.

On Saturday, Purvis thanked the community and the medical staff at Denver Health “for their outpouring of support during this difficult time,” according to a Denver Health news release.
