According to the regulator, the poppy derivatives (which have been banned since 2013) included codeine and morphine. They called on local authorities to step up monitering efforts as well.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether sprinkling poppy powder on dishes can make a restaurant\u2019s food genuinely addictive, though it isn\u2019t an uncommon practice among Chinese cooks, reported CNN. One noodle vendor was detained for 10 days back in 2014, after admitting he added powdered poppy plant to his food to keep customers coming back for more.\n\nThis crackdown adds to the series of food scandals China has suffered in recent years, including a Shanghai-based supplier found to have sold unsanitary chicken meat to chain restaurants, including KFC and McDonalds, and a 2008 tragedy where six children died from a result of contaminated milk powder.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "35, chinese, restaurants, busted, sprinkling, food, opium, poppy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Opium poppy derivatives have been banned from restaurants in China since 2013, but dozens of restaurants continued to use them anyway.", "title": "China Busts 35 Restaurants For Selling Food Laced With Opium Poppy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/35-chinese-restaurants-busted-sprinkling-food-opium-poppy-370556", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/01/22/chinese-noodles.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opium poppy derivatives have been banned from restaurants in China since 2013, but dozens of restaurants continued to use them anyway.", "title": "China Busts 35 Restaurants For Selling Food Laced With Opium Poppy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/35-chinese-restaurants-busted-sprinkling-food-opium-poppy-370556", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/01/22/chinese-noodles.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/22/chinese-noodles.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-22T11:43:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T11:43:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Opium poppy derivatives have been banned from restaurants in China since 2013, but dozens of restaurants continued to use them anyway."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e13\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s unclear whether sprinkling poppy powder on dishes can make a restaurant\u2019s food genuinely addictive, though it isn\u2019t an uncommon practice among Chinese cooks, reported CNN.\nRestaurant patrons in China were getting more than their money\u2019s worth when visiting 35 different establishments that were recently shut down by the China Food and Drug Administration \u2014 they were getting a sprinkling of possibly addictive opium poppies.\nAccording to the regulator, the poppy derivatives (which have been banned since 2013) included codeine and morphine.\nOne noodle vendor was detained for 10 days back in 2014, after admitting he added powdered poppy plant to his food to keep customers coming back for more.\nThey called on local authorities to step up monitering efforts as well."}
