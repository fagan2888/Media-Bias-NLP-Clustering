Bannon that resettling more Syrian refugees who cannot even be properly vetted by intelligence agents is another example of the Obama administration \u201cnot addressing the problems\u201d and merely \u201caddressing the symptoms.\u201d\n\nWalker, who blasted Obama for drawing a line in the sand that he allowed Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad to cross, said the the problems are \u201cAssad and Syria\u201d and \u201cwe need to take action on both.\u201d\n\nIf he were president, Walker said he would empower and give cover to rebels in Syria to take on Assad and institute more no-fly zones. Regarding ISIS, Walker said he would push to lift political restrictions on the military personnel already there in Iraq so they can support the Kurds and the Sunni tribal allies to take out ISIS and \u201cdo so in a way that doesn\u2019t allow them to creep back into Syria.\u201d\n\nOn the domestic front, Walker said he would send a bill to Congress to repeal Obamacare on his first day in office and sign an order that would force Congress to live under the same rules as everyone else to \u201clight a fire under their tales\u201d to repeal Obamacare, which Walker said would also be good for the economy.\n\nWalker said voters were promised that a GOP majority would vote to repeal Obamacare, and they are frustrated that there still has not been such a vote since Republicans got their majority in Congress.\n\nHe also spoke about reining in \u201cout of control regulations,\u201d an \u201call of the above energy policy,\u201d making sure people have the education and the skills to succeed in the country, reforming labor laws so taxpayers and American workers are in charge instead of union bosses and a \u201clegal immigration policy that gives priorities to American working families and their wages.\u201d\n\nWhen Bannon asked Walker if he would veto potential bills that would increase the number of H-1B visas, Walker just responded by saying he would focus on policies that would prioritize \u201cAmerican working families and wages.\u201d\n\nHe said a focus on what \u201cis the impact on American working families and wages\u201d instead of just \u201cwhat\u2019s the benefit to American corporations\u201d is something that has been missing in the debate on immigration, trade, and other issues.\n\nThe Wisconsin governor stressed that he is an outsider and an anti-Washington candidate, and he acknowledge that voters are drawn to frontrunners Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina\u2013none of whom have held elected office\u2013because they are so frustrated with the governing elite in Washington, especially the Republican establishment.\n\nCiting his record of successful reforms in Wisconsin, Walker said that though people may not want to hire him to build condos in New York, be a neurosurgeon, or be the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, he will appeal to \u201cpeople looking to hire someone who can take on Washington and win\u2013and we\u2019ve got the best record.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more than just a Republican in the White House,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe need a reformer who is committed to doing those things once they take office. We need someone who is actually going to get it done.\u201d\n\nWalker, who had once been at the top of state and national polls earlier in the year, barely registers in some national polls today\u2013the most recent CNN/ORC poll found Walker with 0% support. But the Wisconsin governor mentioned that Time magazine once dubbed him \u201cDead Man Walker\u201d when he had terrible poll numbers at the beginning of the recall election but \u201cwe came back with more votes in June of 2012 than in the original election.\u201d Walker said that turnaround happened because \u201cwe stayed true to who we were\u201d and the \u201cconservative reforms worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we can do it again,\u201d he said, remaining hopeful that he will see a bounce in his poll numbers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott Walker: No More Refugees", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Scott Walker: No More Refugees", "title": "Scott Walker: No More Refugees\u00a0 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_scott-walker_ap-photo4-wi.jpg", "height": 853}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/20/scott-walker-no-more-refugees/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Walker: No More Refugees", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_scott-walker_ap-photo4-wi.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker: No More Refugees\u00a0 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-09-20T20:15:38-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Breitbart News Sunday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said America must not bring in more Syrian refugees.\nWalker said voters were promised that a GOP majority would vote to repeal Obamacare, and they are frustrated that there still has not been such a vote since Republicans got their majority in Congress.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI think we need to stop bringing in more refugees not because we haven\u2019t been good-hearted,\u201d Walker said on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, noting that America has \u201cstepped up\u201d by permanently settling 70,000 refugees over the last year, including several thousand from Syria, and spending $4 billion to aid with the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\u201cWe need a reformer who is committed to doing those things once they take office.\nWe need someone who is actually going to get it done.\u201dWalker, who had once been at the top of state and national polls earlier in the year, barely registers in some national polls today\u2013the most recent CNN/ORC poll found Walker with 0% support."}
