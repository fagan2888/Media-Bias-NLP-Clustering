They swayed back and forth in unison, like video game characters fending off a foe.\n\nA few minutes later, Hunt paused and grimaced.\n\n\u201cMy bottom\u2019s feeling that,\u201d she said, pounding her hips.\n\nFor eight years, Gelband has sculpted the figures of women who grace the world\u2019s catwalks and \u201cmost beautiful\u201d lists.\n\n\u201cIrina Shayk came to class the other night,\u201d he said, perched on a red exercise ball, referring to the former Sports Illustrated cover model. \u201cIt makes the other girls feel comfortable, like, \u2018Wow, these girls do it too.\u2019 \u201d But while the long-legged and lithe sing his praises (Karlie Kloss called him \u201cextraordinary\u201d in an email), Gelband said his primary aim is to offer his services to those less genetically blessed, including cubicle dwellers who wear stilettos only for special occasions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start with the models, I didn\u2019t start with celebrities; I started with normal, everyday women who needed to lose dress sizes for a wedding or for a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did that, and then the other things fell into place.\u201d\n\nGelband, 41, got into fitness as a child, running and swimming, playing soccer and tennis. He swam competitively for two and a half years at Rutgers, where he studied exercise science and sports management. After graduating, he moved to Los Angeles, where he was recruited by a branch of 24 Hour Fitness while he was training a girlfriend.\n\nGelband eschewed heavy weights and aggressive cardio for dumbbells in the single digits and Lilliputian movements \u2014 squatting down just a couple of inches, for example. At 24 Hour Fitness, Gelband asked his boss to let him take over the regimen of six women who were 50 to 100 pounds overweight, promising he could \u201cdo better for them and their bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe training style was something they had never seen at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he met Miranda Kerr.\n\n\u201cAfter the 2007 Victoria\u2019s Secret show, after Miranda\u2019s body looked the way it did, that was it,\u201d Gelband said, referring to the toned, taut midsection Kerr paraded down the runway that year. \u201cI started getting phone calls.\u201d\n\nHe relocated to New York, where he met his eventual business partner, Vanessa Packer. A fashion stylist who was frustrated with her workout, Packer took to Google for new exercise methods and stumbled on Gelband\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about, \u2018I need to spend two hours in a gym and kill myself,\u2019 \u201d said Packer, 30. \u201cIt was like, \u2018I can do a solid 45 minutes and really elongate and lengthen and get fit in the way I wanted to be fit.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hffit11.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc403\"", "article_summary": "For eight years, Gelband has sculpted the figures of women who grace the world\u2019s catwalks and \u201cmost beautiful\u201d lists.\nBehind her, the trainer Justin Gelband offered instructions and encouragements.\nA fashion stylist who was frustrated with her workout, Packer took to Google for new exercise methods and stumbled on Gelband\u2019s website.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about, \u2018I need to spend two hours in a gym and kill myself,\u2019 \u201d said Packer, 30.\n\u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d said the 25-year-old model Martha Hunt, pushing a set of two-pound weights above her shoulders."}
