The annual award, which was bestowed this week during PMI\u2019s 2014 PMO Symposium, recognizes PMOs that have had a positive and clear impact on an organization\u2019s strategic goals and business results.\n\nWellPoint\u2019s stated vision is to be America\u2019s valued health partner and the company\u2019s purpose is to \u201ctransform health care with trusted and caring solutions.\u201d As one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States, the company delivers a number of leading health insurance benefit solutions through a broad portfolio of integrated health care insurance plans and related services, along with a wide range of specialty insurance products, serving nearly 67 million people.\n\nWellPoint has encountered a non-stop barrage of change over the past three years, especially in the government-sponsored healthcare sector. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) incentivized states to expand the number of residents qualifying for Medicaid; at the same time, the recession increased the number of low-income people qualifying for existing Medicaid plans. At the same time, enrollment in Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the people 65 or older, began surging as an aging population of \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d became eligible.\n\nThe solution for managing such massive change: the PMO that WellPoint, Inc. secured as part of its purchase of Amerigroup in 2012. WellPoint executives charged it with implementing strategy through the organization\u2019s newly created government business division (GBD). The team overhauled its approach to align it with PMI\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide), mapping 100 percent of activities to one of the five process groups of project management. Any activity that wasn\u2019t aligned was discontinued.\n\nWhat emerged now serves as the bedrock for the PMO\u2019s success: scalable, repeatable frameworks for project execution. As the PMO grew, its standardized approach helped project teams working across the organization. Just two years later, the division manages manage a US$4 billion portfolio of 38 projects. This includes healthcare for 7.4 million Medicaid and Medicare members spread across 26 states, and it accounts for 45 percent of WellPoint\u2019s overall annual revenue. Tasked with delivering 40 percent annual revenue growth in 2012 and 2013, the PMO delivered\u2014cementing its standing at the company.\n\n\u201cWellPoint, Inc. achieved the monumental accomplishment of delivering healthcare solutions amid a restructured marketplace, economic and social trends that caused massive change, an acquisition, and a portfolio that doubled in size \u2013 all in less than three years,\u201d said Mark A. Langley, president and CEO of PMI. \u201cThe team is well deserving of the PMO of the Year Award, and clearly illustrates how projects and programs are the true engines of change and organizational success.\u201d\n\n2015 PMI Professional Awards Call for Nominations\n\nThe call for nominations for 2015 PMI Project of the Year, and other PMI Professional Awards, opens on 1 November, 2014.
