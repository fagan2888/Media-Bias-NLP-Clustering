But they seemed, he concluded, a bit \"racist adjacent.\"\n\nOr maybe the term comes from some old English phrase for hokey pokey in a tool shed? Whatever the meaning of Scalia's often strange choice of words -- including calling the ruling \"pure applesauce\" and stating that words essentially have no meaning -- late-night comic Wilmore has apparently become the ultimate Scalia-to-public translator. Take a look at today's webisode of Punchlines to see what else the comic had to say about the ruling and Scalia's off beat interpretive choices.\n\nAnd what does this ruling mean in practical terms? Jimmy Kimmel gives us a list of injuries and daring behavior that are OK because the medical bill is now on America. And Seth Meyers talks lingering Internet problems that still may do the program in.\n\nTake a look at our favorite jokes from last night's late-night lineup, then vote for yours in the quick poll to the right.
