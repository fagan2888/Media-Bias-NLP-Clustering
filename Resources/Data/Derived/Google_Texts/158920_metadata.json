Because the Missouri legislature has turned down Medicaid expansion three years in a row, students who work part-time or don\u2019t have insurance through their parents may fall into a coverage gap: Their incomes are too high for Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program, and too low for income-based subsidies to help them buy insurance on Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of just in no-man\u2019s land,\u201d said 29-year-old Katie Dorr, a second-year nursing student at St. Louis Community College.\n\nAfter two years without Medicaid expansion in Missouri, an estimated 90,000 residents of the St. Louis region are still uninsured. Like Dorr, many of them have incomes that fit into the coverage gap.\n\nAfter five years working as a medical technologist in a hospital, Dorr decided to follow iin her mother\u2019s footsteps and go to nursing school. Because she had to cut back her work hours to allow for classwork, she no longer qualified for her employer\u2019s benefit plan. Dorr's new income places her below the cutoff to qualify for subsidies. Also, she doesn\u2019t have children, so she is ineligible for Medicaid.\n\nWithout health insurance, Dorr can\u2019t finish her nursing program, so she pays $125 a month for a private plan. She had found an option on Healthcare.gov, but it was even more expensive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating,\u201d Dorr said. \u201cI have to come up with so much money a month to pay my rent and pay my insurance and still study.\u201d\n\nThe health insurance requirement has always been in SLCC\u2019s contracts with local hospitals where the students do clinical work, said nursing education director Karen Mayes. But after an anonymous poll, she found that about a quarter of the students did not have health insurance. Now, they\u2019re required to show proof.\n\n\u201cIf accidents were to happen, they need to be able to cover their expenses,\u201d Mayes said.\n\nIn addition to health insurance, nursing students are required to have a full list of immunizations. Liability insurance for medical malpractice is provided by the school.\n\nOn Monday, Dorr and a half dozen of her classmates met with certified application counselors from Cover Missouri, an arm of the Missouri Foundation for Health that assists with health insurance sign-ups.\n\nHub manager Laura Burbank, of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said almost all of the students they met with fit into the coverage gap.\n\n\u201cYou have people coming in who are trying to do the right thing, they want to get enrolled, because they understand how important it is to their health and education. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not looking or trying to take advantage of the system or anything.\u201d Burbank said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nFollow Durrie on Twitter: @durrieB.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "In this season of open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a group of people who might be uninsured: nursing students.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/stuck-coverage-gap-dreams-being-nurse", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201511/1109dorr.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In this season of open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a group of people who might be uninsured: nursing students.", "title": "Stuck in the coverage gap, with dreams of being a nurse"}, "story_id": 455391281, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@durrieB"}, "author": "Durrie Bouscaren", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Stuck in the coverage gap, with dreams of being a nurse"}, "nid": 49730, "datePublished": "2015-11-09", "keywords": "health insurance, Cover Missouri", "wordCount": 566, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In addition to health insurance, nursing students are required to have a full list of immunizations.\nWithout health insurance, Dorr can\u2019t finish her nursing program, so she pays $125 a month for a private plan.\nIn this season of open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a group of people who might be uninsured: nursing students.\nBut after an anonymous poll, she found that about a quarter of the students did not have health insurance.\nNursing schools frequently require, or highly recommend, that students be enrolled in a health insurance plan before participating in clinical work at local hospitals."}
