A White House official said Obama \u201cdiscussed the importance of having influencers on YouTube get the word out to the millions of fans that they speak to every day,\u201d and thanked them for the work they\u2019ve already done to help raise awareness of the health care law among young people when he stopped by the meeting, which was with senior officials.\n\nThe president \u201cacknowledged\u2026how powerful the YouTube community is in helping raise awareness about key issues,\u201d the official said.\n\nAttending the meeting were Hannah Hart, creator of the Drunk Kitchen series; Iman Crosson, an Obama impersonator known online as Alphacat; Michael Stephens, the man behind the YouTube channel \u201cVSauce;\u201d Benny and Rafi Fine, creators of the \u201cKids React\u201d series; Mark Douglas, Todd Womack, and Ben Relles, who introduced the world to Obama Girl six years ago; Peter Shuckoff and Lloyd Ahlquist of \u201cEpic Rap Battles of History\u201d and Tyler Oakley, an LGBT rights advocate with millions of online fans.\n\nAmong the group, Hart and Oakley also have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Hart hosted a six-hour online signup marathon for the California health care exchange in January.\n\nThe administration has turned to internet personalities as well as stars from Hollywood, music and sports throughout the enrollment process. Celebrities have played a big part of multiple campaigns aimed at boosting youth enrollment numbers in recent months.\n\nYouth enrollment has been lower than projected so far: The administration\u2019s original goal was for seven million Americans to enroll; the target was for roughly 40% of that group to be between 18 and 34. So far, young Americans have made up about a quarter of enrollees. The White House has pointed to studies showing a high enough percentage of young people have enrolled in Obamacare to avoid the so-called \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has lowered expectations for the final tally of enrollees expected to sign up for insurance by March 31. Last month, Vice President Biden hinted enrollments won\u2019t reach the seven million figure originally predicted when the Affordable Care Act kicked in.\n\nStill, the administration feels confident about the enrollment figures especially after the difficult opening months of the HealthCare.gov website, with a slate of outreach events and campaigns.\n\nUpdate: After this article was published, a White House official sent in the names of two more attendees at the meeting: Mickey Meyer and Daniel Kellison from Jash.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3051744, "userid": 568833}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "The president asked viral video creators to help boost Obamacare enrollment ahead of the March 31 deadline at a White House summit last...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
