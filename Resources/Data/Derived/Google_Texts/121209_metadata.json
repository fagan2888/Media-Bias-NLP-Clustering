Yet, the district fell a step short of empowering principals with the autonomy allowing them to chart their own courses.\n\nFor the most part, principals have had to accept whatever the district gave them. Decisions about curriculum and the type of teacher training were made by the central administration.\n\nThat is about to change.\n\nRecently, the school board approved what looks to be a monumental shift in how the district\u2019s traditional schools are run \u2014 providing all principals the opportunity for more control. They will be able to choose their school\u2019s curriculum, select the type of professional development best for their teachers and set the parameters on what kinds of district assessments their students will take.\n\n\u201cIf the school is the unit of change, let\u2019s give them as much autonomy as we legally can,\u201d said school board member Barbara O\u2019Brien.\n\nThis move comes a year after DPS unveiled its revamped Denver Plan. But the ambitious goals for the district to meet by 2020 may be next to impossible under the traditional system of top-down control.\n\nThis change gives schools the freedom to decide how to best reach those goals.\n\n\u201cIt is saying, \u2018These are what the standards should be. How you get there is up to you,\u2019 \u201d said Van Schoales, CEO of A-Plus Denver.\n\nThe empowering of principals is a natural progression for DPS that has embraced charter schools, allowed parents to choose any district school, and invented the \u201cinnovation school\u201d model, under which a school can ask to be exempt from many central-office and union dictates.\n\nStarting this fall, every school will be able to create the environment that best suits its community. Principals will have to opt in for district programs and services. The default will be autonomy.\n\n\u201cThis is the right next step,\u201d said Superintendent Tom Boasberg. \u201cWe have made really great progress, but we have to move faster. Promoting more innovation will help us move faster.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the district is strengthening its school accountability framework by adding a component that looks at equity within each school.\n\nThe Denver Plan is now a decade-old reform. The district has improved in many areas, but the growth has been slow. Particularly frustrating is that the achievement gap between minorities and their white or Asian peers remains cavernous.\n\nChange for change\u2019s sake does not work. But giving schools the power to chart their own courses should empower and attract leadership that is crucial to success.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DPS empowering Denver schools with autonomy", "title": "DPS empowering Denver schools with autonomy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/12/dps-empowering-denver-schools-with-autonomy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T13:20:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T13:20:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bc0\"", "article_summary": "Yet, the district fell a step short of empowering principals with the autonomy allowing them to chart their own courses.\nDenver Public Schools has known this and has focused its reforms on attracting top leaders and teachers.\nRecently, the school board approved what looks to be a monumental shift in how the district\u2019s traditional schools are run \u2014 providing all principals the opportunity for more control.\nBut giving schools the power to chart their own courses should empower and attract leadership that is crucial to success.\nA great leader is usually key to a great organization, and nowhere is that more true than in a school."}
