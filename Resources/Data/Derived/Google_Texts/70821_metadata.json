The federal government should stay within the confines of the constitution. The constitution does not authorize the federal government to have anything whatsoever to do with healthcare. So, Obamacare should be abolished along with Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, but the people who are on those programs should be grandfathered in because they paid money to be in there and they\u2019ve ordered their lives to stay there. The states should regulate healthcare because the states retain that power under the constitution. So, if you want if you want mandatory healthcare, go live in Massachusetts. If you want the free market and you want individual savings accounts, financial money savings accounts, go live in Texas. As Uncle Ronnie used to say, you can vote with your feet.\n\n\u201cLet me just very quickly ask, you say you want to do away with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?\u201d a stunned Williams asked the judge.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the judge told him. \u201cIn my world, where government lives within the confines of the Constitution, people are responsible for themselves. It\u2019s not the Beltway world where you live. People don\u2019t look to the federal government to take care of them.\u201d\n\nTwo tweets summed the segment perfectly:\n\nWatch Napolitano awesomely explain the Constitution to a liberal:\n\nShare Tweet\n\nH/T: Twitchy\n\nWatch: Hilarious video of NYPD trying to stop skateboarders goes viral\n\n[poll id=\u201d138\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "\u201cJuan, fasten your seat belt,\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano warned liberal Juan Williams before he flabbergasted Williams with a lecture on the Constitution. \u201cYou have abandoned the whole notion of conservatism tonight,\u201d a shocked Williams responded to the judge\u2019s lecture. \u201cYou have abandoned the notion that the Constitution means what it says,\u201d Napolitano retorted.
