Peine said the men packed enough food but ran out of water and were separated Saturday evening.\n\nThe 911 call came in at 7:11 p.m. from one hiker closer to the Mount Lemmon side of the trail, according to Peine. The hiker told the operator he was separated from his friend along the way.\n\nThe sheriff's office responded with a plane, a helicopter and ground teams to find the two men. The air units look for sources of heat or light while the ground teams work their way through the trail.\n\nThe men were airlifted out at about 5 a.m., Peine said.\n\nPeine says in light of this situation, there are a few ways people can stay safe if they decide to go on a hike.\n\n\n\nThe major issue he says hikers face is they don't bring enough water, he says hikers should bring a quart of water for every hour they are out on the trail. He also recommends people carry a cell phone so they can call for help if they need to and take a friend who can go for help. just in case.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015. Tucson News Now.
