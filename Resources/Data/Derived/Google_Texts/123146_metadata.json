House Bill 2258, also known as the HOPE Act, goes into effect on July 1, 2015, but already critics are claiming it will harm the poor in Kansas.\n\nIn a related report by the Inquisitr, reports claim that Anna Broom and Jordan Burford are demanding that taxpayers foot the bill for a $15,000 welfare wedding, which would include a fairy tale-like castle, a designer dress, champagne for the 50 guests, horse and carriage, and a honeymoon in Mexico.\n\nCurrently, the TANF program provides Kansas\u2019 welfare recipients with EBT cards which are used like debit cards to make purchases. The new law plans to limit the amount of cash which can be withdrawn from ATM machines to $25 per day. Welfare recipients will still be capable of obtaining larger amounts in order to pay for basic necessities like housing, but low income families will not be allowed to use government assistance to directly pay for cruise vacations, tattoo parlors, movie theaters, dog and horse racing facilities, spas, alcohol, cigarettes, fortune telling and a long list of other businesses.\n\nMiriam Krehbiel, the chief executive of the United Way chapter, told KCUR they are uncertain why Kansas\u2019 welfare law specifically targets cruise vacations since it seems a little out place.\n\n\u201cPeople on public assistance shouldn\u2019t be spending what little money they have on things like cruises,\u201d said Krehbiel. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t get is how we think that someone on public assistance \u2013 as little as it is \u2013 would ever be able to save up enough money to be on a cruise ship?\u201d\n\nKansas Governor Sam Brownback explained that the intention with the new law was to crack down on fraud and waste within the welfare system.\n\n\u201cWe know that the most charitable act is not handing someone a check but helping that person get a job that sustains them and their families for generations to come,\u201d said Gov. Brownback. \u201cOur focus is on helping people develop the skills to find and keep a job. Instead of focusing on a war against poverty, we will focus on fighting for the poor among us by offering them hope and opportunity.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, about two percent of Kansas\u2019 welfare recipients lost cash assistance due to fraud, which took place between between July 2014 and February 2015. Barry Feaker, the director of the Topeka Rescue Mission, believes that banning certain types of purchases is reasonable, but he\u2019s uncertain how the law will be enforced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in agreement with that,\u201d Feaker said. \u201cPeople with limited resources shouldn\u2019t be using those resources to gamble or buy alcohol. But how are we going to enforce that prohibition? Again, that concerns me as well.\u201d\n\nShannon Cotsoradis, chief executive with the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children, also believes that children may be caught in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing sight of the big picture here,\u201d said Cotsoradis. \u201cIn our desire to penalize the adults for what are perceived as poor choices or negative behaviors, we\u2019re going to be penalizing large numbers of very poor children because their parents won\u2019t have access to cash assistance and there will be less food in the house.\u201d\n\nCotsoradis also feels Kansas\u2019 welfare law feels \u201cmean-spirited\u201d since it \u201cseems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.\u201d What do you think?\n\n[Image via Liberal America]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kansas' welfare law that was just signed by Governor Sam Brownback bans cruise vacations, tattoos, swimming, movie theaters, and more for anyone who receives", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Kansas\u2019 welfare law that was just signed by Governor Sam Brownback bans cruise vacations, tattoos, swimming, movie theaters, and more for anyone who receives", "title": "Kansas Welfare Law Signed By Gov.
