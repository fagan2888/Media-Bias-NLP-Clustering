The Department of Health and Human Services has even hosted cash-prize video competitions to encourage enrollment into the health exchanges.\n\nHHS isn\u2019t the only federal agency turning to offbeat marketing campaigns in an effort to remain relevant in the public eye. The U.S. Postal Service has done the same, to similarly mixed response, stirring the beginnings of a conversation about the proper role of government-funded advertising and promotional materials.\n\nThere currently are no rules requiring government-sponsored ads to disclose their funding source, but legislation recently re-introduced by Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., would change that. Under the Taxpayer Transparency Act of 2015, publicly funded commercials and promotional materials would be required to include disclaimers stating they were sponsored at taxpayer expense. Last year we highlighted this reform, which was passed by voice vote in the House before stalling in the Senate.\n\nThe discussion about government advertising is nothing new. Ten years ago, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and members of Congress investigated the accuracy and value of Bush administration advertisements related to Medicare. More recently, there has been serious debate about the exorbitant sums spent by the U.S. Armed Forces sponsoring NASCAR drivers.\n\nLast year, while he was still at the Congressional Research Service, R Street Institute Senior Fellow Kevin Kosar authored a report looking at the need for balance in evaluating the government\u2019s role in advertising. Data about government advertising expenditures can be difficult to pinpoint, Kosar explained, but noted that limitations on government advertising are already established by the GAO\u2019s Principles of Federal Appropriations Law.\n\nRep. Long\u2019s effort to increase accountability in federally funding advertising is a promising step to make government more accountable to the public. Perhaps the legislation will build momentum following last year\u2019s successful passage in the House and receive serious consideration in the Senate, as well.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "governance", "og": {"image": "http://redesign.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/R-Street-Logo1.png", "title": "Transparency in government-sponsored ads | R Street"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06fb\"", "article_summary": "There currently are no rules requiring government-sponsored ads to disclose their funding source, but legislation recently re-introduced by Rep.
