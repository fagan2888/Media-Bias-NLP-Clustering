Airline company JetBlue is offering police officers across the country free airfare to attend services for slain NYPD cops Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

The deal allows up to two officers from any police force in the country to fly into New York City via any of its routes. JetBlue is based in NYC and travels among more than 80 destinations, with most of the domestic ones being on the East Coast.

“We’re honored to do what we can to support the communities we serve,” a company spokesperson said, per the New York Post.

According to the paper, Ramos’ funeral is scheduled for Saturday. Liu’s has yet to be finalized. NPR reported Christmas Day that Liu’s family was waiting for relatives to arrive from China.
