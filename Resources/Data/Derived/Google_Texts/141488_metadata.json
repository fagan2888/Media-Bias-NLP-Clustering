Rand Paul, The Right, Elections News, Media News, News, Politics News\n\nSen. Rand Paul is gearing up for a triumphant return to the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday morning, where he\u2019s a star. But in a warm-up interview with Yahoo\u2019s Katie Couric, he again looked unready for the glare of a national presidential campaign. This time he didn\u2019t \u201cshush\u201d the female journalist, but he wiggled and squirmed and ducked direct questions in their 17-minute interview.\n\nThe woman who dispatched Sarah Palin to the sidelines in 2008 again just did her job. Paul wasn\u2019t Palinesque, but it\u2019s consistently clear he\u2019s more accustomed to speechifying and holding forth than being questioned by a reporter. He insisted the Benghazi tragedy \u201cprecludes [Hillary Clinton] from ever being considered for higher office,\u201d explained he\u2019d beat ISIS by arming the Kurds, and repeatedly ducked comment on his father\u2019s recent slide back into racism when he explained that his anti-war allies in the Congressional Black Caucus \u201cdidn\u2019t want the war because they wanted that money to go to food stamps to people here.\u201d\n\nBut the contrast between Paul\u2019s bold pronouncements and his inability to answer direct questions was stark. He was eloquent, and somewhat convincing, when he explained that the U.S. can\u2019t fight wars everywhere. But when Couric asked him directly whether he thinks the president should send ground troops back to Iraq, he bobbed and weaved.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in any absolute prescription against them,\u201d he told her, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to send millions of troops around the world.\u201d At another point he coyly allowed \u201cwe already have [sent some ground troops], and I have not objected to it.\u201d He went on: \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to put a half a million troops in there,\u201d and Couric interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not even asking you for a number\u2026\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t quite shush her, but he got irritated, \u201cI\u2019m trying to answer the question, so you gotta let me answer the question.\u201d In the end, we learned he would arm the Kurds to fight ISIS, and create a new Kurdistan out of parts of Iraq and Syria. Although how he\u2019s going to get a piece of Syria without ground troops toppling Bashar al-Assad went unasked and unanswered.\n\nHe did the faux-candor routine again on questions about whether, ultimately, he will vote for a clean bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, one that doesn\u2019t block President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Each time Couric asked, he repeated GOP talking points about how it\u2019s the Democrats who want to shut down the government because they won\u2019t support a bill that blocks the president. But on Couric\u2019s fourth try he wavered: \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet because I haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man running on candor ducked direct questions about ground troops, DHS funding and his dad\u2019s racist outburst", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s faux-candor nonsense: Why Katie Couric had him bobbing and weaving", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The man running on candor ducked direct questions about ground troops, DHS funding and his dad\u2019s racist outburst", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s faux-candor nonsense: Why Katie Couric had him bobbing and weaving", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/26/rand_pauls_faux_candor_nonsense_why_katie_couric_had_him_bobbing_and_weaving/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/rand_paul_couric.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The man running on candor ducked direct questions about ground troops, DHS funding and his dad\u2019s racist outburst", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s faux-candor nonsense: Why Katie Couric had him bobbing and weaving", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/rand_paul_couric.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Benghazi, GOP, Hillary Clinton, isis, Katie Couric, Libya, patriot act, Ron Paul, Sarah Palin, Sen.
