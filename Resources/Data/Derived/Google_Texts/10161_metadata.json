The pair reunited last year to shoot George Clooney\u2019s The Monuments Men, which opens on March 13.\n\nAUSSIE WOMEN BID FOR OSCARS RECORD\n\nAND THE RAZZIES GO TO ... FATHER AND SON\n\nThe American star told News Corp Australia that Blanchett is in a class alongside only Meryl Streep.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t very many male or female actors in that stratosphere,\u201d Damon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special thing to see. I remember being 27 years old and seeing it: she walked out after shooting something with us and (director) Anthony Minghella and I just looked at each other, shook our heads and went, \u2018What the hell was that?\u2019\n\n\u201cNow, she\u2019s the same actress except with 16 more years of experience. Her range, which I didn\u2019t see an end to back then, has only expanded. She\u2019s a really special person.\u201d\n\nOscar voting closed last Tuesday, with nominees such as Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, U2 and Lupita Nyong\u2019o hitting every event and TV talk show possible in the final two weeks of campaigning. During this period, Blanchett was the subject of a glowing profile on the US version of 60 Minutes.\n\nWhile B lue Jasmine\u2019s Oscar chances were given a battering by renewed allegations of abuse targeted at writer-director Woody Allen in early February, Blanchett has just gone on winning.\n\nWith her husband Andrew Upton by her side, Blanchett picked up one last pre-Oscar best actress gong at the Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica on Saturday.\n\nShould she prove the pundits right today, the statuette will join her Best Supporting Actress Oscar won for The Aviator in 2005.\n\nOther Australians vying for Academy Awards are Catherine Martin, who is nominated for both Costume and Production Design for The Great Gatsby; Beverley Dunn, who is co-nominee with Martin in the Production Design category; and David Clayton in the Visual Effects category for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.\n\nFULL LIST OF OSCAR 2014 NOMINEES:\n\nBEST PICTURE:\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nGravity\n\nPhilomena\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street\n\nNebraska\n\nAmerican Hustle\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nHer\n\nBEST DIRECTOR:\n\nDavid O Russell - American Hustle\n\nAlfonso Cuaron - Gravity\n\nAlexander Payne - Nebraska\n\nSteve McQueen - 12 Years a Slave\n\nMartin Scorsese - The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nBEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE:\n\nChristian Bale - American Hustle\n\nBruce Dern - Nebraska\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio - The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor - 12 Years a Slave\n\nMatthew McConaughey - Dallas Buyers Club\n\nBEST ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE:\n\nCate Blanchett - Blue Jasmine\n\nAmy Adams - American Hustle\n\nSandra Bullock - Gravity\n\nJudi Dench - Philomena\n\nMeryl Streep - August Osage County\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR:\n\nBradley Cooper - American Hustle\n\nBarkhad Abdi - Captain Phillips\n\nMichael Fassbender - 12 Years a Slave\n\nJonah Hill - The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nJared Leto - Dallas Buyers Club\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS:\n\nJennifer Lawrence - American Hustle\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o - 12 Years a Slave\n\nSally Hawkins - Blue Jasmine\n\nJulia Roberts - August Osage County\n\nJune Squibb - Nebraska\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM:\n\nDespicable Me 2\n\nFrozen\n\nThe Croods\n\nErnest & Celestine\n\nThe Wind Rises\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY:\n\nRichard Linklater, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke - Before Midnight\n\nBilly Ray - Captain Phillips\n\nSteve Coogan and Jeff Pope - Philomena\n\nJohn Ridley - 12 Years a Slave\n\nTerence Winter - The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY:\n\nEric Warren Singer and David O Russell - American Hustle\n\nWoody Allen - Blue Jasmine\n\nCraig Borten & Melisa Wallack - Dallas Buyers Club\n\nSpike Jonze - Her\n\nBob Nelson - Nebraska\n\nBEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM:\n\nThe Great Beauty (Italy)\n\nThe Hunt (Denmark)\n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown (Belgium)\n\nThe Missing Picture (Cambodia)\n\nOmar (Palestine)\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG:\n\nLet It Go - Frozen\n\nOrdinary Love - Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\n\nAlone Yet Not Alone - Alone Yet Not Alone\n\nHappy - Despicable Me 2\n\nThe Moon Song - Her\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE:\n\nThe Book Thief\n\nGravity\n\nHer\n\nPhilomena\n\nSaving Mr Banks\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE:\n\nThe Act of Killing\n\nCutie and the Boxer\n\nDirty Wars\n\nThe Square\n\n20 Feet from Stardom\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT:\n\nSaveDigger\n\nFacing Fear\n\nKarama Has No Walls\n\nThe Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life\n\nPrison Terminal: The Last Days of Private Jack Hall\n\nBEST FILM EDITING:\n\nAmerican Hustle\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nGravity\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nBEST MAKE-UP & HAIRSTYLING:\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nJackass Presents: Bad Grandpa\n\nThe Lone Ranger\n\nBEST SHORT FILM (ANIMATED):\n\nFeral\n\nGet a Horse!\n\nMr Hublot\n\nPossessions\n\nRoom on the Broom\n\nBEST SHORT FILM (LIVE ACTION):\n\nAquel No Era Yo (That Wasn\u2019t Me)\n\nAvant Que De Tour Perdre (Just Before Losing Everything)\n\nHelium\n\nPit\u00e4\u00e4k\u00f6 Mun Kaikki Hoitaa?
