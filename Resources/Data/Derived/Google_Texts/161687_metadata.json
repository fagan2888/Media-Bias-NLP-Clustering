They used to be allowed to spend those dollars on all kinds of health-related over-the-counter items until Obamacare\u2019s passage set stricter rules. Before Obamacare, there was no government-imposed limit on contributions to an FSA, though there were sometimes limits set by employers. Obamacare mandates that no one can contribute more than $2,500 a year. On paper, this did two things Democrats love\u2014 take away a consumer choice and raise money to offset the cost of Obamacare.\n\nBefore the new rule, there was no official cap on how much taxpayers could stash into the account, though many companies typically set their own limits of $5,000. For a person in the 25 percent tax bracket, the cap cuts the maximum tax break in half to $625 from $1,250. For families who relied on the accounts to help them cover the costs of pricey medical services like braces, the cap indirectly raises their costs, says Gayle Glenn, president of the American Association of Orthodontists, which along with some other medical groups is calling for the cap to be eliminated. About 65 percent of the roughly 17,000 orthodontists surveyed by the association in 2009 said their patients used FSAs to pay for treatment. And with the cost of braces ranging from $5,000 to $7,000, many families are likely max out their FSA contributions to pay for them, says Glenn, whose association recently circulated a letter for orthodontists to publish in their local newspapers, encouraging people to write to Congress to challenge the cap. \u201cWe want people to be aware,\u201d says Glenn.\n\nOn the upside for FSA users, the federal government did away with the forfeit rule, so funds of up to $500 can now roll over from year to year. Aren\u2019t they generous with the way they let you keep fractions of fractions of your money? Frankly, at this point, FSA rules change so frequently and are so burdensome, they\u2019ve been rendered more work than they\u2019re worth for all but the most dedicated users. And again, Democrat rejoice. People like Yesha Callahan clearly didn\u2019t know what was good for them.\n\nEventually we made our way to the orthodontist, and thankfully the price for a 2 year treatment wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be. My dental insurance was able to negotiate a price that turned out to be half of what the orthodontist initially quoted me. On the day of service I ended up paying only $1700 for braces and follow up appointments. So braces were a done deal. Let\u2019s also calculate the several emergency room visits, the 4 day stay at Johns Hopkins because of his asthma issues, as well as prescription costs. All of this was before I found out my son needed glasses. If I hadn\u2019t set up my FSA, I truly don\u2019t know how much credit card debit I would have possibly ran up because of the bills and co-pays we amassed over the past year.\n\nObamacare advocates will argue that pediatric dental and vision coverage were made totally better by the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d package Obamacare mandates, but a) those benefit definitions differ by state, so it\u2019s hard to which families will see a net benefit after being robbed of their old option and b) many people are finding those plans more expensive and less attractive than their former options. And, you can\u2019t access them on the exchange anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter a whole lot.\n\nHey, but I\u2019m sure none of the families who need braces for multiple kids and glasses to go with them are in the middle class or struggling. And, I\u2019m sure all the families who used FSA funds for their special-needs children will be comforted by their months-long wait times in a health care exchange where they can\u2019t even pay for their policies. We knew all this four years ago, but reassuring Obamacare claims that were \u201chalf-true\u201d back then have a way of becoming recognized as big ol\u2019 lies lately. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of them.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Inflexible.", "title": "ObamaCare makes braces, glasses more expensive for some families", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/13/obamacare-makes-braces-glasses-more-expensive-for-some-families/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-14T00:41:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-14T00:27:11+00:00"}, "keywords": "fsa, health care, HSA, ObamaCare, pre-tax,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Before Obamacare, there was no government-imposed limit on contributions to an FSA, though there were sometimes limits set by employers.\nAn FSA allows families to put away a certain amount of pre-tax dollars each year, with the stipulation that whatever is unspent is forfeited.\nHey, but I\u2019m sure none of the families who need braces for multiple kids and glasses to go with them are in the middle class or struggling.\nOn paper, this did two things Democrats love\u2014 take away a consumer choice and raise money to offset the cost of Obamacare.\nThey used to be allowed to spend those dollars on all kinds of health-related over-the-counter items until Obamacare\u2019s passage set stricter rules."}
