Burwell, will mark the fourth time the justices have weighed in on President Obama\u2019s signature law \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the second time it\u2019s heard from devout employers who object to the administration\u2019s \u201ccontraception mandate.\u201d\n\nReligious nonprofits are pushing for a full exemption from the regulation, an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved contraceptives in their plans or else pay crippling fines.\n\nThe justices shielded certain corporations from the contraception mandate in 2014, citing protections within the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. This term, the court will look beyond the mandate itself and decide if the government\u2019s attempt at compromise for the objecting nonprofits still imposes an undue burden.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who provide elder care, and a line of Catholic archdioceses and Christian colleges say an \u201caccommodation\u201d furnished by the Health and Human Services Department clears the way for a third party to provide drugs and services they view as sinful, particularly morning-after pills they equate with abortion.\n\n\u201cAfter promising that the Little Sisters\u2019 religious beliefs would be protected, the government created a new regulation requiring the Little Sisters change their healthcare plan to offer drugs that violate Catholic teaching,\u201d the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said in a statement announcing the date of argument.\n\nThe Justice Department will submit their main brief to the court in the coming days. At the circuit level, its attorneys compared the nonprofits to conscientious objectors who duck the draft and then want to block the government from naming someone else to fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A charity of nuns and other religious nonprofits who contested Obamacare's birth control rules will plead their case to the Supreme Court on March 23.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A charity of nuns and other religious nonprofits who contested Obamacare\u2019s birth control rules will plead their case to the Supreme Court on March 23.", "title": "Supreme Court sets date for birth-control mandate showdown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/29/supreme-court-sets-date-birth-control-mandate-show/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/06/12c7e567e7affb31860f6a7067000e04.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/06/12c7e567e7affb31860f6a7067000e04.jpg", "description": "A charity of nuns and other religious nonprofits who contested Obamacare's birth control rules will plead their case to the Supreme Court on March 23.", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court sets date for birth-control mandate showdown"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law Crime, Religion Belief, Labor, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "A charity of nuns and other religious nonprofits who contested Obamacare\u2019s birth control rules will plead their case to the Supreme Court on March 23.\nThe justices shielded certain corporations from the contraception mandate in 2014, citing protections within the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993.\nThis term, the court will look beyond the mandate itself and decide if the government\u2019s attempt at compromise for the objecting nonprofits still imposes an undue burden.\n\u201cAfter promising that the Little Sisters\u2019 religious beliefs would be protected, the government created a new regulation requiring the Little Sisters change their healthcare plan to offer drugs that violate Catholic teaching,\u201d the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said in a statement announcing the date of argument.\nThe Justice Department will submit their main brief to the court in the coming days."}
