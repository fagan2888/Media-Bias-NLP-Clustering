The vote took nine minutes.\n\nThe public learned little about the board's thinking that day.\n\nThe board, knowing that legal challenges were likely, declined to publicly discuss the process it used to select a winner. Instead, it released a 172-page decision that cited the winning project's proximity to the city's sports stadiums. It also called the project \"right sized\" and \"not overbuilt.\"\n\nClarke: in or out?\n\nNext question: Will City Council President Darrell Clarke seek a fifth term on Council in the May 19 Democratic primary election or enter the mayoral race?\n\nClarke has a go-to answer when asked if he is running for mayor.\n\n\"Not today,\" he tells people.\n\nThat answer has become a little too cute and coy for the city's Democratic Party players and political donors, who have grown tired of Clarke effectively freezing the field while he holds plenty of campaign fundraisers.\n\nClarke, at a fundraiser during last week's Pennsylvania Society gathering in New York City, told supporters that he'd have something to say around New Year's Day.\n\nIs there a hint in that? What politician buries into a holiday weekend an announcement about a campaign for a new office?\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Clarke won't run for mayor.\n\nIf true, that gives rise to a new question: Will City Controller Alan Butkovitz run for mayor?\n\nButkovitz is leaving that door open, despite announcing Nov. 17 that he would not run for mayor because Clarke would not declare his intentions. Butkovitz has said he would not seek the office if Clarke did.\n\nFattah's future?\n\nIf you just arrived in Philadelphia for the first time yesterday, things might look pretty swell for U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah.\n\nFattah last month won an 11th two-year term with 88 percent of the vote. He held a breakfast fundraiser Wednesday and opened a new district office yesterday.\n\nStill, serious trouble seems to be looming in Fattah's future.\n\nA key political aide and friend, Greg Naylor, pleaded guilty in federal court in August to repaying an illegal $1 million loan to Fattah's 2007 campaign for mayor with $600,000 in federal funds.\n\nFattah's former consultant Tom Lindenfeld pleaded guilty one day after the Nov. 4 general election to being in on the scam.\n\nFederal court documents for Naylor and Lindenfeld describe the scam being directed by \"Elected Official A.\" It doesn't take much detective work to determine that refers to Fattah.\n\nThe congressman has denied doing anything illegal and has suggested that federal agents \"may have crossed the line\" in their seven-year investigation.\n\nThe federal probe is sapping Fattah's resources. His latest campaign-finance report, filed two weeks ago, showed he had just $7,019 in the bank.\n\nFattah spent more than he took in during the reporting period, which covered Oct. 16 to Nov. 24, with $27,000 going to legal fees. That was three out of every four dollars he raised in the period.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2014-12-19/news/57237596_1_parx-casino-bart-blatstein-cordish-co", "site_name": "philly-archives", "type": "article", "description": "CLOUT CLOSES OUT 2014 with a final column of questions we hope to have answered in 2015.
