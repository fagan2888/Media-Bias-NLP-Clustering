The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reports a proposed Medicaid expansion would cost $978 million through 2027.

A private actuarial firm, Optumas, calculated the cost based on proposed legislation (LB1032) that lawmakers are considering now.

Calder Lynch, DHHS Division of Medicaid director, says that’s too costly and could end up being more expensive.

“The state would be on the hook for continuing to finance this program over time and if the federal dollars were to ever diminish, we would have to put up as much as $600 million a year in new state funding to cover the cost at our normal matching rate,” Lynch says.

The proposed Transitional Health Insurance Program sponsored by State Senator John McCollister would allow more uninsured Nebraskans to use state and federal Medicaid dollars to purchase insurance.

“I think we need to look beyond Medicaid,” Lynch says. “I think this is going to take conversations at the national level, across the state, with private sector folks, with government folks, with community stakeholders to find more sustainable ways to address this need for Nebraska and for other states.”

Lynch says he would like to see more flexibility from the federal government on options for helping uninsured Nebraskans get coverage through the Affordable Care Act.
