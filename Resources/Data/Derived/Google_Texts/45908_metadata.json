These cellular changes ultimately reversed the animals\u2019 reclusive, avoidant behaviors for just over a month. While incomparable to human models, which still demand clinical trials, the team believes their findings belie the assumption that autism is somehow permanent.\n\n\"Twenty percent of the known factors associated with autism are genetic, but most are not,\u201d said Dr. Robert Naviaux, senior author and professor of medicine, pediatrics, and pathology, in a statement. \u201cIt's wrong to think of genes and the environment as separate and independent factors. Genes and environmental factors interact. The net result of this interaction is metabolism.\"\n\nOne of the telltale signs of autism, when looking at a cell, is its number of metabolic disturbances. Surrounding each cell in the body is a ring of metabolites and nucleotides. These substances broadly serve to regulate metabolism in the body. But when microbes or bacteria, threats to the cell, confront these metabolites, the cell\u2019s outer layer stiffens. Communication between cells starts to degrade. Collectively, this process is known as the cell danger response.\n\n\"Cells behave like countries at war,\" Naviaux said. When there\u2019s a threat, walls go up and countries stop communicating. In the case of neurons, he explains, this may mean fewer or too many connections. \u201cOne way to look at this related to autism is this: When cells stop talking to each other, children stop talking.\"\n\nIn the United States, because of a mix of genetic, environmental, or lifestyle factors, the autism rate in children is ascending with a troubling velocity. In the year 2000, the rate was roughly one in 150 children. By 2010, the rate had increased to one in 68. Boys are especially prone to autism diagnoses, as the rate pales in comparison to girls: one in 42 versus one in 189. Scientists have yet to pin down a conclusive cause \u2014 it\u2019s likely an amalgam of many factors working together, Naviaux suspects \u2014 and research on the disorder, while robust, hasn\u2019t bore much fruit.\n\nIn 2013, Naviaux authored a study that found that mice at 6 weeks old (15 years by human standards) saw a dramatic slide in autism-like symptoms when their cell danger response persisted. In his team\u2019s latest study, mice at 6 months old (30 years) displayed the same behavior. But when they introduced suramin, which has been in use since the 20th century as a way to kill organisms responsible for African sleeping sickness, the mice\u2019s autistic behavior stopped. Mazes no longer seemed unappealing. They joined other mice. Seventeen of the 18 major pathways that had been disrupted by the danger response had corrected or improved.\n\nMigrating the drug from mice to humans isn\u2019t so simple, however. Rodent tests far too often fail once they reach the human stage, for the sole reason that mice aren\u2019t people. Our brains aren\u2019t identical. Injecting prolonged doses of suramin into children, for instance, would almost certainly result in sweeping anemia. Purinergic receptors, those that interact with many autism-like behaviors via cells, aren\u2019t only affected by suramin, however. The findings imply that other compounds could yield the same effect if they target these receptors in safer ways \u2014 provided that smaller doses of suramin fail human trials.\n\n\u201cThe discovery that a single dose of medicine can fundamentally reset metabolism for weeks means that newer and safer drugs might not need to be given chronically,\u201d Naviaux said. \u201cMembers of this new class of medicines might need to be given only intermittently during sensitive developmental windows to unblock metabolism and permit improved development in response to many kinds of behavioral and occupational therapies, and to natural play.\"\n\nSource: Naviaux J, Schuchbauer M, Li M, et al.
