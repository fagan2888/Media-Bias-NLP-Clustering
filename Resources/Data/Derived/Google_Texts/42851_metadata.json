James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the Patriot Act\u2019s original author, told The Hill in a statement.\n\nHe argues Apple and other companies are taking the privacy of consumers into their own hands because Congress has failed to pass legislation in response to public anger over the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance programs.\n\n\u201cWhile Director Comey says the pendulum has swung too far toward privacy and away from law enforcement, he fails to acknowledge that Congress has yet to pass any significant privacy reforms,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause of this failure, businesses have taken matters into their own hands to protect their consumers and their bottom lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this becomes the norm, I suggest to you that homicide cases could be stalled, suspects walked free, child exploitation not discovered and prosecuted,\u201d he said last week.\n\nComey is asking that Congress update the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law that required telephone companies to make it possible for federal officials to wiretap their users' phone calls.\n\nMany new mobile applications and other modern devices aren\u2019t included under the law, however, making it difficult if not impossible for police to get a suspect\u2019s records \u2014 even with a warrant.\n\nForcing companies to put in a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to give officials access would also open them up to hackers in China and Russia, opponents claim, as well as violate Americans\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy.\n\nComey claimed the FBI was not looking for a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into people\u2019s devices.\n\n\u201cWe want to use the front door with clarity and transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for critics, that\u2019s a distinction without a difference.\n\n\u201cThe notion that it\u2019s not a backdoor; it\u2019s a front door \u2014 that\u2019s just wordplay,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. \u201cIt just makes no sense.\u201d\n\nIt is reminiscent, he said, of the mid-1990s debate over the \u201cClipper Chip,\u201d an electronic chip that federal officials wanted to insert in devices allowing them to access people\u2019s communications. In the end, Congress did not require that companies use that chip in their technology.\n\nSimilar arguments have emerged every few years, as technology has gotten better and government agents have feared being left behind.\n\n\u201cThis is the third or fourth replay,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology. \u201cSo far Congress has done the right thing and stood aside when companies are given the latitude they need to make communications devices and services more secure.\u201d\n\nEarly indications are that it could be an uphill push for the FBI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if more than a handful of members would support the idea of backdooring Americans\u2019 personal property,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who would staunchly oppose the measure, said in a statement shared with The Hill.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, on Friday tweeted that the administration would be making a \u201ctough sell\u201d by pushing an update to CALEA.\n\n\u201cTo FBI Director Comey and the [administration] on criticisms of legitimate businesses using encryption: you reap what you sow,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) predicted that any bill would have \u201czero chance\u201d of passing.\n\nEarlier this year, she and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) introduced a measure to the defense spending bill banning the National Security Agency from using \u201cbackdoor\u201d searches to spy on Americans through a legal provision targeting foreigners. That measure overwhelmingly passed the House 293-123.\n\nWhile the NSA\u2019s spying is different from the FBI\u2019s requested updated to CALEA, the spirit is the same, she said.\n\n\u201cI think the public would not support it, certainly industry would not support it, civil liberties groups would not support it,\u201d Lofgren told The Hill. \u201cI think [Comey is] a sincere guy, but there\u2019s just no way this is going to happen.\u201d\n\nStill, the FBI is unlikely to drop the pressure, especially if tech companies keep putting a focus on their privacy protections.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term discussion that has been coming and I expect to continue,\u201d said Carl Szabo, a lobbyist for NetChoice, a trade group for online businesses including Google, eBay and Yahoo.\n\nAs for the chances of a CALEA update, he is opposed but isn\u2019t assuming the FBI will stand down.\n\n\u201cI never underestimate anything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI always think that there is a chance, even if it\u2019s not as sweeping as installing a front door master key on every mobile device, it could be installing a small backdoor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "FBI director wants Congress to revise law to help police.", "description": "FBI director wants Congress to revise law to help police.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "FBI director wants Congress to revise law to help police.", "title": "\u2018Crypto wars\u2019 return to Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/221147-crypto-wars-return-to-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/comeyjames_090514getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-20T13:06:40-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/221147-crypto-wars-return-to-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "FBI director wants Congress to revise law to help police.", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Crypto wars\u2019 return to Congress"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-20T13:06-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/221147-crypto-wars-return-to-congress", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-20T06:31-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cybersecurity,James Comey, James Sensenbrenner, Zoe Lofgren,FBI, NSA", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-20T06:31:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-20T13:06:40-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "\u2018Crypto wars\u2019 return to Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6ed\"", "article_summary": "FBI Director James Comey has launched a new \u201ccrypto war\u201d by asking Congress to update a two-decade-old law to make sure officials can access information from people\u2019s cellphones and other communication devices.\nIn the end, Congress did not require that companies use that chip in their technology.\n\u201cTo FBI Director Comey and the [administration] on criticisms of legitimate businesses using encryption: you reap what you sow,\u201d he wrote.\nComey is asking that Congress update the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law that required telephone companies to make it possible for federal officials to wiretap their users' phone calls.\nAs for the chances of a CALEA update, he is opposed but isn\u2019t assuming the FBI will stand down."}
