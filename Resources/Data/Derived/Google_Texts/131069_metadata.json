For one thing, it will improve the U.S. trade balance \u2014 in 2012, net oil imports accounted for more than half of the U.S. trade deficit. A freer market for domestic oil will also set the stage for an eventual renaissance in domestic oil production and related jobs, whenever oil prices return to higher levels. It may also have a positive effect on national security by giving other countries an American alternative for their energy.\n\nThe sops traded in exchange for this out of necessity \u2014 basically, some renewable energy and environmental slush funds, and a special interest tax break for independent refiners \u2014 are probably worth the cost.\n\nThe bad news about this omnibus is mostly about what is not contained in the bill. Planned Parenthood will continue to feast at the taxpayer's expense. A number of the Obama administration's executive initiatives are not curtailed through withholding of funds, either.\n\nMitigating this somewhat is the fact that many of these initiatives are not going forward for now anyway. Some, such as the Waters of the United States rule and the executive immigration amnesty, have been halted by the courts, at least for the moment. This is not true, however, of the Clean Power Plan, although it is under litigation.\n\nIt is somewhat disappointing that this omnibus bill will not help restore certainty on these matters by cutting off Obama's freelance efforts at policy and rulemaking. But in divided government, one enters the process expecting to make tradeoffs that one will not like. The tradeoffs in this bill are undesirable, but Republicans have done much worse in the recent past without getting nearly as much in return.\n\nAnother important thing about this bill is that it will hopefully give the new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., time to get his chamber in order to pass all of the various agency spending bills ahead of next year's appropriations process. Congress has been passing more and more omnibus bills in recent years, to the point that the regular process has become the exception rather than the rule. This matters, because it means repeated showdowns over government-wide shutdowns, inevitably resulting in grand bargains that rarely shake out in favor of conservative principles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress has finally wheeled out a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, which will basically keep the government from shutting down until next fall's election.
