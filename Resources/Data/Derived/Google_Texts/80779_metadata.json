(Photo: Sean Dougherty, USA TODAY)\n\nHillary Clinton is one of the smartest people I know. The central goal of her presidency will be raising the incomes of working families, and she\u2019s the only candidate with practical plans to achieve that goal.\n\nIn every issue she addresses, she asks, \u201cHow will this boost Americans\u2019 take-home pay and allow them to keep more money in their pocket?\u201d This is clear from her support for a minimum wage hike, equal pay for women, sharing corporate profits with workers, capping out-of-pocket drug costs, and free community college and debt-free tuition at public colleges.\n\nHillary has also answered this question clearly when it comes to health care, trade and energy. She has called for repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d standing with working families who are seeing costs shifted onto their backs as their deductibles rise.\n\nIn opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she raised concerns about whether it would sufficiently raise wages and create good U.S. jobs. She understands that trade agreements can contribute to world stability and peace, but she\u2019s also willing to learn lessons from past deals that have harmed some struggling American families. Her presidency will be about easing that struggle.\n\nHillary hoped to give the president and her successor, Secretary John Kerry, the time and space to make a decision on the Keystone pipeline. But she owed it to voters to make her position clear: She opposes a pipeline that she believes won\u2019t create good, long-term jobs. Instead, she has offered a plan to boost American renewable energy \u2014 an industry poised to create millions of good jobs.\n\nOn issue after issue, Clinton is showing steely determination in fighting for families. But this isn\u2019t a surprise. Her first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. As first lady, she helped pass the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which has helped millions of kids get covered. As senator, she fought for 9/11 first responders and their families to ensure they got the benefits and compensation they deserved.\n\nThe most important long-term issue in this campaign is how to recreate a strong middle class and give every American a shot at the American Dream again. She is the only candidate on either side of the aisle who has laid out practical, specific plans to do that, and that is precisely why she is best suited to be our next president.\n\nHoward Dean, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, is the former governor of Vermont.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LpGsOf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "She\u2019s the only presidential candidate with practical plans to achieve that goal, writes Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "She\u2019s the only presidential candidate with practical plans to achieve that goal, writes Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.", "title": "Howard Dean: Hillary fights for working families", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/11/hillary-clinton-howard-dean-presidential-candidate-editorials-debates/73784684/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She\u2019s the only presidential candidate with practical plans to achieve that goal, writes Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.", "title": "Howard Dean: Hillary fights for working families", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c448f144c78656cd2d3a8460368d1304681c0c1/c=254-0-935-681&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Opinion", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Topics/Opinion", "title": "Howard Dean: Hillary fights for working families", "author": "Howard Dean", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0c8f5657fef36d7b0119811d1473b261f483f06/c=407-0-918-681/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7102a3d649b6cf6231158ffe329c7e81755be573/c=254-0-935-681/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e20f217a2687cdd1a58471eec9464567320e66cf/c=59-0-965-681/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cee253a003c0c12a20a628874bbbcfe559e390d/c=0-56-1023-634&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-10-11T17:10:03.250000-04:00", "shorthed": "Howard Dean: Hillary fights for working families", "articleid": 73784684, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0610175d90da042e38faef94d75548c48e36e8bc/c=0-56-1023-634/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92eee52066439f45a61608fb8051c07da0757192/c=487-0-868-681/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801789803088395-OPPOSE-1-.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean, 2016 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate, editorials, debates,"}, "article_summary": "The central goal of her presidency will be raising the incomes of working families, and she\u2019s the only candidate with practical plans to achieve that goal.\nOn issue after issue, Clinton is showing steely determination in fighting for families.\nIn opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she raised concerns about whether it would sufficiently raise wages and create good U.S. jobs.\nBut she owed it to voters to make her position clear: She opposes a pipeline that she believes won\u2019t create good, long-term jobs.\nShe understands that trade agreements can contribute to world stability and peace, but she\u2019s also willing to learn lessons from past deals that have harmed some struggling American families."}
