In that case, four justices voted to strike down the entire legislation as unconstitutional. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the four liberal justices to uphold the core of the law.\n\nThis time, the outcome at the high court would turn on whether at least one of the five conservative justices agreed to uphold Congress\u2019 broad goal of providing all Americans with insurance they can afford.\n\nSoon after the Affordable Care Act won final approval in 2010, conservative groups pointed out an anomaly in its wording. The problem involved a key section of the law, which called for creating insurance marketplaces, or \u201cexchanges,\u201d where buyers could shop for coverage. People with low or middle incomes \u2014 up to $94,200 for a family of four \u2014 are offered tax credits to help pay for the insurance.\n\nWhite House says it's confident in legal basis for Affordable Care Act The White House reiterated its support for the legality of the Affordable Care Act after an appeals court ruling that some say could derail the law's success.

But if states refused the job, Congress authorized federal officials to \u201coperate such exchange within the state\u201d and carry out all the required duties. However, in another part of the law, Congress said tax credits would be offered for insurance purchased through an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nConservative legal groups have argued ever since that the wording \u201cexchange established by the state\u201d does not include the federal exchange. That reading of the law would block insurance subsidies in two-thirds of the nation.\n\nFederal healthcare subsidies 36 states opted for federal healthcare subsidies. 36 states opted for federal healthcare subsidies.\n\nCurrently only 14 states, including California, run their own exchanges. In 36 states, including Texas, Florida and Illinois, the exchange is run by the federal government. Some states that ran their own exchanges this year but had trouble have announced plans to use the federal exchange for the open enrollment season that begins in November.\n\nAbout 5 million Americans bought subsidized policies through the federal exchange this year, often reducing their costs by hundreds of dollars a month, healthcare experts say.\n\nTwo years ago, the Internal Revenue Service interpreted the law to mean that tax credits would be available for insurance purchased through any government-run exchange, regardless of whether it was run by state or federal authorities.\n\nConservative groups and Republican attorneys joined in four lawsuits to challenge that IRS rule. The two leading cases led to Tuesday\u2019s opposing rulings.\n\nIn Washington, an appeals court focused strictly on the wording of the law and struck down the IRS rule on a 2-1 vote.\n\n\u201cA federal exchange is not an \u2018exchange established by the state,\u2019\u201d Judge Thomas Griffith said for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. His ruling would not allow tax credits in the 36 states with federally run exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe reach this conclusion, frankly, with reluctance,\u201d Griffith wrote for himself and Judge A. Raymond Randolph, both Republican appointees. \u201cOur ruling will likely have significant consequences both for millions of individuals receiving tax credits and for health insurance markets more broadly.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s lone Democratic appointee, Judge Harry Edwards, dissented, describing the case as a \u201cnot-so-veiled attempt to gut\u201d the healthcare law.\n\nConservative leaders hailed the D.C. court\u2019s ruling. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called it \u201ca repudiation of Obamacare and all the lawlessness that has come with it.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, however, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., upheld the IRS rule. In its 3-0 decision, the judges focused on the overall intent of the law. They noted that the congressional sponsors wanted to provide affordable coverage to all and had devised the exchanges and the subsidies as a means to that end. By that logic, the judges concluded, it made no sense to deny the subsidies to millions whose states chose not to run an exchange.\n\nJudge Roger Gregory, who was nominated by President Clinton and appointed under President George W. Bush, wrote that the wording of the law was \u201cambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.\u201d But in such a case, the balance tips in favor of the agency charged with implementing the law, he said.\n\nMoreover, the \u201ceconomic framework supporting the Act would crumble if the credits were unavailable on federal exchanges,\u201d since millions of Americans could not afford to buy insurance, he wrote. Judges Stephanie Thacker and Andre Davis, both Obama appointees, joined him.\n\nThe pair of rulings will have no immediate impact pending further appeals, government officials said.\n\nObama administration lawyers will appeal the D.C. panel\u2019s decision to the full D.C. Circuit Court. There, seven of the 11 judges are Democratic appointees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people all across the country to understand that this ruling does not have any practical impact on their ability to continue to receive tax credits right now,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cThis will work its way through the legal process.\u201d\n\nWashington attorney Michael Carvin, a veteran of the Reagan administration, argued both cases decided Tuesday. He also was on the legal team that unsuccessfully argued before the Supreme Court two years ago that Obamacare was unconstitutional.\n\nAlthough the lawsuits are backed by conservative and libertarian groups that oppose the law, the judges in both circuits said they would not rule on \u201cpurely ideological\u201d claims. Each suit needed at least one real plaintiff who could show an economic injury from the workings of the law, they said.\n\nIn the D.C. Circuit case, that person was David Klemencic, a West Virginia resident who said he \u201cexpects to earn approximately $20,000 this year.\u201d He does not wish to buy health insurance, according to his complaint, even if he receives a subsidy.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Federal appeals courts issue conflicting rulings on Obamacare", "date": "2014-07-22", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The legal battle over President Obama\u2019s healthcare law ramped up again Tuesday, as two federal appeals courts handed down conflicting rulings on whether the government can continue to pay subsidies nationwide to millions of low- and middle-income people to help them with the cost of insurance.", "title": "Federal appeals courts issue conflicting rulings on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-court-obamacare-subsidies-20140711-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53ce7b7e/turbine/la-na-nn-court-obamacare-subsidies-20140711", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, appeals court, subsidies, Obamacare", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80780505", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, appeals court, subsidies, Obamacare", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The legal battle over President Obama\u2019s healthcare law ramped up again Tuesday, as two federal appeals courts handed down conflicting rulings on whether the government can continue to pay subsidies nationwide to millions of low- and middle-income people to help them with the cost of insurance. ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8b6\"", "article_summary": "Federal healthcare subsidies 36 states opted for federal healthcare subsidies.\nThe White House reiterated its support for the legality of the Affordable Care Act after an appeals court ruling that some say could derail the law's success.\n\u201cA federal exchange is not an \u2018exchange established by the state,\u2019\u201d Judge Thomas Griffith said for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.\nAbout 5 million Americans bought subsidized policies through the federal exchange this year, often reducing their costs by hundreds of dollars a month, healthcare experts say.\nIn Washington, an appeals court focused strictly on the wording of the law and struck down the IRS rule on a 2-1 vote."}
