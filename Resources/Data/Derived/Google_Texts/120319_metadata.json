For some, education and the ensuing career possibilities are key to living a longer, less stressful, and stable life \u2014 something they might say would be more difficult for someone without an education. But it turns out that an education could have nothing to do with living a long life. According to a new study, people without an education can live for just as long simply by having a sense of control over their lives.\n\nIt may sound obvious. After all, anyone who has a sense of confidence and control over the way they accomplish their goals and deal with hardships will probably feel less stressed. But other research has shown that people who aren\u2019t educated are more likely to die younger.\n\nThe current study suggests the opposite. Although there was no association between having an education and longevity, people who were uneducated, but had a high sense of control over their lives also had a mortality rate three times lower than those with a low sense of control. \u201cA high sense of control all but wipes out educational differences when it comes to mortality,\u201d said Margie Lachman, a professor of psychology at Brandeis University, in a press release. \u201cA person with less education but a high sense of control is practically indistinguishable from a person of high education.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tracked 6,135 people, aged 25 to 75, over the course of 14 years. At the outset, between 1994 and 1996, the participants were asked to rate their agreement to a set of statements, such as \u201cSometimes I feel I am being pushed around in my life,\u201d which were meant to assess their perceived control. By 2009, nearly 600 participants had died. Those who had a higher sense of control lived for longer, even after accounting for factors that would normally put someone down, like depression and chronic illnesses.\n\n\u201cHealth and longevity are not just due to health care access,\u201d Lachman told HealthDay. \u201cAttitudes make a difference. How you construe your circumstances and challenges determine whether you take action or give up, or feel stressed or motivated\u201d Qualities like being able to take hold of ones circumstances can be taught through education, Lachman said, but they can also be taught through more broad public health programs aimed at \u201chealth-promoting attitudes and behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe reason for these correlations, according to Shevaun Neupert, an associate professor of psychology at North Carolina State University, is that feeling in control can be \u201cpartially derived from happiness or satisfaction, and there is probably a feedback process at work,\u201d she told HealthDay. \u201cA low sense of control may lead to less happiness, which in turn would lead to even lower sense of control.\u201d\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s all about the attitude. \u201cWhether individuals that we studied actually \u2026 have control over their lives is irrelevant in our study,\u201d Lachman told HealthDay.\n\nSource: Turiano N, Chapman B, Lachman M, et al.
