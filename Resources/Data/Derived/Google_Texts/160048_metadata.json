Nevertheless, the Harvard study adds to a growing body of evidence that having health insurance increases a person\u2019s life expectancy,\" Stateline reported.\n\nMortality rates \u2013 in this case, the number of deaths per 100,000 adults between the ages of 20 and 64 that occur in a given year \u2013 vary widely among states, Stateline reported.\n\nFor instance, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Louisiana have the highest age-adjusted rates (which recognize that some states have older or younger populations). Hawaii, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York and Massachusetts have the lowest mortality rates, Stateline reported, citing 2010 data (the most recent available) from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUninsured rates also vary widely. Between 2011 and 2012 Massachusetts had the lowest uninsured rate in the nation at 4 percent of its population, compared to a national average of 15 percent, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of U.S. Census data. Texas had the highest rate at 25 percent, followed by Nevada (24 percent) and New Mexico and Florida (both 22 percent), Stateline reported.\n\nWhile it is \"difficult to compare one state to another when it comes to mortality rates ... All the evidence points in the direction of health insurance increasing longevity. We just don\u2019t know the magnitude of the effect,\" Alison Cuellar, a health economist at George Mason University, told Stateline.\n\nThe rest of the day's news starts now.\n\nIn a fantastic piece of reporting, our colleague Don Gilliland looks at what it'll take for The Other Three to catch Tom Wolfe on Tuesday.\n\nA new controversy, as that woman says Sen. Lisa Boscola lied about apology over April bar incident, our Capitol colleague Jeff Frantz reports.\n\nPoliticsPA gives us this week's list of the winners and losers in state politics.\n\nTom Wolf is the Dems \"darling\" to take on Tom Corbett, The Post-Gazette reports.\n\nThe Democrats are expected to break campaign spending records this primary season, The Tribune-Review reports.\n\nAllentown's arena zone has reached $1 billion in proposed development, The Morning Call reports.\n\nIn the final poll of the campaign, Tom Wolf is up 23 points in The Morning Call/Muhlenberg poll, Keystone Politics notes.\n\nHeavy Rotation.\n\nHere's Scottish technopop trio CHVRCHES and \"The Mother We Share,\" caught live.\n\nAnd now you're up to date.
