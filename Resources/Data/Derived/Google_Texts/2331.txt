President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March of 2010. Since then, the medical device tax contained in the bill has proven to be a job-killer, and many Democrats have even voted to repeal the tax.

Has over four years been enough time for possible 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton to draw any conclusions?

I expect a comment from Clinton on Obamacare's medical device tax today. She is appearing before @AdvaMedConf, a group that opposes the tax. — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 8, 2014

In prepared remarks, Hillary Clinton didn't mention the medical device tax by name. She did acknowledge the group's concerns w/ Obamacare. — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 8, 2014

Clinton gets question on medical device tax. Says, "I am well aware of your concerns… And I think you have an argument to make." — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 8, 2014

Clinton gives a non-answer on the medical device tax. Says opponents have a case but still need to look at "the pluses and the minuses." — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 8, 2014

"I don't know what the right answer about the tax is," Clinton says of the medical device tax. — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 8, 2014

Take your time, Ms. Clinton.
