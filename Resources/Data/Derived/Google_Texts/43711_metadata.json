We could dream about escaping $90-a-month fees for hundreds of channels we didn\u2019t need, but such flights of imagination were, in the short term, hopeless, due to the arrangement of the pay-TV business and fruitful economics of bundling. In 2013, I wrote another column explaining how ESPN had become perhaps the most lucrative entertainment company in the world by gleaning $5 a month from every cable-watching household, even those that had never watched a second of SportsCenter. Two years ago, cable television stretched like a massive arch across the entertainment landscape and ESPN was its keystone. The future, I said, would probably look a lot like the present. Architects don\u2019t carelessly part with their keystones. Cable wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Well, two and a half years later, I\u2019m not ashamed to say that I\u2019m beginning to look like an idiot. On Monday, ESPN announced that it\u2019s teaming up with Dish to offer a new Web-only product, Sling TV, that will allow viewers to stream a small bundle of channels including ESPN for just $20. The worldwide leader in sports joins HBO and CBS (including Showtime) in giving cord-cutters a way to watch their channels without buying the full cable package.\n\nPut more dramatically: The most prestigious cable network, the most-watched TV network, and the most expensive cable network have all announced plans to side-step the traditional cable bundle\u2014since just October. (For the next four months to continue the trajectory of such drama, the NFL would have to be shut down for the 2015 season, and Congress would pass a law banning further production on NCIS.) The economics behind Sling TV are straightforward. There are 10 to 15 million American households with a broadband Internet connection and no cable. Right now they are paying TV companies practically nothing. TV companies would like them to pay something. So they'll try to thread the needle by creating a product that is good enough for this group\u2014a.k.a.: the cord-cutters or the cord-nevers\u2014but not so good that cable subscribers trade in their $90 monthly payments. Whether this offering will \u201cwork\u201d is unknowable at the moment. Dish has been buying up lots of wireless spectrum nationwide to make Sling TV work smoothly, but anybody who\u2019s tried to watch live TV on their computer knows it can be a hair-tuggingly awful experience. But whether it \u201cworks\u201d is also a secondary story. The real story is that it\u2019s happening in the first place. The cable bundle is coming apart, and there\u2019s basically no way we\u2019re ever getting back to 2012. The very concept of television has unbundled completely. The word itself means radically different things for different generations. To a teenager, television might mean YouTube, Vine, and Facebook videos. To a twentysomething college grad, it is (their parents\u2019 password to) Netflix and (their roommate\u2019s sister\u2019s password to) HBO Go. To a family of four, it\u2019s the plain old cable bundle. To a sports fanatic living alone, it\u2019s $90 a month to watch ESPN. Going forward, it seems TV fans will have three options: (1) A La Carte, where viewers cobble together Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other Internet fare, little of which is live; (2) The Little Bundle, like Sling TV and other cheap packages of live channels; and (3) The Big Bundle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The TV bundle continues to molt: A new product from Dish makes ESPN and a handful of other channels available over the Internet for $20.", "author": "Derek Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The massive pay-television business continues to come apart", "title": "ESPN Without Cable?
