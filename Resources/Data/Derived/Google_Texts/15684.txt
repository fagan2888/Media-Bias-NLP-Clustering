Colorado is entering the fire and flood season and a workshop Monday at the Ranch Events Complex in Loveland will help prepare people and groups who want pets to survive those calamities.

The Animal Disaster Sheltering Exercise is being sponsored by Colorado State University’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital and will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

It will be led by Diane Robinson, owner of Disaster Animal Shelter Education and former training manager of the American Humane Association’s Red Star Animal Emergency Services Response program.

The event, co-sponsored by CSU Extension and The Ranch (Larimer County Fairgrounds), is designed for supervisor-level personnel in charge of selecting, setting up and managing animal shelters when disasters such as wildfires or floods strike, said CSU.

The group of about 35 will include county extension agents, veterinarians, fairground managers, Humane Society representatives and animal control officers.

Regan Adams, coordinator of CSU Veterinary Extension and event organizer, said participants will share their experiences and discuss setup and layout designs, dilemmas and standard protocols.

The event is about “not waiting for the next disaster to do your planning,” said Tim Hackett, director of the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. “It’s important to get everybody in the same room when they’re not out fighting fires or saving animals from flood.”
