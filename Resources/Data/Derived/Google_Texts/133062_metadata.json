Some things have worked pretty well, some things have not and we need to understand that because we\u2019re going to do a lot more of it,\u201d Thornberry said.\n\nRelated: DOD May Be Throwing Good Money After Bad on Syrian Training Program\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) struck a similar note. \u201cJust because they failed doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said right before labeling the Syria effort \u201can abject failure.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Central Command Chief Gen. Lloyd Austin managed to lower the bar for the rebel effort when he told McCain\u2019s panel that out of an initial batch of 54 graduates only a handful remained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small number ... we\u2019re talking four or five,\u201d he said, admitting there was zero chance the Pentagon would meet its original goal of 5,000 recruits a year.\n\nRelated: Why Even Obama Doesn\u2019t Know If We\u2019re Winning the War Against ISIS\n\n\u201cIt is taking a bit longer to get things done, but it must be this way if we are to achieve lasting and positive effects,\u201d Austin said.\n\nTo that end, DOD has not halted the thus far completely ineffectual effort. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Christine Wormuth, testifying alongside Austin, told lawmakers around 100 more rebels are in training today.\n\nThe Pentagon is conducting a soup-to-nuts assessment of the program, a major component of President Obama\u2019s anti-ISIS strategy. While no timeline has been given for when the internal review might end, lawmakers believe that after Austin\u2019s testimony, the department is painfully aware of their skepticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly time to reevaluate what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed (RI), the Armed Services panel\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cOne of the realities that everyone mentions is that there has to be some indigenous force on the ground \u2026 I think we have to exhaust that option before anything else.\u201d\n\nYet the former Army Ranger believes the U.S. shouldn\u2019t \u201cabandon this model.\u201d\n\nReed noted he recently visited Ukraine, where U.S. forces are instructing that country\u2019s military following Russia\u2019s seizure of the Crimea last year and the ongoing separatist unrest in the east.\n\n\u201cIn fact, our paratroopers are learning from them,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCain chalked the Syrian program\u2019s futility up to the \u201cincredible ineptitude of this administration.\u201d\n\nHe chided the Pentagon for making recruits swear an oath that they would fight ISIS, not the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has killed hundreds of thousands of his citizens during a nearly five-year civil war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d McCain said before making his oft-repeated argument that the administration should bring back retired Army general and former CIA Director David Petraeus and others who contributed to the \u201cSurge,\u201d the troop strategy then-President George W. Bush used in Iraq in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been done many times. Many, many times. It\u2019s not that hard,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said DOD leaders \u201cnow know we\u2019re looking carefully\u201d at the Syrian rebel program \u201cso they\u2019re going to have some answers in the next few months, certainly before the next fiscal year.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cIt would be na\u00efve and wrong to rule out any efforts to help countries rise up against extremists that are killing people in their country and threatening our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of saying, \u2018This will never work.\u2019 I think it\u2019s a matter of saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got a problem with this particular train and equip mission,\u2019\u201d according to McCaskill.\n\nShe added it may be time for Pentagon officials to \u201chave a gut-check moment\u201d and admit \u201cit\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) confessed he was \u201cstunned\u201d by Austin\u2019s admission and that it crystallized the program, so central to the administration\u2019s plan to defeat and degrade ISIS, \u201cis a failure worse than can be imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t go on,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s effort to train and equip \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels to serve as the boots on the ground against Islamic State militants has been branded a total failure following the disclosure that after nearly $42 million spent, only four or five remain in the fight.", "title": "Why Congress Won\u2019t Cut the Failed $500 Million Program to Fight ISIS in Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Why-Congress-Won-t-Cut-Failed-500-Million-Program-Fight-ISIS-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_ISIL_ISIS_Standing_Guard_Iraq.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Why-Congress-Won-t-Cut-Failed-500-Million-Program-Fight-ISIS-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_ISIL_ISIS_Standing_Guard_Iraq.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s effort to train and equip \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels to serve as the boots on the ground against Islamic State militants has been branded a total failure following the disclosure that after nearly $42 million spent, only four or five remain in the fight.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Program to Train Syrian Rebels Is a DisasterNor do they think the U.S. should get out of the business of exporting American military know-how.\nRelated: DOD May Be Throwing Good Money After Bad on Syrian Training ProgramSenate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) struck a similar note.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Capitol Hill lawmakers, who last year allocated $500 million for the effort, aren\u2019t ready to pull the plug on the program.\nThe Pentagon is conducting a soup-to-nuts assessment of the program, a major component of President Obama\u2019s anti-ISIS strategy.\n\u201cIf you look around the world, we\u2019re going to have to do lots of training and equipping and assisting."}
