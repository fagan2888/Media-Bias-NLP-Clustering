Steven Tucker is none too pleased with the law.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn this edition of Conference Room, Tucker tells FBN\u2019s Jeff Flock that many of his small-business clients are facing huge tax bills down the road, thanks to the health-care overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe chief concern is the return of the excise tax,\u201d says Tucker. While the tax has been temporarily waived by President Obama, Tucker says businesses above the employer-mandate threshold (more than 50 full-time workers) will eventually need to either provide ObamaCare-approved health insurance plans, or pay $2,000 per worker, with a 30-employee offset. And the $2,000 is a starting point, not a flat fine. According to Tucker, depending on the employer\u2019s current income-tax rates, it can cost more per employee.\n\n\u201cI have clients that are facing $200,000 excise tax beginning in 2014 \u2026 As soon as the president waived that, I called all of them \u2013 they were jumping for joy!\u201d says Tucker. He says his clients are trying to make preparations now to be ready for the potential tax burden when the mandate kicks in.\n\nNo \u2018Free\u2019 Health Care\n\nTucker says health care will initially appear to be affordable, based on the huge subsidies the government is paying to insurance companies on behalf of participants. But he says out-of-pocket costs under the new system will easily rack up to more than $10,000, making health care not so affordable after all.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTucker says these huge bills are due to the number of medical expenses now mandated by the law.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to 1979, there were a total of 252 federal- and state-imposed mandates,\u201d says Tucker. \u201cToday, post-ObamaCare, we\u2019re at 2,262 mandates, and they\u2019re not all medically necessary.\u201d\n\nTucker says the cost of gym membership, hair prosthetics and colonoscopies are among the mandated procedures driving up the cost of health care.\n\n\u201cGet the government\u2019s big boot off the private sector, and you\u2019ll see medical costs go down,\u201d says Tucker.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/The Conference Room", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:57:38 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Insurance broker C.
