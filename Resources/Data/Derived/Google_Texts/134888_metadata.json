Her request for a second office was denied.\n\nMILLION DOLLAR PMS\n\nKEVIN RUDD $200,000 pension plus estimated $300,000-a-year office and travel costs\n\nJULIA GILLARD $200,000 pension plus estimated $300,000-a-year office and travel costs\n\nJOHN HOWARD $250,000 pension plus $300,000 a year in office and travel costs.\n\nPAUL KEATING $140,000-a-year office, travel, phone costs + pension\n\nBOB HAWKE $130,000-a-year in office, travel, phone costs + pension\n\nMALCOLM FRASER $220,000-a-year office, travel, phone + pension\n\nGOUGH WHITLAM $125,000-a-year office, travel, phone + pension*\n\nSource: Department of Finance documents.\n\nWhen in New York, the two ex-PMs have also requested airport pick-up from the Department of Foreign Affairs and VIP treatment at international airports allowing them to skip the customs queue. Recently, this prompted a senior DFAT official to joke they should ask the ex-PMs to share a cab.\n\nKeeping Labor's ex-PMs happy with offices, cars, pensions and free flights has proved double trouble for the incoming government. Traditionally, the new PM finalises the arrangements in consultation with their predecessors.\n\nKevin Rudd has defended the arrangements confirming he is in the process of finalising staffing and office arrangements.\n\n\"As of Friday, Mr Rudd's office had not received confirmation from the Government about his staff entitlements for the period ahead. It is a matter for the Government of the day,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Mr Rudd has not been allocated any staff by the current government as a former PM beyond that currently provided to Former PMs Keating and Hawke.\n\n\"He is unaware of staffing arrangements for Mr. Howard. Nor of current arrangements for Ms. Gillard.\n\n\"Mr Rudd has not been allocated extra staff by the government for assistance in writing any memoir.\"\n\nWith taxpayer funded pensions for life worth an estimated $200,000 a year, Labor's ex-PMs will double the retirement costs of former Prime Minister John Howard who served for 11 years. Based on Mr Howard's annual office, travel and car costs of $300,000 a year, the cost of keeping two former Labor PMs is likely to cost taxpayers up to $1 million a year in pensions, travel, car and office costs.\n\nUnable to work together in government, it has emerged the bitter Labor enemies found one thing they could agree on - some of the taxpayer-funded benefits traditionally available to ex-PMs only after they leave politics should be granted to Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd while they remained in parliament.\n\n\"Clearly, it was a cosy deal but it was the taxpayer that footed the bill,'' a senior Coalition source said.\n\nWhen he quit as foreign minister in 2012, the gravy train continued with Mr Rudd securing an entitlement to more taxpayer funded travel and spousal travel than he would have secured as a normal backbencher.\n\nAsked directly if any of her staffers would now be involved in preparing research material for her memoirs, a spokesman for Ms Gillard referred the question to departmental officials.\n\n\"Staff arrangements for Ms Gillard have been approved by Prime Minister Abbott,'' he said. \"The guidelines for Ms Gillard are exactly the same as those applying to other prime ministers. Any queries should be directed to the relevant government ministers and departments.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "KEVIN Rudd bombarded the incoming Abbott government with demands for taxpayer-funded assistance for two Brisbane offices, staff and other perks, even ringing the Prime Minister to discuss his arrangements.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "KEVIN Rudd bombarded the incoming Abbott government with demands for taxpayer-funded assistance for two Brisbane offices, staff and other perks, even ringing the Prime Minister to discuss his arrangements.", "title": "Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd demand bigger perks for former Prime Ministers", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/julia-gillard-and-kevin-rudd-demand-bigger-perks-for-former-prime-ministers/story-fni0cx12-1226766891140", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/11/23/1226766/890816-1092f660-5413-11e3-9770-07dcc52d4773.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/11/23/1226766/890816-1092f660-5413-11e3-9770-07dcc52d4773.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226766891140, "keywords": "taxpayer-funded benefits, taxpayer-funded assistance, government ministers, prime ministers, senior adviser, office costs, peace offering, leaving office, life worth, exit politics, chauffeur driver, customs queue, gravy train, retirement costs, standard agreement, ,,New York,, Department of Foreign Affairs and VIP, Abbott, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd, John Howard, prime minister", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Nov 24 16:10:27 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sun Nov 24 16:10:27 EST 2013", "author": "Samantha Maiden"}}, "article_summary": "PAUL KEATING $140,000-a-year office, travel, phone costs + pensionBOB HAWKE $130,000-a-year in office, travel, phone costs + pensionMALCOLM FRASER $220,000-a-year office, travel, phone + pensionGOUGH WHITLAM $125,000-a-year office, travel, phone + pension*Source: Department of Finance documents.\n\"The guidelines for Ms Gillard are exactly the same as those applying to other prime ministers.\n\"Staff arrangements for Ms Gillard have been approved by Prime Minister Abbott,'' he said.\nKevin Rudd has defended the arrangements confirming he is in the process of finalising staffing and office arrangements.\n\"Mr Rudd has not been allocated extra staff by the government for assistance in writing any memoir.\""}
