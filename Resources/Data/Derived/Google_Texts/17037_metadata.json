The group is a Missouri-based 501c4 public policy organization \u2014 political nonprofit group \u2014 that will be dedicated to advancing free-market initiatives in state government to help ensure the health of our state\u2019s economy throughout the 21st century.\n\n\u201cI was having dinner with two of my great friends and two of Missouri and the country\u2019s top free market political professionals: Rich Chrismer and Jim Gwinner,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe were commenting, specifically, on how it\u2019s simply beyond belief that a state as conservative as Missouri would even consider expanding a program like Obamacare in our state. It\u2019s a horrible program that\u2019s kicked millions of Americans off their health care and the financial implications of expanding Obamacare have been dire in other states. Yet Obamacare expansion came dangerously close to becoming a reality last cycle and now our opponents are taking another run at it. We thought that we could add a common sense, free market voice to the conversation and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nMike Hafner and Holly Gogel will be joining Keller at the Missouri Century Foundation.\n\n\u201cOne of our team members who we\u2019re most excited about is our head of Government Relations, Mike Hafner, who\u2019s been a fixture in Missouri public policy for years,\u201d Keller said. \u201cMike will be at the Capitol advocating with policy makers and their staff on the issues we care most about in 2015: stopping Obamacare expansion, protecting Missourians\u2019 rights to assemble and associate and reforming public sector unions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to Board members Rich Chrismer and Jim Gwinner and head of GR Mike Hafner, we\u2019re joined at MCF by our Policy Analyst, Holly Gogel,\u201d Keller continued. \u201cHolly is a former legislative director in the Capitol and a Mizzou law grad. Holly will be working with our team to ensure that our research materials and background papers are an accurate reflection of how dangerous, for example, expanding Obamacare will be to our state. She\u2019s a rising star and one of the sharpest young lawyers conservatives have in this state and we\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d\n\nKeller told The Missouri Times that MCF is already fielding requests from groups in other states and nationally to weigh in on various issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling those folks that we are focused like a laser in 2015 on advocating on issues in the Missouri legislature like Obamacare expansion,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s flattering that our opinions are being sought on other issues, we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about what we decide to engage on.\u201d\n\nKeller\u2019s background is in campaigns and political consulting, and he says the organization will not allow him to lose focus at Atlas Strategies.\n\n\u201cThe level of staff talent at MCF is as high as any statewide campaign, and I\u2019ve worked on a few of those,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSo I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on MCF but still have time to work on other projects, political and corporate. Atlas Strategy\u2019s first year was extremely successful, crafting winning strategies for our corporate and political clients. I\u2019m looking forward to the company continuing to grow.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, announcing that he will file a bill to expand healthcare for veterans in Missouri. Silvey is the most outspoken Republican proponent of expanding Medicaid in the Senate.\n\nKeller has formerly served as the Executive Director of the American Conservative Union, National Executive Director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, National Coalitions Director on Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, campaign manager on the U.S. Senate campaign of Sen.
