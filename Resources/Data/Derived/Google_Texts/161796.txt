Sen. Ted Cruz attempted to campaign in the Bronx on Wednesday, but “New York values” weren’t so welcoming to the Republican presidential candidate.

The New York Daily News reported that the Texas senator was scheduled to speak at the Bronx Lighthouse College Preparatory Academy, but students weren’t having it. They wrote a letter to the principal that said if Cruz came, they were leaving.

“A group of students will be leaving during 4th period, as (an) act of civil disobedience in regards to the arrival of Ted Cruz to BLCPA,” the letter said. “We have all considered the consequences of our actions and are willing to accept them. The presence of Ted Cruz and the ideas he stands for are offensive. His views are against ours and are actively working to harm us, our community, and the people we love. “

They called Cruz “misogynistic, homophobic, and racist” in the letter, and some students claimed his views were against their immigrant backgrounds, despite the fact that Cruz is the son of an immigrant himself.

“We told [the principal] if he came here, we would schedule a walkout,” BLCPA student Destiny Domeneck told the Daily News. “Most of us are immigrants or come from immigrant backgrounds. Ted Cruz goes against everything our school stands for.”

Khori Whittaker, the CEO of Lighthouse Academies, agreed to cancel the visit and the school’s principal Alix Duggins commended the students for the “commitment to your beliefs and values.”

Call me crazy, but I thought a school principal’s job was to expand student’s minds and encourage them to hear differing views, rationalize them, and come to a conclusion.

It’s sad that at such a young age students have already figured out how to claim that they’re offended and triggered by what someone may or may not say in front of them.
