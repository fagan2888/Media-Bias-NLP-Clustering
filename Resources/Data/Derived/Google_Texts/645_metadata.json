If these sounds familiar, sorry, but they bear repeating.Texas Republicans have been vehemently opposed to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income single adults, and Abbott and Patrick are no exception. The decision to not expand health coverage means more than 1 million Texans\u2014including 600,000 Latinos and women\u2014are left uninsured. Thanks, bros.We have Dan Patrick to thank for the pre-abortion sonogram law, which requires that women seeking an abortion get an invasive transvaginal ultrasound before they can get the procedure. Abbott has spent a significant amount of hours fighting legal challenges to Texas\u2019 abortion laws, most recently arguing that House Bill 2 will protect the \u201chealth and safety of women.\u201d The law has already led to the loss of half the state\u2019s abortion clinics. Oh yea, and Patrick believes those of us who gathered at the Capitol for last year\u2019s 11-hour filibuster against the law \u201canarchists.\u201d And here we thought the Texas Capitol was ours.In the name of making babies, Abbott is currently fighting a challenge to Texas\u2019 same-sex marriage ban and repeated throughout his campaign that marriage is between a man and a woman. Patrick echoed that and was one of dozens of Republican lawmakers to sign on to a legal brief Abbott filed in court in the case.For years, Patrick has apologetically implored extreme rhetoric when it comes to border security and immigration. He\u2019s known for claiming that immigrants \u201care bringing Third World diseases\u201d to Texas, and echoed that extreme rhetoric during his one and only debate with his Democratic opponent Leticia Van de Putte: \u201cImmigrants often carry invisible diseases,\" he said.He also believes ISIS is storming our border and will kill us all.We all remember the day the Internet exploded when Phil Robertson of \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 was suspended from the show after making controversial and graphic statements about homosexuality in a GQ interview. Well, our new lieutenant governor came to his defense, posting this to his Facebook page:\u201cThis is an exciting time for Christians. God is speaking to us from the most unlikely voice, Phil Robertson, about God's Word. God is using pop culture and a highly successful cable TV show to remind us about His teaching.\u201dYea...we\u2019ll just leave that right there.During his campaign, Patrick made it perfectly clear that he won\u2019t give his Democratic colleagues much of voice. He has said that he won\u2019t appoint Senate Democrats to half the committee chairman positions and it\u2019s also no secret that he opposes the upper chamber\u2019s \u201ctwo-thirds\u201d rule. The procedural rule, which requires that a two-thirds majority of senators agree to take up a bill on the Senate floor, is meant to foster bipartisanship. So of course this dude hates it, and it's part of the reason he landed on Texas Monthly's Worst Legislators list in 2013.There are many more reasons to brace yourselves for this new regime, but these are just a few that come to mind. Before Election Day, the Jezebel blog called Patrick a \u201cwackadoo.\u201d Unfortunately, many of us already knew that.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "Now that it\u2019s official, let\u2019s think about the kind of shit storm we\u2019re in for with Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick at the helm of...", "title": "Brace Yourselves, Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick Now Lead Our State | Blogs | San Antonio Current", "og": {"site_name": "San Antonio Current", "description": "Now that it\u2019s official, let\u2019s think about the kind of shit storm we\u2019re in for with Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick at the helm of...", "title": "Brace Yourselves, Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick Now Lead Our State", "url": "http://www.sacurrent.com/Blogs/archives/2014/11/05/brace-yourselves-greg-abbott-and-dan-patrick-now-lead-our-state", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media2.fdncms.com/sacurrent/imager/not-greg-abbott-and-dan-patrick-but-you-g/u/slideshow/2342083/abbott-patrick.jpg", "height": 352}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media2.fdncms.com/sacurrent/imager/not-greg-abbott-and-dan-patrick-but-you-g/u/slideshow/2342083/abbott-patrick.jpg"}, "title": "Brace Yourselves, Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick Now Lead Our State", "description": "Now that it\u2019s official, let\u2019s think about the kind of shit storm we\u2019re in for with Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick at the helm of...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SAcurrent"}, "oid": 2342045, "p": {"domain_verify": "f35a95b23d40bb6e52604d4d2b9d5a65"}, "fb": {"app_id": 571229849674888}, "keywords": "Texas, Texas Government, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick, Greg Abbott, News, Blog, Culture, Dining, Events", "google-site-verification": "06A5Yh5mu5xlqSkqBOzGlxA6P_yfmltTp1l0ssgpOBk", "thumbnail": "http://media2.fdncms.com/sacurrent/imager/not-greg-abbott-and-dan-patrick-but-you-g/u/slideshow/2342083/abbott-patrick.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "texas, texas government, governor, lieutenant governor, dan patrick, greg abbott, news, blog, culture, dining"}, "article_summary": "Now that it\u2019s official, let\u2019s think about the kind of shit storm we\u2019re in for with Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick at the helm of our state government.\nNot Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick, but you get the idea.\nThanks, bros.We have Dan Patrick to thank for the pre-abortion sonogram law, which requires that women seeking an abortion get an invasive transvaginal ultrasound before they can get the procedure.\nBefore Election Day, the Jezebel blog called Patrick a \u201cwackadoo.\u201d Unfortunately, many of us already knew that.\nIf these sounds familiar, sorry, but they bear repeating.Texas Republicans have been vehemently opposed to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income single adults, and Abbott and Patrick are no exception."}
