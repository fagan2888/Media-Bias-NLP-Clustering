The press covers her, of course, attempting to ask her substantive questions, but mostly she exists to grace the covers of magazines\u2014Fast Company and Elle most recently\u2014and be treated to lighter-than-air puff pieces.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFew object to the cone of deference the press places over the actual children who reside in the White House, or their parents\u2019 attempts to construct a privacy zone around them. Even after White House kids are no longer minors and move on to college, as Chelsea did in 1997, most reporters and editors resist covering them as news in themselves. Unless a White House kid breaks the law, takes measures to make their private profile public, or otherwise becomes \u201cnewsworthy\u201d (is injured in an accident, is stalked, etc.), the press basically turns a blind eye.\n\nBut at some point\u2014early adulthood\u2014the general immunity from critical coverage needs to end. The threshold for newsworthiness recedes, and the children of presidents become more like the siblings, cousins, uncles and parents of presidents. In other words, if one of President Barack Obama\u2019s daughters got busted for drunk driving, few would expect saturation coverage from the press. But, say, had Obama\u2019s Boston aunt gotten arrested for drunk driving before she died in 2014, there would have been no reason for the press to turn a blind eye. Chelsea Clinton should be treated no more royally than the Nixon daughters, Susan Ford, Amy Carter, the Gore children, or the Bush and Reagan progeny.\n\nThe coverage threshold falls lower still if a grown-up White House kid expands her own public profile, as Chelsea Clinton most definitely has. She has maintained a role as adviser and advocate inside the Clinton family\u2019s political dynasty since leaving Stanford University. In late 2011, she crossed over to the dark and often invasive art of journalism, working at NBC News as a special correspondent ($600,000/year) until August 2014. Today, Chelsea serves as vice chair of the politically controversial Clinton Foundation, which has raised $2 billion since 2001. She\u2019s a board member at Barry Diller\u2019s IAC (paid a reported $300,000 a year, plus stock awards). She charges $65,000 per speech. Last fall, she published a book on \u201cempowerment\u201d for kids. She\u2019s powerful. She exercises influence. She\u2019s all grown up, soon to be the mother of two. If she isn\u2019t newsworthy, nobody is.\n\nAs is her right, Chelsea picks and chooses how to respond to the press. Had you lived through the White House sex scandals as she did, you might not have affection for the press, either. For years, when approached by reporters asking questions, she would politely demur. In 2007, while stumping for her mother\u2019s presidential campaign, shaking hands with voters and posting for photos, Chelsea spun her advocacy from the softest cotton\u2014with no message exceeding the \u201cvote for my mom, she\u2019s the best\u201d variety. She worked hard, traveling thousands of highway miles, visiting more than 100 campuses and dialing up to 60 names a day in support of the Clinton campaign.\n\nBut she refused to talk to the press, famously brushing off a fourth-grader from Scholastic News at a campaign event who asked her an innocuous political question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you\u2019re cute.\u201d\n\nAs Vanity Fair reported, in early 2008 the Clinton campaign placed \u201cwarning calls\u201d to David Shuster, then at MSNBC, the day after he asked her a couple of questions (that went unanswered) at a campaign event. Chelsea, age 27, was off-limits, the campaign said.\n\nAs the Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign gathered steam, Chelsea agreed to sit for interviews with the press, but most of them were of the softball variety with Fusion, Ellen DeGeneres and Extra. But whenever the questions turn probing, Chelsea tends to shut down. At a April 2015 Council on Foreign Relations forum in New York, ABC News anchor Juju Chang asked her to respond to the news stories that criticized the Clinton Foundation's fundraising methods. \u201cNot surprisingly, Chelsea punted,\u201d wrote the Daily Beast\u2019s Lloyd Grove about the session. Instead, she discussed all the good work the foundation does. Grove continued, \u201cNeedless to say, I was thwarted in my efforts to ask Chelsea a follow-up question as she left the building after patiently greeting a receiving line of admirers.\u201d\n\nA similar thing happened last fall on the Today show after Savannah Guthrie asked Chelsea how she felt about poll results in which respondents linked Hillary Clinton to the words \u201cdishonest,\u201d \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d Chelsea retreated into the realm of the non-answer. \u201cI\u2019m not a pundit, I\u2019m a daughter,\u201d she said, and spoke instead of how proud she was to have Hillary as her mother.\n\nPerhaps Chelsea avoids serious talks with the press because she\u2019s smart enough to know that words betray her when she speaks extemporaneously, as she did in the middle of January when a young voter asked her how to mobilize young American\u2019s for the Clinton campaign. Chelsea dug a hole, jumped into it, and dug deeper to attack Bernie Sanders as someone who wants to \u201cdismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare and private insurance.\u201d\n\nSuch Democrats as former Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod were appalled by Chelsea\u2019s reckless charge. PolitiFact rated Chelsea\u2019s comment as \u201cMostly False\u201c as it \u201cmakes it sound like Sanders\u2019 plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders\u2019 proposal: universal health care.\u201d\n\nSharp rebukes came almost immediately from With All Due Respect\u2019s John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. Halperin repeatedly pronounced himself \u201cstunned\u201d by the attack. Heilemann called the jab \u201chistoric,\u201d continuing to say that it was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cjust a lie\u201d that Sanders seeks to strip health care from people. The duo relit the fire the following day, as Halperin declared himself perplexed by the \u201clack of interest that most of the news world had to her remarks.\u201d He added, \u201cAs far as we could tell, very few of our media colleagues were as blown away by Chelsea\u2019s rhetoric as we were.\u201d Heilemann responded that the show \u201cgot a lot of blowback\u201d for having ripped Chelsea\u2019s comments the previous day, and attributed the media complacency to the \u201cmuscle memory\u201d acquired by the media over the years that instructs them to instinctively treat White House kids as off-limits no matter how old they are.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that today, what some in the Clinton orbit call the \u2018invisible hand of Chelsea\u2019 shapes almost every significant decision her parents make,\u201d wrote POLITICO\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel last April in a feature story about the political scion. The time for treating her as a fragile kid has long passed. Nor does she occupy some ceremonial function as international goodwill ambassador that places her beyond reproach. She\u2019s an educated (Stanford, Columbia, Oxford), mature, wealthy, campaign surrogate and a well-connected ex-journalist who knows the score. \u201cI had very much led a deliberately private life for a long time, and now I\u2019m attempting to lead a purposely public life,\u201d as she told CNN in 2013.\n\nChelsea Clinton deserves no special treatment from the press, and from what I can tell, she no longer expects it. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful I grew up in a house in which media literacy was a survival skill,\u201d she said upon becoming an NBC News correspondent in 2011. Nobody put it better than Halperin last month when he said, \u201cThe notion of laying off her seems ridiculous. Fair coverage, but not no coverage.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The article has been changed to correct an error in transcription by CNN. Clinton spoke of living a \u201cpurposely public life,\u201d not a \u201cperfectly public life.\u201d\n\n******\n\nThen there was the time in 2008 when my colleague Glenn Thrush asked Chelsea, \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d at a New Hampshire rally. \u201cShe responded with regal contempt: \u2018I don\u2019t talk to the media.\u2019 \"Thrush replied, \u201cBut you are all grown up now,\u201d which marked the end of the exchange. If you\u2019ve been brushed off by the adult Chelsea or been interrogated about fun by Thrush, drop me a line of complaint at Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.
