Katz, 30, is the seascapes program director for Conservation International, based in Arlington, Va., where her job includes leading scuba expeditions across the Asia-Pacific region to help develop marine protection programs.\n\nQ. When did you realize you wanted to make a career out of protecting the ocean and its inhabitants?\n\nA. Around my 12th birthday, my family went on vacation to Australia, and I had my first dive on the Great Barrier Reef. I saw amazing coral and hundreds of fish species and Christmas tree worms; a baby black-tip reef shark followed us the whole dive. I surfaced and proudly announced that I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: to be a dive instructor. I figured there was no way you could see these life-forms and not want to protect the oceans. The day after my 18th birthday, the youngest age allowed, I registered for a dive master training program. Five months later, I was certified as an instructor and taught environmentally focused scuba classes for the next six years.\n\nWhat other education do you have?\n\nI have a master\u2019s degree from Stanford\u2019s Earth Systems Program, which approaches environmental problem-solving in an interdisciplinary manner. My studies and research led me to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Monterey Bay, the Pacific Line Islands and Tanzania, where I spent as much time as I could learning from the ocean and from the people whose lives are connected to it.\n\nWhat was your first assignment with Conservation International?\n\nI was sent to Indonesia for four years to support a team of Indonesians designing large-scale marine conservation programs in the Bird\u2019s Head Seascape in the province of West Papua, which Conservation International had identified as hosting the highest concentration of marine species on earth. I left Indonesia as a serious marine conservationist and a believer in the power of local communities.\n\nWhat exactly do you do now for Conservation International?\n\nI work to amplify the lessons we have learned from our marine field programs and to advance marine conservation. I am still very dedicated to Indonesia, traveling back about four times a year to work with the government on a system to train as many as 2,500 staff members in marine-protected areas. Everything I do focuses on the interconnection between the conservation of nature and human well-being.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140920150254, "twitter": {"description": "The seascapes program director for Conservation International says she has learned much \u201cfrom the ocean and from the people whose lives are connected to it.\u201d", "title": "Underwater Inspiration", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/jobs/underwater-inspiration.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003122759"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/business/21-VOCATIONS/21-VOCATIONS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/jobs/underwater-inspiration.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003122759", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/jobs/underwater-inspiration.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "jobs", "hdl_p": "Underwater Inspiration", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 20, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Conservation International", "keywords": "Careers and Professions,Conservation International,Oceans and Seas,Reefs", "news_keywords": "Reef", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/business/21-VOCATIONS/21-VOCATIONS-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The seascapes program director for Conservation International says she has learned much \u201cfrom the ocean and from the people whose lives are connected to it.\u201d", "tom": "Question", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/business/21-VOCATIONS/21-VOCATIONS-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The seascapes program director for Conservation International says she has learned much \u201cfrom the ocean and from the people whose lives are connected to it.\u201d", "CG": "jobs", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Question", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/jobs/index.html", "section": "Job Market", "modified": "2014-09-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "tag": "Reefs", "published": "2014-09-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "D2CC9565-209C-4B30-8247-030DB7A0228E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "21vocations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140924101435, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/jobs/underwater-inspiration.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/business/21-VOCATIONS/21-VOCATIONS-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The seascapes program director for Conservation International says she has learned much \u201cfrom the ocean and from the people whose lives are connected to it.\u201d", "title": "Underwater Inspiration"}, "pdate": 20140920, "des": "Reefs", "articleid": 100000003122759, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Underwater Inspiration", "col": "Vocations: The Marine Program Leader", "PST": "Question"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1637\"", "article_summary": "I work to amplify the lessons we have learned from our marine field programs and to advance marine conservation.\nAround my 12th birthday, my family went on vacation to Australia, and I had my first dive on the Great Barrier Reef.\nThe day after my 18th birthday, the youngest age allowed, I registered for a dive master training program.\nWhen did you realize you wanted to make a career out of protecting the ocean and its inhabitants?\nI saw amazing coral and hundreds of fish species and Christmas tree worms; a baby black-tip reef shark followed us the whole dive."}
