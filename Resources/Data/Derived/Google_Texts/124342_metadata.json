Curran says her sons\u2019 life-saving compounded medications will be dropped from coverage altogether as of Monday, though her family\u2019s medications and treatments were covered with no denials for years prior to 2011.\n\nA Mito Mother's Plight \u2013 \"we need people to stand up and push back against a government that is overreaching\"\u2026. http://t.co/jWeF17I7Wx \u2014 Birgit Jones (@DesignsbyBirgit) September 10, 2014\n\nFriends of Curran have recently set up a website to collect donations, although Revels says that \u201cPattie has continuously stated that this is a long-term problem and the best way to help her is to \u2018stand up against the tyranny that is Obamacare. Get involved, contact your legislators and stand up with us.'\u201d\n\n@PattieCurran says best way to help = fight #obamacare. Her friends set up a site to help her family in the meantime: http://t.co/rOwCeH7p8v \u2014 Nicole Revels (@RevelsNicole) September 12, 2014\n\n@PattieCurran I watched your video on youtube and I sympathise with your situation. @4FatherBeliefs @BlindManMark \u2014 Secular Hero (@secular_hero) September 14, 2014\n\n@PattieCurran Hi Pattie, Watched YouTube.
