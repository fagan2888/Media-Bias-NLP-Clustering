But actually, it could be about the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, Global Volunteers, United Planet or any cause that draws someone who\u2019s all starry-eyed about changing the world.\n\nWhen \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d touring company opens the play at the Denver Performing Arts Complex for the second time on Oct. 22 for a month-long run, some audiences will see it as a statement on Mormonism. Others might see something different. \u201cI know people who just think it\u2019s funny, and I know atheists who think it\u2019s written by atheists, and people of faith who think it\u2019s written by people of faith,\u201d said Robert Lopez, who wrote \u201d The Book of Mormon\u201d with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.\n\nPeople tend to see what they want to see. Yes, \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d is profane, freely using most of the seven words that famously formed a routine for the late George Carlin.\n\nAnd it does makes fun of Mormons, but it doesn\u2019t take much for the humor to apply to other religions as well. Isn\u2019t the story of an angel disclosing the location of sacred golden plates just as plausible as the story of a virgin impregnated by a spirit?\n\nReally, \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d may be less at the expense of the Church of Latter Day Saints than as it is about youthful idealism, and what happens when guileless dreamers bump into rocky reality.\n\n\u201cA chance to go out and help heal the world\u201d is how Elder Price describes the two-year mission served by the Church of Latter Day Saints\u2019 faithful young members.\n\nHe is so lovably sincere.\n\nAnd so sweetly naive.\n\nAnd so adorably shocked \u2014 \u201cYou really should not be saying that,\u201d Elder Price says primly \u2014 when villagers rail against God for an appalling list of local troubles including famine, genital mutilation, AIDS, rape.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like what we say, try living here a couple days,\u201d the villagers sing.\n\nSo the innocent visiting elders do just that, and their presence galvanizes everyone \u2014 the Mormons, the villagers and the warlord\u2019s gang. In the end, \u201cwe are still Latter Day Saints, all of us, even if we\u2019ve change some things, or break the rules\u201d Elder Price says.\n\nThat sentence describes the evolution of every religion ever. And if you don\u2019t believe it, look up how the words of Pope Francis jibe with his predecessors\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis gave us an opportunity to talk about religion \u2014 how they come about, how they change, what they mean, and how they work,\u201d Lopez said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stories are true or not \u2014 that\u2019s not the point. The point is that there\u2019s an emotional truth that teaches us how to lead our lives.\u201d\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\n\u201cTHE BOOK OF MORMON\u201d Musical comedy.
