Andre has sued her insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross because it has denied her a medication that would cure her of hepatitis C. Beverly Hillls, CA 5/21/2015 (Photo by John McCoy Daily News)\n\nFacts about hepatitis C What is Hep C? Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. It is spread from person to person through an exchange of blood. How many people have it? About 3.2 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C infection. It is most prevalent among those born between 1945 and 1965 or the baby boom generation, with a majority of them likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What are the medical options? There is no vaccine, but there are two drugs that were approved in the past few years by the Food and Drug Administration that have a high cure rate. They are Sovaldi and Harvoni. Both drugs have fewer side effects than their predecessors. What\u2019s the issue? Cost. A 12-week prescription of Harvoni can cost more than $90,000. Insurance companies are denying patients\u2019 claims for the drug. What\u2019s the solution? Health advocates say it\u2019s cheaper to help cure someone with hepatitis C than it is to let that person become sicker and face hospital visits and possibly a liver transplant. \u2014 Susan Abram\n\nThe virus could win.\n\nIt wants to do to Shima Andre what it already has done to so many thousands of people worldwide: Drain her of energy. Change the color of her skin. Make her panic when she feels a pain on her right side.\n\nBut the 42-year-old West Hollywood woman with hepatitis C said there\u2019s a sure-fire weapon on the market that could help her fight and kill the virus.\n\nA drug called Harvoni is one of precious few prescription medications that can actually cure a virus. It\u2019s been touted as a miracle drug. But her health insurer says she\u2019s not sick enough and therefore the drug is not medically necessary. That\u2019s why they won\u2019t cover it.\n\nAndre, who was diagnosed four years ago, is at an early stage of hepatitis C. She gets her viral load checked every six months. She endures ultrasounds on her liver. So far, the tumor that was discovered is benign, but the whites of her eyes are starting to change color. She wonders how much time she has.\n\nShe has filed a lawsuit against Anthem Blue Cross for denying Harvoni and for saying in a letter dated October of last year that until she has reached Stage 3 of severity, she can\u2019t have the pills. That means that by the time Blue Cross approves the lifesaving drug for her, she will be too exhausted to work as a book editor, her liver will develop scar tissue and cirrhosis, and she may have to consider an organ transplant.\n\n\u201cI was shocked, devastated and outraged,\u201d Andre said. \u201cI thought it was a mistake.\u201d\n\nDenial letters for specialty drugs such as for those with diabetes, multiple sclerosis and HIV are becoming more common. The reason, say Andre\u2019s attorneys and others: the cost. Harvoni\u2019s price tag exceeds $90,000 for a 12-week prescription.\n\nAndre\u2019s attorneys say in the lawsuit that Blue Cross is obligated to help her obtain the drug and is violating state standards by ignoring her physician\u2019s recommendations.\n\nFor Andre and many insured Americans with hepatitis C, Harvoni is the only way for her to fight the virus, not only for its high cure rate, but also because it has very few side effects. Harvoni, made by San Dimas-based Gilead Sciences, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and cures up to 99 percent of patients within 12 weeks.\n\nAnother drug, Sovaldi, was approved in late 2013 and is also billed as a cure, although it is not suited to all patients. It too is made by Gilead. There are no generic versions.\n\nDozens of denials\n\nIn the short time since the drugs have become available, physicians and their patients in California have already come up against dozens of denials.\n\nIn a little more than a year, there have been 135 independent medical review requests for both drugs to California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care, which regulates health plans. The requests seek appeals to decisions made by insurance plans and even HMOs. Of 135 reviews, the state overturned a health insurer\u2019s denial 95 times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cImagine a health care company telling their patients with hepatitis C that they\u2019re not sick enough yet to get a known cure,\u201d said one of Andre\u2019s attorneys, Ricardo Echeverria. \u201cBlue Cross is simply putting profits over patients.\u201d\n\nAndre filed the lawsuit against Blue Cross in May, accusing them of withholding a cure for hepatitis C based on profits.\n\nA spokesman with Anthem Blue Cross said the company could not comment on a pending lawsuit.\n\nBut Echeverria said his law firm has at least 10 more cases they\u2019re looking at. And a lawsuit similar to Andre\u2019s was filed recently on behalf of a man who has had hepatitis C for nearly 40 years. Blue Shield, his health plan, denied his physician\u2019s prescription for Harvoni on the same basis: medical necessity.\n\nHe also said it would be less expensive to treat Andre than to wait until she is sicker. A study cited by the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that from 2007 to 2009, 19,907 patients were hospitalized in Los Angeles County due to hepatitis C. Their care cost $58 million, with more than 70 percent charged to government sources.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s unclear how many reviews have been requested among some Medi-Cal managed-care recipients because those figures are not yet available, a spokesman with the Department of Health Care Service said. But among those who are on the Medi-Cal fee-for-service system, the department has received 1,489 treatment authorization requests from pharmacists since June 2014 for Harvoni and Sovaldi. Those requests are on behalf of 749 beneficiaries. Of these requests, 959 were denied by the state. A total of 71 appeals have been received; 12 of them were overturned and approved on appeal, while 53 were upheld and denied, and six are pending review.\n\nThe state\u2019s hepatitis C treatment policy, released on July 1, 2014, \u201cauthorizes treatment for patients with documented Stage 3 or 4 (advanced hepatitis C), or treatment regardless of stage if the patient has appearances of hepatitis C outside the liver or has had a liver transplant,\u201d among other criteria.\n\nIn January, Sovaldi and Harvoni were added to the Medi-Cal Contract Drug List.\n\n\u201cThey are the preferred products to be considered when medically necessary for the treatment of a beneficiary who is infected with hepatitis C,\u201d according to a response by the Department of Health Care Services.\n\n\u2018Witnessing a war\u2019\n\nWhile insurance denials for treatment for hepatitis C are receiving most of the current spotlight, physicians\u2019 prescriptions for specialty drugs, even generic ones, are being denied more often, said Dr. Samuel Fink, a Tarzana-based internist who also is past president of the Los Angeles County Medical Association.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 we\u2019re witnessing a war among physicians and insurance companies,\u201d Fink said. \u201cI\u2019ve had more denials this year than any year before. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Affordable Care Act related. The insurers are trying to control the care and treatment of patients.\u201d\n\nThough he hasn\u2019t had to prescribe Harvoni, he said insurance companies are waiting out a patient\u2019s illness, perhaps even until they sign on to another insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just kicking the can down the road,\u201d Fink said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disheartening and discouraging, knowing that you can\u2019t help your patient.\u201d\n\nHepatitis C is a bloodborne infection that causes liver disease. It\u2019s was discovered in 1990 and is usually spread person to person through needles and blood transfusions, among other ways. About 3.2 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C infection. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an unrecognized health crisis. It is most prevalent among those born between 1945 and 1965, or the baby boomer generation, with a majority of them likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest, according to the CDC.\n\nBut most people don\u2019t seek a cure because they don\u2019t know they\u2019re infected. That\u2019s because most people with hepatitis C are asymptomatic but still may have chronic liver disease. It\u2019s most commonly found when someone tries to donate blood.\n\nThe CDC recently urged all baby boomers be tested.\n\nBecause health plans have placed specialty drugs on different price tiers, those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, HIV and even multiple sclerosis have had to pull out their own credit cards to pay hefty prices. That sparked a decision last month by Covered California to help reduce the monthly out-of-pocket costs for enrollees by spreading out the costs so that they don\u2019t have to pay it all at once.\n\nThose who purchased plans through the exchange will see their costs capped at an average of $250 per month per prescription. Overall, the caps will range from $150 to $500. The caps will begin later this year, but the move will be reviewed in 2016 to see if it has helped.\n\nIn addition, a proposed state bill, AB 339, mirrors Covered California\u2019s change but would place limits on how much health plans can charge enrollees for outpatient prescriptions permanently. It would set a monthly cap of as little as $124.\n\nAs for Andre, she and her husband, Ted, would like to have a child, but she fears spreading the virus to her baby. Had she been given Harvoni last year when her physicians from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center prescribed it and even appealed for her, she would already be cured.\n\nShe said she has pursued a lawsuit to bring attention to what insurance plans are doing, but also because she is running out of time.\n\n\u201cThis is a miracle drug,\u201d Andre said. \u201cThere are thousands of folks going through this.\u201d\n\nFacts about hepatitis C\n\nWhat is Hep C?\n\nHepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus.
