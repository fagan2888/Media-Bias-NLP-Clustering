But whistleblowing comes at a high risk, and employees who do come forward often become victims of retaliation. So the government is working on extending protections to prevent that.\n\nThe Defense Department, for example, broadened its whistleblower policies last year to expand the same protections to sub-contractors. Under the new rule, sub-contractors can report government waste, fraud or abuse without fear of reprisal by federal employees.\n\nSimilarly, reform advocates are trying to extend whistleblower protections to contractors and patients at the Veterans Affairs Department, after the scandal involving hidden wait times and cover-ups at agency hospitals surfaced last year.\n\nRelated: Riches or Retaliation Await Whistleblowers\n\nBut federal watchdogs say the agency most in need of reform in this area is the Justice Department, where even its own employees aren\u2019t covered by any real or effective whistleblower protections.\n\nRight now, the DOJ rejects nearly 90 percent of complaints by FBI employees who fear retaliation for coming forward with information about misconduct within their department, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, 55 of the 62 complaints reviewed by the GAO were rejected.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and Department of Justice, in particular, have a vested interest in investigating wrongdoing, yet when an FBI employee uncovers misconduct within the agency\u2019s own ranks, it\u2019s not so easy to sound the alarm without the risk of retaliation,\u201d said Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), who requested the report.\n\nOne problem at Justice, say auditors, is that the department\u2019s policies only protect employees from retaliation if they go to a specific group of top officials within the agency. If they go to the wrong people \u2013 which is what happened in at least 17 of 62 cases \u2013 they completely forfeit any protections.\n\nRelated: $104 Million IRS Whistleblower Payout: A Bargain?\n\nEven if they do go to the right people, it could take years to resolve the problem. In one example, GAO said it took Justice literally 10 years to rule on a case in which a former FBI agent claimed retaliation after she told superiors her colleagues had stolen things from Ground Zero after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\u201cUnlike employees of other executive branch agencies, FBI employees do not have a process to seek corrective action if they experience retaliation based on a disclosure of wrongdoing to their supervisors or others in their chain of command who are not designated officials,\u201d auditors said in their report.\n\nThe GAO recommended that Justice develop new guidelines that instruct employees about where they can direct their complaints and how long it will take them to get a decision.\n\nIn the Justice Department\u2019s response, it said it wouldn\u2019t exclude FBI whistleblower protections to employees complaining to the wrong people.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Justice Department has a rather embarrassing track record when it comes to how it", "title": "GAO Outs Justice for Not Protecting Whistleblowers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/GAO-Outs-Justice-Not-Protecting-Whistleblowers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0611_whistleblower_630x420.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/GAO-Outs-Justice-Not-Protecting-Whistleblowers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0611_whistleblower_630x420.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Justice Department has a rather embarrassing track record when it comes to how it", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the Justice Department\u2019s response, it said it wouldn\u2019t exclude FBI whistleblower protections to employees complaining to the wrong people.\nThe Justice Department has a rather embarrassing track record when it comes to how it treats whistleblowers who shine a light on wrongdoing within its agencies.\nUnder the new rule, sub-contractors can report government waste, fraud or abuse without fear of reprisal by federal employees.\nThe GAO recommended that Justice develop new guidelines that instruct employees about where they can direct their complaints and how long it will take them to get a decision.\nBut whistleblowing comes at a high risk, and employees who do come forward often become victims of retaliation."}
