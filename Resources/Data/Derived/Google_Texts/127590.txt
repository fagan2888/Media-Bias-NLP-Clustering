Atty. Pagan stated that state arguments are fact-based and is not worthy of the attention of the Supreme Court, as reported by Cincinnati's WLWT. He further added that they are expecting the court's ruling in February.

Baxton has served 11 years of prison time for a 15 to 50 years sentence for complicity of the murder of his wife in 1995 as well as complicity to aggravated burglary. According to a report by WHIO, if the higher court decide to reject the appeal, six months will be given to Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell on whether to give Barton a re-trial or have him released.

The Cincinnati Federal Appeals court previously ruled in favor of Barton stating that the authorities improperly withheld evidences that could have helped him in his case. 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reportedly ruled that the case relied heavily on a witness with shifting, and unsupported details on the story.

Barton was convicted in 2005 for being the alleged master mind in staging a burglary in their rural house in hopes to scare his wife to get her to move into the city, however, the scenario eventually caused the death of his wife. Such effort is reportedly to increase his chances into becoming the Springboro Police Chief.
