The conservative group behind "Creepy Uncle Sam" is bringing the anti-Obamacare mascot to Washington--with a circus.

Creepy Uncle Sam is back, and he's coming to the National Mall with a few friends.

The conservative group Generation Opportunity, which has financial ties to conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, is planning to bring a circus to the nation's capital in its latest attempt to convince young American to opt out of the Affordable Care Act.

The "Creepy Care-nival," announced in a YouTube video released this week, will be "an interactive event that puts the failures of the 'Affordable Care Act' (also known as Obamacare) on full display," according to its website.

"The 'Creepy Care-nival,' like Obamacare itself, comes with a veneer of excitement, but as soon as you begin to experience it, you realize you are being taken for a ride," the site states.

The video features clowns, fire-eaters and strong-men, along with a "dropped coverage" dunk tank and an "exploding premiums" strength test. Creepy Uncle Sam, who appeared in the group's first ad surprising a woman at her gynecologist's office, is introduced in the video as the master of ceremonies.

The Virginia-based Generation Opportunity hosted tailgate parties on 20 college campuses in 2013 to encourage young people not to enroll in Obamacare. The group also has television and Internet ads running against Democrats in states with tight Senate races.

Obamacare opponents and the administration have fought to attract the attention of young, healthy Americans whose participation in exchanges helps offset the costs of sicker participants; one notable effort was President Barack Obama's deadpan interview with comedian Zach Galifianakis on the comedian's "Between Two Ferns" web series-which was just nominated for an Emmy.
