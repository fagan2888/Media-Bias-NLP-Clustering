Micah Escamilla \u2014 Correspondent\n\nSAN BERNARDINO >> Health insurance agents were available Saturday at Community Hospital of San Bernardino to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act and assist people with selecting coverage plans available to them under the new law.\n\nRoughly two dozen people attended Saturday\u2019s information seminar, one of two hosted last week by Community Hospital and St. Bernardine Medical Center. St. Bernardine held its seminar from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we\u2019re here is to provide information to the community on all the health and insurance changes going on right now under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said George Balteria, CEO of Quote Selection Insurance Services, a Corona-based insurance brokerage firm with brokers certified by Covered California, the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange.\n\nImplemented under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, Covered California is where individuals and businesses can shop for health coverage plans named after precious metals: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\n\nBalteria conducted a PowerPoint presentation on the health care plans available to individuals of various family sizes and income brackets.\n\nInsurance brokers sat at tables going over 35-page applications with visitors and discussing their options.\n\n\u201cWe just lost our coverage, so I\u2019m here seeing what the options are,\u201d said Nicole, a San Bernardino resident who attended Saturday\u2019s seminar but declined to give her last name.\n\nShe said her employer, a nonprofit ministry and school, took a major hit due to the soured economy and could no longer afford to provide its employees with health insurance.\n\nBalteria said he\u2019ll be hosting other seminars throughout Southern California through March.\n\nThe deadline to sign up for coverage under the ACA is March 31. Those who are not signed up by then face fines, Balteria said.\n\nFor more information, call: 888-247-7696", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN BERNARDINO >> Health insurance agents were available Saturday at Community Hospital of San Bernardino to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act and assist people with selecting coverage plans available to them under the new law.", "title": "San Bernardino hospital hosts Affordable Care Act information seminar", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/government-and-politics/20131109/san-bernardino-hospital-hosts-affordable-care-act-information-seminar", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20131109/NEWS/131109374/AR/0/AR-131109374.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "976px"}, "type": "article", "title": "San Bernardino hospital hosts Affordable Care Act information seminar"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "SAN BERNARDINO >> Health insurance agents were available Saturday at Community Hospital of San Bernardino to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act and assist people with selecting coverage plans available to them under the new law.", "title": "San Bernardino hospital hosts Affordable Care Act information seminar", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/government-and-politics/20131109/san-bernardino-hospital-hosts-affordable-care-act-information-seminar", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20131109/NEWS/131109374/AR/0/AR-131109374.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, San Bernardino Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, San Bernardino Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2770\"", "article_summary": "George Balteria, CEO of Quote Selection Insurance Services, speaks during an informational seminar about the Affordable Care Act and health insurance coverage on Saturday at Community Hospital of San Bernardino.\nMicah Escamilla \u2014 CorrespondentSAN BERNARDINO >> Health insurance agents were available Saturday at Community Hospital of San Bernardino to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act and assist people with selecting coverage plans available to them under the new law.\nBalteria conducted a PowerPoint presentation on the health care plans available to individuals of various family sizes and income brackets.\nImplemented under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, Covered California is where individuals and businesses can shop for health coverage plans named after precious metals: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\nRoughly two dozen people attended Saturday\u2019s information seminar, one of two hosted last week by Community Hospital and St. Bernardine Medical Center."}
