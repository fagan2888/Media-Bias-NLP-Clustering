THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS EXTENDING THE DEADLINE TO

SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE.

MONDAY WAS THE DEADLINE TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE FOR

NEXT YEAR.

NOW, THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE

TIME TO FINISH, IF THEY START THE APPLICATION PROCESS

ON THAT DAY.

BUT, THE EXTENSION DOES NOT APPLY TO PEOPLE LIVING

IN WASHINGTON

KXLY 4'S CAITI CURREY IS WORKING FOR YOU WITH WHY

YOU SHOULD ACT FAST IF YOU WANT TO BE COVERED.

NADINE, WASHINGTON STATE HAS AN INDEPENDENT EXCHANGE.

SO AS OF NOW THE ENROLLMENT DEADLINE IS STILL MARCH

31ST.

AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS PEOPLE CAN STILL GET HELP

IF THEY NEED IT.

Sue Frasier

I have been without health insurance as of May it

will be five years.

AS OF TODAY, SUE FRASIER WILL NOT HAVE TO GO ANOTHER

YEAR WITHOUT IT, BECAUSE SHE JUST FOUND OUT.

I'm elligible for free health insurance so, yay!

FRASIER IS ONE OF 31 THOUSAND PEOPLE.

AND COUNTING.

IN THE SPOKANE AREA WHO WILL NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE

THANKS TO THE WASHINGTON HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE.

It's definitely a benefit to know that if I do need

to go to a doctor I can afford to go.

BUT TIME IS TICKING TO ENROLL.

AND UNLIKE THE FEDERAL HEALTH EXCHANGE.

WASHINGTON'S DEADLINE IS STILL MARCH 31ST.

Bethany Osgood

Washington state did our own state exchange, even

though we are connected through the federal hub, our

exchange works off of our own power and does our own

thing separate from the federal exchange.

BETHANY OSGOOD WORKS FOR UNITED HELATHCARE SHE SAYS

IN RECENT WEEKS THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AS A WHOLE

HAS SEEN A HUGE JUMP IN ENROLLMENT.

ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE.

LAST WEEK WASHINGTON HIT FOUR TIMES THE AVERAGE WEEKLY

ENROLLMENT.

WITH OVER 12,000 NEW ENROLLEES.

Bethany

I'm really excited about the surge that's coming in

because people are having that ah-ha moment of, you

know this will really benefit me, I can live a happier

healthier life.

THERE ARE STILL MANY WAYS TO GET ASSISTANCE TO SIGN

UP.

MANY PEOPLE LIKE FRASIER.

BELIEVE THE MOST HELPFUL IS WITH AN IN-PERSON ASSISTANT.

It's extremely helpful to actually be able to sit

down with somebody and tell them my circumstance and

have them work with me on the numbers.

CHAS IS HOSTING AN OPEN ENROLLMENT EVENT THIS SATURDAY

FROM 10 TO 2 AT THEIR MAPLE STREET CLINIC.

WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO GET IN PERSON ASSISTANCE.
