This provision would end the 1975 ban on the export of American oil. Domestic energy production is booming in the United States, and lifting the ban will help create jobs, grow our\n\neconomy, and promote greater exploration of our natural resources.\n\n2.\n\nIncreases resources for our military.\n\nThe arbitrary spending cuts in the sequester have depleted the resources our armed forces need to carry out their mission. This bill restores funding for our military to ensure our troops can confront today\u2019s challenges and defeat ISIL.\n\n3.\n\nStrengthens the Visa Waiver Program to protect the homeland.\n\nThe Visa Waiver Program presents one of the most urgent threats to our homeland from radical Islamic terrorism. This agreement includes the House-passed bill to tighten the security requirements under the program. It would also deny visa waiver status to any individual who has traveled to certain terrorist hotspots, including Syria and Iraq, in the last five years.\n\n4.\n\nProhibits new funding for\n\nObamacare\n\n.\n\nThe bill contains no new funding for Obamacare and continues to prevent a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program.\n\n5.\n\nPrevents the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to American soil.\n\nThe bill prohibits funds from being used to transfer terrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States, and prohibits the construction or acquisition of a facility in the U.S. to house detainees.\n\n6.\n\nBlocks EPA overreach.\n\nThe bill contains no funding for new or expanded EPA programs, holding the agency to its lowest funding levels since 2008 and its lowest staffing levels since 1989.\n\n7.\n\nReins in the IRS.\n\nThe IRS continues to act with impunity against the interests of hardworking taxpayers. This bill freezes most IRS operations and maintains budget cuts necessary to ensure this agency roots out wasteful spending and redirects resources to serving the American people. In addition, the tax extenders package also includes a measure to prohibit the IRS from unfairly imposing the gift tax on contributions to non-profit groups, which have historically been exempt, to encourage donations to these important organizations.\n\n8.\n\nMaintains strong protections for life.\n\nThe bill maintains important pro-life provisions, including the Hyde Amendment, and prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion. It also includes a ban on FDA approval for genetically modifying human embryos and cuts funding for a program involved in abortion-related activities, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), by 7 percent.\n\n9.\n\nHonors our commitment to our veterans.\n\nThe bill ensures our veterans receive their much-deserved health benefits, speeds up VA claims processing, prioritizes modernizing the VA\u2019s electronic health care record system, and tightens oversight of construction projects.\n\n10.\n\nProvides critical health care benefits for 9/11 first responders.\n\nMore than 30,000 first responders continue to suffer from injuries or illnesses sustained during the 9/11 attacks. The bill contains a bipartisan measure to permanently reauthorize critical health care benefits for these brave men and women\u2014and it does so in a fiscally responsible way.\n\n11. Repeals harmful labeling requirements on American meat.\n\nThe bill repeals mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements, ensuring that our economy does not suffer more than $1 billion in trade penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaker Ryan Press Office", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker of the House Says Omnibus Bill Advances Republican Priorities - Plus Full Text of Bill", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "rights": "All Rights Reserved Goldrushcam/Sierra Sun Times", "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": "Speaker of the House Says Omnibus Bill Advances Republican Priorities - Plus Full Text of Bill", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Visa Waiver Program presents one of the most urgent threats to our homeland from radical Islamic terrorism.\nDecember 16, 2015 - Speaker Paul Ryan says this omnibus bill represents a bipartisan compromise that includes a significant number of wins for Republican priorities.\nStrengthens the Visa Waiver Program to protect the homeland.\nIt would also deny visa waiver status to any individual who has traveled to certain terrorist hotspots, including Syria and Iraq, in the last five years.\nThis bill restores funding for our military to ensure our troops can confront today\u2019s challenges and defeat ISIL."}
