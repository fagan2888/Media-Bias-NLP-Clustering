State legislator Brad Ashford is challenging Terry for the job. As part of our Campaign Connection 2014 coverage, NET News examines where the candidates stand on the issues shaping this race.\n\nWatch video of the candidates below\n\nThis is a sample caption Font Color\n\nFont Opacity\n\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100% Background Color\n\nBackground Opacity\n\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100% Window Color\n\nWindow Opacity\n\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100%\n\nIn a non-descript office at the Nebraska Crossing Outlet Mall in Gretna, just outside of Omaha, Republican Congressman Lee Terry sat down with the mall\u2019s corporate executives.\n\nThey talked about the mall\u2019s marketing plans, and how to improve the local economy.\n\nTerry said it\u2019s an important conversation to have. As chairman of the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade sub-committee for the U.S. House of Representatives, Terry said he\u2019s seen the country\u2019s economy take a deep dive, especially the manufacturing industry.\n\n\u201cThose great middle-class jobs that have gone away over the last generation, or last decade or more, we can get those back,\u201d Terry said, \u201cbut first we have to realize that energy is an issue. We want our energy to be reliable and affordable. That\u2019s bringing back jobs right now. Our tax code is actually chasing jobs away right now.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest single factor keeping people out of the workplace, according to Terry, is a skills gap.\n\n\"Many of our manufacturers that want to pay fifty, sixty, seventy-thousand dollars a year for an employee can\u2019t find the person with the right skills,\" Terry said. \"So we really have to look at our education system. Do our high school graduates have the necessary skills if they don\u2019t want to go to college to go into manufacturing and earn a nice middle-class wage?\u201d\n\nTerry\u2019s opponent in the upcoming election, longtime Nebraska legislator Brad Ashford, a Democrat, said first we need to make sure everyone is paid a livable wage.\n\nWhile shaking hands at Septemberfest in Omaha, Ashford said he agrees jobs are the biggest issue in this campaign, but he added you can\u2019t talk about good jobs without talking about raising the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start to bring people together on the wage scale and we have to start with the minimum wage because when we\u2019re trying to lift people out of poverty, that $7.25 isn\u2019t going to cut it,\" Ashford said. \"They\u2019re going to keep going back into poverty and back into social programs. We want to get people out of those programs and we want to get them working.\u201d\n\nAshford has served in the Nebraska Legislature two different times for a total of 16 years. Term limits are forcing him to find a new job, but he said he\u2019s not ready to call his political career over. He said after watching last year\u2019s government shutdown, he knew his next destination.\n\n\u201cI think Congress is totally dysfunctional. Shutting the government down for 16 days which caused a furlough of federal employees and cost billions of dollars to the economy, that can\u2019t happen. If you\u2019re elected as a public servant, you can\u2019t go on strike,\u201d Ashford said.\n\nWhen it comes to the Affordable Care Act, both Terry and Ashford agreed the law is unworkable in its current state. Terry said while he\u2019s seen some people benefit from Obamacare, too many people are paying too much.\n\n\u201cWe even tried making subtle changes and (U.S. Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid will not let those go through and I think that\u2019s an election year ploy. So maybe next year there will be a change in the Senate where the House and the Senate can work together,\u201d Terry explained.\n\nAshford proposed breaking the law down into separate pieces.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the cost issue, the insurance coverage issue, whether it\u2019s Medicare\u2014the bill is so big that the best way to make it work for all Americans is to break it down. We\u2019ve had four years to do that, and Republicans won\u2019t do it,\u201d Ashford said.\n\nOn immigration, Terry said the U.S. needs to secure its borders first before any reform can be discussed, saying the crisis at the Mexican border proves how unsecure the nation really is.\n\nAshford called the current U.S. immigration policy \u201canti-child\u201d and said the House should pass the Senate\u2019s immigration reform bill, which he said would beef up border security and provide a parallel pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants.\n\nOn foreign affairs, Terry said the administration\u2019s policies have isolated our foreign allies, and created a power void.\n\n\u201cI think we have an obligation to fill that void,\" Terry said. \"It doesn\u2019t mean we go into countries with our military, but because we\u2019ve backed off and now there\u2019s a leadership void, you see it being filled by Putin right now.\u201d\n\nTerry said tougher economic sanctions should be levied against Putin, and the U.S. needs to be tougher globally. Something Ashford seemed to agree with.\n\n\u201cThis is where I have issues with President Obama. I really feel he lacks decisiveness with dealing with Israel. He lacks decisiveness in dealing with the problems with ISIS. I think we need to build a coalition, and in some ways this coalition is going to bring people together that generally aren\u2019t in the same group,\u201d Ashford said, \u201cThat takes decisive leadership and I think the president needs to buck up on this. He\u2019s not leading right now and that\u2019s not helping.\u201d\n\nBoth Lee Terry and Brad Ashford touted their long careers of working with people across the aisle to get things done. Terry said he\u2019s currently working with Democrats on two bills\u2014one about data security, the other about patents. If re-elected, Terry said he\u2019ll talk more about those next year.\n\nAshford said if he\u2019s elected, he\u2019ll find 25 friends from both sides of the aisle on his first day in office and form a coalition, what he\u2019s calling his unicameral promise, to show people from both sides of the political spectrum can work together.\n\nIn November, the voters will decide which man gets the chance to keep his word.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://netnebraska.org//sites/all/modules/custom/netvideo/images/net_logo_black.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, both Terry and Ashford agreed the law is unworkable in its current state.\nThat\u2019s bringing back jobs right now.\nCongressman Lee Terry has been in office for 16 years, representing Nebraska\u2019s second district.\nTerry said he\u2019s currently working with Democrats on two bills\u2014one about data security, the other about patents.\nState legislator Brad Ashford is challenging Terry for the job."}
