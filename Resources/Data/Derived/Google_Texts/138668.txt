One person was killed Sunday afternoon in a single vehicle crash on the Sam Rayburn Tollway, a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman said.

DPS spokesman Lonny Haschel said around 6 p.m. troopers were called to the Sam Rayburn Tollway at the Denton Tap Overpass where they found one person dead. That person was not identified.

Haschel said a Chevrolet Camaro was traveling northbound on the tollway in the left lane when it left the roadway, crossed onto the median and dropped down on the Denton Tap Road.

The car then continued north, crossed all eight lanes of the Denton Tap Road and crashed into a retaining wall, erupting in flames.

It was not clear what caused the vehicle to veer off the roadway.

Haschel said the northbound lanes of Denton Tap Road was closed following the accident.

The investigation remained open.
