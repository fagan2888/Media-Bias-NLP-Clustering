(Photo: AP file photo)\n\nA Southern Indiana county is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases, but officials say it's too soon to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program.\n\nFloyd County officials say they've seen a noticeable rise in hepatitis C cases tied to use of heroin and other drugs. County health officer Dr. Tom Harris told the Jeffersonville News and Tribune that the drug is inexpensive and easy to obtain in the area.\n\nSheriff Frank Loop says the county needs a drug addiction center. But recent budget cuts are raising questions about whether the county has the funding to deal with its drug issues.\n\nOfficials say the outbreak is troubling but hasn't yet risen to the level needed to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program under a new Indiana law.\n\nIn May, state health officials extended for another year a temporary needle-exchange program in Scott County meant to curb the spread of an epidemic where at least 160 people have been confirmed to have HIV.\n\nA new law passed this year allows counties to ask the state health department for permission to operate a needle exchange program if they fear they are at risk of an HIV or hepatitis C outbreak. Counties must pay for the programs themselves.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1MfY904", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Floyd County in Southern Indiana is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Floyd County in Southern Indiana is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases", "title": "Rise in Hep C sparks concern in Floyd County", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/floyd/2015/06/07/hepatitis-c-concern-floyd-county/28643779/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Floyd County in Southern Indiana is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases", "title": "Rise in hepatitis C cases sparks concern in Floyd County", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/HIV", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/HIV", "title": "Rise in Hep C sparks concern in Floyd County", "author": "Associated Press", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana/floyd", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e972509815038099be0de9d968053e0017d60c8/c=116-0-417-401/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46d729d8f3d768b717d4a020d4552b4eef49b4a8/c=66-0-467-401/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d8d36144bd2e13bc60f90ebcfb1ac87a90627f9/c=0-0-534-400/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f880bad1e08da3dac20a53ff02ab53c3f837f2d0/c=0-50-534-350&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-07T22:41:39.217000-04:00", "shorthed": "Hep C spike a concern in Floyd County", "articleid": 28643779, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eec6fd4cafba6c9b20fad3b0475b2dc4dc63a0e1/c=0-50-534-350/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70f689c316271227bf89628d0e373ea257e6d4c8/c=154-0-380-401/local/-/media/2015/06/06/Indianapolis/B9317634567Z.1_20150606160204_000_GFRB0JLDV.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "hepatitis c, floyd county indiana, hepatitis indiana, indiana hepatitis c cases, floyd county hepatitis cases"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36d1\"", "article_summary": "Floyd County officials say they've seen a noticeable rise in hepatitis C cases tied to use of heroin and other drugs.\n(Photo: AP file photo)A Southern Indiana county is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases, but officials say it's too soon to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program.\nOfficials say the outbreak is troubling but hasn't yet risen to the level needed to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program under a new Indiana law.\nBut recent budget cuts are raising questions about whether the county has the funding to deal with its drug issues.\nCounty health officer Dr. Tom Harris told the Jeffersonville News and Tribune that the drug is inexpensive and easy to obtain in the area."}
