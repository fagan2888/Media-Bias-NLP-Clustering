Further, Standard & Poor\u2019s upgraded the Nashville, Tenn.-based company\u2019s corporate credit rating on Jan. 13 by two notches, to \u201cBB\u201d from \u201cB+\u201d, and its senior secured debt to \u201cBBB-\u201d from \u201cBB\u201d.\n\nS&P also put HCA on its vaunted S&P 500 stock index, replacing grocery retailer Safeway Inc., which has been taken private.\n\nHCA is expected to offer insight into how it expects 2015 to go, and analysts appear optimistic that the Affordable Care Act \u2014 as well as a promising environment for hospitals \u2014 should help boost its fortunes.\n\nThere could be a few hiccups for the hospital company, however. Here\u2019s the outlook for HCA:\n\nEarnings: Analysts polled by FactSet see HCA reporting net income of $1.22 a share, and they offer a sharp consensus of $1.24 a share. That\u2019s up from the 92 cents reported a year ago.\n\nDisappointment could be in the air, however, as forecasts from Estimize.com, a crowdsource estimate of hedge-funds, brokers as well as analysts, put HCA earnings at $1.15 a share.\n\nStill, HCA has had a good track record of beating FactSet forecasts, as it has come in ahead of expectations in nine of the last 12 quarters. And when it misses, it\u2019s been by no more than three cents in that time frame.\n\nRevenue: HCA\u2019s revenue is expected to come in at $10.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.96 billion a year ago.\n\nStock reaction: HCA shares have climbed steadily from the $20 level in late 2011 to the $70 range where they stand now. HCA\u2019s all-time intraday high is $76.18, which it reached in mid-January.\n\nAfter hitting that high, shares dropped to below $68, and recently have traded in a high-$60s to low-$70s range.\n\nWhat to watch for: In addition to keeping an eye on full-year and quarterly earnings, look for HCA to offer a sign on where business is headed for the year, and whether that brings shares back up to the mid-$70 level.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Boosted internal forecasts as well as high outside praise should play a role in fourth-quarter earnings from hospital operator HCA.", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DE666_HCA_20_ZG_20150202145644.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Boosted internal forecasts as well as high outside praise should play a role in fourth-quarter earnings from hospital operator HCA.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-to-look-for-in-hca-earnings-2015-02-02", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "What to look for in HCA earnings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-02T15:26:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Boosted internal forecasts as well as high outside praise should play a role in fourth-quarter earnings from hospital operator HCA.", "title": "What to look for in HCA earnings", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-to-look-for-in-hca-earnings-2015-02-02", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DE666_HCA_20_ZG_20150202145644.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DE666_HCA_20_ZG_20150202145644.jpg"}, "article.id": "DB976FAC-AB0C-11E4-BB9E-D70E23BF6E7B", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1edf\"", "article_summary": "HCA HCA, +0.22% said in early January it should see adjusted earnings of $7.4 billion for the year, up from the $7.25 billion to $7.35 billion prediction it made in October.\nStock reaction: HCA shares have climbed steadily from the $20 level in late 2011 to the $70 range where they stand now.\nDisappointment could be in the air, however, as forecasts from Estimize.com, a crowdsource estimate of hedge-funds, brokers as well as analysts, put HCA earnings at $1.15 a share.\nWhat to watch for: In addition to keeping an eye on full-year and quarterly earnings, look for HCA to offer a sign on where business is headed for the year, and whether that brings shares back up to the mid-$70 level.\nS&P also put HCA on its vaunted S&P 500 stock index, replacing grocery retailer Safeway Inc., which has been taken private."}
