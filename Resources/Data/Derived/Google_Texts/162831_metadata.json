In Florida, there are multiple indications of increases in the double-digit range. The Palm Beach Post reports:\n\nFifteen health insurers want an average 17.7 percent increase in premiums for Affordable Care Act individual plans, Florida officials said Thursday \u2014 higher than last year\u2019s approved average of less than 10 percent.\n\nThe Post points out that last year\u2019s 9.5% increase was judged proof the program was a success because it was less than the 13% average increase the previous year. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Services said last August when the 2016 rates were announced, \u201cFlorida\u2019s proposed rates for the 2016 plan year demonstrate that the Affordable Care Act is working to spur competition and transparency in the marketplaces, keeping premium increases to single digits and leading to affordable new choices for consumers.\u201d Now it seems rates will be going up sharply.\n\nIn addition, Florida Blue accidentally posted its proposed rate increases on its website Tuesday. When a reporter for the Palm Beach Post noticed them and asked the company about them the rates were taken down. A spokesman for Florida Blue told the Post, \u201cthere are some adjustments that are not reflected in those numbers that were posted online.\u201d Does that mean the requested rates will be higher or lower? In any case here are the individual rate increases the Post reporter saw before they disappeared:\n\nBlueOptions Individual 9.83 percent\n\nBlueSelection Individual 11.61 percent\n\nThose rates could go up down depending on whatever \u201cadjustments\u201d Florida Blue makes before they are formally submitted. In addition, the state insurance regulator will likely try to bring those average increases down.\n\nThere have been multiple stories recently pointing out reasons why this year\u2019s rate increases will be higher, probably significantly higher, than previous years. The Obama administration likes to emphasize that most people don\u2019t see the bulk of these increases because subsidies cover the majority of the additional cost. However, the additional cost is still being paid, albeit indirectly by taxpayers.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cFifteen health insurers want an average 17.7 percent increase\u2026\u201d", "title": "Florida insurers seeking double-digit rate hikes under Obamacare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/05/13/florida-insurers-seek-17-rate-hike-under-obamacare/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-14T00:01:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-13T21:58:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "ACA, Florida, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "In addition, Florida Blue accidentally posted its proposed rate increases on its website Tuesday.\nFlorida insurers seeking double-digit rate hikes under Obamacareposted at 8:01 pm on May 13, 2016 by John SextonMore signs continue to pop up that Obamacare rate increases for next year will be significantly higher than the past two years.\nThere have been multiple stories recently pointing out reasons why this year\u2019s rate increases will be higher, probably significantly higher, than previous years.\nIn addition, the state insurance regulator will likely try to bring those average increases down.\nIn Florida, there are multiple indications of increases in the double-digit range."}
