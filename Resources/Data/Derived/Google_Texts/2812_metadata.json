Melissa \u201cMissy\u201d Davert and their two children have a condition that makes their bones fragile and susceptible to breaking.\n\nWhen the Davert family was told their insurance for their children would be cancelled, they turned to Obamacare and were denied.\n\nNow, with a fixed income, the family is worried about being able to afford the out-of-pocket maximum for the private insurance their children need.\n\n\u201c\u2026 we\u2019ve overcome many obstacles in life. And now it\u2019s a shame that one of the obstacles we have to overcome is our own government to pay for health care,\u201d Ken Davert said.\n\nEvery member in the Davert family has a medical condition requiring special care. But after losing their preferred insurance upon the enactment of the Affordable Care Act and being denied federal coverage, the Michigan family is now worried about high costs associated with their new private plan.\n\nAccording to The Bay City Times, Ken Davert has cerebral palsy and his wife, Missy, and their 15-year-old fraternal twins all have a condition called osteogensis imperfecta, which makes their bones very fragile.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the couple receives disability payments and are covered under Medicare. The state\u2019s Children\u2019s Special Health Care Services covers issues related to the teens\u2019 bone condition but not their other health needs.\n\n\u201cWe received a letter from Blue Cross maybe four months ago stating that their plan was going to be canceled due to new requirements of Obamacare,\u201d Missy Davert told The Bay City Times. \u201cI can imagine they didn\u2019t fit criteria of the new plan. There were some particular benefits the new act didn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nSo, the family applied for Obamacare. The Bay City Times reported that their first application was lost and their second came with a rejection. In response, the family is filing an appeal, which could take three months for the federal exchange to answer.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in the meantime, because their insurance was ending Dec. 31, we had to go out and buy a separate plan directly through Blue Cross/Blue Shield,\u201d the teens\u2019 mother told the newspaper. \u201cThe president had come on TV and said, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, we won\u2019t require you to get marketplace insurance for another year.\u2019 But Blue Cross/Blue Shield would not continue their plan, despite what the president said.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s issue with this new plan is its out-of-pocket maximum. Before, coverage cost the parents $2,500 for both teens, the Times reported. Now, it will cost $5,100 each \u2013 $10,200 total.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great insurance if you don\u2019t have to use it, that\u2019s how I look at it, but you never know from day to day if you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Missy Davert told the Times.\n\nBased on their family\u2019s medical history, meeting the maximum out-of-pocket expense relatively common.\n\nWatch this video from the Mackinac Center for Public Policy about the Davert\u2019s insurance issues (via Michigan Capitol Confidential):\n\n\u201cWe have such a unique family and we\u2019ve overcome many obstacles in life. And now it\u2019s a shame that one of the obstacles we have to overcome is our own government to pay for health care,\u201d Ken Davert said in the video, laughing in disbelief.\n\nThe Bay City Times reported that it is unclear exactly why Blue Cross cancelled the Davert\u2019s previous coverage.\n\nLast week after the family\u2019s plight was seen on some websites, the newspaper reported that they were contacted by Paul Tibbits, a representative with the Federal Health and Human Services Agency. Tibbits told the Daverts he thinks a glitch in the federal marketplace system might have mistakenly denied their children Medicade coverage. When she tried to re-enroll again after this conversation, Missy Davert said the site still wasn\u2019t working.\n\nOverall, the family told the newspaper they are figuring out how to make it work financially. Ken Davert is going back to work, something he can only due part time due to the symptoms associated with spina bifida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to me. It seems more and more our government has become a controlling power when the power is supposed to be with the people,\u201d Missy Davert told the Times. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this law isn\u2019t good for some people. I\u2019m really happy for those people [being helped], and I\u2019m not trying to take away what they\u2019ve gained, but it\u2019s also hurting many people.\u201d\n\nWatch this video from a couple years ago, in which the Daverts share more about their family and life:\n\nRead more of the Davert\u2019s story in the Bay City Times\u2019 full article.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Ken Davert has spina bifida.
