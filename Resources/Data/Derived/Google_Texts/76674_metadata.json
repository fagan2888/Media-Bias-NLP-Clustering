( Tara Siler )\n\nBertha Swan is wrestling with a taped-up package she calls a \u201cbubble pack,\u201d containing dozens of packets of pills that are different shapes, sizes and colors. On the table is a plastic box with dividers to organize them.\n\n\u201cYou just put the medicine in there, morning, noon, evening and night,\u201d she says.\n\nFor two years now Swan has been organizing these pills for her 70-year-old mother, whom she gives insulin shots and helps with home dialysis.\n\n\u201cShe has a lot going on,\u201d Swan says. \u201cShe has a lot of medical issues \u2014 a lot of them.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Aroytemise Swan, does indeed have a lot going on. She has diabetes as well as heart and kidney problems. She\u2019s asleep during my visit with her daughter \u2014 she sleeps a lot. She also makes frequent visits to the hospital: seven admissions and four trips to the emergency room in just over a year.\n\nA very small percentage of people use a significant amount of health care in this country. According to one estimate, 5 percent of the people account for 60 percent of health care costs. In California, health officials are busy drawing up a plan to identify these so-called super-utilizers of the Medi-Cal system.\n\nThe staff at San Francisco General Hospital has already started looking at these heavy utilizers and is now working extensively with Bertha Swan to help her mother.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something I need, I can just call them,\u201d Bertha Swan tells me. \u201cThey help me as far as getting connected to the doctor, doing the email, doing the prescriptions, things like that. So they help me a very lot. Yes they do. They\u2019re there for me.\u201d\n\nAnd since starting dialysis in March, her mother has not been to the hospital. \u201cKnock on wood,\u201d Swan says.\n\nAt San Francisco General Hospital\u2019s Adult Medical Clinic, officials estimate just 3 percent of patients account for 35 percent of hospital admissions. And they often come with both multiple chronic conditions and multiple medications.\n\n\u201cThey may also be living in a two-bedroom apartment with eight other people,\u201d notes clinic medical director Dr. Elizabeth Davis. \u201cThey may be depressed, and they may also smoke. And that\u2019s a lot to deal with.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the staff here takes a team approach, using a nurse, a health coach and social workers.\n\nIt all starts by building trust with the patients, says Marty Lynch. He\u2019s the executive director of LifeLong, a community health organization based in Berkeley. Lynch says it\u2019s tough work because many in this population have mental health and substance-use disorder issues.\n\n\u201cThese case managers who do this kind of work are saints in my opinion,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThey have to have really good persistence and also really good personal skills and the ability to respect anyone with any kind of problem and think positively about them.\u201d\n\nMany of the patients, he says, may be homeless. \u201cThe second issue is can we get you housed and if we can get you housed, maybe then we can talk you into coming in and seeing our doctor.\u201d\n\nLifeLong is working with Alta Bates Summit Hospital to provide coordinated care to frequent utilizers. The new state program will depend on just this kind of collaboration.\n\nHannah Katch is with California\u2019s Department of Health Care Services. She says the proposed Health Home program, along with other proposals, will provide more than just care coordination.\n\nIt will \u201calso help the patient get access to supportive housing,\u201d Katch says, \u201cor help the patient get access to a mental health provider, or to support groups, or to food assistance.\u201d\n\nThe federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost to get this program off the ground. After two years, the Health Homes program will have to cover its costs, Katch says, by making a big dent in hospital admissions and emergency room visits.\n\nBut providing more services without spending more money is just one metric. \u201cBut really the goal is to try and help these particular high utilizers improve their health,\u201d Katch said.\n\nSince more than half of all services are used so inefficiently by so few people, Katch says this is really the prime opportunity in health care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the whole ballgame,\u201d she says.\n\nYet a lot of questions remain: Who exactly will be eligible for the Health Homes program? How well will hospitals, specialists and clinics share information? Marty Lynch from LifeLong is curious how much providers will be reimbursed for reaching this difficult population.\n\n\u201cIf they want the very toughest people they have to pay a decent rate,\u201d Lynch says.\n\nIf approved by federal officials this October, the state hopes to launch the Health Homes programs in seven counties beginning in January. The rollout would expand to other counties starting July 2016.\n\nClick here to listen to the original audio report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposed program hopes to help patients take better care of themselves and also save health care dollars.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Targeting Heavy Users of Medi-Cal, Program Aims to Lower Costs, Increase Quality\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/06\\/22\\/targeting-heavy-users-of-medi-cal-program-aims-to-lower-costs-increase-quality\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-22 10:33:22\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-22 14:51:42\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":37941,\"author_id\":\"257\",\"author_name\":\"Tara Siler\",\"author_display_name\":\"Tara Siler\",\"tags\":[\"Medi-Cal\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/06\\/IMG_1544-e1434652323355.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Proposed program hopes to help patients take better care of themselves and also save health care dollars.", "title": "Targeting Heavy Users of Medi-Cal, Program Aims to Lower Costs, Increase Quality", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/06/22/targeting-heavy-users-of-medi-cal-program-aims-to-lower-costs-increase-quality/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/06/IMG_1544-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "medi-cal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "According to one estimate, 5 percent of the people account for 60 percent of health care costs.\nA very small percentage of people use a significant amount of health care in this country.\n\u201cShe has a lot of medical issues \u2014 a lot of them.\u201dHer mother, Aroytemise Swan, does indeed have a lot going on.\n\u201cBut really the goal is to try and help these particular high utilizers improve their health,\u201d Katch said.\nShe says the proposed Health Home program, along with other proposals, will provide more than just care coordination."}
