Danny McDonald.\n\nThis six-seater, 2015 Yamaha Viking 6, was purchased with grant money from the Ironman and Firehouse Public Safety Foundations.\n\nAbout two months ago, beach police applied for the grant and were given $15,000 for the purchase.\n\nThe company HG-2 provided the blue lights.\n\nAnd what makes this ATV unique: there's only one like this in the United States.\n\n\"The idea is that we are going to have it for all our major events at the gulf coast jam, at the music festival, spring break is going to be utilized,\" said McDonald.\n\nPolice planned on using the ATV for the first time to follow swimmers along the beach.\n\nBut the weather threw off plans for police and athletes alike.\n\n\"This is colder than Copenhagen,\" one athlete said.\n\n\"Let's see how it goes in the swimming, seems to be pretty rough,\" competitor Miguel Ponce said.\n\nAnd rough was an understatement.\n\n\"To ensure your safety, we have canceled the swim,\" officials announced.\n\n\"It was a bummer, but I think it was a wise decision because Florida is known for many first timers. The conditions are rough and it would have been dangerous,\" athlete Guy Buyens said.\n\nEvent officials say due to severe riptides and high winds, the decision was a no-brainer.\n\n\"Our first priority above all else is to keep the athletes safe and sometimes they don't necessarily agree with that, but then again, given the conditions it was the right call,\" said Philip Lahaye, Vice President of Operations.\n\nThe triathlon became a duathlon with just cycling and running.\n\nFrom 140.6 miles total, only 2.4 miles were eliminated.\n\nWhile some were disappointed, as soon as the athletes got on the bikes, they were focused on crossing the finish line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of athletes in the IRONMAN Florida Triathlon were handed a big surprise Saturday.
