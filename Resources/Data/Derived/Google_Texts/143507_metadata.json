I can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also expressed his hope that the Senate would not delay in confirming his nomination of Loretta Lynch to this position, especially since they did not delay to confirm her position as federal prosecutor twice before in the past.\n\nIf her nomination is confirmed and approved by Senate, Loretta Lynch will make history by becoming the first African-American woman to serve in this position.\n\nIn the beginning of her speech, Loretta Lynch expressed her honest feelings about the Department of Justice and how she will be humbled by her new position.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is the only Cabinet department named for an ideal and this is actually appropriate because our work is both aspirational and grounded in gritted reality. It is both ennobling and\u2026 profoundly challenging. Today, I stand before you so thrilled and, frankly, so humbled to lead this group of wonderful people who work all day and well into the night to make that ideal a manifest reality \u2014 all as part of their steadfast protection of the citizens of this country.\u201d\n\nLoretta Lynch then continued her speech by expressing her gratitude for President Obama and the citizens of the United States with a heartfelt promise.\n\n\u201cMr. President, thank you again for the faith that you\u2019ve placed in me. I pledge today to you and to the American people that if I have the honor of being confirmed by the Senate, I will wake up every morning with the protection of the American people my first thought. And I will work every day to safeguard our citizens, our liberties, our rights and this great nation which has given so much to me and my family.\u201d\n\nLynch has worked as a popular prosecutor since she was first appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn from 1999 to 2001 and then by President Obama in 2010. If the Senate approves President Obama\u2019s nomination, a formal announcement will then be made from the White House about Loretta Lynch becoming the new U.S. attorney general.\n\n[Image Credit: Wall Street Journal]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Loretta Lynch has officially been nominated by President Barack Obama to become the new U.S. attorney general, replacing Eric Holder.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Loretta Lynch has officially been nominated by President Barack Obama to become the new U.S. attorney general, replacing Eric Holder.", "title": "Loretta Lynch Nominated As U.S. Attorney General, Makes History", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1595042/loretta-lynch-nominated-attorney-general/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loretta-Lynch-Attorney-General-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-08T13:30:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-08T13:50:51+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loretta-Lynch-Attorney-General-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-08T13:30:41+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "loretta lynch,loretta lynch attorney general,loretta lynch nomination,president obama,barack obama,eric holder,loretta lynch nominated,u.s. attorney general,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loretta-Lynch-Attorney-General-670x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Loretta Lynch has officially been nominated by President Barack Obama to become the new U.S. attorney general, replacing Eric Holder."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "For his speech, President Obama was joined by both Loretta Lynch and the outgoing U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder.\nLoretta Lynch was officially nominated by President Barack Obama on Saturday to become the next U.S. attorney general.\nIf her nomination is confirmed and approved by Senate, Loretta Lynch will make history by becoming the first African-American woman to serve in this position.\nIf the Senate approves President Obama\u2019s nomination, a formal announcement will then be made from the White House about Loretta Lynch becoming the new U.S. attorney general.\nIn the beginning of her speech, Loretta Lynch expressed her honest feelings about the Department of Justice and how she will be humbled by her new position."}
