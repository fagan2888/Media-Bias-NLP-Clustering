But the Founders placed a high bar for constitutional change.\n\nSince 1789, the Constitution has been amended just 27 times. But in the past two decades, major events such as the 2000 presidential election, the constant budget battles in Congress and the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision have given new momentum to groups that want constitutional change now.\n\nIn Article V, the Founders designed two paths toward constitutional change. The path used for the first 27 amendments has been the legislative path. It requires a two-thirds majority vote by the House and the Senate before a proposed amendment is sent to the states, where three-quarters of the states must ratify an amendment to make it the law.\n\nBut there are staunch supporters of a second process that has never been used, but is spelled out in the Constitution. It allows the legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a Constitutional convention to propose an amendment, or amendments. Then, as in the traditional process, three-quarters of the states would ratify an amendment to make it the law.\n\nWe\u2019ve invited two proponents who agree on a basic premise, as an example of this evolving debate about constitutional change. They both think that the Citizens United decision should be mitigated. But they both strongly disagree about the process. And it is the debate about process that affects all discussions about new amendments and legislative policy, whether they focus on a balanced budget, the Electoral College, or the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCenk Uygur is the host of the YoungTurks, the largest online news show in the world at www.YouTube.com/TheYoungTurks, and Founder and CEO of www.TYTNetwork.com. Cenk was also instrumental in launching Wolf-PAC (#wolfpac), a group that wants states to propose and ratify an amendment to the Constitution to end corporate personhood, without the interaction of Congress.\n\nMeredith McGehee is Policy Director at the Campaign Legal Center where she directs the legislative and media policy efforts. In addition, she is the principal of McGehee Strategies, which specializes in public interest advocacy campaigns. Meredith advocates changes through the existing legislative process to address the fallout from Citizens United.\n\nTo listen to the full podcast, use the player below or click on the following link: Download this episode (right click and save)\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s use of executive orders in historical terms\n\nJeffrey Rosen explains the House lawsuit against President Obama on WHYY\n\nConstitution Check: When and how will the Supreme Court act on same-sex marriage?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Cenk Uygur, the host of the Young Turks, and the Campaign Legal Center\u2019s Meredith McGehee join the National Constitution Center's Jeffery Rosen for a podcast debate about a constitutional conventio...", "title": "Podcast: Debating two ways of changing Citizens United", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/08/podcast-debating-two-ways-of-changing-citizens-united/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cenkmeredith.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cenkmeredith.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T16:38:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T18:13:00+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab24\"", "article_summary": "Meredith advocates changes through the existing legislative process to address the fallout from Citizens United.\nWe\u2019ve invited two proponents who agree on a basic premise, as an example of this evolving debate about constitutional change.\nIn Article V, the Founders designed two paths toward constitutional change.\nBut the Founders placed a high bar for constitutional change.\nBut in the past two decades, major events such as the 2000 presidential election, the constant budget battles in Congress and the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision have given new momentum to groups that want constitutional change now."}
