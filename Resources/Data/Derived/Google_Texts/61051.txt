Investigators are trying to figure out the identities of two dead people found Friday in a Chickasaw County motel room.

The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the bodies were partly decomposed.

Okolona Police Chief Willie Moore says the people appear to have been a man and a woman and may have been in the room for some time. Police sought the assistance of state crime lab investigators and were trying to determine who had called 911 to alert them to the bodies.

Officers donned fire department boots and fire department air tanks to make their initial canvas of the room, to ward off an overpowering stench.

A motel employee didn't know who was staying in the room or how long they had been there.
