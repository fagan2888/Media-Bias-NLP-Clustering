Really, he\u2019s not.\n\nNor is he mean.\n\nNot when he\u2019s writing about George W. Bush\u2019s inability to make nouns and verbs agree, or the voices in Ben Carson\u2019s head, or Sarah Palin\u2019s failure to name a single U.S. Supreme Court decision she disagrees with.\n\nNo, in those instances, Borowitz, a satirist for The New Yorker, is hoping to effect change.\n\n\u201cEverybody who is a satirist or does what I do \u2014 criticizing things and trying to be funny about it \u2014 comes from a place of innocence and earnestness,\u201d Borowitz told a packed audience Wednesday night at The Poynter Institute. \u201cI think the impulse to point out this stuff comes from a misguided view that things should get better.\u201d\n\nSatire, on some level, is supposed to be a corrective exercise, Borowitz said. It\u2019s not that he thinks his role is all that important \u2014 he was quick to clarify that. But there is a point to it.\n\n\u201cThe idea of satire is to take on something that deserves to be taken on,\u201d Borowitz said. \u201cI try to ask myself, \u2018What is the appropriate target here?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor instance, when he wrote his numerous columns about Hurricane Katrina, he never made fun of the people who suffered. Instead, he turned his sharp criticism and biting wit to the people who made it worse: The government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, former president George W. Bush, even Barbara Bush.\n\nBorowitz shared his thoughts on the role of satire, the decline of the Republican Party and the target-rich environment that is U.S. Politics as the second speaker in Poynter\u2019s 40th Anniversary Speaker Series.\n\nThe conversation was moderated by Paul Tash, the chairman of the Poynter Institute and CEO of the Tampa Bay Times, which Poynter owns. After Borowitz delivered a joke-laden soliloquy about the presidential debates, Tash asked whether Borowitz, whose comments thus far in the night had focused on conservative politicians, thought Republicans were funnier than Democrats.\n\n\u201cI will make fun of anybody who gives me good material,\u201d Borowitz said.\n\nHowever, if he had to make a choice based on the 2015 candidates, the Republicans would win out as the easier targets.\n\nDespite the fact that he rips on Republicans more often than their liberal counterparts, Borowitz has found that Democrats are often much more thin-skinned.\n\n\u201cThe same people will love it when you attack the people they can\u2019t stand, but if you take down one of their sacred cows there is no thinner skin in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always sort of disappointed by that.\u201d\n\nAfter 15 years of writing satire, Borowitz said the hardest part isn\u2019t the writing -- that comes easily -- but finding new ideas, especially in the repetitive circus that is politics. There are only so many times he can write about Republicans attempting to repeal Obamacare or pushing for a more probing investigation of Benghazi.\n\n\u201cOn a week where things are really flowing and there are some great things going on in the world, my job becomes a walk in the park, and there\u2019s no real stumbling block,\u201d Borowitz said.\n\nAfter he hones on in a good idea, the key is to keep it short.\n\n\u201cI never want to outstay my welcome with any of these jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe audience catches on pretty quickly to what you\u2019re doing. Try to entertain them quickly and then let them move on.\u201d\n\nSo he churns out a pithy headline, follows it with a funny lead and then plays on variations of those for a few paragraphs.\n\nSometimes, foreign press outlets aren\u2019t able to discern between his copy as satire and \u201creal news\u201d coming from other U.S. news outlets. He\u2019s seen several of his stories printed abroad as if they were factual, especially in China. The Onion, he said, has the same problem.\n\nPart of what might contribute to that confusion is the blurring of content lines between cable news outlets and comedy shows such as \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\u201d\n\nCable news networks have become more glib, Borowitz argued, while comedy shows are focusing on actual news highlighted with cutting commentary.\n\n\u201c(Cable networks) have gotten actually less serious and more shallow, meanwhile John Oliver is becoming more substantive,\u201d Borowitz said. \u201cThe two trend lines are crossing right now.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misidentified a recent subject of Borowitz' satire. It is Ben Carson, not Herman Cain.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Poynter", "description": "Andy Borowitz wants people to know he\u2019s not a jaded person.
