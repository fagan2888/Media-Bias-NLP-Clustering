He was working the night shift in the basement of the hospital when suddenly he saw the CEO coming toward him.\n\nHe had no idea why the boss was walking the halls, but it didn\u2019t matter. Van Gorder had never met the CEO before. He thought this was his chance to make a connection. He straightened his uniform and prepared to shake the man\u2019s hand \u2014 and at least say hello.\n\nRelated: 3 Secrets to a Better Job (and More Money)\n\nHe never got the chance. \u201cThe CEO walked right by me like I didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Van Gorder recalls. \u201cHe turned the corner and was gone, without making eye contact or even acknowledging my presence in that empty hallway.\u201d\n\nThe episode was so demoralizing Van Gorder vowed if he ever took on a C-suite role, he would do the opposite of it. He would not only engage with employees who worked for his firm \u2014 he would listen to their concerns, bond with them as much as possible and keep their needs in mind when making corporate decisions both big and small.\n\nHe seems to have made good on that pledge. For the past 15 years Van Gorder has been running the Scripps health system, which has over 14,000 employees. The CEO has been lauded for saving his company from bankruptcy and putting it in a dominant market position. Scripps hospitals have regularly appeared in the U.S. News & World Report ranking of America\u2019s best hospitals, and the health care provider has made Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for seven consecutive years. Scripps Health hasn\u2019t laid anyone off since Van Gorder joined the company in 2000.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job Seekers\n\n\u201cAs a leader, I\u2019m not a distant CEO but an ordinary guy who \u2018gets it,\u2019\u201d he says in a new book, The Front-Line Leader: Building a High-Performance Organization from the Ground Up, adding, \u201cPsychological distance is extremely dangerous for leaders.\u201d\n\nBeing the kind of hands-on leader he describes may seem a tall order in a 24/7 global economy. It\u2019s certainly not for everyone and it\u2019s not for every industry. It\u2019s also risky: If you\u2019re spending time talking to those in the lower ranks, then you\u2019ve lost time to interact with your management team or with the others helping you run the business. But Van Gorder, a former police officer, insists that the payoffs can be huge.\n\n\u201cOrganizations could become far more successful if executives understood authentically leading from the ground up,\u201d he notes. \u201cPaying attention to workers isn\u2019t only helpful \u2014 it\u2019s essential. Engaging emotionally, intellectually and financially produces incredible loyalty, which in turn improves the metrics important to any business: retention, employee satisfaction, productivity, quality.\u201d He adds that the hardest thing about what he's advocating is consistency and the time required.\n\nMore than a few blunt and blustery leaders in American business have of course carved out entire reputations by treating underlings horribly (The Devil Wears Prada, anyone?). Bad bosses can also cross the line into bullying, with damaging consequences.\n\nRelated: 5 Smart Steps to Combat Workplace Bullying\n\nBut the best leaders know how to make a connection with those who work for their firms through regular feedback sessions, meetings or conferences. Van Gorder started a Scripps Leadership Academy, among other initiatives. He meets with the group monthly.\n\nRoselinde Torres, a leadership expert at The Boston Consulting Group, also says a key characteristic of today\u2019s best leaders is the capacity to empathize. She calls the ability to connect through a \u201csofter\u201d influence \u2014 rather than a top-down hierarchy \u2014 the best way to exert influence.\n\nThat means going outside the C-suite comfort zone. It\u2019s about relating to those who are very different in order to gain their trust to achieve shared goals, Torres noted in a recent TED talk. Those differences can be functional, cultural or socioeconomic.\n\nVan Gorder explains in his book that connecting with employees isn\u2019t about trying to be popular. It\u2019s not about paying lip service to good leadership \u2014 and it\u2019s definitely not about a one-and-done interaction. It\u2019s about genuinely and regularly connecting and communicating with workers to get better performance, keep their satisfaction rates high and keep them around \u2014 all of which makes for a financially healthier organization.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of Scripps Health in San Diego, still recalls with", "title": "The One Trait All Leaders Should Have", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/One-Trait-All-Leaders-Should-Have", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05292012_Board_Meeting_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/17/One-Trait-All-Leaders-Should-Have", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05292012_Board_Meeting_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of Scripps Health in San Diego, still recalls with", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb125\"", "article_summary": "Roselinde Torres, a leadership expert at The Boston Consulting Group, also says a key characteristic of today\u2019s best leaders is the capacity to empathize.\nRelated: 5 Smart Steps to Combat Workplace BullyingBut the best leaders know how to make a connection with those who work for their firms through regular feedback sessions, meetings or conferences.\nVan Gorder was then a blue-collar hospital security guard just starting out.\nFor the past 15 years Van Gorder has been running the Scripps health system, which has over 14,000 employees.\nBut Van Gorder, a former police officer, insists that the payoffs can be huge."}
