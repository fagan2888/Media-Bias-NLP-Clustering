My dog noticed him and barked at him. By the time he barked, me and the other deputy came around the truck. I screamed at my dog, and the cop looked at me and shot my dog,\" Rexrode said.\n\nWhen Buford jumped out of the truck, Rexrode said the deputy ran into the street.\n\nHe said Buford did run after him, but he stopped when he got to the end of his driveway.\n\nRexrode said the dog did not attack the deputy.\n\nBut the sheriff's office paints a much different picture. They said the deputy was forced to shoot the aggressive dog when it attacked.\n\nIf the officer did feel threatened, Rexrode said there are other ways he could've stopped the animal -- shooting him was unwarranted.\n\n\"He has mace or a Taser, to protect himself. There was a whole other route he could have took,\" Rexrode said. \"I mean the dog was doing his job. The cop should've never been in my yard. He had no reason to be in my yard.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office said they were at Rexrode's home attempting to serve an arrest warrant to a woman when Buford attacked.\n\nRexrode said he doesn't know who that woman is.\n\nRexrode said Buford is expected to make a full recovery, but his vet bill has already reached $1,300.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A dog was shot by a Charlotte County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0on Saturday\u00a0afternoon, and the dog's owner is speaking exclusively with ABC7.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/31044287/shooting-of-dog-by-ccso-deputy-unwarranted-owner-says", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A dog was shot by a Charlotte County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0on Saturday\u00a0afternoon, and the dog's owner is speaking exclusively with ABC7.", "title": "Shooting of dog by CCSO deputy 'unwarranted,' owner says"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9720964_G.jpg", "description": "A dog was shot by a Charlotte County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0on Saturday\u00a0afternoon, and the dog's owner is speaking exclusively with ABC7.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shooting of dog by CCSO deputy 'unwarranted,' owner says"}, "wnreadableurl": "shooting-of-dog-by-ccso-deputy-unwarranted-owner-says", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2016/01/24", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0333\"", "article_summary": "I screamed at my dog, and the cop looked at me and shot my dog,\" Rexrode said.\nA dog was shot by a Charlotte County Sheriff's deputy on Saturday afternoon, and the dog's owner is speaking exclusively with ABC7.\nWhen Buford jumped out of the truck, Rexrode said the deputy ran into the street.\n\"He was walking up my driveway to the other deputy, and he got up to the truck the dog was sitting in.\nRexrode said Buford is expected to make a full recovery, but his vet bill has already reached $1,300."}
