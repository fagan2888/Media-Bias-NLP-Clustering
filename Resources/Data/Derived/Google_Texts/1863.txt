Members of the U.S. House voted 239-186 Tuesday to approve H.R. 596, a bill that would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA).

H.R. 596 would also repeal the health care provisions in a PPACA companion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA).
