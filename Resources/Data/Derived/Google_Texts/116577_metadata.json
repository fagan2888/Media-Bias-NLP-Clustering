While some worry making low-income recipients pay for part of their Medicaid costs is unfair, the change is notable in that the Obama administration is not fighting it tooth and nail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very fluid scenario,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cThere\u2019s now a handful of states that are engaged in direct negotiations with CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] or are having [a] back-and-forth debate within their house.\u201d\n\nIndiana, led by GOP Gov. Mike Pence, approved the Healthy Indiana Plan in February. In doing so, the state replaced traditional Medicaid and expanded it, as sought under ObamaCare \u2013 something a number of Republican-led states have still not done.\n\nThe catch: Indiana\u2019s plan requires recipients pay for part of the cost. In order to get insurance, recipients would pay monthly premiums (based on income, ranging from $1 to $27), in addition to various co-payments (anywhere from $4 to $75). If a recipient pays their premiums on time, they can qualify for expanded benefits and have co-pays limited to only non-emergency ER visits.\n\nMore On This... Truth Serum: Cost of health insurance premiums\n\nIf it works, it would be a breakthrough for GOP-led states that want to expand Medicaid and cover the uninsured \u2013 yet don\u2019t want the program to be an all-expenses-paid entitlement. About 297,000 Indiana residents have enrolled in the program as of July 1. The state says 72 percent are paying their premiums on time.\n\nUnder the traditional Medicaid expansion, the federal government would cover 100 percent of the cost for states, and ratchet that down to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nIndiana\u2019s plan relies solely on its own resources, but Pence says it \u201cwill require no new state spending and no new taxes.\u201d The Healthy Indiana Plan will be financed by state cigarette tax revenue and fees collected from hospitals. State figures estimate that the program will cost $1.63 billion.\n\nFour other states also have gotten federal waivers for their own cost-sharing expansions. Arkansas got the ball rolling with its approval in September 2013, followed by Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIndiana, though, went a step further. The state\u2019s plan was unprecedented because it says recipients can lose coverage for not paying premiums.\n\nAlaska, Montana, Utah, and Tennessee are now debating similar shared-cost proposals \u2013 borrowing elements from the Indiana plan -- according to Salo. Most, though not all, of these states are led by GOP governors.\n\n\u201cThe Healthy Indiana Plan \u2026 is aspirational,\u201d Brian Neale, Pence\u2019s health policy director, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe believe that individuals, if offered the opportunity, will make the right choices.\u201d The plan requires recipients to contribute to a health savings account that tracks medical expenses. Patients get care as long as they make their payments, and can lower their rates by getting various preventive care.\n\nBut charging poor patients can be problematic. Studies show that charging premiums and co-pays, and penalizing people for excessive emergency room visits, typically steers poor people away from the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t get necessary care,\u201d Judith Solomon, a health analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told the Los Angeles Times. She said plans like Indiana\u2019s often prevent the poor from actually getting decent treatment.\n\nBut the federal government has become more open to alternative plans.\n\nIn late January, then-CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner approved Indiana\u2019s waivers and congratulated the state on its program. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell has said the administration is open to alternatives.\n\nObamaCare itself calls for Medicaid to be extended to childless adults making up to 138 percent of the poverty line. The Supreme Court, however, ruled the expansion optional for states in 2012. Twenty states remain resistant to any expansions. Indiana originally was in that group, but reversed course with its cost-sharing plan.\n\nSalo said the program represents a deep change in philosophy, bringing a conservative approach to a longstanding entitlement. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing from more conservative states is that they want more consumer engagement in health care \u2026 skin in the game,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, Salo said Pence is \u201ca bona-fide conservative red state governor\u201d and it may be \u201chard for other states to say Medicaid can\u2019t be a conservative thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "state-local", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-25 05:04:01 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program \u2013 by making recipients pay for part of their health care.", "twitter": {"description": "Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program \u2013 by making recipients pay for part of their health care.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/08/0/0/070815_dotcom_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "GOP govs test ObamaCare compromise: Make Medicaid recipients pay", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/state-local\",\"title\":\"GOP govs test ObamaCare compromise: Make Medicaid recipients pay\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/08/0/0/070815_dotcom_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-16T07:15:20Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"8af76498-1e0b-41fa-a6ce-6a3632bfbf14\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program \u2013 by making recipients pay for part of their health care.", "dc.identifier": "8af76498-1e0b-41fa-a6ce-6a3632bfbf14", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "description": "Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program \u2013 by making recipients pay for part of their health care.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Gop Govs Test Obamacare Compromise: Make Medicaid Recipients Pay", "dcterms.created": "2015-07-25 05:04:01 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Republican officials, after battling for years with Washington over ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, are testing a middle ground that could reshape the program \u2013 by making recipients pay for part of their health care.", "title": "GOP govs test ObamaCare compromise: Make Medicaid recipients pay | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/08/0/0/070815_dotcom_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-07-16", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/state-local\",\"title\":\"GOP govs test ObamaCare compromise: Make Medicaid recipients pay\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/08/0/0/070815_dotcom_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-16T07:15:20Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/gop-govs-weigh-obamacare-compromise-make-medicaid-recipients-pay.html\",\"post_id\":\"8af76498-1e0b-41fa-a6ce-6a3632bfbf14\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddb0\"", "article_summary": "The catch: Indiana\u2019s plan requires recipients pay for part of the cost.\nAlaska, Montana, Utah, and Tennessee are now debating similar shared-cost proposals \u2013 borrowing elements from the Indiana plan -- according to Salo.\nWhile some worry making low-income recipients pay for part of their Medicaid costs is unfair, the change is notable in that the Obama administration is not fighting it tooth and nail.\nMike Pence, approved the Healthy Indiana Plan in February.\nThe state\u2019s plan was unprecedented because it says recipients can lose coverage for not paying premiums."}
