Estimated to garner about $30 billion dollars over the next ten years, the medical-device law went into effect this past January.\n\nRepublicans in the House have long fought the tax, as have members of both parties from states like Massachusetts and Minnesota where many makers of medical devices are headquartered.\n\nUnder the law, \u201cdevices\u201d mean everything from MRI machines and cardiac defibrillators to tongue depressors and bandages \u2013 as long as they are being sold to medical \u201cproviders\u201d like hospitals and doctors. If bandages or medical gloves are sold at a drugstore, that sale isn\u2019t subject to the tax. But if they\u2019re sold in bulk to a hospital chain, that transaction does fall under the law. Also, certain items are always exempt, such as eyeglasses and contact lenses.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of devices and products that typically are and aren\u2019t subject to the excise tax.\n\nBand-Aids EXEMPT\n\nAssociated Press\n\nBand-Aids and other consumer products get a pass under the retail exception. In this 2009 file photo, a customer removes a box of Band-Aids from a display at a pharmacy in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging machines TAXED\n\nAssociated Press\n\nFrom left, MRI technician Laura Woods, Jacksonville Zoo veterinarian Adrian Atkins, and MRI Technician Sharon Vizcaino, position Torra the cheetah on the table in the MRI room at the Baptist Medical Center Nassau in Fernandina Beach, Fla., last year. Torra was having trouble with vision and stability.\n\nWheelchairs EXEMPT\n\nAssociated Press\n\nMechanical and powered wheelchairs fall under the retail exemption. Above, Korean War veteran Robert Olson, from Iowa, is pushed in his wheelchair by Zach Twedt, also from Iowa, around the National World War II Memorial in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013.\n\nLASIK machines TAXED\n\nAssociated Press\n\nA television monitor shows the image from the operating microscope during Lasik eye surgery in this 2005 file photo.\n\nHeart valves TAXED\n\nBloomberg News\n\nAn Edwards Lifesciences Corp. SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve is assembled in a training room at company headquarters in Irvine, Calif., in 2011.\n\nPacifiers EXEMPT\n\nAssociated Press\n\nIn this 2012 image released by Jessa Decker-Smith, her 7-month-old daughter wears a pacifier with a felt mustache attached to it.\n\nPacemakers TAXED\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAn x-ray from the North Carolina State\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine in Raleigh, N.C., seen here on Wednesday Jan. 29, 2003, shows a dog with a pacemaker in place.\n\nDentures TAXED\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWhile the final product isn\u2019t taxed, the components that go into a set were taxed during the production process. In this March 30, 2012, photo, Kelley Gannon smiles as she first sees her new full set of dentures installed by Stephen Alouf, rear, a dentist in Roanoke, Va.\n\nEyeglasses EXEMPT\n\nAssociated Press\n\nEyeglasses and contact lenses are specifically exempted under the law.

Hillary Rodham Clinton shops for eyeglasses during a campaign stop in Louisville, Ky., in May 2008.\n\nSources: IRS, American Dental Association\n\nMore\n\nShutdown Jargon: \u2018Fairness Under Obamacare,\u2019 More\n\nCrisis Meter Update: Stuck on DEBTCON 3", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Here's a rundown of devices and products that typically are and aren't subject to the medical-devices excise tax.", "title": "Medical Devices: What\u2019s Taxed, What Isn\u2019t", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/15/medical-devices-whats-taxed-what-isnt/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZH050_MRI_G_20131014172534.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Medical Devices: What\u2019s Taxed, What Isn\u2019t", "description": "Here's a rundown of devices and products that typically are and aren't subject to the medical-devices excise tax.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Here's a rundown of devices and products that typically are and aren't subject to the medical-devices excise tax.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-15T17:08:42-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/15/medical-devices-whats-taxed-what-isnt/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-41132", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Here's a rundown of devices and products that typically are and aren't subject to the medical-devices excise tax.", "title": "Medical Devices: What\u2019s Taxed, What Isn\u2019t", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/15/medical-devices-whats-taxed-what-isnt/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZH050_MRI_G_20131014172534.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-41132", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-15T19:15:40-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84ba\"", "article_summary": "Among the moving parts in talks over the government shutdown is a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices sold in the U.S. that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nDentures TAXEDAssociated PressWhile the final product isn\u2019t taxed, the components that go into a set were taxed during the production process.\nLASIK machines TAXEDAssociated PressA television monitor shows the image from the operating microscope during Lasik eye surgery in this 2005 file photo.\nRepublicans in the House have long fought the tax, as have members of both parties from states like Massachusetts and Minnesota where many makers of medical devices are headquartered.\nIf bandages or medical gloves are sold at a drugstore, that sale isn\u2019t subject to the tax."}
