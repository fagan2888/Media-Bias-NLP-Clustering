The VA will deny access to or remove a service animal if it poses a risk to the healthy and safety of other people or other service animals.\n\nThe rule will take effect in 30 days.\n\nAbnormal nuclear occurrences: The Nuclear Regulatory Council is considering changing its policy statement on reporting abnormal occurrences (AO) to Congress.\n\nThe revision would clarify the criteria for determining events that are significant from the standpoint of public health and safety and should be reported. Past AOs include medical events and radiation exposures at testing facilities and nuclear power plants.\n\nThe public has 90 days to comment on the proposed revisions.\n\nRecord systems: The Department of Homeland Security is considering folding two record-keeping systems, which collect and maintain data on all commercial goods imported into the U.S., into one system.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Automated Commercial Environment/International Trade Data System of Records and the Automated Commercial System of Records would be consolidated and renamed the Import Information System of Records.\n\nThe systems will continue to collect records on imported goods, as well as the information pertaining to the people \u2014 carriers, brokers and importers \u2014 associated with the import transaction.\n\nThe public has 30 days to comment.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A look at Monday's edition of the Federal Register today.", "description": "A look at Monday's edition of the Federal Register today.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A look at Monday's edition of the Federal Register today.", "title": "New regs for Monday: Service animals, abnormal occurrences and record-keeping systems", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251135-new-regs-for-monday-service-animals-abnormal-occurrences-and-record-keeping", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/veteranserviceanimal08142015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251135-new-regs-for-monday-service-animals-abnormal-occurrences-and-record-keeping", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-14T11:06-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Nuclear power, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Issues,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T11:06:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/251135-new-regs-for-monday-service-animals-abnormal-occurrences-and-record-keeping", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A look at Monday's edition of the Federal Register today.", "card": "summary", "title": "New regs for Monday: Service animals, abnormal occurrences and record-keeping systems"}, "dcterms.title": "New regs for Monday: Service animals, abnormal occurrences and record-keeping systems"}, "article_summary": "Service animals: The Department of Veterans Affairs is issuing a final rule to amend its policy and allow service animals on Veteran Affairs property.\nAbnormal nuclear occurrences: The Nuclear Regulatory Council is considering changing its policy statement on reporting abnormal occurrences (AO) to Congress.\nADVERTISEMENTThe final rule expands the current VA regulation to allow service animals on VA property when individuals with disabilities \u2014 employees, veterans and visitors \u2014 accompany the animal.\nThe agency\u2019s Automated Commercial Environment/International Trade Data System of Records and the Automated Commercial System of Records would be consolidated and renamed the Import Information System of Records.\nRecord systems: The Department of Homeland Security is considering folding two record-keeping systems, which collect and maintain data on all commercial goods imported into the U.S., into one system."}
