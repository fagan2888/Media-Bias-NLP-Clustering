And I\u2019m getting pretty sick of it.\n\nMaybe this is especially true for me: a nonpartisan, well-traveled, 20-something Jew with a diverse assortment of politically and religiously aligned friends. But pro-Israel and pro-Palestine posts have been popping up left, right and center \u2014 and, when it comes to this issue, people appear keen to reveal their true colors.\n\nWhile one friend\u2019s status accuses Israel of genocide to Holocaust-like proportions, another reams out Palestinian protesters whose signs are adorned with swastikas.\n\nGory photos of Gazan children injured by Israel Defense Forces strikes and shells are combated with infographics decrying outrage over Hamas\u2019 use of schools as weapons storage facilities.\n\nA video of Israelis cheering from a lookout point as rockets hit Gaza is matched by a video of Hamas militants warning, \u201cWe love death more than you [Israelis] love life.\u201d\n\nFor every \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d comes an \u201cAm Israel Chai (long live Israel).\u201d For every offense, a defense. For every tit, a tat. And so it goes, on and on.\n\nThen, below each post, are dozens of comments arguing points we\u2019ve all heard before, citing news articles we\u2019ve all seen before, quoting the same academics and politicians again and again in circles until the two parties either realize their efforts are futile or develop carpal tunnel.\n\nWhat was once a pleasant jaunt through Facebook is now enough to leave anyone feeling completely bipolar. The only way I know how to respond is: Enough. Or, as Arabs and Israelis would say: Khalas!\n\nIf world leaders will not see our posts and they will not actually have a direct impact on the conflict at hand, then we must ask ourselves: Whom and what are they for?\n\nRaising awareness? Sparking discussion? Perhaps. And \u2014 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m a firm believer in the power of discourse and debate. But social media is not a constructive forum for exchanging complex ideologies.\n\nFor starters, although some \u201cposters\u201d do have ties to the conflict or, at least, enough knowledge to formulate an educated opinion on it, many do not. To them, this is an opportunity to get in with a certain crowd or show off their aptitude for social issues. It\u2019s all too easy when you can hide behind a screen from the safety of your own home, using Google instead of brain power. Meanwhile, \u201cin a far off land,\u201d very real people are dying. Social media is a place where we treat tragedy as a \u201ctrending topic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "My feed is flooded from both sides.
