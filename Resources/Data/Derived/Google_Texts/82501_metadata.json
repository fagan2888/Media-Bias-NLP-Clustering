So the family put up a sign asking the thief to bring the statue back.\n\nThe theft likely happened Friday night or Saturday morning, Pat Mierzejewski said.\n\n\"It meant a lot to us, maybe not to somebody else, but to us,\u201d Mierzejewski said.\n\nThe 4-foot statue weighs about 300 pounds. Tracks on the ground seem to indicate that the suspects rolled the statue to the curb before leaving with it, according to the Mierzejewski family.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only statue that\u2019s disappeared. Leonard Mierzejewski\u2019s statue of St. Francis next door was stolen in the same time frame.\n\n\u201cThe world today I don't know the people we got around today, they'll take anything. It's a shame,\u201d he said.\n\nPat Mierzejewski filed a complaint with Meriden police, but officers have not made an arrest at this time.\n\n\u201cI would just like whoever took it to either return it or have them get caught,\u201d she said.\n\nLeonard Mierzejewski hopes the culprits are caught.\n\n\u201cGive them a fine and put them in jail for a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nWith two religious statues missing, two owners are praying for justice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Meriden residents reported that their Virgin Mary and St. Francis statues were stolen over the weekend.", "title": "Meriden Residents Pray for Justice After Religious Statue Thefts", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Connecticut", "description": "Two Meriden residents reported that their Virgin Mary and St. Francis statues were stolen over the weekend.", "title": "Owners of Stolen Religious Statues Pray for Justice", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Meriden-Residents-Pray-for-Justice-After-Religious-Statue-Thefts-259878211.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*800/statue+still.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Meriden residents reported that their Virgin Mary and St. Francis statues were stolen over the weekend.", "title": "Owners of Stolen Religious Statues Pray for Justice", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Meriden-Residents-Pray-for-Justice-After-Religious-Statue-Thefts-259878211.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*800/statue+still.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcconnecticut", "site": "@nbcconnecticut", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 81242742459}, "keywords": "Virgin Mary, Saint Francis, Meriden, statue thefts", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCConnecticut"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Virgin Mary, Saint Francis, Meriden, statue thefts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1deb\"", "article_summary": "Two Meriden residents reported to police that their Virgin Mary and St. Francis statues were stolen over the weekend.\nA Virgin Mary statue has stood in a Meriden family's front yard for 50 years, a wedding gift to Pat Mierzejewski and her late husband, Robert.\nPat Mierzejewski filed a complaint with Meriden police, but officers have not made an arrest at this time.\nThe theft likely happened Friday night or Saturday morning, Pat Mierzejewski said.\nBut when Pat was leaving her home over the weekend, she noticed the statue no longer was there."}
