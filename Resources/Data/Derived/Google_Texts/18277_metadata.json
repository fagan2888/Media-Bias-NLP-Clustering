Republicans may be vociferously challenged by conservatives to hold the line against any fix to subsidies that doesn\u2019t also actively seek to destroy the whole Affordable Care Act, potentially dividing the GOP over its response to such a ruling.\n\nIn a piece entitled \u201c25 questions the Koch brothers want every 2016 candidate to answer,\u201d the Post\u2019s James Hohmann scoops that the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the funding arm of the Koch brothers\u2019 political network, has distributed a questionnaire to all the presidential candidates. Note this question:\n\nQuestion #7: If repealed by the Supreme Court, would you support extending federal subsidies for health insurance in states without exchanges, even if it would extend individual and employer mandates?\n\nPresuming the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer is No, this would appear to mean any fix to subsidies is a non-starter unless it repeals the individual mandate. House Republicans have signaled they will offer a temporary extension of the subsidies that also repeals the mandate (and indeed repeals all of Obamacare in 2017), to punt the political fallout from the vanishing of subsidies until after the election, while clearing the decks so Republicans can offer their own comprehensive health reform plan for the 2016 election. But repealing the mandate would severely undermine the law everywhere (and of course the GOP plan repeals Obamacare entirely in two years), making it a non-starter for President Obama and Democrats.\n\nRepublicans are offering this plan to draw a veto, in hopes of blaming Obama for the failure to extend subsidies. They will pair that argument with the claim that the law itself is at fault for all those millions of people losing them. The GOP argument is basically this: Obamacare is to blame for the awful outcome of millions of people losing Obamacare, so Republicans will protect all those people from Obamacare by temporarily restoring their Obamacare, before repealing it entirely for all its beneficiaries, and replacing it with \u2026 \u201coh, wow, look over there, a unicorn is wandering through the Capitol!\u201d\n\nThis story-line is deeply incoherent and may prove a tough sell politically. More moderate Republicans may want to offer a real fix, or enter into negotiations over a solution in which both sides make genuine, workable concessions. But the above questionnaire suggests conservatives will demand the GOP do no such thing. (Another possibility: even if the Court upholds the subsidies by deferring to the administration\u2019s discretion in interpreting the ACA, conservatives could demand that GOP candidates pledge to use that discretion as president to cancel them.)\n\nPresumably the 2012 GOP hopefuls will find it hard to support any subsidies fix that doesn\u2019t also hold out the promise of destroying the law. But Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio come from Florida, where 1.3 million people stand to lose subsidies. The situation in Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin also threatens to get very messy. And lots of those who will get hurt are concentrated in the presidential battlegrounds. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has signaled she will go on offense against Republicans by demanding a simple fix to the problem.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\n* OBAMA TRADE AGENDA SET TO MOVE FORWARD? The Hill has the latest: Mitch McConnell is set to hold a Senate vote on the Fast Track bill the House passed yesterday, and then one on the Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers that Dems want. But the bloc of pro-trade Dems, which is worried that if they pass Fast Track, TAA won\u2019t end up happening later, is holding out for concessions from McConnell, such as a vote reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n\nMcConnell is not inclined to make concessions. It\u2019s looking as if pro-trade Senate Dems may back Fast Track and hoping GOP leaders make good on their vow to move worker assistance later.\n\n* HILLARY TURNS UP HEAT ON TRADE: In a new interview, Hillary Clinton says that Fast Track is a non-starter unless it is also paired with TAA worker assistance:\n\n\u201cI certainly would not vote for it unless I was absolutely confident that we would get Trade Adjustment Assistance.\u201d\n\nObama has said he wants to sign both Fast Track and TAA, but he hasn\u2019t said explicitly that he won\u2019t sign the former without the latter. Meanwhile, Clinton has still left wiggle room to support Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership later.\n\n* IRAN DEAL NEAR? Reuters quotes western officials claiming that negotiators are \u201cincreasingly likely to clinch\u201d a deal curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran negotiators reportedly have indicated that they will allow inspectors more access to the program than they\u2019ve publicly admitted. But there are still major sticking points around the specificity to be permitted around technical limits on Iran\u2019s future nuclear work.\n\nA deal may not be secured by the June 30th deadline. But still, the big picture is that both sides badly want to reach one.\n\n* COURT DECISION AGAINST ACA WILL HIT BATTLEGROUND STATES: Roll Call\u2019s David Hawkings sheds still more light on this important point:\n\nThe biggest population affected would be in Florida, where 1 in 12 people younger than 65, or 1.3 million, are now getting federal help. The same is true for 3 percent or more of the adults in the likely presidential swing states of Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The final four states on that roster also have GOP senators anticipating competitive re-election contests. Altogether, 22 of the 24 Senate seats the GOP is defending next year are in states relying on the federal exchanges.\n\nAs Hawkings dryly notes, the GOP is \u201cnot quite ready for the health care victory its dreamed about.\u201d\n\n* SHOOTING SUSPECT \u2018FLEW FLAGS OF WHITE POWER': The New York Times takes a deep look into Dylann Storm Roof\u2019s background, talking to friends who say he had begun to employ increasingly racist and violent rhetoric:\n\nOfficials said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime. Although it was not clear if Mr. Roof had actually joined any organized white supremacist groups, people who knew him said that in recent months, a young man they described as extremely shy had begun to harbor racist views and make increasingly violent statements about attacking black people.\n\nMeanwhile, Roof\u2019s uncle says that if he receives the death penalty, he would \u201cpush the button myself.\u201d\n\n* HEADLINE OF THE DAY, ADVENTURES-IN-IMAGE-MANAGEMENT EDITION: \u201cWhite Supremacists Worried Charleston Shooting Makes Them Look Bad.\u201d\n\n* AND JEB EMBRACES \u2018VOODOO ECONOMICS': Paul Krugman takes apart Jeb Bush\u2019s promise to get growth up to four percent, the latest in a long line of GOP claims to possession of the secret growth formula. The actual history:\n\nThe next time you encounter some conservative going on about growth, you might want to bring up the following list of names and numbers: Bill Clinton, 3.7; Ronald Reagan, 3.4; Barack Obama, 2.1; George H.W. Bush, 2.0; George W. Bush, 1.6. Yes, that\u2019s the last five presidents \u2014 and the average rate of growth of the U.S. economy during their time in office (so far, in Mr. Obama\u2019s case). Obviously, the raw numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, but surely there\u2019s nothing in that list to suggest that conservatives possess some kind of miracle cure for economic sluggishness.\n\nBut but but Awesome Rocket-Fueled Reagan Recovery! Also, as Krugman notes, all signs are that Jeb is embracing \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d an epithet coined by none other than his father.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Koch group asks: Will the 2016 GOPers pledge not to extend subsidies if the Court guts them?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A Koch group asks: Will the 2016 GOPers pledge not to extend subsidies if the Court guts them?", "title": "Morning Plum: Koch brothers pose tough conservative litmus test to 2016 GOP hopefuls", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/19/morning-plum-koch-brothers-pose-tough-conservative-litmus-test-to-2016-gop-hopefuls/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2014/03/Forbeswealthy_4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/19/morning-plum-koch-brothers-pose-tough-conservative-litmus-test-to-2016-gop-hopefuls/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles koch, charles and david koch, koch brothers, 2016 gop presidential candidates, dylann storm roof, jeb bush, marco rubio,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "charles koch, charles and david koch, koch brothers, 2016 gop presidential candidates, dylann storm roof, jeb bush, marco rubio,"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Clinton has still left wiggle room to support Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership later.\nPresumably the 2012 GOP hopefuls will find it hard to support any subsidies fix that doesn\u2019t also hold out the promise of destroying the law.\nIt\u2019s looking as if pro-trade Senate Dems may back Fast Track and hoping GOP leaders make good on their vow to move worker assistance later.\nRepublicans are offering this plan to draw a veto, in hopes of blaming Obama for the failure to extend subsidies.\nPresuming the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer is No, this would appear to mean any fix to subsidies is a non-starter unless it repeals the individual mandate."}
