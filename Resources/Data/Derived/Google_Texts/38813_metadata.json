Its 2013 population estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau is 100,223 \u2014 a 3.4 percent increase from the city\u2019s population in 2010.\n\nTexas State Demographer Lloyd Potter said he believes Tyler\u2019s growth has been a fairly healthy, natural increase, part of it due to migration.\n\nPearland, Lewisville and College Station also exceeded 100,000 in population last year, U.S. Census data shows. Between the 2010 Census and the 2013 estimate, Lewisville grew 6.1 percent, College Station grew 6.6 percent and Pearland grew 9.7 percent.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Census Bureau just recently acknowledged that Tyler\u2019s population has exceeded 100,000, a 2005 estimate from an independent study indicated that Tyler had already reached that milestone, and Tyler was able to move its extraterritorial jurisdiction from three miles to five miles, said Tom Mullins, president and CEO of the Tyler Economic Development Council.\n\nAnd the Texas State Data Center estimated Tyler reached the 100,000 milestone in 2012, said Dr. Lila Valencia, researcher and Legislative liaison for the Office of the State Demographer, adding that it is not uncommon to have differences in estimates between the data center and the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2010 U.S. Census number \u2014 96,900 \u2014 is on Tyler population signs, which are changed every 10 years.\n\nStill, Mullins said, the most widely used and most official number is the U.S. Census estimate, and reaching more than 100,000 is \u201cgood news for Tyler.\u201d\n\nTyler Area Chamber of Commerce Chief Operating Officer Henry Bell said the U.S. Census population estimate makes the milestone official and \u201copens all kinds of other doors.\u201d\n\nFor instance, there are retailers that won\u2019t look at doing business in an area until it has at least 100,000 people, Bell said.\n\nHe said the population milestone also could spark interest from other types of businesses wanting to come to Tyler, and some people might not move somewhere unless the population is more than 100,000.\n\nThe milestone is even advertised in the newest edition of the Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce magazine. The advertisement boasts Tyler has more than 100,000 residents and a daytime population that reaches 250,000.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s official, it\u2019s kind of a neat deal,\u201d Bell said.\n\nMullins echoed Bell, saying that the milestone is important because many companies making investments will have population thresholds in the formula they use to decide where to locate.\n\nSo, he said, hitting that 100,000 mark is important for companies, particularly when comparing markets, and could prompt a company to start looking at Tyler instead of going on to the next city.\n\nHe said the city also is growing consistently in various economic sectors without depending on any one factor, and that helps bring new growth to the community.\n\nThe most obvious example he gave is The Village at Cumberland Park retail development.\n\nAdditionally, the population growth \u2014 some of which has come from annexation of smaller population centers around Tyler \u2014 also provides more job opportunities for young people and employment opportunities for people in the region who want to stay in this area, Mullins said.\n\nAside from the U.S. Census, the city of Tyler does its own independent population projections, said Heather Nick, planning director for the city.\n\n\u201cWe just want to know where we\u2019re at,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to plan for the future from a planning perspective. You want to know, \u2018What does my community look like?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she said the U.S. Census data does impact city funding because population affects areas such as transportation and public health.\n\nMs. Nick said the Census helps Tyler determine transportation needs and assess questions like, \u201cDo we need to build more roads?\u201d and \u201cWhat kind of public transit needs do we have?\u201d\n\nShe noted that the 2010 data showed that Tyler\u2019s median age at that time was 33 and that almost one-third of households in Tyler were single-person households in 2010.\n\nAnd as the city analyzes population, those are the kinds of things that must be considered because the city is trying to make smart growth decisions, and certain data helps answer questions like, \u201cIs it aging?\u201d and \u201cDo we have the right type of facilities for our population?\u201d Ms. Nick said.\n\nShe said planners nationwide have noticed that there are now more older Americans, with a longer life expectancy, than there once were, and in the future, more cultural diversity is expected.\n\nSo the question, she said, is, \u201cHow do you prepare for that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s about making informed decisions about growth, making sure we meet the needs of our community, whether for transportation, public health, education, and/or making sure we have adequate housing units and that we also have the commercial aspect of that to support the community,\u201d Ms. Nick said.\n\nMs. Nick said she believes as people are looking to move to the community, they look at population and other statistics.\n\nLuckily, she said, the city\u2019s seen an increase in residential unit activity \u2014 not just with single-family homes but also an increase in multi- family development \u2014 in order to support the growing population.\n\nShe said the city\u2019s also seeing more commercial services and retail, which helps a growing community.\n\nAdditionally, she said, when the federal government is looking at allocating money, population is one thing that\u2019s considered.\n\nFrom a tourism perspective, Tyler reaching a population number of more than 100,000 would have a \u201ctrickle-down effect\u201d from those who are considering the city for new business, said Shari Rickman, general manager and vice president for the Tyler Convention and Visitors Bureau. Crossing that threshold, there are likely a lot of potential candidates that look at the city, she said, and Tyler\u2019s quality of life and guest experience come into play.\n\nFor instance, if the person notices the city has a lot to view and see when it comes to arts and culture and attractions, and that person has a nice hotel stay, then they feel like they aren\u2019t in \u201cSmall Town, USA\u201d but rather a small town with big city amenities, Ms. Rickman said.\n\nShe cited things, such as the planetarium and science center at Tyler Junior College, the American Freedom Museum at The Brook Hill School and recent upgrades that were made at Brookshire\u2019s World of Wildlife and Country Store as examples.\n\n\u201cWe offer a good answer to whatever people are interested in,\u201d whether it\u2019s riding a bike or seeing a performance at The University of Texas at Tyler\u2019s R. Don Cowan Fine and Performing Arts Center, she said.\n\nShe said tourism overall is not driven by any magic population number but rather \u201cWhat do you have that\u2019s of interest to me?\u201d\n\nStill, she said, a population of more than 100,000 sounds different than a number under 100,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a round number, more raising an eyebrow of, \u2018Wow, we didn\u2019t know they were that big.\u2019\u2026 It gets people\u2019s attention,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "A recent population milestone could help bring additional businesses to Tyler and draw more peop...", "title": "Census numbers put Tyler over 100,000 - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/202400/census-numbers-put-tyler-over-100000", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-5QdHS92/0/L/i-5QdHS92-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b57\"", "article_summary": "The 2010 U.S. Census number \u2014 96,900 \u2014 is on Tyler population signs, which are changed every 10 years.\nPearland, Lewisville and College Station also exceeded 100,000 in population last year, U.S. Census data shows.\nAccording to U.S. Census estimates released in May, Tyler has officially reached a population of more than 100,000.\nA recent population milestone could help bring additional businesses to Tyler and draw more people to the area, community leaders said.\nAside from the U.S. Census, the city of Tyler does its own independent population projections, said Heather Nick, planning director for the city."}
