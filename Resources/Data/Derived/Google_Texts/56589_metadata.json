I'm not trying to mix the two. I'm trying to give you a nice meal before you go home. If you choose to have an alcoholic beverage and go home, that's on you. It's no different than them leaving here and going to Outback,\" owner Ron Perkinson said.\n\nVolusia Top Gun will have a restaurant and gun range, separated by a retail space. And now, they'll also sell alcohol.\n\nInitially, the planning board balked at the idea of selling booze where there's a firing range.\n\n\"I didn't think it was that big of a deal because I knew how safe it was,\" Perkinson said. \"When it got shot down, I realized I needed to bring more to the table to show them how this business runs.\"\n\nAnd Wednesday night, Perkinson reassured city commissioners with a few safety rules:\n\nA computer system will track who has been drinking.\n\nIf you drink, you can't shoot for the rest of the day.\n\nIf anyone in your group drinks, none can shoot.\n\n\"I firmly believe it will be safer than any restaurant in Florida,\" Perkinson said.\n\nHe said he plans to have his business up and running the second week of November.\n\nStory courtesy WKMG/clickorlando.com.\n\nCopyright 2015 by ClickOrlando.com.
