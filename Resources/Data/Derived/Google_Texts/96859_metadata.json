How had they neglected to inform her that this was the secret to surviving a Minnesota winter?\n\nUm, maybe because they\u2019re from here?\n\nThanks to Wang, recent transplants and those who\u2019ve returned to St. Paul will get a uniquely warm welcome this week.\n\nWang is founder of St. Paul Hello (stphello.com), a partnership of businesses, nonprofits and individuals eager to connect St. Paul\u2019s newcomers so that they\u2019ll stick around.\n\nWelcome Hat What: Icebreaker to welcome newcomers to St. Paul with music, food and free winter hats handed out by local folks. When: 5-8 p.m. Oct. 6, Nov. 10, Dec. 1 and Jan. 5. Where: Minnesota History Center, 345 W. Kellogg Blvd., St. Paul. Tickets: Free, but registration required. More info: stphello.com.\n\n\u201cAs we think about the vibrancy of a place, we are really good at attracting young professionals, but not good at retaining them,\u201d Wang said, \u201cand even worse at retaining young professionals of color. Many who stay never quite feel as if they\u2019re part of this community.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Wang\u2019s nascent organization is presenting its inaugural Welcome Hat event Tuesday from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Minnesota History Center. No Dumbledore sightings are expected, and nobody gets a key to the city. But everybody gets an iconic winter hat with flaps, handed out by the likes of Paul Bunyan, St. Paul Saints pig mascot Mudonna, St. Paul City Council President Russ Stark, Ramsey County Commissioner Toni Carter \u201cand some of those cute guys from Minnesota United FC.\u201d\n\nQuite the icebreaker.\n\nThe event\u2019s levity, though, underscores a heftier mission, one that Noel Nix, a 33-year-old aide to Commissioner Carter, understands well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made friends with people who come, and then they go because they don\u2019t necessarily feel they\u2019re making connections that make this place feel like home,\u201d said Nix, who is African-American. He moved from Flint, Mich., to the Twin Cities to study business at the University of Minnesota, later meeting Wang through his community work.\n\nDespite marrying a Minnesota woman with extended family here, he said, \u201cI can very much relate to folks who move here for professional reasons and wonder, \u2018How do I connect?\u2019 \u201d\n\nConnective resources\n\nAlong with local music and light food, Tuesday\u2019s event will showcase the city\u2019s connective resources \u2014 everything from the St. Paul Neighborhood Network to Rondo Avenue Inc. to the Growler magazine \u2014 with representatives on hand to answer questions, and maybe ask a few, too.\n\n\u201cOur region is coming to grips with the fact that it matters that this is a welcoming place for newcomers,\u201d said Peter Frosch, vice president for strategic partnership at Greater MSP. The Twin Cities area economic development partnership has launched the Make It. MSP. initiative, a consortium of more than 70 organizations focused on attracting a talented workforce.\n\nWhy do people move to the Twin Cities or return here? Frosch wonders. What\u2019s key to making them stay? What might push them away? What is most perplexing to newcomers about the culture here?\n\n\u201cWe need to learn what we don\u2019t know by reaching out directly to newcomers,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have data. We\u2019re going out to create the data.\u201d\n\nFriends from childhood\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that most \u201cnot from here\u201d folks (including yours truly) do not believe there\u2019s anything intentionally unkind in the lack of inclusion. It\u2019s more the reality of this highly unusual state of mind in which friendships forged in childhood remain strong into adulthood, few people move away (or, if they do, they return with a spouse) and growing families leave little space at the Thanksgiving table.\n\nAdd to that a distinct Scandinavian reserve, which led Wang to wonder early on if something was wrong with her.\n\n\u201cThe first year, I thought, \u2018Maybe I have B.O.?\u2019 \u201d Wang said with a laugh, reflecting on a lack of social invitations, despite being married to a Minnesotan. \u201cMaybe I seem desperate?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s come a long way since, digging into work for Springboard for the Arts and many other organizations.\n\nNice Breaker gatherings\n\nWith financial support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Wang is launching St. Paul Hello with a plan for monthly Welcome Hat events and Nice Breaker gatherings, ranging from pub crawls to gardening classes. The first Nice Breaker is a Saturday tour along the Green Line.\n\nWang is among many transplants who\u2019ve learned a secret about the Twin Cities: Stick around and get involved, and you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many other regions with this abundance of cultural options, top restaurants, philanthropy, beautiful neighborhoods and fine schools.\n\nMike Reynolds, a Hamline University English professor, expected nothing more than \u201cthe cold and Jesse Ventura\u201d when he moved here in 2001. He was struck by the vibrant arts scene.\n\n\u201cHere, every street corner seems to have a cultural venue. The reading scene is amazing. The restaurant scene has blown up. And I\u2019ve never experienced anything like the political engagement,\u201d said Reynolds, whose wife also teaches at Hamline.\n\n\u201cWe really like St. Paul.\u201d\n\nWang really likes to hear that. It would warm her heart to hear others say the same \u2014 soon after arriving.\n\n\u201cI hope people don\u2019t say, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Joe and I\u2019ve only been here for 15 years,\u2019 \u201d Wang said. \u201cI hope people feel welcome right away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to Jun-Li Wang, recent transplants and those who've returned to St. Paul will get a uniquely warm welcome this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Thanks to Jun-Li Wang, recent transplants and those who've returned to St. Paul will get a uniquely warm welcome this week.", "title": "New to St. Paul?
