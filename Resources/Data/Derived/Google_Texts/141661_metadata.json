Schneider, the pediatric dentist who faced allegations of mistreatment of pediatric patients, was arrested Monday afternoon, charged with 11 counts of Medicaid fraud.\n\nAccording to jail records, 78-year-old Schneider was booked into the Duval County jail shortly before 4 p.m. on 11 counts of unauthorized Medicaid claims. He was being held on $110,000 bond pending a hearing that likely would take place Tuesday morning.\n\nAttorney John Phillips, who represents some of Schneider's former patients, said his office will hold a news conference at 5:30 p.m.\n\nNews4Jax also obtained a court document that said Schneider cannot afford to pay his attorney's fees for the case involving the new Medicaid fraud charges.\n\nHe filed a motion for temporary support to pay his attorney's fees.\n\nThe motion said this matter is an emergency since Schneider will be incarcerated until he can make bond.\n\nSince April, hundreds of parents have claimed Schneider abused their kids as they sat in his dentist chair. They also claim he performed unnecessary dental procedures for the purpose of ripping off Medicaid.\n\nEarlier this year, News4Jax reviewed state records and found that Schneider received $3.9 million in Medicaid reimbursements over the past five years,\n\nAccording to the Agency for Health Care Administration, Schneider\u2019s fee-for-service reimbursements in both 2012 and 2013 were over $1 million.\n\nSchneider eventually closed his Arlington office and relinquished his license to practice in both Florida and Georgia.\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com.
