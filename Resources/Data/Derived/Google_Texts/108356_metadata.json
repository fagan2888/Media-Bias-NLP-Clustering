I have faithfully adhered to the old notion that Trump\u2019s orbit would degrade and when it slowed enough the combination of friction and gravity would bring him down to earth in a fiery orange blaze.\n\nClearly, I have been wrong, really wrong, amazingly wrong. However, though wrong, I have not been lonely. Virtually all serious newsies have kept me company. Our \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d has proved to be the oxymoron that \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d usually is.\n\nI have been in denial\u2013and I remain in denial. I have no theory that gives Trump more than a majority of Evangelical voters. It\u2019s damn liberal of them to back a libertine. I have no theory to deal with rock-ribbed conservatives, the so-called, \u201cMovement conservatives,\u201d voting for Trump\u2013who is many things but conservative is not one of them.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a strange year when Trump, who was a life-long Democrat until recently and Bernie, who still isn\u2019t a Democrat, are where they are. It\u2019s a stern rebuke to the party professionals that so many, both liberals and conservatives, feel angry and alienated.\n\nIt\u2019s both a strange year, and a stern rebuke to our party system, when the two most likely nominees, Hillary and Trump, are the least liked, and will enter their cage match with higher unfavorable ratings than favorable. Both have core supporters, but their common task will be to motivate those lukewarm to come out and vote for them. How will Hillary get Bernie\u2019s true-believers to vote for her? How will Trump get ethnic and religious minorities, women and principled conservatives to come out?\n\nTheir common tactic will be fear. Underlying their mutual attacks on each others character and honesty, will be the issue of the Supreme Court. It is true that the Supreme Court nominations are consequential. The next president will likely get three picks\u2013including the currently vacant Scalia seat.\n\nHillary will claim, with reason, that Trump\u2019s Justices would reverse Roe v Wade, fatally wound ObamaCare and eliminate environmental regulations. Trump will claim, with some reason, that Hillary\u2019s Justices will revisit Citizens United, all campaign finance laws and find in favor of stricter gun regulations.\n\nI hesitate to predict anything about this election cycle, having been so consistently wrong, but I figure with a record like mine, I\u2019m due to be right. I mean the law of averages is on my side. So here it is (and it feels so safe as to be self evident): In terms of dirt and name calling, we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. The name calling will get worse. Trump will not hesitate to pillory Hillary with sins of omission and commission\u2013not to mention Bill with his sins of emission. \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d is from the kinder and more disciplined Trump. Hillary\u2019s surrogates, more than Hillary herself, don\u2019t really need to manufacture anything to smear Trump. It\u2019s out there and most of it is true. The problem is that it\u2019s largely already known and hasn\u2019t damaged him yet. Not even with religious conservatives.\n\nI thought that Trump was a joke and so naturally, I laughed. I\u2019m not laughing now. Paradoxically now that I realize the true gravity of the situation, gravity itself has been rescinded.\n\n\u00a92016 Jonathan Dobrer\n\nwww.Dobrer.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @jondobrer", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blogs.dailynews.com/friendlyfire/2016/04/26/trumped-trump-again/", "site_name": "Friendly Fire", "type": "article", "title": "Trumped by Trump\u2026Again"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "Trump", "published_time": "2016-04-26", "modified_time": "2016-04-26", "author": "http://blogs.dailynews.com/friendlyfire/author/jonathan-dobrer/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Our \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d has proved to be the oxymoron that \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d usually is.\nParadoxically now that I realize the true gravity of the situation, gravity itself has been rescinded.\nClearly, I have been wrong, really wrong, amazingly wrong.\nBoth have core supporters, but their common task will be to motivate those lukewarm to come out and vote for them.\nTrump will not hesitate to pillory Hillary with sins of omission and commission\u2013not to mention Bill with his sins of emission."}
