Former American Idol star Clay Aiken is considering a run against North Carolina Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers — and Ellmers has some harsh words for him.

“Apparently his performing career is not going so well. He’s very bored,” the congresswoman told WMAL’s Mornings on the Mall radio program.

She slammed his track record of losing competitions, including “American Idol”: “He didn’t fair all that well. He was runner-up.”

“Let me just get this clear,” WMAL host Larry O’Connor said. “You are saying Clay Aiken couldn’t even win American Idol and his career is in the toilet so that’s why he is now desperately trying to get to Congress?”

Ellmers chimed in: “You can throw in there that he didn’t win on Celebrity Apprentice. I guess the next step is Congress. You know we don’t have a very high approval rating so the bar has been lowered for him.”

“Could you remind to never run against Renee Ellmers?” WMAL co-host Brian Wilson quipped after her second slammed Aiken.

Ellmers is a tea party Republican and former nurse who was inspired to fight Obamacare by running for Congress in 2010.

The openly gay singer Aiken has spoken out against Amendment One, North Carolina’s anti-gay marriage amendment. The filing deadline to participate in the North Carolina primary is Feb. 28.
