A video memorial that featured a rock version of \u201cRing of Fire\u201d as well as \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d moved a young girl in the back to dance, and even Aretxuloeta tapped along in her black heels.\n\nHer son and his girlfriend, Wiyanna Nelson, were driving home late Sept. 11 with two friends as rain was pounding down. A mudslide appears to have stopped their car. When Wiyanna stepped out, she was swept away in the water. Wesley got out to try to save her. Their two friends survived.\n\nA week and a half later, the state bears reminders of the disastrous flooding. But Saturday, above the plaza at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the sun hid behind soft clouds and a quiet was interrupted only by spoken memories of the young couple.\n\nAlthough the two had been together less than a year, they were remembered Saturday as a pair \u2014 each free spirit complementing the other.\n\nBoth were described as fearless.\n\nWesley went through adventures in \u201csubzero temperatures\u201d and hunted for the mythical Chupacabra in New Mexico.\n\nWiyanna was fearless in her determination and in speaking her mind.\n\n\u201cFrom even her earliest moments on her first day of kindergarten, when the class was asked what they were most looking forward to learning and Wiyanna answered, \u2018I want to cut with scissors,\u2019 \u201d said Lizzy Schleuning during her eulogy.\n\nWesley loved leather jackets and Cap\u2019n Crunch shakes. He recently spent all night playing Dance Dance Revolution with friends, moving to Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s \u201cCall Me Maybe.\u201d\n\nWesley and Wiyanna were writers. Two poems, one written by each, were recited at the service.\n\nWesley\u2019s poem, \u201cSafe,\u201d spoke of a new day bringing peace. Wiyanna\u2019s poem expressed her determination to stay positive and her gratitude for her life.\n\n\u201cI aspire to believe in life and living through the things I have lost throughout my existence, in gaining perspective through them, in remaining positive because life really is too short to look at the glass half empty,\u201d her poem read.\n\nOne friend who spoke during an open-microphone invitation said he remembers Wiyanna in their most fun moments as she would run after him trying to give the reluctant friend a hug.\n\n\u201cShe would just chase me outside Wesley\u2019s house for, like, 20 minutes,\u201d said the friend, Jason. \u201cIt was the greatest times I ever had with Wiyanna.\u201d\n\nFamily and friends said the couple will be remembered in the words they crafted, in videos Wesley produced and in the memories they left for their loved ones.\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boulder flood victim couple remembered together", "title": "Boulder flood victim couple remembered together", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/boulder-flood-victim-couple-remembered-together/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_A1_CD13FLOODVICTIMSp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130914_A1_CD13FLOODVICTIMSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T18:41:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:49:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc31d\"", "article_summary": "He recently spent all night playing Dance Dance Revolution with friends, moving to Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s \u201cCall Me Maybe.\u201dWesley and Wiyanna were writers.\nHer son and his girlfriend, Wiyanna Nelson, were driving home late Sept. 11 with two friends as rain was pounding down.\nAlthough the two had been together less than a year, they were remembered Saturday as a pair \u2014 each free spirit complementing the other.\nBOULDER \u2014 Overlooking the Flatirons and the foothills, family and friends gathered Saturday at an outdoor plaza to remember two 19-year-olds who died when floodwaters swept them away.\n\u201cShe would just chase me outside Wesley\u2019s house for, like, 20 minutes,\u201d said the friend, Jason."}
