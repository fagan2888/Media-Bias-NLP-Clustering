(Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo\n\nNurse. Lawyer. Mother of three.\n\nJulie Sheppard has held many titles. Recently, she added one more: small business owner.\n\nThe 45-year-old is the founder and president of First Healthcare Compliance (FHC), a tech company based in Greenville that specializes in helping doctors, nursing homes and medical billing companies meet stiffer rules and regulations imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in what the government expects providers to track and know, and what the providers know they should be tracking,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make life a little easier for those providers by helping them to make sure they're meeting all those requirements.\u201d\n\nDemand for First Healthcare Compliance\u2019s services is evident by the growth the company has experienced since its 2013 launch.\n\nSales jumped 300 percent in just the last year and the company has expanded its customer base to hundreds of clients in more than 25 states.\n\nSheppard said she now expects FHC to double the size of its 15-person workforce by 2017, mostly by beefing up its sales staff.\n\n\u201cRight now, for example, we\u2019re signed up to attend 16 trade shows this year that are just focused on the private practice market,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal is to expand our attention to more long-term care facilities, billing companies and, especially, the small, rural hospitals that seem to need us the most.\u201d\n\nFHC\u2019s main product is a customizable, online platform where customers can track and verify whether their staff is meeting a wide range of regulatory requirements.\n\nThat includes mandates designed to protect patient information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA; safety and facility standards mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA; and rules meant to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse related to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cA lot of these things have been around for years, but the audits and enforcement were really stepped up under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThe days of getting a paper set of policies and procedures and putting them on the shelf are over.\u201d\n\nIn addition to helping healthcare providers avoid fines and mitigate risk, FHC\u2019s platform also helps keep track of other obligations, such as mandatory orientation for new employees, continuing education and professional licensing requirements.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a really large group spread out across multiple locations, it gives the compliance officer or the supervisor real-time insight into what\u2019s happening at each location,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThat\u2019s important because they bear responsibility for all of that.\u201d\n\nThe company also provides around-the-clock support for clients with routine questions and sudden emergencies, along with video seminars that can be used to ensure annual training requirements are being met.\n\nTotal Care Physicians, a primary care medical group with more than 50 employees at three locations in New Castle County, was among FHC\u2019s first clients in Delaware.\n\nMichael Wolf, the practice\u2019s administrative assistant, said FHC\u2019s platform has proven to be invaluable.\n\n\u201cBefore, keeping track of all this information fell to the individual office manager,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try to stay compliant, but your main focus is on providing medical care and there a lot of things going on in the day-to-day operations that can make doing both difficult.\u201d\n\nFHC\u2019s platform, he said, does most of the compliance work for the medical group.\n\n\u201cWhen you log on, you get a list of employees and a breakdown of who meets what requirement, from who can deal directly with patients to who is up to date on their Hepatitis B shots,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other tools on the market that are that comprehensive.\u201d\n\nJulie Sheppard, is the founder and president of First Healthcare Compliance, a consulting company that assists healthcare providers, billing companies and nursing facilities comply with the Affordable Care Act. (Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNA)\n\nSheppard said it was her background in both law and nursing that helped her anticipate the need for a product capable of addressing a broad range of compliance demands.\n\nA native of Wheeling, West Virginia, Sheppard earned a nursing degree at Clemson University. It was there that she also met her husband Will, now an ear, nose and throat doctor in Wilmington.\n\nSheppard worked in the field for about five years while Will attended medical school. Following a stint as a full-time homemaker, she earned a law degree from Widener University Law School in 2006.\n\nSheppard passed the bar in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but opted to start her own company rather than secure a position at local law firm.\n\n\u201cMy kids were still young and my husband\u2019s practice was still growing,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought this would be something enjoyable to do part time, which is kind of funny because running a company is a 24/7 job.\u201d\n\nSheppard has received some help in that regard thanks to some key hires.\n\nDr. Jill Brooks, former radiologist at Jennersville Regional Hospital in West Grove, Pennsylvania, serves as FHC\u2019s senior director of education, while Sheba Vine, a former biomedical engineer and attorney who specialized in employment law, joined the company as the senior director of regulatory compliance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely lucky in building our team,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest part of getting your business off the ground. If you don\u2019t have the right people, you aren\u2019t going to go very far.\u201d\n\nFHC\u2019s in-house expertise and ability to address a broad range of compliance demands has helped the company form partnerships with more than a dozen state medical societies, most recently Virginia, Michigan and Mississippi. Those groups refer their members to FHC, which gives those clients a lifetime discount.\n\nSheppard said she\u2019s been pleased with her startup\u2019s rapid expansion, although not necessarily surprised by its success.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory climate in healthcare has changed a lot in recent years and that\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just scratched the surface in terms of markets and products we can offer.\u201d\n\nWhile FHC may have high-growth potential, Sheppard said her goal is to build the startup into an attractive acquisition for a larger company.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of like my fourth child,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it but I\u2019ll have to let it go one day. Then, it will be time to move on to something else.\u201d\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1Mud7Vv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Greenville's First Healthcare Compliance finds at niche at intersection of medicine and law", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Greenville's First Healthcare Compliance finds at niche at intersection of medicine and law", "title": "Obamacare a boon to Greenville business", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/small-business/2016/03/27/obamacare-boon-greenville-business/82265548/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Greenville's First Healthcare Compliance finds at niche at intersection of medicine and law", "title": "Obamacare a boon to Greenville business", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa418bbb620294fa3a252331ae79f42c4fecf5d5/c=343-0-2903-2560&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Wilmington/Wilmington/635926091212481965-030316-WIL-1ST-HEALTHCARE-JC00066.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "First Healthcare Compliance, Julie Sheppard, Affordable Care Act, Greenville Del.,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of these things have been around for years, but the audits and enforcement were really stepped up under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sheppard said.\nTotal Care Physicians, a primary care medical group with more than 50 employees at three locations in New Castle County, was among FHC\u2019s first clients in Delaware.\nThen, it will be time to move on to something else.\u201dContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\nBuy Photo Julie Sheppard, is the founder and president of First Healthcare Compliance, a consulting company that assists healthcare providers, billing companies and nursing facilities comply with the Affordable Care Act.\nFollowing a stint as a full-time homemaker, she earned a law degree from Widener University Law School in 2006."}
