Reed was playing with Woods for the first time Friday at the Hero World Challenge.\n\nSpieth knows all about the fearless nature of Reed because they were partners in the Ryder Cup. That\u2019s why he turned to caddie Michael Greller when he saw Reed and told him, \u201cOf course, Patrick is wearing red and black today.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an act of showmanship. Reed has started wearing the ensembles on Friday every now and then. Considering he was playing with the guy he grew up idolizing, this would be considered a special occasion.\n\n\u201cI know he was excited when we got finished yesterday and he saw he was paired with Tiger,\u201d Spieth said.\n\nReed showed just how much. With three straight birdies, a 29 on the front nine at Isleworth and a 9-under 63, Reed not only beat Woods by seven shots, he moved into contention going into the weekend.\n\nSpieth was at 11-under par and chose to return Saturday morning to finish the rain-delayed second round. He had a two-shot lead over Henrik Stenson, who sputtered at the end of his round in the mud and darkness and shot 68. Reed and Justin Rose (64) were another shot back.\n\nReed became the third player this year to shoot a 63 while playing with Woods.\n\n\u201cI never played with Tiger before, besides a practice round at the British,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt was good to finally be able to play with him, especially in competition. It was a lot of fun. We had a good time. I felt like we enjoyed ourselves out there, and luckily I played well.\u201d\n\nWoods was better than his opening 77, except for a sour ending because of another flubbed chip.\n\nWoods was making progress toward his goal of getting back to even par for the tournament. He hit a 5-iron out of the rough to 4 feet for eagle on the par-5 13th, followed with a flip wedge into 3 feet for birdie on the 14th, and he hit another wedge to 5 feet for birdie on the 16th.\n\nBut after the rain, Woods had mud on his ball in the fairway and could only smile as it sailed left and long of the green. What followed was another bad chip \u2014 that\u2019s six already in two rounds \u2014 that traveled only about 10 feet. He wound up with a double bogey for a 70. He remained in last place, 14 shots behind Spieth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very good,\u201d Woods said of his short game.\n\nThe best golf in the group came from Reed, who wasn\u2019t even sure he would be in the tournament until Jim Furyk withdrew last week. And if there was ever a time to get excited about opening with a 73, this would be the occasion. It meant Reed would be paired with Woods, in the first group out.\n\nReed opened with three straight birdies. He rolled in a 40-foot eagle putt on the seventh, and he went out in 29 after making a 15-foot birdie putt at No. 9.\n\nAfter his 7-foot birdie putt at No. 10, Reed even began \u201cthinking in the 50s,\u201d though that ended quickly. With a sand wedge from the rough, his ball came back off a hill behind the 12th green with so much steam that Reed begged it to \u201chit the microphone.\u201d That would have been the only thing to keep it from rolling into the water, and it missed. He made bogey.\n\nRory McIlroy shot a 63 with Woods in the opening round at Dubai this year (Woods shot 68). Spieth played with Woods at Torrey Pines and shot 63 on the North Course (Woods shot a 71).\n\nWoods is playing for the first time since Aug. 9 at the PGA Championship. He took nearly four months off to strengthen his muscle structure, and during the time away, he hired a new swing coach.\n\nHis swing looks fine. His short game does not.\n\n\u201cHe had a couple of loose shots here and there, but he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWhen was the last time he played a competitive tournament? It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for Spieth or Stenson.\n\nSpieth won by six shots last week in the Australian Open. Stenson won the World Tour Championship in Dubai the week before.\n\nStenson had the lead after his sixth birdie at No. 13. But he make bogey on the 15th and 16th and had to settle for a 68.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not winning anything on Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the races.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Woods is playing for the first time since Aug. 9 at the PGA Championship.
