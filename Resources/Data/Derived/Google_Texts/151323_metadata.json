Paul Ryan's longstanding proposals to convert the Medicare health program for seniors to a system of subsidies for largely private health insurance.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe House of Representatives had included the Medicare reforms in its budget for a fifth straight year, calling for the changes to start in 2024. But the more cautious Senate did not include the proposals, adopting similar savings goals for the program as Obama proposed.\n\nThe Republican budget will nominally maintain statutory \"sequester\" spending caps for the military and domestic federal agencies for the 2016 fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But at the same time it skirts the caps by providing an additional $38 billion in military spending via a special off-budget account for war operations.\n\nThe final language is expected to drop Senate language that would have required such war funding to be offset with other savings.\n\nWhile the budget will help guide the process of crafting spending bills for the next fiscal year, most of it is nonbinding and represents a policy manifesto for Republicans who now control both chambers of Congress.\n\nOnce the budget is passed, the fiscal debate will shift to a separate effort to find other savings or revenue increases to ease the sequester spending constraints that were enacted in a 2011 budget law.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the spending caps, military and domestic agency spending next year would stay flat at about $1 trillion, the same level as a decade ago. This also would make passage of spending bills more difficult, raising the risk of a government shutdown on Oct. 1.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "house-senate budget deal, house senate budget deal, republican budget deal, republicans to cut social spending, republicans to boost military spending, republicans targeting obamacare, social cuts coming", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Republicans reached a compromise deal for the first joint House-Senate budget in six years.", "title": "Republicans Reach Compromise Deal For Budget Plan, Target Obamacare", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/republicans-reach-compromise-deal-budget-plan-target-obamacare-1899093", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/23/2015-04-23t155816z535246987gf10000070206rtrmadp3usa-congress-republicans.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans reached a compromise deal for the first joint House-Senate budget in six years.", "title": "Republicans Reach Compromise Deal For Budget Plan, Target Obamacare", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/republicans-reach-compromise-deal-budget-plan-target-obamacare-1899093", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/23/2015-04-23t155816z535246987gf10000070206rtrmadp3usa-congress-republicans.JPG", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/23/2015-04-23t155816z535246987gf10000070206rtrmadp3usa-congress-republicans.JPG"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-04-27T23:10:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-27T23:10:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Republicans reached a compromise deal for the first joint House-Senate budget in six years."}, "article_summary": "If Congress fails to lift the spending caps, military and domestic agency spending next year would stay flat at about $1 trillion, the same level as a decade ago.\nThe Republican budget will nominally maintain statutory \"sequester\" spending caps for the military and domestic federal agencies for the 2016 fiscal year starting Oct. 1.\n(Reuters) - Republican budget negotiators on Monday reached a compromise deal for the first joint House-Senate budget in six years, one that seeks to boost military spending while calling for deep cuts to social programs to eliminate deficits in a decade.\nBut at the same time it skirts the caps by providing an additional $38 billion in military spending via a special off-budget account for war operations.\nThis also would make passage of spending bills more difficult, raising the risk of a government shutdown on Oct. 1."}
