FRANKLIN, Ind. -- Ted Cruz told a crowd of Hoosiers on Monday that small businesses are the heart of the economy.

Cruz was speaking at a rally in Franklin, Indiana.

He told attendees that, if elected, he would lift federal regulations on companies large and small, including Carrier. He also reiterated his plans to pass a flat tax and to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Touching on an issue at the forefront of the political discussion in Indiana over the past year, Cruz said he wouldn't compromise on religious liberty. He also said the issue of bathroom access for transgender individuals is "basic common sense."

"Our friends in the media seem to think this is a very complicated issue," Cruz said. "So let me help make it a little simpler. If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can't use the girls' restroom."

Cruz visited with supporters in Greenwood, Columbus and Clark County before holding his rally at the Johnson County Fairgrounds.

He was scheduled to continue his campaign in Indiana Tuesday with a rally at the Hoosier Gym in Knightstown at 7 p.m.
