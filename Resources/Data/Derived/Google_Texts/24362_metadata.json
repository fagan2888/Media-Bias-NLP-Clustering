William McNabb III, chairman and chief executive officer of Vanguard, a Valley Forge, Pennsylvania\u2013based global firm that manages $3.5 trillion in investor assets.\n\nMcNabb dismissed the gloomy portrayal of the nation\u2019s economic health in the current presidential campaign and expressed skepticism about some candidates\u2019 promises that their policy proposals would accelerate economic growth from its present rate of about 2 percent to 5 percent or more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re relatively sanguine,\u201d said McNabb. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a lot of recessionary signals. In fact, we\u2019re seeing the opposite.\u201d Vanguard\u2019s forecasts show \u201ccontinued muted growth\u201d for at least the next six months to a year, he said.\n\nThe employment rate has improved enough that the first signs of wage inflation are starting to appear, McNabb said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually getting hard to hire people,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling that as a company.\u201d\n\nEconomic growth is slower than in past recoveries because of reduced borrowing; it\u2019s not a matter of tight money, but rather of caution, he said.\n\nUnlike the last rebound, \u201cthis recovery is very unlevered,\u201d McNabb said. \u201cConsumers have been slow to add leverage to their balance sheets\u201d and instead have focused on paying down existing debt. He estimated that the caution about amassing too much debt\u2014a psychological effect of the 2008 downturn\u2014probably has slowed growth in the gross domestic product by 0.5 to 0.75 percent.\n\nBut in contrast with the aftermath of the downturn, the money for credit is now available if consumers decide to use it. \u201cWe\u2019ve begun to see the mortgage market open up in the past 12 months,\u201d McNabb said. \u201cConsumer credit cards are still available, with more guardrails from users.\u201d\n\nMcNabb also said more-stringent regulations put in place after the downturn, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2010, have slowed growth. But there is a positive tradeoff: \u201cThe market is now safer,\u201d he said.\n\nMcNabb disputed predictions by some analysts that the growing number of baby boom retirees tapping into their retirement portfolios would lead to a downturn in stock prices. With that generation\u2019s increasing longevity, some members will need to rely on their savings for several decades, he said.\n\n\u201cThe only way to make [retirement savings] last is to continue to invest in assets that produce,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to invest in equities.\u201d\n\nThe investment industry needs to pay more attention to developing new products to serve those retirees, McNabb said.\n\nMcNabb joined Vanguard in 1986 and became chief executive in 2008, on the eve of the Wall Street financial meltdown. \u201cI often tease my predecessor, Jack Brennan, that he was the best market timer in history,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike some other financial giants, McNabb and the rest of Vanguard\u2019s leadership decided not to lay off staff during the crisis because they thought it was imperative to maintain the same level of service to maintain clients\u2019 confidence. \u201cA lot of people thought that it would be the end of western capitalism, but we thought we could get out on the other side,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe told our people, \u2018Focus all your energy on the client. Nothing else matters. We\u2019ll worry about the financial side.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was a bet that paid off. Vanguard, which essentially had invented the modern mutual fund marketplace in the mid-1970s, not only survived, but grabbed an even bigger share of the investor market. Since 2009, roughly one of every two dollars invested in mutual funds has gone to Vanguard, McNabb said.\n\nMcNabb predicted that investors\u2019 returns on stock investments will be somewhat lower over the next decade, with inflation-adjusted returns in the 3.5 to 5 percent range. The reason is that so many companies already have high valuations, he said.\n\nBut investors will stay in the equities market, he said, because returns from cash and bonds will be lower as well.\n\nMcNabb\u2019s greatest concern now is cybersecurity in the financial industry, he said. The threat has evolved in recent years from mischievous vandals to criminal gangs, and now to nations that might wage cyber warfare, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not so much interested in your money, but maybe in disrupting the system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe financial industry has become much more vulnerable, he noted, because of increased reliance on online portals. About 98 percent of Vanguard\u2019s investor transactions now take place online. On the plus side, he said competing financial services companies are now joining together to share information about attacks and to create a warning system to bolster their collective defenses. Federal agencies also have formed a task force to fight the problem more aggressively.\n\nMcNabb urged consumers to use two-factor authentication, a system in which an online transaction must be authenticated with a code that the financial services company sends via a second channel, such as a phone text message.\n\n\u201cFrom a security standpoint, it\u2019s the single biggest thing you can do to prevent hacking in the financial space,\u201d he said. \u201cI would sign up for it. You\u2019ll get even better technology over the next ten years, but this is as good as it gets right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Urban Land Magazine", "description": "The U.S. economy remains in good shape with steady, if unspectacular, growth, the head of one of the world\u2019s largest investment management companies said at the opening of the general session at ULI\u2019s Spring Meeting in Philadelphia.", "title": "Vanguard\u2019s McNabb Sees \u201cContinued Muted Growth\u201d in U.S. Economy - Urban Land Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://urbanland.uli.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/04/800_mcnabb.jpg", "height": 467}, "updated_time": "2016-05-23T16:25:02-04:00", "url": "http://urbanland.uli.org/capital-markets/vanguards-mcnabb-sees-continued-muted-growth-u-s-economy/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Capital Markets", "published_time": "2016-04-22T10:59:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T16:25:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Since 2009, roughly one of every two dollars invested in mutual funds has gone to Vanguard, McNabb said.\nIn fact, we\u2019re seeing the opposite.\u201d Vanguard\u2019s forecasts show \u201ccontinued muted growth\u201d for at least the next six months to a year, he said.\nThe financial industry has become much more vulnerable, he noted, because of increased reliance on online portals.\nMcNabb\u2019s greatest concern now is cybersecurity in the financial industry, he said.\nMcNabb joined Vanguard in 1986 and became chief executive in 2008, on the eve of the Wall Street financial meltdown."}
