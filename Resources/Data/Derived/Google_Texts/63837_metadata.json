To understand population health. And to be ready from day one to put best practices for quality care and patient safety to work.\"\n\nBy developing innovative curricula that \"embed students in real-world experiences, introduce them to cutting-edge technology and instill in them a love for lifelong learning,\" the schools of the consortium will \"give future physicians these skills and more, and prepare them to lead and innovate as they care for patients and communities in this complex, modern, rapidly changing healthcare system,\" he said.\n\nMadara pointed to two examples from schools in the first batch of 11 members as programs that \"allow medical students to be totally immersed within the healthcare system from day one of medical school: training in physician leadership, education in team care skills and increased use of technology to teach electronic health records and patient outcomes skills.\"\n\nPenn State, for instance, developed a curriculum to \"ensure that students learn not only the basics in clinical sciences but also health systems science,\" he said. \"This is an important innovation given that the majority of medical students still receive their training in hospital settings \u2013 despite the fact that the majority of patients are now being cared for in an outpatient setting in order to treat chronic conditions.\"\n\nAt Indiana University School of Medicine, meanwhile, educators \"developed a teaching electronic health record using deidentified data to ensure medical students have access to EHRs during their medical training, instead of having to get up to speed after graduating\" \u2013 something, Madara added, that has unfortunately \"been the norm\" for too many med students.\n\nThe 20 new schools joining ACME consortium:\n\nA.T.
