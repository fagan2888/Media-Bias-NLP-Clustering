The House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday released a $3.3 billion bill to fund the operations of the legislative branch for fiscal 2016.

The measure, which is about $172 million below President Obamaâ€™s request, keeps funding at the current 2015 level and maintains a freeze on lawmakers' salaries that has been in effect since 2010.

Since Republicans took control of the lower chamber in 2011, funding for the House has been reduced by 14 percent, the GOP-led committee said.

The bill funds House operations as well as the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol, the Library of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Government Publishing Office (GPO).

The bill funds House operations at the 2015 level, which is $1.2 billion. This covers operations for leadership, committees and officers of the House, among other things.

Capitol Police would receive $369 million under the bill, an increase of $21 million above the 2015 level. The Appropriations panel said this is meant to fund critical safety and security at the Capitol and to maintain public access to its buildings.

The Architect of the Capitol would receive nearly $497 million, which is $9 million below the 2015 level. The measure would provide authority for the renovation and restoration of the Cannon House Office Building.

The Library of Congress would receive $591 million, which is $510,000 above the 2015 level.

This is the third fiscal 2016 appropriations bill the panel has released so far. It is marking up the first two bills on Wednesday, which cover energy and water development as well as military construction projects and veterans benefits.

Those last two bills are expected to hit the House floor next week.
