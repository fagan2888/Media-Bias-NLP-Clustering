Poplar Springs Drive United Methodist Church's annual spring festival was going on Saturday.

The event is a way to raise money for Relay for Life, Wesley House and others. There was fun for the kids and the young at heart. Homemade and frozen goodies were being sold in addition to the always popular boiled shrimp plates.

"We’ve just been blessed with a beautiful day today. It’s a time a fellowship and fun for the church and we just really appreciate the community's support. They came out to buy the shrimp plates and frozen goods and baked goods," church member Butch Shannon says.

The group had nearly 850 pounds of shrimp to be sold.
