It\u2019s been so popular, in fact, that less than half of all eligible employees under 26 enrolled in an employer-provided health plan in 2015. Many instead opted to stay insured under mom and dad. In late July, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey introduced a similar bill in Congress extending government-subsidized health insurance to foster youth until they turn 26. The funny thing is that Congress already passed just such a provision in 2010 so that young adults weren\u2019t penalized for not having a permanent home. So why the duplication? It turns out, Casey\u2019s legislation is an attempt to fix what he calls a \u201cglitch\u201d in the law\u2019s language that has led to spotty and limited Medicaid coverage for former foster care youth. The glitch \u2014 perhaps more accurately described as a troublesome ambiguity \u2014 has come about thanks to two little words: \u201cthe State.\u201d As it\u2019s written, the health-care law says former foster youth only qualify for Medicaid if they \u201cwere in foster care under the responsibility of the State.\u201d Two years ago, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded that \u201cthe State\u201d means \u201cthe state in which they currently live.\u201d In other words, a state is only required to provide Medicaid to a former foster youth if that individual aged out of that specific state\u2019s foster care system. Put another way, that means that if a young adult was in foster care in Maryland, but moved to nearby Virginia or the District of Columbia for work, his option to receive Medicaid would only be valid in Maryland. (emphasis added)\n\nIn this case, the federal government has maintained that the reference to \u201cthe State\u201d actually means \u201cthe State,\u201d even though that makes it more difficult for some foster youth to obtain health coverage. Under Chevron, the agency\u2019s interpretation might be due some deference, but not under King v. Burwell. Perhaps if Casey\u2019s fix doesn\u2019t pass, someone will take this question to federal court to see whether the plain language of the statute reflects \u201cCongress\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Some commenters question my suggestion that the CMS interpretation above would not be due Chevron deference. I was admittedly a bit flip on the point, but I don\u2019t think it would be even if one were to conclude that the relevant statutory language were ambiguous.\n\nAccording to the Governing story linked above, the CMS interpretation was put forward in a proposed rule and never finalized, and has simply become the agency\u2019s de facto policy.\u201d As a consequence, whether or not thinks this is the sort of question that should receive Chevron deference, it would not be eligible for Chevron deference under Mead and other post-Chevron cases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A reference to \"the State\" limits health coverage for foster youth.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A reference to \"the State\" limits health coverage for foster youth.", "title": "It seems sometimes \u2018State\u2019 really means \u2018State\u2019 in the Affordable Care Act", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/18/it-seems-sometimes-state-really-means-state-in-the-affordable-care-act/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/18/it-seems-sometimes-state-really-means-state-in-the-affordable-care-act/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, foster kids,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, foster kids,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92c3\"", "article_summary": "In late July, Pennsylvania Sen.
