Graham warned, grabbing a shotgun and lining up with several others to take their positions.\n\nThe men \u2014 along with a few women, including news anchor Katie Couric, whom Graham coached with extra attention \u2014 fired at orange clays, one after another. The senior senator from South Carolina did not do so well. He blamed the early hour.\n\nNevertheless, Graham explained his philosophy for shooting skeet, which, as is often the case in such situations, doubled as his philosophy for running for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about letting the pigeon run into the shot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you shoot over the pigeon, you\u2019re not going to hit it. If you shoot under, you won\u2019t. . . . \u2018Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot\u2019 is the first goal of shooting skeet, and the first goal of politics is to just survive.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is a Republican contender for the White House in 2016. Here's his take on Obamacare, guns and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nIn this chummy phase of the presidential race, Graham, 59, is proving to be the chummiest of a large and expanding Republican field. A long shot at best \u2014 he registers as a blip in the polls \u2014 Graham relishes being in the spotlight and a part of the debate. He wisecracks on the cattle-call circuit and texts punchy one-liners to GOP moneymen from his old-school flip phone. His impish campaign-trail humor leaves almost everyone in stitches.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Lindsey hilarious?\u201d Ann Romney gushed the other day.\n\nBut Graham\u2019s campaign is not merely about jokes. He\u2019s focused on national security and global threats such as the Islamic State terrorist group, using his megaphone to keep the Republican Party balanced on the hawkish right.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m running to talk about serious things, to talk about ISIL. I want people to listen. I also don\u2019t want them to slit their wrists when they hear what I have to say,\u201d he said in an interview this week in nearby Park City, where he attended 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s annual donor summit and ideas festival.\n\nOn the road, Graham maintains a low-key presence. Waiting for his Delta flight to Utah, Graham browsed a newsstand at Washington\u2019s Reagan National Airport. He glanced down at a pile of books by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), his foreign-policy foil, but didn\u2019t pick one up. He turned instead to the glossy magazines. When a reporter asked what he was buying, his eyes lighted up and he held up copies of People and the Economist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of the people and of the world,\u201d he quipped.\n\nAt the luxurious Stein Eriksen Lodge for Romney\u2019s conclave, he impressed donors with his zest for political combat, quick wit and sharp policy critiques \u2013 not only on national security, but also on domestic issues.\n\nGraham, left, celebrates with GOP donor Kent Lucken after shooting skeet in Kamas, Utah, on Saturday. (Jim Urquhart/Reuters)\n\nGraham spoke emotionally about the need for comprehensive immigration reform, especially a pathway to citizenship, and said he thought Romney\u2019s rhetoric in 2012 alienated Hispanic voters. \u201cI love Mitt,\u201d he said, but \u201cthat was the big mistake.\u201d\n\nAs much as they enjoyed Graham\u2019s presence, some GOP financiers said they have a hard time imagining him in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cPolitics is like most sports. You\u2019ve got to be loose in the huddle. If you want it too badly and you\u2019re swinging for the fences, you tighten up,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent investor who is backing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. \u201cBut what\u2019s weird about presidential politics is that you need that and you need gravitas. People need to see you as the president.\u201d\n\nGraham has been courting Romney\u2019s network. About a month ago, he met with Romney intimates \u2014 former Bain Capital partner Bob White and former Massachusetts lieutenant governor Kerry Healey, among others \u2014 at the Boston offices of Spencer Zwick, Romney\u2019s former national finance chairman. They had lunch catered from the nearby Flour Bakery. Zwick came away informed and entertained. \u201cHe\u2019s going to add a lot of personality to a sometimes otherwise boring process,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn McCain always says, \u2018If I need to smile, I talk to Lindsey\u2019 \u2014 and he\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nMcCain is Graham\u2019s closest friend in the Senate and an enthusiastic supporter in the 2016 race. During McCain\u2019s 2008 run, Graham stumped at the Arizona senator\u2019s side \u2014 and appears to have absorbed his bag of tricks. Graham recycles stock jokes and loves quoting from movies. His favorite is \u201cCasablanca,\u201d but he tends to cite lines from popcorn flicks like the Will Ferrell comedy \u201cTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\u201d\n\nGraham does not write out his jokes or solicit zingers from staff. \u201cIt\u2019s situational comedy,\u201d he said in the interview. His mind works fast, he said, and he simply looks for ways to poke fun at himself \u2014 adjusting, of course, to his setting or host.\n\nLast week, Graham\u2019s lifelong bachelorhood made headlines when he suggested he would have a \u201crotating first lady.\u201d So when he addressed the Romney gathering, he teased the former nominee: \u201cWe tried tall, good lookin\u2019, smart, nice, great family. Vote for me. We\u2019re not going down that road again!\u201d\n\nReince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Graham is reveling in his candidacy. He recalled their joint appearance at a recent Silver Elephant Dinner in South Carolina, where Graham playfully said that when Priebus was elected chairman, it made him think the GOP had \u201celected a car, a Toyota Prius,\u201d a hybrid vehicle loathed by a number of conservatives.\n\nGraham also learned from McCain to embrace the press. He occasionally ends days on the campaign trail by inviting reporters to join him for a glass of riesling.\n\nWalker and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came and went from the Romney retreat without saying a word to reporters. Over a day and a half, Graham held three media availabilities and 10 one-on-one interviews.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do as president is restrict the number of media outlets,\u201d he said with a wink as he wandered through the media workspace.\n\nFriends say Graham\u2019s humor comes from his difficult early adulthood, during which his parents died. Jokes helped him make light of the pain he and his younger sister experienced. Later, serving in the military and as a trial lawyer, Graham honed his skills. Well-delivered jokes with a little Southern charm, he learned, can kill with a jury.\n\nOn Saturday, at the gun range, Graham was asked how he would determine success if, as the polls predict, he doesn\u2019t win the nomination. His answer: \u201cThat I\u2019m the same guy afterwards that I was before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I fall short,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s because I fell short being Lindsey Graham.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The long-shot GOP presidential hopeful leaves his audiences in stitches, but his campaign is no joke.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The long-shot GOP presidential hopeful leaves his audiences in stitches, but his campaign is no joke.", "title": "Lindsey Graham campaigns with a smile, one wisecrack at a time", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-campaigns-with-a-smile-one-wisecrack-at-a-time/2015/06/13/86e001aa-11f9-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/13/National-Politics/Images/2015-06-13T144849Z_01_SLC102_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-GRAHAM-4370.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-campaigns-with-a-smile-one-wisecrack-at-a-time/2015/06/13/86e001aa-11f9-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "86e001aa-11f9-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cc1\"", "article_summary": "His answer: \u201cThat I\u2019m the same guy afterwards that I was before.\u201d\u201cIf I fall short,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s because I fell short being Lindsey Graham.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a cruel game, guys,\u201d Lindsey O.
