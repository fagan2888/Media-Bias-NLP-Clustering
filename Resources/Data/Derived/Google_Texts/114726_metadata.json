Ted Cruz, in a mix of a stump speech and Sunday sermon, rallied Republicans here over chili and talk of what it takes to make America great.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to what has made America a beacon of hope and freedom for the world for centuries,\u201d the Texas Republican said. \u201cFrom the beginning of this country, God\u2019s providential blessing has been on America and I tell you I\u2019m convinced God is not done with America yet.\u201d..Cruz, at the start of the possible presidential hopeful\u2019s two-day visit to New Hampshire on Sunday, spoke to the Strafford County Republican Committee\u2019s \u201cChili & Chat\u201d event at Turbocam International...\u201cThere is an urgency of politics today that is unlike anything any of us has ever seen,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is now or never. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached the point of no return yet, but we are close. We are close and I believe if we go four or eight more years on this same path we risk losing the greatest country in the history of the world.\u201d..Cruz said his travels around the country underscored the urgency.\u201cThe Obama economy is a disaster. Obamacare is a train wreck and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind \u2026 the whole world\u2019s on fire.\u201d..After delivering that line, a young girl sitting on her mother\u2019s lap in the front row blurted out, \u201cThe world\u2019s on fire?\u201dAs audience members chuckled, Cruz walked over to her. \u201cThe world\u2019s on fire, yes. Your world is on fire. But you know what, your mommy\u2019s here and everyone\u2019s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better.\u201d..Cruz was also interrupted once by a man who urged him to run for President.He won applause when he called for a flat tax and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, and he said the Affordable Care Act and Common Core curriculum standards should be repealed...America needs to get back to free market principles to foster job growth from the private sector, not Washington, Cruz said. He said Washington is a place of \u201cdespair and despondency.\u201dCruz was the keynote speaker for the Grafton County Lincoln-Reagan Dinner on Sunday night in Lincoln. He is scheduled to speak at \u201cPolitics & Eggs,\u201d co-hosted by the New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College this morning...Jack Kimball, a former state GOP chairman from Dover, said constitutional conservatives like himself want to see leaders like Cruz push back against President Obama.\u201cBarack Obama is the most lawless President this country has ever seen,\u201d Cruz replied...Several Republicans in attendance also had a chance to hear former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush speak at a house party in Dover and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker deliver remarks to a GOP event in Concord.David Scott, a former Dover city councilor, listened to Bush and Cruz. He said Walker and Cruz are right now the most interesting possible candidates in the field. He is critical of Bush\u2019s support for Common Core curriculum standards, which Cruz said should be repealed...Nodding to Cruz, Scott said, \u201cHe\u2019s up there \u2013 very close to Scott Walker.\u201dCruz held an impromptu meet-up with state legislators in attendance and, before leaving Turbocam, autographed Marga Coulp\u2019s pink cowboy boots...\u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d Coulp, of Dover, said after meeting Cruz. \u201cI just love his conservative values.\u201dMany Republicans in the audience, estimated by an organizer at 200, wore \u201cConstitutional Conservative\u201d stickers...Cruz said he is seriously considering a run. He said one question is, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win in 2016, how do we bring the many conservatives who have been staying home back into the fold?\u201ddtuohy@unionleader.com..", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Sen.
