Carson replied that he'd propose making current illegal immigrants go through the same decade-long process Larsen went through.\n\nLarsen said Carson's idea \"was at least on the right path,\" adding that she would still likely caucus for him this afternoon.\n\n\"When you come to the United States as an immigrant and follow the law, it takes a long time,\" Larsen said. \"I'm just concerned that so many of us struggle so hard to do it legally.\"\n\nAttendee Justin Abraham, 35, said he'll be caucusing for the first time today, siding with Carson.\n\nAbraham, a nightclub host on the Las Vegas Strip, called Carson \"the best candidate I've seen\" in this year's election.\n\n\"He's honest, he's humble and he has integrity,\" Abraham said. \"There's just no nonsense with him.\"\n\nCarson also held a private town hall event Monday evening at Sun City Anthem Center in Henderson. Carson is scheduled to speak at Coronado High School, a caucusing site, at 5:45 p.m. today before hosting a post-caucus event at the Embassy Suites by Hilton Convention Center at 3600 Paradise Road.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson answered questions and warned of the perils of big government this morning in front of about 300 people at Summerlin's Mountain Shadows Community Center, touching on topics \u2026", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson answered questions and warned of the perils of big government this morning in front of about 300 people at Summerlin's Mountain Shadows Community Center, touching on topics \u2026", "title": "Carson talks health care, immigration in Summerlin", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2016/feb/23/carson-talks-health-care-immigration-in-summerlin/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2016/02/23/0223CarsonTownhall19_t378.JPG?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LasVegasSun", "image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2016/02/23/0223CarsonTownhall19_r100x100.JPG?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "creator": "@@kudialisLVSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-23T12:49", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/chris-kudialis/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dfe\"", "article_summary": "Carson said the law is actually less affordable for Americans, and that as president he\u2019d replace it with a system of family health care savings funds that would ultimately make health care less expensive.\nCarson talks health care, immigration in SummerlinRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson answered questions and warned of the perils of big government this morning in front of about 300 people at Summerlin's Mountain Shadows Community Center, touching on topics such as the economy, health care, First Amendment rights and immigration.\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, spent most of his 60-minute dialogue discussing health care and criticizing the Affordable Care Act spearheaded by President Barack Obama.\n\"It's like a health savings account without the bureaucrats,\" he said.\n\"When you come to the United States as an immigrant and follow the law, it takes a long time,\" Larsen said."}
