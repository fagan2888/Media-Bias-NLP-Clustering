Why?\n\nCutting to the quick: Investors, it seems, are losing confidence in the Fed.\n\nRelated: 18 Companies Americans Hate Dealing With the Most\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nWhile the Wall Street stimulus junkies should've been happy with the continuation of the status quo, there is now a nagging fear that credibility in central bankers is being lost \u2014 something that RBS' Head of Macro Credit Research Alberto Gallo took to Twitter this afternoon to reiterate.\n\nMoreover, the Summary of Economic Projections by Fed officials revealed that, at the median, policymakers now only expect a single rate hike by the end of 2015. The futures market is now pricing in a 49 percent chance of a hike at the December meeting (although Yellen noted that the October meeting was \"live\" and could result in a hike should markets and economic data improve).\n\nBut the kicker \u2014 the one that pushed large-cap stocks lower into the closing bell \u2014 was the appearance of a negative interest rate projection by a Fed policymaker on the newly released \u201cdot plot.\u201d Someone, it seems, expects federal funds policy rate to be in negative territory at the end of 2016. Four officials don't expect any hikes this year at all.\n\nNot only does this undermine confidence in the state of the economy, but it calls into question the efficacy of the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy stance that has been in place, to varying degrees, since 2008. Moving forward, it will be critical for the bulls to recover from Thursday's intra-day selloff. The day's action resulted in a very negative \"shooting star\" technical pattern that signals buying exhaustion and often precedes pullbacks.\n\nIn their statement, Federal Open Market Committee members fingered recent global economic weakness and financial market turbulence as giving reason to believe that inflation would take longer to return to their 2 percent target. So the new dot plot shows the median rate projection for the end of 2015 falling to 0.375 percent from 0.625 percent as of June; to 1.375 percent for 2016 vs. 1.625 percent before; and 2.625 percent for 2017 from 2.875 percent. The long-term neutral rate declined to 3.5 percent from 3.75 percent, signifying ongoing structural problems in the economy holding down its potential growth rate.\n\nRelated: U.S. Companies Are Dying Faster Than Ever\u200b\u200b\n\nBut a tree should be judged by the fruit it produces. In this case, median household incomes are stagnating despite all the Fed has already done, including three bond-buying programs and the \"Operation Twist\" maturity extension program. With corporate profits rolling over and global growth stagnating, people are wondering: Is this all the Fed and its central banking counterparts can do? Fresh threats, such as another possible debt ceiling showdown on Capitol Hill this autumn and an election in Greece, are approaching.\n\nAs for what comes next, Societe Generale Chief U.S. Economist Aneta Markowska suggests a replay of the late 2013 experience surrounding the beginning of the end of the QE3 bond-buying program: \"Our scenario is reminiscent of 2013 when the 'taper tantrum' spooked the Fed in September, a government shutdown spooked the Committee in October, and the fog finally lifted by December when the taper was finally announced.\"\n\nIf the Fed left rates unchanged, there were some new wrinkles in its statement. In explaining their decision, Fed officials elevated issues like global economic growth and the dollar's valuation seemingly above its traditional mandate regarding labor market health. J.P. Morgan Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli believes investors shouldn\u2019t read too much into the new factors being cited. In a paraphrase of the infamous rant by former Arizona Cardinals coach Dennis Green: Yellen is a dove. She is who we thought she was. And until higher inflation becomes a clear and present problem, this continual moving of the goalposts for Fed rate hikes \u2014 deferring until more data comes in \u2014 looks set to continue.\n\nBut that may no longer be enough to keep stocks happy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It wasn't supposed to be like this.", "title": "Why Wall Street\u2019s Stimulus Junkies Weren\u2019t Thrilled by the Fed\u2019s Rate Decision", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/18/Why-Wall-Street-s-Stimulus-Junkies-Weren-t-Thrilled-Fed-s-Rate-Decision", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07092014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/18/Why-Wall-Street-s-Stimulus-Junkies-Weren-t-Thrilled-Fed-s-Rate-Decision", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07092014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It wasn't supposed to be like this.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And until higher inflation becomes a clear and present problem, this continual moving of the goalposts for Fed rate hikes \u2014 deferring until more data comes in \u2014 looks set to continue.\nMoreover, the Summary of Economic Projections by Fed officials revealed that, at the median, policymakers now only expect a single rate hike by the end of 2015.\nIn explaining their decision, Fed officials elevated issues like global economic growth and the dollar's valuation seemingly above its traditional mandate regarding labor market health.\nThe long-term neutral rate declined to 3.5 percent from 3.75 percent, signifying ongoing structural problems in the economy holding down its potential growth rate.\nThe day's action resulted in a very negative \"shooting star\" technical pattern that signals buying exhaustion and often precedes pullbacks."}
