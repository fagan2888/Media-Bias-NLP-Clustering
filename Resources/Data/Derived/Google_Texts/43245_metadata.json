It should try to find new language of communicating in order to give awareness to the public. Then every society can use the layer it needs at the moment.\u201d \u2013Marina Abramovic\n\nThere are many who would scoff at the above quote, preferring to think that art should be nothing but escapism, a form of \u201cfeel-good\u201d entertainment. And yet, to feel nothing but good is to feel nothing but empty, a fact Tim Heidecker probably knows all too well. For years, he\u2019s stood out as a much-needed beacon among America\u2019s film critics for infusing elements of his personal and political lives into his lauded movie-criticism program, Adult Swim\u2019s On Cinema at the Cinema. We\u2019ve seen him bravely speak out against Obamacare when no one else would. We\u2019ve seen him stare death in the eye during more than one health scare. We\u2019ve seen his complicated romance with Ayaka Ohwaki, and when she tried to take him for all he was worth, we saw him stand up for what\u2019s right. Because that\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s what he always does. He doesn\u2019t know any other way.\n\nHeidecker has consistently brought this kind of integrity not only to his work as a critic, but to his work as a fictional character as well. Like Heidecker himself, Special Agent Jack Decker might not be the hero America wants, but he\u2019s certainly the hero America needs. Still, every hero needs a villain \u2014 someone who\u2019s the complete opposite of them in their values, abilities, and charisma\u2014and if there\u2019s an opposite of Tim Heidecker, it\u2019s his co-host, Gregg Turkington. Turkington, while kindhearted and gifted with an uncanny knowledge of American movie trivia, doesn\u2019t have one ounce of the chutzpah, conviction, or magnetism possessed by Heidecker. And perhaps that\u2019s why they work so well together. It\u2019s all about balance. Turkington is the Roeper to Heidecker\u2019s Ebert, the beard to his Leonard Maltin, the unsightly mustache to his Gene Shalit.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the show faltered when Turkington tried (or should I say attempted) to host it all by himself at the beginning of the current season, its sixth. But lucky for us and America at large, Heidecker\u2019s back in the saddle after a lost weekend in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, already restoring On Cinema to its former glory after only one episode. In the wake of Editor-In-Chief Michael Roffman\u2019s painfully biased interview with Turkington, we thought it was only fair to get Heidecker\u2019s side of the story. Fortunately, we were able to catch this national treasure before his big trip to Hawaii to get the inside scoop on why he really left Jackson Hole, what we can expect from On Cinema\u2019s annual Oscar special this weekend, and the exciting future of Decker.\n\nFirst off, welcome back. Does it feel good to return to the show?\n\nAbsolutely. It\u2019s good to be back where I belong and feel energized and ready to really dig into making the show a great show, something that\u2019s rewarding to the audience and the On Cinema family.\n\nExcellent. How did you feel about Gregg\u2019s episode where he went at it alone?\n\nI don\u2019t want to seem like a jerk or anything here. I\u2019ve spoken about this at length, and I made a statement about it, but it speaks for itself. I consider it a train wreck. I consider it an embarrassment to the On Cinema brand, and I think Gregg acknowledged that, or at least he did privately to me. He seems to have a different perspective when he speaks about it to others. But listen, that\u2019s on me at the end of the day because I\u2019m the one who put him in that position.\n\nWe appreciated what Gregg was trying to do, but it definitely felt like a different show and that something was missing. We actually spoke to Gregg not too long ago, and he mentioned that part of you leaving Jackson Hole had to do with a bar fight. You also alluded on the show that some of the friends you had made there were in the KKK. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the exact event that caused you to leave Jackson Hole.\n\nWell, it was an accumulation of events. It wasn\u2019t just one single event. Earlier last year, I purchased a lot \u2014 roughly 25 acres of land. I moved out there and set up a small house and really started building a life for myself there. And as we were building, as we were putting the pieces together and getting things where I wanted them, there were \u2026 there were certain facts that weren\u2019t presented to me appropriately \u2014 let me put it that way \u2014 by the realtor and the landowners that sold me the property. What that meant was my property did not have access to water. With a lot of the land in Wyoming, you dig a well. It isn\u2019t like L.A. or a big city where you tie into the public waterworks. It\u2019s not like that.\n\nSo after this whole thing with lawyers and water-rights experts, it came down to the simple fact that the property I was living on had no access to water. There was just no way to get water to me. I tried dealing with it and sort of jerry-rigging it, but basically I ended up going into town and buying large amounts of bottled water. And I got to the point where I said, \u201cThis is untenable. This is not any way to live.\u201d So that was a difficult moment.\n\nAnd of course I alluded to the KKK. I can\u2019t really talk too much about that because I don\u2019t know what these guys are going to do, you know? I definitely felt my life was in danger.\n\nSo did the bar fight happen? Can you at least confirm that?\n\nYeah. But if you have an image of Patrick Swayze in Road House, it wasn\u2019t like that. I had taken my motorcycle out to Jackson Hole because that was my means of transportation at the time. That whole ride out there was difficult. It was cold, it was challenging. I had already gone through one motorcycle accident. I had another one on the way out there. I spun out.\n\nBy the time I get to Jackson Hole, I had made the decision to sell my motorcycle. So long story short, the assault happened during the sale of the motorcycle. There was some disagreement about the price we had discussed on Craigslist, and we got into a \u2026 more of a shoving situation. I verbally attacked this gentleman, and he responded with force. He basically shoved me, and I tumbled down two steps in front of the bar and hit my head.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fight in the sense of beer bottles being broken over peoples\u2019 heads. It got broken up pretty quickly. But I had already checked out of the idea of living in Jackson Hole. I was trying to figure out what I was going to do, so you could call that the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, I guess.\n\nWell we\u2019re glad to hear you\u2019re alright. Gregg literally said you had gotten the \u201cshit kicked out of you.\u201d And I knew that was a lie \u2014 him trying to talk trash.\n\nIn the heat of the moment \u2014 and I think I spoke on the Tom Scharpling show about this \u2014 that\u2019s how I described it, but that might have been exaggerating the facts a little bit. If you see me on the show, I don\u2019t have a black eye or anything like that. It wasn\u2019t what I presented it to be, but it was an assault, plain and simple. It was an assault.\n\nLike I said, I don\u2019t know what these guys are going to do next because I got out of there quick. I didn\u2019t get a statement. I didn\u2019t press charges or anything like that. But they\u2019re serious guys involved with, like I said, the KKK. They had swastikas tattooed on their neck and everything.\n\nThanks for opening up about that. Now that you\u2019re back on the show, do you still plan on fusing your politics with your critiques? Also, have your politics changed at all, now that you\u2019re not living in Jackson Hole anymore?\n\nI understand that my political views might make people uncomfortable and that they\u2019re not the most popular with young people. And it\u2019s an off year for politics, too. There\u2019s not a lot going on. But we are doing our Oscar special this Sunday, and I\u2019m in discussions with Mike Huckabee about him being a part of the show.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah. And it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re not making it a political forum for him. I want to talk movies with him. I want to talk music with him, and we\u2019re going to play music together. I definitely align myself with him, but I find myself politically becoming a little more compassionate. I\u2019ve really become involved with a website called Values.com, and I still believe in small government and making traditional values, as I like to call them, the focus of what leads the choices we make.\n\nI think somebody like Mike or Donald Trump \u2014 that\u2019s who I feel akin to, but I\u2019m trying to respect the audience\u2019s wishes and Gregg\u2019s wishes that the show isn\u2019t the best format for me to express my political views. I acknowledge that. The show\u2019s called On Cinema. It\u2019s not On Politics or On Values.\n\nI have to ask, what kind of movies does Mike Huckabee like?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s one of the questions I\u2019m going to be asking him. It\u2019s hard for me to say because I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to talk to him about it yet. I would think they\u2019re going to be wholesome family movies: The Sound of Music, movies the whole family can watch together. Mike\u2019s not the kind of guy who\u2019s going to watch Fifty Shades of Grey and these other smut porno movies that are coming out. There\u2019s part of me that really does enjoy that, but when it comes to movies the whole family can watch, those are the movies I think Mike and I would watch together.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good. A lot of Americans\u2019 values are going in the toilet, and I think it\u2019s good to bring back those traditionalist viewpoints. Speaking of the Oscars, who are your Oscar picks? Who should win, and who will win for Best Picture?\n\nGregg has theories about this. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s spoken to you about it. Look, I wish everybody the best, but we\u2019re going to do a little something different on our show that I think everyone will get really excited about. I think the focus tends to go a little too much on the movies with the Academy Awards. They tend to exclude some things in 2014 that I think deserve acknowledgement. So we\u2019re going to be doing a little counter-programming with the Oscars. There\u2019s going to be an acknowledgement of some web content I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nSo I think the Oscars get enough attention. They don\u2019t need me chiming in, guessing who\u2019s going to take home an arbitrary prize that\u2019s ultimately meaningless except in the fact that it has the potential to drive up box-office sales. There were so many great movies that came out last year that the Oscars don\u2019t talk about. There\u2019s a movie that has two of my favorite movie stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. It\u2019s called Escape Plan. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with that movie.\n\nI am, but I haven\u2019t seen it.\n\nI think it\u2019s called Escape Plan. It\u2019s an interesting story about how Sylvester Stallone is the master of escaping prisons. That\u2019s his job. He\u2019s a sort of consultant. He gets himself captured, goes into these prisons, then breaks out. Then he goes to the warden and says, \u201cLook, here are your weaknesses and what not.\u201d Well, it turns out that Sylvester Stallone gets himself in the most maximum-security prison out there. This is a place they\u2019d put Saddam Hussein, the worst of the worst. And who does he meet there but Arnold Schwarzenegger. It turns out that Sylvester Stallone has been set up, and there really is no way to get out of this thing. Now he\u2019s got to work with Schwarzenegger to get out of this super-max jail.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the best movies I saw last year, and it gets no recognition. It gets no acknowledgement from the Academy Awards. So those are the movies I think America appreciates and wants to see more of. The film community would be smart in acknowledging these more popular films.\n\nAnd you of course are a filmmaker and actor yourself. I also know you\u2019re humble, so I hope this question doesn\u2019t embarrass you too much, but could you ever see Decker taking home an Oscar in the future?\n\nYes.\n\nFor which categories?\n\nBest Actor, Best Director, and Best Film, if we do ever make a Decker film. The trick is we have to pepper it with enough movie stars that the studios get interested and get the big money behind it. The Oscars are nothing more than an exchange of goods. So say you\u2019re Warner Bros. and you want your movie to win an Oscar; you pay for it. You put out the ads. You wine and dine the Academy. You have screenings. That\u2019s hard cash that you have to put in. The infrastructure behind Decker doesn\u2019t have those resources.\n\nSo should we get someone like Warner Bros. or Sony or Universal Pictures? Paramount would be a great fit. They did the Mission: Impossible series. They get behind Decker, and we add a few movie stars \u2014 perhaps Sir Ian McKellen or a cameo from Mr. Tom Cruise himself. Somebody of that caliber. And we\u2019ll add a little bit more production value and a stronger story, a little bit more compelling of a story. You\u2019d easily see Decker sweep the awards.\n\nDo you picture stars like Tom Cruise and Ian McKellen playing supporting roles, or would one of them take on the role of Decker? Or do you want to keep playing that part yourself?\n\nThe only scenario where I see someone else playing Decker is 20 or 30 years from now, when they start rebooting it. There\u2019s a cycle in this business where I see myself doing Decker for another five or 10 years in various forms. From the web, we\u2019ll hit TV, then there\u2019ll probably be three or four movies. And then I\u2019ll get tired of it, the audience will get tired of seeing me do it, and then Decker will kind of just go away. It\u2019ll become one of those classic franchises. And in 20 years, it\u2019ll get revamped, much like Mission: Impossible and the Indiana Jones series. There are so many great franchises that have been given a brand-new life thanks to these hardworking people that bring these characters back to life.\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the Decker sequel?\n\nWe are in production. I\u2019m heading to Hawaii on Monday to shoot the first two episodes.\n\nI know you probably don\u2019t want to spoil too much, but what are some of the action sequences we can expect?\n\nWhile I hate giving away surprises, I will say that the island of Hawaii is one of the main characters in the series. The beauty, the splendor, and the majesty of the island comes alive in Decker, and we use the island. You\u2019re not going to see anyone going, \u201cI guess they just shot this in front of a green screen and put some pictures of Hawaii in the background.\u201d We are immersed in the culture. When I was there last week scouting and securing the talent and the crew, I fell in love with the whole energy there and the spirit of the people. It\u2019s a wonderful, magical place, and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I think it\u2019s going to shine through.\n\nTo your point about action sequences, there are so many activities in Hawaii that you can do: jet-skiing, ziplining, parasailing. All these things are at our beck and call. And I thought, Wow, what a cool place to film an action show \u2014 where you can utilize some of the more adventurous aspects of the island. So we\u2019re going to dabble in that.\n\nWill Gregg and Joe Estevez be coming back? I know there\u2019s been some debate about whether or not Kingston will be returning.\n\nJoe is essential to the story. After all, he\u2019s President Jake Davidson. He\u2019s the yin to my yang, unless you consider Taliban forces to be the yang. But in a sense, I\u2019m fighting two fronts. It\u2019s like the Nazis in World War II \u2014 they were fighting the Russians and the Allied Forces. Decker battles not only the pure evil that is Taliban, but the bureaucracy and the red-tape bullshit of Washington. It\u2019s the perfect reflection of the current state of affairs. The show doesn\u2019t exist without having that dynamic.\n\nKingston is less valuable to the franchise. He represented, in the first [series], sort of a means to an end. We needed a practical solution to a plot point, and frankly it could have been a number of service agents who stood in. We\u2019re trying to bring in bigger names to play another agent that Decker works with. I think it would be cool to make it a nod to the island of Hawaii and have someone like Mr. Tom Selleck be a part of the show, or whoever, really. The current actors who are on Hawaii Five-0 \u2014 one of them is Scott Caan, who\u2019s James Caan\u2019s son. He\u2019s one of my idols, and I would be honored to work with him. We\u2019re reaching out to his team right now to be a big part of the show.\n\nSo those are the goals: to elevate it, make it something special, and top something that I didn\u2019t think was possible, which is Decker, Season One: Decker Classified. So Kington isn\u2019t, at this point at least, something I\u2019m focusing on.\n\nThat\u2019s totally understandable. As a franchise grows, it\u2019s important to change with the times. It looks like we\u2019re almost out of time ourselves, so I\u2019m going to ask you one last question. It\u2019s a pretty conventional question, but one I have to ask because of your cinematic expertise. So here it goes. What is your favorite movie of all time?\n\n(Long pause)\n\nYou know, I should have an answer for this because I do get asked it quite a bit. I have to say, I think it\u2019s Escape Plan with Sylvester Stallone, just because it\u2019s one of the last movies I\u2019ve seen and really does resonate with me at the moment. Right now, if someone put a gun to my head and said, \u201cName your favorite movie,\u201d that\u2019s what I\u2019d say. It\u2019s because it has all of those elements. It\u2019s like:\n\n\u201cI like a Sylvester Stallone movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, good. Here you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you know, I\u2019m actually more in the mood for an Arnold Schwarzenegger film.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you came to the right store. Because we\u2019re also providing that for you.\u201d\n\nAnd then we go into the story of the current state of the prison system and how we fight terrorism \u2014 constitutional questions. It\u2019s all there, wrapped up in a really fast-paced, wonderfully directed, wonderfully performed thriller that I absolutely stand by as being one of the best movies of all time, and it absolutely is my favorite.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor's Note: Dan Caffrey stands proudly over a mountain of lies.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=971967886", "og": {"site_name": "Consequence of Sound", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note: Dan Caffrey stands proudly over a mountain of lies.", "title": "Tim Heidecker: A Man With a Country", "url": "http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/02/tim-heidecker-a-man-with-a-country/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tim-heidecker-feat.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tim-heidecker-feat.jpg?w=640"}, "description": "Editor's Note: Dan Caffrey stands proudly over a mountain of lies.", "site": "@coslive", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@coslive"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "c9c929e58133a99b6cb8cdcf74044277"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://consequenceofsound.net/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dbe3add772e86e30b10b5b89084daa8e?s=16", "application-name": "Consequence of Sound", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/coslive", "published_time": "2015-02-18T05:00:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T15:23:47+00:00"}, "keywords": "cos exclusive features, film, interviews, adult swim, film criticism, gregg turkington, on cinema at the cinema, tim heidecker", "google-site-verification": "Nu-8yaladgF9AoZJeG_IRGZJL1n9KqOywliy3KFkpeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb55\"", "article_summary": "Right now, if someone put a gun to my head and said, \u201cName your favorite movie,\u201d that\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\nIt looks like we\u2019re almost out of time ourselves, so I\u2019m going to ask you one last question.\nHere you go.\u201d\u201cAh, you know, I\u2019m actually more in the mood for an Arnold Schwarzenegger film.\u201d\u201cWell, you came to the right store.\nAnd yet, to feel nothing but good is to feel nothing but empty, a fact Tim Heidecker probably knows all too well.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful, magical place, and I\u2019m really enjoying it."}
