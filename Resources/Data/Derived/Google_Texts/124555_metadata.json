And in the weeks and months to come, the Lakota elder from South Dakota\u2019s Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation is hoping that a court trial will determine, once and for all, what took place at Rapid City Regional Hospital in late summer 2011.\n\nRELATED: Was Lakota Man Victim of a Hate Crime in South Dakota Hospital? The Troubling Story of Vern Traversie\n\nTraversie underwent double-bypass surgery at the hospital on August 26, 2011 and was discharged on September 8. On the advice of an anonymous hospital employee, he had his home health-care worker from Timber Lake-based West Winds Home Health Care look at his abdomen and take photos.\n\nThe photos show scars from the 2011 surgery and prior procedures, and they show what seem to be deep, scattered wounds. Some of them appear to make three Ks. Traversie said his doctor at Indian Health Services in Eagle Butte was shocked, as was his pastor, who called it a hate crime.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to call it that, and when the FBI interviewed me, they said it wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Traversie said from his home in Eagle Butte. \u201cIt was a racial hate crime.\u201d\n\nHe said he asked his nurses at the time why his abdomen hurt so much. He also recalled that large numbers of people kept coming into his hospital room, asking to look.\n\n\u201cThere must have been 20, 30 different people,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was going on, why they were all so curious. Was it a unique surgery? I could feel the stitches in my chest, but I had so much pain in my abdomen.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Hundreds Descend on Rapid City Hospital in Support of Cheyenne River Elder\n\nTraversie said he requested a transfer to the rehab hospital, partially because he needed to practice walking, but also because he was afraid of a male nurse in the hospital\u2019s ICU.\n\n\u201cHe threatened me, he intimidated me, he grabbed and threw my arm up and down, and he used the F-word,\u201d Traversie said. \u201cI was sure he was going to start beating me. And I don\u2019t think he was ever chastised or disciplined.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vern Traversie has been waiting two and a half years for answers into the alleged hate crime attack he suffered while at Rapid City Regional Hospital.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/14/vern-traversie-and-his-two-and-half-year-wait-answers-154870", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/07/FEA-Photo-Pastor-Vern-Traversie-02_Facebook-copy-e1341939023524.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Vern Traversie and His Two and a Half Year Wait for Answers"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-05-14T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Vern Traversie and His Two and a Half Year Wait for Answers"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/14/vern-traversie-and-his-two-and-half-year-wait-answers-154870", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Vern Traversie, Galanda and Broadman, Gabe Galanda, KKK, Hate Crime, Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, Rapid City Regional Hospital, Scarred, Carved", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Vern Traversie and His Two and a Half Year Wait for Answers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f30\"", "article_summary": "Two and a half years ago, something happened to Vern Traversie.\nThe Troubling Story of Vern TraversieTraversie underwent double-bypass surgery at the hospital on August 26, 2011 and was discharged on September 8.\nTraversie said his doctor at Indian Health Services in Eagle Butte was shocked, as was his pastor, who called it a hate crime.\nRELATED: Was Lakota Man Victim of a Hate Crime in South Dakota Hospital?\n\u201cHe threatened me, he intimidated me, he grabbed and threw my arm up and down, and he used the F-word,\u201d Traversie said."}
