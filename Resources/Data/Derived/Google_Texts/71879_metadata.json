Rick Scott\u2019s call for an investigation of hospital finances, officially issued this week, had a familiar ring to Floridians in the health-care industry.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Gee, didn\u2019t we just do that?\u2019\u201d said Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association. She was one of those asked to testify at a 2011 hearing held by Scott\u2019s first hospital-financing panel, created shortly after he was sworn into office.\n\nThat one, the Commission on Review of Taxpayer Funded Hospital Districts, had a different title than the new one, the Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding. But their objectives were similar: to raise hard questions about the use of taxpayers\u2019 money in health care.\n\nThe targets: government-owned and private non-profit hospitals that receive direct subsidies and higher payment rates than other hospitals.\n\nScott\u2019s order says he wants heavy scrutiny of public health-care programs, especially Medicaid \u2013 the joint state and federal insurance program for certain low-income groups, such as children and the elderly \u2013 and a state regulation that requires health-care facilities to prove there is a need before getting a certificate to build one.\n\n\"Let's look at how we're spending our tax dollars,\" Scott told reporters at an informal question-answer session Thursday. \"Are we getting a good return for taxpayers, the ones who are putting the money up?\"\n\nThe chairman of the first commission, Florida TaxWatch President Dominic Calabro, thought Scott and some members of the panel wanted to find enough ammunition to justify getting rid of local hospital taxing districts. But that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nCalabro says the panel found each hospital district was different. Some taxing districts had \u201cpredatory practices, where money was treated with close to reckless disregard,\u201d he said. But others were honest brokers and had strong support in their communities.\n\nHospital taxing districts are an anachronism, Calabro said, created to cover the costs of indigent care in the years before the 1965 creation of Medicaid. But legislators would not vote to get rid of them, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like the idea of taxing districts, but don\u2019t want to give up their own,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first commission held 14 meetings before issuing a report in December 2011, which was much milder than expected. It didn\u2019t call for privatization of public hospitals or abolition of taxing districts; instead, it recommended several ways to avoid conflicts of interest and asked for a fairer distribution of funds.\n\nWhile some of those reforms have occurred, the report has had little impact. Whether Scott gets what he wants from the new commission, said Quick, \u201cdepends on who is appointed and who is executive director and what process they use.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s executive order, dated May 5, says he will appoint all members of the commission, including its chair, and will designate an executive director. State employees from the Agency for Health Care Administration will provide staff support. His press office also released a list of topics to be studied.\n\nThe timing led some to suspect that Scott\u2019s order creating a new commission was meant as a rebuke to the state\u2019s hospitals. In the just-past legislative session, hospitals lobbied hard for passage of a Florida Senate proposal to accept billions of dollars under the Affordable Care Act. It would provide insurance coverage to about 800,000 of Florida\u2019s low-income uninsured.\n\nIn his executive order, Scott says he wants the commission to \u201cinvestigate the extent to which taxpayer-funded hospitals pay for lobbyists, campaign contributions, and advertising.\u201d While all hospitals receive taxpayer funds, especially from Medicare, Scott is thought to be referring to two categories of hospitals: publicly owned, like Jackson Memorial, and private non-profit hospitals like Tampa General that receive extra tax money because they treat a disproportionate share of the uninsured.\n\nScott\u2019s order says he wants to know whether public funds cause health-care costs to rise and whether they improve access and quality of care. He wants to know whether Medicaid patients have better or worse outcomes than others and whether \u201ccertificate of need\u201d laws have a positive or negative effect on affordability.\n\nIn the list of tasks he wants the commission to carry out, Scott uses the word \u201cinvestigate\u201d a dozen times.\n\nThat caused Quick to say she suspects Scott has an agenda that could harm members of her association. She said of the new commission: \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money and a waste of time, a diversion from what we ought to be dealing with.\u201d\n\nQuick was referring to the fact that Florida\u2019s House and Senate have not been able to reach a budget for the state\u2019s fiscal year starting July 1. At issue are two related health-care disputes: whether Florida will accept federal funds to expand coverage to the poor through a privatized version of Medicaid, and whether federal health officials will renew the state\u2019s request for a continuation of $2.2 billion in funds for hospitals and clinics. This \u201cLow Income Pool (LIP)\u201d funding stream is scheduled to expire June 30.\n\nFlorida officials have sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in federal court, claiming that HHS is trying to force the state to accept federal Medicaid expansion funding by threatening the loss of LIP funds. Federal officials have said there is no quid pro quo, that the LIP program was set up to be temporary and was already extended for a year at Florida\u2019s request.\n\nScott went to Washington to see HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Wednesday in hopes of winning a verbal assurance of continued LIP funds, even though legally HHS can\u2019t act until the end of a public comment period. Burwell made no explicit denial, but notes from the meeting make clear she offered no encouragement either, saying Florida had not taken the steps HHS required in order to justify continued funding.\n\nScott left unhappy, and on Thursday the state\u2019s legal team asked a federal judge in Pensacola for an injunction requiring HHS to reconsider LIP funds for Florida without regard to the state\u2019s decision to opt out of Medicaid expansion.\n\nQuick and four other Florida hospital executives, who were in Washington for an American Hospital Association meeting, were invited to meet with Burwell along with a couple of dozen others on Wednesday just before Scott arrived, Quick said.\n\nThe hospital executives wanted the same thing Scott did \u2013 continued LIP funding \u2013 although the hospitals and the governor continue to disagree vehemently on the question of taking Medicaid funds to cover the uninsured.\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent with WUSF in Tampa.
