WASHINGTON (AP) — A metro spokesman says an off-duty police officer shot a man with a knife in Union Station.

Dan Stesseltold The Washington Post that the officer fired several shots Saturday and hit the suspect and possibly a female bystander.

The shooting shut down parts of Union Station and the surrounding area.

The conditions of those shot were not immediately clear. Stessel said the bystander may have been struck in the leg.

Stessel said the incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. on an escalator between the Metro facility and the rail station.

He said the investigation would be handled by D.C. police, who tweeted Saturday, “There is no active shooter or terrorism incident ongoing at Union Station. A suspect is in custody. Investigation in progress.”

The off-duty officer was not identified.
