Casey.\n\nBitcoin Latest Price: $619.97, up 0.3% (via CoinDesk)\n\nCrossing Our Desk:\n\n- Let\u2019s get this straight up front: Soylent is not people. They even say so on their website. Soylent also is not a nutritional supplement. Soylent is an actual food product and the company that makes it, a California startup, is now accepting bitcoin.\n\nSoylent started off as an experiment in healthy eating by founder Rob Rhinehart. He wrote on his blog about this powdered drink he\u2019d created, that combined all the essential ingredients of food. The post went viral, and he found himself flooded with people interested in his drink. So he did what any entrepreneurial minded Millennial would do: He started a crowdfunding drive.\n\nHe named his concoction \u201cSoylent,\u201d a self-consciously ironic reference to the 1973 sci-fi movie \u201cSoylent Green,\u201d a dystopian tale of a world gone wrong in which the beleaguered population is fed a product called Soylent Green \u2013 which, Charlton Heston discovers, is made of ground-up human beings.\n\nThis real-world Soylent \u201cis not made of humans,\u201d Anastassia Laskey, the company\u2019s vice president of marketing, said with a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no soy in it, either.\u201d It\u2019s not a nutritional supplement, either, she said. It\u2019s been approved by the FDA as a food (if you\u2019re interested to know what\u2019s in it, everything is on the company\u2019s website).\n\nSoylent is a classic example of a collaborative-economy enterprise, and from the beginning, its customers have been asking for a way to buy it using bitcoins. The company took its product onto the online marketplace Shopify in May, and was immediately looking for a way to integrate bitcoin into its payments options. That became feasible with Shopify\u2019s new agreement with CoinBase for processing bitcoin transactions.\n\nSelling a product that\u2019s named after a fictional product that\u2019s made out of people has been a challenge for Ms. Laskey, but the name has some benefits, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation-starter.\u201d (Paul Vigna)\n\n- We mentioned yesterday the auction of bitcoins.com, the domain name owned by the bankrupt Mt. Gox. If you\u2019re interested in following its progress, the folks over at Heritage Auctions sent us the webpage of the auction. The auction is slated for July 24, but you can preview the auction now, and apparently, submit a bid. The current bid is $240,000. The auction page had 20,000 hits as of this morning, according to Heritage. (Paul Vigna)\n\n- There\u2019s a friendly (we assume) competition between the islands of Man and Jersey in the British Channel to become the home office of the digital revolution. In Jersey, they\u2019ve got a whole crypto chamber of commerce going, and last week, the island announced the launch of a bitcoin hedge fund domiciled on the island. Now, Man is striking back.\n\nA new startup called Crypto Next has launched from a quay in Man. The firm is building what it describes as a turn-key product for merchants to accept bitcoin payments, including bank accounts and white-label currency exchange platforms. The fact that the system is located in Man means that it\u2019s subject to Man\u2019s regulations, which may be a sight more amiable to cryptocurrencies than other locales.\n\nAs part of its launch, Crypto Next is issuing 5 million Crypto Next coins through a crowd sale on its website, which began today. They\u2019ve sold about 1% of them so far. (Paul Vigna)\n\n- Grooveshark, an online music-streaming service, announced that it is now accepting bitcoin for payments. The site, which operates as a sort of search engine for music, allowing users to search for and play streaming music.\n\nThe service is using Stripe, a payments processor that itself announced a few months ago it would start offering bitcoin as a payments option.
