Larry Hogan\u2019s 2% across-the-board budget cuts on Friday, Sen. Adelaide Eckardt of the Senate Budget and Tax committee questioned the future of 68 mental health program facilities DHMH has created the past two years through aid provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEckardt, a psychiatric nurse from the Eastern Shore, described DHMHs\u2019 growth of mental health programs in the past two years as \u201cpretty remarkable,\u201d but voiced concerns that if the department doesn\u2019t locate state funds to cover reducing federal funds, Maryland will begin backtracking.\n\nThe state had a premier public health system in the early nineties, but then began to go downhill, she said.\n\n\u201cWe put it (Maryland) on a road to restoring some of that and now it\u2019s downhill again,\u201d Eckardt said.\n\n\u201cIf you start making reductions in the core funding then sometimes that puts you in a situation where you don\u2019t have really enough staff,\u201d Eckardt said to the DHMH panel at the committee briefing. \u201cSo, will you be at the place where you\u2019ll have to close programs, because there won\u2019t be enough people to do what is expected?\u201d\n\nNew health secretary concerned\n\nNew Health Secretary Van Mitchell said he is concerned and believes that the foundation of the health department is community-based public health programs. Maryland will be heavily affected with cuts to programs that are mostly situated in rural areas.\n\nRight now, the health department is receiving feedback from several counties to determine what effect projected reductions will have.\n\n\u201cSo yes, is the answer to your question,\u201d said Dr. Laura Herrera, deputy secretary of public health. \u201cAnd there are implications to programs and the cutting of those programs at the local level. I think that with the last few years and the decline in core funding, the counties have generously overmatched the core funds, but that seems to be going away.\u201d\n\nCuts to mental health programs\n\nDHMH is looking at an estimated $7 million in projected cuts to mental health funding, adding to that is looming decrease of federal funding, as funding for the expansion of health care under the Affordable Care Act begins to become the responsibility of the state.\n\nAccording to DHMH, since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), full Medicaid benefits have been given to an additional 100,000 people at the start, equaling $200 million infederal funds. Now enrollment has grown to 1.3 million people included in the full Medicaid benefits. The full cost has been covered by federal funding, but in fiscal year 2017 the federal funding will drop to 95%, and then by 1% every following year.\n\nDr. Herrera has been working with health departments over the last two years to figure how to diversify the way the public health department funds itself. \u201cBecause not only are we seeing declines in our state general funds, but we\u2019re certainly seeing declines in our categorical federal funds.\u201d\n\nCategorical funds go toward state programs dedicated to chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes.\n\nDr. Herrera hopes to reorganize programs and regionalize, something Sen. Eckardt has seen success with in the Eastern Shore. It would involve regional partnerships among programs and hospitals, and funding through partnering with private sector agencies.\n\nLooking for more cooperation among departments\n\nSecretary Mitchell believes funding can come from other departments within the state. \u201cThe state has a lot of assets, whether it\u2019s DHR, DHMH, MSDE, or everything else,\u201d referring to Human Resources, Health and Education departments.\n\nMitchell told the committee that if they help him to \u201cbreak down the silos\u201d and get departments to do a \u201cbetter job working together and reaching out to one another\u201d then maybe they will all come together to find a solution.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of assets still, it\u2019s tough times, but there\u2019s no reason that we cannot help each other out,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nEckardt agreed, \u201cWe\u2019ll all certainly work with you as we shape where we are going to be.\u201d\n\nHealth Budget Subcommittee Chair Richard Madaleno also agreed, saying together the DHMH department and the committee \u201cWill try to do more, with even less\u201d moving forward.\n\nrebeccaannlessner@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene discussed Gov.
