Nebraska state Senator Brad Ashford has won the Democratic primary race for the 2nd Congressional District in Omaha and will face incumbent Lee Terry in the general election.

Ashford easily defeated fellow Democrat Mark Aupperle on Tuesday and will face eight-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the November general election. Aupperle, an Omaha landscaper, had raised no money and done little campaigning.

Ashford, an Omaha attorney, is ineligible to seek re-election in the Nebraska Legislature because of term limits. In recent years he has successfully pushed for state reforms of Nebraska's prison system and services for troubled juveniles.

Terry, a Republican, is an outspoken supporter of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and says he is working with the GOP to try to repeal the federal health care law.

The congressman issued a statement Tuesday night saying, "Tonight, I am extremely humbled and grateful that the people of Omaha have continued to respond to my message of holding Barack Obama's Washington accountable. The reality is we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of fighting to do. ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced. The Keystone XL Pipeline needs to be approved. Washington needs to be held accountable. There is a lot to fight against, but there is also a lot to fight for and until we have the government we deserve, I will not stop fighting for the people of Omaha.

"I'd like to thank all of the people who have invested their time and energy in supporting my campaign - my family and staff, friends and volunteers - without this strong coalition, I would not be where I am today."
