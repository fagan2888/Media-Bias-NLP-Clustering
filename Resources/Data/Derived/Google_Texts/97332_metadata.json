Could you source and create the thousands of inputs that go into what on its face is fairly simple? If so, you\u2019re in possession of superhuman mechanical skills.\n\nAt the same time, the act of literally constructing a computer from scratch with no parts \u201cimported\u201d from across the street or around the world would be a tragic waste of your time. It would be because it would likely require all of your years on this earth to build what would be an unattractive, slow and poorly performing version of the sleek, fast, and endlessly capable machine in front of you.\n\nWhat your use of a computer should tell you about yourself is that whether you know it or not, you\u2019re an ardent free trader. Your life without open trade would be horribly bleak. But thanks to the globalized division of labor that defines free trade, you have the world\u2019s abundance before you at prices that continue to fall.\n\nAll of which brings us to the economic importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), not just to the U.S., but to the rest of the world. Without getting into the weeds, the TPP intends to reduce barriers to trade among twelve different countries including the U.S., Canada, Australia, Peru, Japan, and Vietnam. American voters should hope the pact passes.\n\nView this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Why rich countries open their borders to trade (and poor countries don't).", "title": "Why All Americans Should Support the Trans-Pacific Partnership: New at Reason", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/09/why-all-americans-should-support-the-tpp", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14549661475538.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14549661475538.jpg", "description": "Why rich countries open their borders to trade (and poor countries don't).", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why All Americans Should Support the Trans-Pacific Partnership: New at Reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-09T12:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/reason-staff"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "But thanks to the globalized division of labor that defines free trade, you have the world\u2019s abundance before you at prices that continue to fall.\nAll of which brings us to the economic importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), not just to the U.S., but to the rest of the world.\nQuick question: could you manufacture all by yourself the computer on which you\u2019re reading this opinion piece?\nCould you source and create the thousands of inputs that go into what on its face is fairly simple?\nWhat your use of a computer should tell you about yourself is that whether you know it or not, you\u2019re an ardent free trader."}
