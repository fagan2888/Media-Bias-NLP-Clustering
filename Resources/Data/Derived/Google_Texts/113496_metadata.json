(Photo: AP ) Story Highlights Employers speak about their concerns about the ACA\n\nMost employers offer health insurance to full-time workers\n\nA marketplace for businesses with few than 50 workers offers insurance plans\n\nWhat worries Cincinnati business owners about the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t a new government penalty if they don\u2019t provide health insurance to employees. It\u2019s all the other tidal changes rippling out as the act rolls into its second full year:\n\nUnexpected cost increases. More government reports. Plan changes in mid-year that distress and confuse workers.\n\n\u201cI just got our insurance bill, and I\u2019ll tell you, it makes my chest hurt,\u201d said Don Wright, chief operating officer for the Mason biotech company Assurex Health. \u201cOur monthly bill is more than we spent on all company operations four years ago.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Affordable Care Act opened with a colossal computer problem that took months to resolve. Ultimately, more than 8 million Americans bought insurance through the government-mediated marketplaces. The next annual \u201copen enrollment\u201d will be Nov. 15 through Dec. 15 for plans to start Jan. 1. It\u2019s the chance to shop for a 2015 plan if consumers want to change coverage.\n\nThe open enrollment this year is of particular interest to employers because in January, businesses with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to all full-time workers.\n\nCompanies with 100 or more employees who don\u2019t offer insurance will face a new government penalty in 2015. The penalty becomes effective in 2016 for employers of between 50 and 99 workers who do not offer coverage.\n\nThe penalty is $2,000 for each employee, after the first 30.\n\nNot many companies in Ohio or Kentucky, however, face the prospect of paying the penalty. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that health insurance is part of the employment package in nearly 97 percent of Ohio companies of more than 50 employees and nearly 40 percent of companies with fewer than 50 workers.\n\nNearly 99 percent of Kentucky\u2019s employers of more than 50 people offer health insurance; 36 percent of businesses with fewer than 50 provide health insurance.\n\nMost employers in the United States employ fewer than 50 full-timers and will never have to face that mandate. Understanding that reality can calm business owners\u2019 worries about the government law, said Michaela Hawn Burriss, the Ohio representative of the Small Business Majority, a nonprofit founded and supported by the nation\u2019s small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe ACA can be complex, and it\u2019s important to know what your responsibilities are, but what\u2019s more important is to make sure you\u2019re not fearing an obligation under the law,\u201d Hawn Burriss said.\n\nBusiness owners with fewer than 50 workers now have access to another insurance marketplace called the Small Business Health Options Program that offers coverage at four levels. Hawn Burriss said the Small Business Majority offers counselors to help employers navigate the marketplace.\n\nEmployers with fewer than 25 workers and marketplace insurance plans also qualify for a tax credit worth up to 50 percent of premium costs.\n\nLast year, President Barack Obama delayed implementing the business mandate to give employers more time to figure out how to proceed. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted the requirement would kill jobs or force employers to cut hours or workers. Mary Miller, chief executive officer of Cincinnati\u2019s JANCOA Janitorial Services, went on CNN to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of business, and that\u2019s not OK with me.\u201d\n\nThis week, though, Miller\u2019s words are not as dire, although she said she\u2019s still concerned about the ACA\u2019s effect on her business.\n\n\u201cFear captured us, too,\u201d Miller said with a laugh. \u201cWe have a healthy dose still, and that is because of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen going forward.\u201d\n\nJANCOA employs 380 full-time workers and has offered health insurance since the 1990s \u2013 a rarity in the commercial-cleaning industry, Miller said. The trendline on costs, though, troubles her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still the concern because nobody knows, including our broker, where the cost is going to go,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest fear, that unknown.\u201d\n\nAt Robbins Inc., which manufactures hardwood floors for sports venues, particularly NBA arenas, health insurance has long been part of the employment package for the 220 workers. But Human Resources Manager Kimberly Jackson said ACA-driven changes in insurance are often beyond the employer\u2019s control. One plan switched from a calendar to a fiscal year operation, and in October, a new deductible went into effect.\n\n\u201cFor individuals who thought they\u2019d made their $500 deductible for the year, they\u2019re trying to figure out what to do next, now that they\u2019ve got another $500 deductible to meet,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cThese are employees working in a manufacturing facility, where week-to-week dollars matter, and it\u2019s very challenging. We were very discouraged. We sought every alternative, but we are really hemmed in.\u201d\n\nDespite the tightening in his chest from his insurance bill, Don Wright of Assurex Health said insurance coverage is a part of doing business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying things like, \u2018The penalty is actually cheaper to me than providing the coverage.\u2019 Lots of people mouth off about stuff like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doubtful that\u2019s true. You cannot possibly say as a business owner that it\u2019s better to pay a penalty to the government than to cover your employees.\u201d\n\nNew for employers in 2015\n\nCome Jan. 1, the Affordable Care Act will require an employer to:\n\n\u2022Provide insurance coverage equal in quality to plans offered through the insurance marketplace. This is required of any employer of more than 50 workers.\n\n\u2022Pay a penalty to the government if the employer of more than 100 workers chooses not to offer health insurance. The penalty is called the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment. That penalty kicks in for businesses with 50 to 99 workers in 2016.\n\n\u2022Provide notice of coverage options to each employee, no matter if the worker is part-time or full-time.\n\nFor more information, go to healthcare.gov.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1wFboAU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The health care economy still is absorbing the changes from the Affordable Care Act", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "The health care economy still is absorbing the changes from the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Employers face 2015 health care penalty", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2014/10/29/employers-face-health-care-penalty/18144771/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The health care economy still is absorbing the changes from the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Employers face 2015 health care penalty", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac4f041d82dbd60b4f75b6609d823448da334842/c=576-0-3552-2976&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health insurance", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health insurance", "title": "Employers face 2015 health care penalty", "author": "By Anne Saker asaker@enquirer.com", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ea1d3e0785b4660dfce36e328e425600b0edd99/c=948-0-3180-2976/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/297d5e762dff0f217c58350dd0b3a4a52b5dfdde/c=576-0-3552-2976/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a600ceab67d617637d33dd14637879af2790014/c=80-0-4048-2976/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5378eec57d3ca21e140119c3995177bc54f75f9/c=0-327-4128-2649&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-29T19:35:14-04:00", "shorthed": "In 2015, employer mandate kicks in", "articleid": 18144771, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/11a9a70e88b30786378698daaa70feaa409f3038/c=0-327-4128-2649/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb3967ca1003655e31651f60d53466bd2d9bd1f3/c=1227-0-2901-2976/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/10/29/acaapp.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3457\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 99 percent of Kentucky\u2019s employers of more than 50 people offer health insurance; 36 percent of businesses with fewer than 50 provide health insurance.\nCompanies with 100 or more employees who don\u2019t offer insurance will face a new government penalty in 2015.\n\u2022Pay a penalty to the government if the employer of more than 100 workers chooses not to offer health insurance.\nApplication and instructions paper work for the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nThe penalty becomes effective in 2016 for employers of between 50 and 99 workers who do not offer coverage."}
