Same goes with family on Thanksgiving.\n\nBut, in an election season like this one, politics is in the air and it\u2019s easy to forget this rule of thumb once the turkey is served.\n\nSo, ABC News spoke to two etiquette experts -- Jacqueline Whitmore, an author and founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach, Fla., and Diane Gottsman, who runs the Protocol School of Texas -- to get some tips.\n\nBoth said that in a perfect world, Thanksgiving would be a time to catch up and rekindle relationships with loved ones. But they acknowledged that a side dish of politics was inevitable.\n\nAre political topics ever fair game at the dinner table?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cI think everything is fair game. Whether it\u2019s appropriate or not is the question. It\u2019s appropriate to have a healthy conversation. Etiquette is all about being mindful of others and also being considerate.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cThe protocol at the dinner table is to make pleasant conversation and interact with each other, so normally we would say to stay away from politics, but the reality is, it\u2019s not going to happen. So, if you\u2019re talking politics and chances are you will, you need to be respectful of other people\u2019s opinions. It should be a conversation not a food fight.\u201d\n\nWhat are your tips for making the discussion tolerable?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cAs long as you keep it light and positive that\u2019s the most important thing. In a political year, different people have a different way of dealing and discussing different topics. Downer topics are not necessarily the best to discuss.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cIt\u2019s all up for debate, because there\u2019s going to be someone that\u2019s offended with anything someone says. If you have to talk politics, make that 10 percent of your conversation and 90 percent should be on reflection around the table. It\u2019s not okay to be combative with your views and express them at the Thanksgiving table.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s say politics come up and things are getting awkward. What\u2019s the most polite way to put a stop to an uncomfortable conversation and change the subject?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cIf possible, talk about topics that are most pleasant like holiday memories, food and travel. Or if it\u2019s too uncomfortable volunteer in the kitchen, remove yourself from the situation.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cI always suggest the host take the lead, saying, \u2018It\u2019s clear that we all have an opinion -- that we can agree on -- but I think it\u2019s important to reflect on why we\u2019re sitting here together.\u2019 If you are going to talk politics the bottom line is you should do it respectfully. It\u2019s important to show tolerance and consider each other\u2019s views.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re the host, what\u2019s the best way to set ground rules without appearing disrespectful?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cYou can always start the conversation on a positive tone by saying, \u2018Let\u2019s all talk about what we\u2019re thankful for this year,\u2019 instead of just letting everyone talk about what they want.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cYou already know Uncle Bob is just a staunch Republican, and everyone at the table are Democrats. So, set ground rules with Uncle Bob by saying, \u2018We will talk politics for three minutes then we will change the subject.\u2019 Tell everyone it\u2019s going to happen and Uncle Bob has to be accepted for who he is. It\u2019s okay to have family banter -- we wouldn\u2019t have family if we didn\u2019t have banter -- and who knows, you might just learn something you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s say your in-laws are in town and you are curious to know their thoughts on the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). What\u2019s the best way to ask at the dinner table without steering the conversation in negative direction?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cI would probably ask them on the side, not in front of everyone, because you\u2019re going to launch a bigger discussion. Pull them aside when you\u2019re preparing the meal.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cIf you want to know their views it would be best to say, \u2018I\u2019m not certain that I\u2019m really working with all of the facts. Will you just share your opinion with me? Maybe I\u2019m just not understanding.\u2019 Being informed is different than combat.\u201d\n\nAny final tips for a relaxing Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nWHITMORE: \u201cKeep [the dinner conversation] light and positive, and if someone gets in a heated discussion change the subject or steer it in another direction.\u201d\n\nGOTTSMAN: \u201cCome to the table with your own idea of what you want to get out of the meal. The Thanksgiving table is not an open forum, it\u2019s interaction, it\u2019s conversation, it\u2019s asking people about their lives. We know what\u2019s on television, we know the political parties of the people sitting at the table. Unyielding views will not grow relationships stronger. You want people to remember you fondly, not grateful that you\u2019re walking out of the door.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "How to Avoid Talking Politics at Your Thanksgiving Dinner", "description": "How to Avoid Talking Politics at Your Thanksgiving Dinner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Politics and religion: two topics that are best avoided with coworkers and new acquaintances.
