The poll found that a bare majority, 51 percent, wants Congress to amend the law to make it clear that people are entitled to help regardless of what their state leaders do. But 44 percent prefer that Congress leave the law as is and let states decide whether they want to create insurance exchanges that would allow their residents to receive subsidies. \u2026. The poll found 27 percent of Americans support the law while 38 percent oppose it, and 34 percent say they neither support nor oppose it.\n\nThese statistics present an impossible problem for Republicans. By a nearly two to one margin, the those polled either support the law or don\u2019t have an opinion either way. The level of opposition to the law has shrunk to the same level as the percentage of self-identified Republicans and conservatives in polls. This means that the opposition to the ACA is shrinking, but firmly located within the Republican Party.\n\nThe fact that a seventeen point majority want the subsidies to continue without restriction, while 69% of Republicans want the subsidies to go away means that Republicans are guaranteed to pay a heavy political price no matter what they do. Republicans are being crushed beneath the weight of their ginned up hatred for the ACA.\n\nObamacare is now a winning issue for Democrats. The more Republicans that nationally discuss repealing the law, the stronger the Democratic position becomes. Democrats could have a huge victory in 2016 because Republican voters are forcing to their candidates to stick to repealing the health care law.\n\nThe ACA turned into a winning issue because people like having health insurance. Republicans are sowing the seeds for future Democratic victories by continuing to fight battles that they\u2019ve already lost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new poll shows Republican hate sowing the seeds of future failure as Obamacare is a winning national issue for Democrats.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A new poll shows Republican hate sowing the seeds of future failure as Obamacare is a winning national issue for Democrats.", "title": "Republicans Crushed As Obamacare Transforms Into A Winning Issue For Democrats", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/09/republicans-crushed-obamacare-transforms-winning-issue-democrats.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Obama_On_Computer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-09T12:08:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-05-09T12:08:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T12:08:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfba4\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare is now a winning issue for Democrats.\nA new poll shows Republican hate sowing the seeds of future failure as Obamacare is a winning national issue for Democrats.\nThe ACA turned into a winning issue because people like having health insurance.\nRepublicans are sowing the seeds for future Democratic victories by continuing to fight battles that they\u2019ve already lost.\nDemocrats could have a huge victory in 2016 because Republican voters are forcing to their candidates to stick to repealing the health care law."}
