Nicolas Cage

Cage’s recent coverage in the tabloids for agreeing to return a stolen Tyrannosaurus Rex skull that was illegally taken from Mongolia wasn’t the first time his extravagant spending made headlines. The National Treasure star was slapped with a $6.2 million tax lien in 2009 after blowing his Hollywood fortune on outlandish purchases like a menagerie of exotic pets, including monitor lizards and vipers, a pyramid-shaped tomb in New Orleans where he wants to be buried and sealed after his death, a collection of shrunken heads and a massive car collection, including nine Rolls Royce roadsters.
