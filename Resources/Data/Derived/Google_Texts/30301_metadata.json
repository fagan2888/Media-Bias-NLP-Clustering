Conservatives are constantly belittling the ACA for its failure to cover all the uninsured \u2014 only one-third covered, it\u2019s often asserted, although that number is out of date and also ignores the fact that the law wasn\u2019t supposed to cover undocumented immigrants.

Um, refusal of red states to expand Medicaid and their refusal to help implement the rest of the law:\n\nPhoto\n\nIn states that want Obamacare to work, most of the eligible uninsured have already been covered.
