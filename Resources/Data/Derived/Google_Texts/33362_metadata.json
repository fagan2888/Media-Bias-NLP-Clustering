Biden filled in for President Obama this week for the White House\u2019s weekly radio address, touting Obamacare in an effort to convince customers to sign up for health insurance just weeks before the enrollment deadline.\n\n\u201cI know this is the time of year when we make resolutions to take care of our health. Whether it\u2019s joining a gym, or eating healthier. But there\u2019s one thing you can do right now that will also make a big difference in your health, that is getting quality, affordable health insurance through the affordable care act,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nHe touted increasing enrollment numbers, low cost, and medicare benefits under the affordable care act before imploring new members to sign up now.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare employer mandate kicks in Jan. 1\n\n\u201cEveryone is beginning to realize what millions of you already know. The affordable care act is working. And we\u2019re just getting started because there are millions more of you who can get quality and affordable health insurance if you sign up before February 15 of this year.\u201d\n\nThe health care focused weekly address comes just after the employer healthcare mandate took effect on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nCompanies with more than 100 full-time workers must offer affordable health insurance to at least 70 percent of their staff or face a hefty penalty tax.\n\nThe employer mandate was supposed to take effect in 2014, but the Obama administration delayed it until this year.\n\nThe fine for companies that do not comply with the mandate is $174 a month times the number of full-time employees, minus 80 workers.\n\nIf a company offers insurance that is not considered affordable or comprehensive then the employer must pay $261 a month for each employee who received subsidized coverage on an individual exchange, CNN Money reported Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joseph R.
