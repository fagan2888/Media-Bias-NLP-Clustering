A mangled SUV remained in the middle of I-26 just west of I-526 after a fatal multi-vehicle accident in the westbound lanes Saturday afternoon.

A Charleston woman died in a multi-vehicle wreck on I-26 Saturday afternoon after her attempt to exit the roadway set off a chain reaction, according to the Highway Patrol.

Twenty-year-old Omea Johnson's Mazda was heading west on I-26 shortly after 3 p.m. when she tried to exit onto Remount Road and sideswiped another vehicle, according to officials. Two other cars were also caught in the chain reaction, said Cpl. Sonny Collins. The Mazda crashed into a retaining wall, and Johnson was killed.

Collins said Johnson's actions caused the wreck.

Four others were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.

All westbound lanes were closed Saturday afternoon while the scene was cleared.
