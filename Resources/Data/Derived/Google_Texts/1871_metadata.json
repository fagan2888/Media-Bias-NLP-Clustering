As part of this, new agers don\u2019t fall within the formal organizational life of Buddhism or Hinduism but often appropriate various ideas and practices from Eastern religions, alongside other influences.\n\nA good place to start is \u201cMelton\u2019s Encyclopedia of American Religions\u201d (Gale), issued in eight updated editions, most recently in 2009. This standard reference work should be in any well-stocked library. Author J. Gordon Melton is a Baylor University professor whose decades of research make him the acknowledged expert on the taxonomy of U.S. faiths, especially thousands of young, small, marginal and obscure groups most people have never heard of. Note that the new age phenomenon extends well beyond formal organizations listed in such an encyclopedia to include free-floating ideas, fashions, books, gurus and other influences.\n\nMelton divides all U.S. religions into 24 categories, one of which is the \u201cSpiritualist, Psychic, and New Age Family,\u201d which encompasses everything from the Swedenborgians to \u201cdrug-related\u201d sects to flying saucer believers. His psychic or new age sub-category lists groups with such names as Inner Peace, Cosmic Wisdom, Mindstream, Psychiana, Natural Hygiene, Oneness United, and World Catalyst. Debatably, this is also where Melton places controversial faiths like L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s Church of Scientology, Sun Myung Moon\u2019s Unification Church, and Jim Jones\u2019s homicidal People\u2019s Temple (though it was affiliated with the respectable Christian Church -- Disciples of Christ).\n\nMelton distinguishes \u201cnew\u201d age from \u201cancient wisdom\u201d creeds like Rosicrucianism and Theosophy. He also sees links with venerable \u201coccult\u201d (that is, hidden wisdom) practices such as astrology, numerology, tarot cards, palm reading, and divination. New age literature and coursework may refer to the Bible, but mostly in terms of alleged esoteric truths a la ancient Gnosticism, as opposed to mainstream Judaism and Christianity (though there\u2019s overlap on the margins). Melton says the movement centers on consciousness rather than doctrines, and that while typical groups are \u201cvery loosely organized,\u201d some are \u201chighly structured and even authoritarian.\u201d\n\nWhere did the movement come from?\n\nTo continue reading, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LISA ASKS:\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the definition of \u201cnew age\u201d thinking?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY ANSWERS:\r\n\r\nThis loosely diffuse movement, largely located in America, \u00a0is so \r\nindeterminate that it\u2019s tempting to simply say \u201cnew age\u201d covers any \r\nrecently formed \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201cpsychic\u201d or \u201cmindful\u201d or \u201cself-discovery\u201d \r\ngroups that don\u2019t fit snugly into other religious categories.
