Citizens United v. FEC. Bush v. Gore. Parents Involved. U.S. v. Windsor. Even 1942\u2019s Wickard v. Filburn. Thanks to Republican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson, another Court decision has been thrown into the political arena for fiery debate.\n\nMarbury v. Madison.\n\nYes, that Marbury v. Madison, the landmark 1803 opinion establishing the basis for the concept of judicial review. Yes, the Marbury in which Chief Justice John Marshall penned words central to the American concept of the separation of powers and the role of the judicial branch of government:\n\n\u201cIt is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each.\u201d\n\nThose words are not only seared into the brains of generations of Con Law students, but also engraved in a wall of the Supreme Court building itself.\n\nConservative candidate Ben Carson, though, is not so sure. He expressed his skepticism to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday:\n\nWALLACE: Do you believe that the president must observe a decision by the Supreme Court? CARSON: Well, what I said is the president doesn\u2019t have to agree with it. WALLACE: No, of course not. But does he have to \u2014 but does he have to enforce it? CARSON: Well, Dred Scott, a perfect example. You know, the Supreme Court came up with this and Abraham Lincoln did not agree with it. Now, admittedly, it caused a lot of conflict and eventually led to a civil war, but we\u2019re in a better place because of it. WALLACE: But does the president have to carry out a Supreme Court ruling? CARSON: The way our Constitution is set up, the president or the executive branch is obligated to carry out the laws of the land. The laws of the land, according to our Constitution, are provided by the legislative branch. WALLACE: But, sir \u2014 CARSON: The laws of the land are not provided by the judiciary branch. So\u2013 WALLACE: But, sir, since Marbury v. Madison in 1803, we have lived under the principle of judicial review which says, if the Supreme Court says this is the law, this is constitutional, the rest \u2014 the executive has to observe that. CARSON: And I have said, this is an area we need to discuss. We need to get into a discussion of this because it has changed from the original intent. And \u2014 WALLACE: So, you\u2019re saying this is an open question as far as you\u2019re concerned? CARSON: It is an open question. It needs to be discussed.\n\nI like Dr. Carson. I\u2019m all for discussion. But saying that Marbury presents \u201can open question\u201d is like calling Darwinian evolution \u201ca theory.\u201d Strictly speaking? Sure. But, in ordinary conversation, saying either will put a lot of listeners on guard, waiting for the other shoe to drop and the speaker to bring up the flatness of the earth or the 861 argument used by income tax protestors like Wesley Snipes. You\u2019ll sound delusional at worst and amateurish at best. And, no, dropping in the phrase \u201coriginal intent\u201d does not help here.\n\nDr. Carson is a neurosurgeon and a very good one at that. Ben Carson\u2019s no lawyer or historian. So, in a sense, he is an amateur at American political history or Constitutional law.\n\nCarson is certainly not the only person vying for the Oval Office who has never taken a Con Law class, though. Seventy-nine people have filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission stating their intention to run as Republicans in the 2016 presidential race, most of whom are neither attorneys nor historians.\n\nFirst, I thought, \u201cAre some of these people inadvertently running for President? Has the GOP gone with an opt-out procedure where any party member who doesn\u2019t affirmatively declare that he\u2019s not running for President is automatically assumed to be in the race?\u201d\n\nNext, I became curious about what other non-lawyer presidential hopefuls thought about Dr. Carson\u2019s remarks. So, I asked a sampling of non-lawyer GOP candidates whether they thought that the President must defer to SCOTUS when it rules that a law violates the Constitution, as well as their views on judicial review more generally. (Sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get ahold of Ole Savior, but I did try to be fair to little-known candidates.)\n\nThe Optometrist Ophthalmologist: The Rand Paul campaign pointed me to this video clip of the Kentucky senator (and eye doctor) describing his picture of the role of the judiciary in front of the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe CPA: Mark Everson, former IRS Commissioner under George W. Bush, said, \u201cI respect the separation of powers and the role of the courts in our system of government. The Supreme Court doesn\u2019t always get it right, but plays an important role, particularly when it corrects congressional and executive overreach.\u201d\n\nThe Construction Company Owner: Michael Petyo, who has never held elected office but who has run in numerous races since 1996, is proud that he was the first to declare his candidacy for the 2016 election. In his response to my queries, Petyo sent several revisions to his comments, the last of which simply read, \u201cYes, some branch of government must determine whether a law is constitutional and MVM says its the judicial branch. From an Attorney\u2019s point of view.\u201d\n\nThe Investment Manager: Brian Russell (self-professed Dealbreaker regular) said that \u201cthe Constitution is pretty clear on this issue. Article II, Section 3, Clause 5 of the Constitution, or the \u201cTake Care Clause,\u201d states that laws must be faithfully executed by the President. This is true whether the President agrees with them or not. While the law may not come from the judicial branch, its interpretations validate the law.\u201d Russell also noted, \u201cI think I understand the point Dr. Carson was trying to make, but don\u2019t agree with what he actually said.\u201d Russell may be on to something. Ben Carson may have been thinking of concerns about \u201cjudicial activism\u201d when he infelicitously targeted \u201cjudicial review.\u201d\n\nTake the results of this candidate cross-section for what you will, but there are other Republican candidates who don\u2019t share Ben Carson\u2019s view of the role of the Court.\n\nWas Marbury v. Madison rightly decided? If Ben Carson, now a frontrunner for the 2016 GOP nomination, wants to discuss that question, he can. In order to show that he does not misapprehend a fundamental gear in the machinery of American government, though, he ought to ask himself a few other questions as well. If Marbury was not rightly decided, who is the final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s language?\n\nOr maybe Dr. Carson, noted opponent of Obamacare, should ask himself, \u201cHow should President Obama respond if the Supreme Court rules against the government in King v. Burwell?\n\nTamara Tabo is a summa cum laude graduate of the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University, where she served as Editor-in-Chief of the school\u2019s law review.
