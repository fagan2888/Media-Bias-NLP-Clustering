There are two walls now advertising a statement, but not one put there by the business owner.

The person or persons wrote "Kill All Jews" in bright white spray paint on two of the buildings walls. It is believed the walls were vandalized sometime late Thursday night or early Friday morning on the building located near 31st St. S. and Seneca.

Gary Robinson was headed to a local restaurant with his wife and children and says he is shocked by what he saw. "These words right here are very offensive, I can hardly believe it," Robinson said, "shock is probably the perfect word, I have never seen this in my lifetime, not in this city."

Robinson's nine year old daughter was with him, he said she was shocked to see the words too. He now has to explain to her that this act of vandalism is more than defacing someones property, but also an act of hate. "It is rare...and hopefully it stays rare," he said.

Police were at the building Saturday, investigating the crime. Employees and customers inside the Barber Shop were talking about seeing the words and what the police were investigating. One man thought it was just some kids messing around, not really knowing what they were doing but he overheard the police thinking this might be a hate crime.

According to the employees inside the Barber Shop, there are no people that work in the building that are Jewish.

Vicky Burdick works inside the building too, she thinks the act is nothing more than senselessness. "It doesn't solve anything, it doesn't fix anything, and it doesn't make anybody feel better either," Burdick said, "not even the people who had done it, I don't think they feel any better for it."

The building owner is away for the weekend, so the spray paint will not be removed until at least Monday, possibly later. Police have not released an official statement about the graffiti.
