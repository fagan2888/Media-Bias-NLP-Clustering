The second-most common answer was $200 per month, which was the response of just 17 percent of respondents.\n\nCost, or perceived cost, is a prime reason that the remaining uninsured people give when asked why they do not purchase health insurance, even as the Affordable Care Act has brought the uninsured rate down to record lows. And Obamacare plans routinely cost more than $100 per month before the federal subsidies available to many enrollees are factored into the price.\n\nThose subsidies are available to people with low and moderate incomes \u2014 but only if they buy plans on government-run insurance exchanges such as HealthCare.gov. About 85 percent of exchange customers qualify for such financial aid.\n\nHowever, people with higher incomes, or those who buy outside the exchange, cannot get subsidies. And many uninsured people remain confused about how the subsidies work, or are unaware of their existence.\n\n\"The results of this nationwide survey have very different implications for those who are unsubsidized in their health insurance purchases, versus those who are subsidized,\" said Kev Coleman, head of research at HealthPocket.com.
