Last night\u2019s episode was by far the most confident \u201cDaily Show\u201d episode in this debut week, despite tackling objectively harder material\u2014bias training for police and Governor Chris Christie, respectively, are not easy targets. It seemed to me like Noah was simply on his game\u2014settling into the rhythm of hosting, with its back-and-forth between monologuing, listening, and interviewing, all within the bounds of one bounded persona. I laughed out loud at the black-and-white cookie gag, and that was after I\u2019d already paused to call my cat a \u201cbaby lion\u201d that poops in a \u201ctiny sandbox,\u201d per Noah\u2019s description. And the opening pre-recorded segment with Jordan Klepper and Roy Wood, Jr. was purely excellent\u2014a long sketch on what is essentially just one joke, which is that black people and white people see police very differently, that found a lot of different ways of illustrating the absurdity of contemporary race relations. (\u201cEmpire,\u201d which had just aired on Fox, found its way into the discussion, as did Bo Dietl of Fox News, \u201cnerdy Suge Knight,\u201d and Wood taking a moment to call, on his phone, the assembled masses of #blacktwitter, to inform them that Wisconsin had a bunch of biased cops. It was absolutely brilliant.)\n\nWhat I appreciated about this was both that the segment really played to Noah\u2019s strengths\u2014the dialogue on race relations\u2014while also letting him take a backseat to the correspondents\u2019 shenanigans; it reminded me a bit of the earlier days of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d when scene-stealers like Steve Carrell and John Oliver took some of the burden of attention off of Jon Stewart.\n\nIt left Noah free to focus on his interview with Christie, and lo and behold, the little piece of advice I threw at Noah yesterday turned out to be prescient. His interview with Christie was breezy and fun, and that may well be because Noah apparently met first Chris Christie at a party (!) on Long Island (!!) while at least one of them was wearing shorts (!!!). Whatever that initial meeting was (and it sounds like a doozy), it clearly softened Noah up enough to question Christie, and in turn made the governor a lot more affable than his rather rigid debate persona.\n\nWas Christie dismantled? Definitely not. The mood was more of mutually assured benefit than interrogation. Noah did get in one good jab at Christie, observing that Christie\u2019s reviled \u201cthe government\u201d would logically include the governor as well. But the rest of it was Chris Christie getting a chance to talk about his platform on the national level; when Noah asked him how he was going to get his poll numbers up, Christie responded, \u201ccoming on the first week of \u2018The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.\u2019\u201d The men then affably shook hands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a rough first two outings, Noah finally seemed to get in a groove (although some worrying tendencies persist)", "title": "Trevor Noah finally nails it: Why his third \u201cDaily Show\u201d episode was by far the strongest yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a rough first two outings, Noah finally seemed to get in a groove (although some worrying tendencies persist)", "title": "Trevor Noah finally nails it: Why his third \u201cDaily Show\u201d episode was by far the strongest yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/01/trevor_noah_finally_nails_it_why_his_third_daily_show_episode_was_by_far_the_strongest_yet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-01-at-8.02.06-AM1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a rough first two outings, Noah finally seemed to get in a groove (although some worrying tendencies persist)", "title": "Trevor Noah finally nails it: Why his third \u201cDaily Show\u201d episode was by far the strongest yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-01-at-8.02.06-AM1.png", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Chris Christie, comedy central, daily show, The Daily Show, the daily show with trevor noah, Trevor Noah, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd992\"", "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Chris Christie, comedy central, daily show, The Daily Show, the daily show with trevor noah, Trevor Noah, TV, Entertainment News, NewsTrevor Noah\u2019s third try as host of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d turned out to be the charm.\nLast night\u2019s episode was by far the most confident \u201cDaily Show\u201d episode in this debut week, despite tackling objectively harder material\u2014bias training for police and Governor Chris Christie, respectively, are not easy targets.\nHis interview with Christie was breezy and fun, and that may well be because Noah apparently met first Chris Christie at a party (!)\nNoah did get in one good jab at Christie, observing that Christie\u2019s reviled \u201cthe government\u201d would logically include the governor as well.\nIt left Noah free to focus on his interview with Christie, and lo and behold, the little piece of advice I threw at Noah yesterday turned out to be prescient."}
