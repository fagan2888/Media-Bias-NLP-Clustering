How well has the nation recovered from the worst economic crisis it has seen in generations? How much closer to the goal of universal healthcare coverage has the Affordable Care Act \u2013 \u2018Obamacare\u2019 \u2013 gotten us?\n\n\u201cAs President Obama himself said in his commencement address at Howard University, \u2018My election did not create a post-racial society.\u2019\u201d Morial said. \u201cMr. President, you are right.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 National Urban League Equality Index tells an all-too-familiar story of persistent racial disparity in American life. Your presidency has made a difference, yet we cannot, in eight short years, eliminate America\u2019s long-standing challenges around racial inequity.\u201d\n\n\u2018Marshall Plan\u2019\n\n\u201cWith this milestone 40th Anniversary State of Black America, the National Urban League proposes a sweeping and decisive solution to the nation\u2019s persistent social and economic disparities.\n\nWe call it the Main Street Marshall Plan: Moving from Poverty to Prosperity,\u201d Morial said in the speech, which was also livestreamed and televised on C-SPAN.\n\n\u201cThis bold and strategic investment in America\u2019s urban communities requires a multi-annual and multi-pronged commitment of $1 trillion over the next five years that would course correct our main streets.\u201d\n\nList of solutions\n\nHere are some of the $1 trillion solutions, from the NUL\u2019s perspective, outlined in this year\u2019s State of Black America(SOBA) report:\n\n\u2022 Universal early childhood education;\n\n\u2022 A federal living wage of $15 per hour, indexed to inflation;\n\n\u2022 A plan to fund comprehensive urban infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 A new Main Street small- and micro-business financing plan focusing on minority-and-women-owned businesses;\n\n\u2022 Expansion of summer youth employment programs;\n\n\u2022 Expanded homeownership strategies;\n\n\u2022 Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit;\n\n\u2022 Targeted re-entry workforce training programs administered through community-based organizations;\n\n\u2022 Doubling the Pell Grant program to make college more affordable;\n\n\u2022 Expansion of financial literacy and homebuyer education and counseling;\n\n\u2022 Expansion of the low-income housing voucher \u201cSection 8\u201d program;\n\n\u2022 Establishment of Green Empowerment Zones in neighborhoods with high unemployment;\n\n\u2022 Affordable high-speed broadband and technology for all;\n\n\u2022 Increased federal funding to local school districts to help eliminate resource equity gaps.\n\nTo stress the urgency of the improvements, Morial gave the results of NUL\u2019s 2016 Equality Index of Black America, which is a calculation to illustrate the level of disparity and inequality in specific categories. The Equality Index is in its 12th edition of the Black-White Index and its seventh edition of the Hispanic-White Index.\n\nMeasures the \u2018pie\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Equality Index measures the share of the pie that African-Americans and Hispanics get,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWhites are used as the benchmark because the history of race in America has created advantages for Whites that continue to persist in many of the outcomes being measured. Each category is weighted, based on the importance that we give to each.\u201d\n\nMorial said the overall equality index for African-Americans currently stands at 72.2 percent compared to a revised 2015 index of 72.0 percent. That means that in 2016, Blacks get 72.2 percent of the overall \u201cpie\u201d in America.\n\nOther equality segments are as follows:\n\nEducation took the biggest rise, going from 76.1 percent in 2015 to 77.4 in 2016. Economics went from 55.5 percent in 2015 up to 56.2 percent in 2016. Social justice went from 60.6 percent in 2015 to 60.8 in 2016. The civic engagement index \u201cdeclined sharply over the last year\u201d from 104.0 percent to 100.6 percent.\n\nHealth declined slightly from 79.6 percent last year to 79.4 percent.\n\nMorial\u2019s speech was punctuated with graphics, including a video to stress the pains experienced by African-Americans such as police killings of unarmed people. Another graphic was a photo of former NUL Executive Director Vernon Jordan, who served from 1971 to 1981. SOBA was introduced by Jordan 40 years ago.\n\nMuch the same\n\nMorial referred back to that time, four decades ago, when Jordan rolled out the first SOBA as a message to the next president. He quoted Jordan:\n\n\u201c\u2018It is our hope that this document will pierce the dark veil of neglect that has thus far smothered efforts to right the wrongs of the past and the present.\n\n\u201cI hope that it will be read closely in the White House and in Congress that it will influence decision makers to open their eyes to the plight of Black Americans. I hope it will be read by all the candidates in both political parties whose campaigns largely exhibit a refusal to grapple with the concerns of Black citizens.\n\n\u2018Most crucial election\u2019\n\n\u201cI urge Black people to educate themselves to the issues, to register, and to vote in the upcoming primaries and election. For this election could be the most crucial in recent history for Black people.\n\nThe implications of the mass impoverishment of Blacks and the massive assault on our newly-won rights demand that every Black vote be mobilized in defense of Black interests and aspirations.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe latest report also includes Morial\u2019s letter to the next president.\n\n\u201c(In 1976), our nation was struggling to overcome the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Pressure was building to slash social services for the poor, who were demonized and characterized as \u201cchiselers.\u201d Communities were rocked by hostility and violence triggered by legal challenges to the social status quo.\n\n\u201cSince 1976, the Black unemployment rate has consistently remained about twice that of the White rate across time, regardless of educational attainment,\u201d the letter states. The household income gap remains at about 60 cents for every dollar. Black Americans are only slightly less likely today to live in poverty than they were in 1976,\u201d according to Morial.\n\n\u2018Shared challenge\u2019\n\n\u201cThere have been times when Americans have met our shared challenges \u2013 as well as those of the international community \u2013 with full-measured urgency. When Europe found itself in physical and economic ruin after World War II, the United States invested $13 billion (or what would be approximately $130 billion today) to help rebuild Western European economies through the European Recovery Program, more commonly known as the Marshall Plan.\n\n\u201cThe Marshall Plan ushered a dramatic increase in economic growth in European history. Though the plan officially ended in 1953, the unprecedented economic growth it sparked continued over two decades.\n\n\u201cFormer National Urban League President John Jacob introduced the concept of an urban Marshall Plan for America in the 15th State of Black America in 1990. At the time, he said the nation should commit itself to completing \u2018our unfinished revolution for democracy and human rights.\u2019\n\n\u201cDear Mr./Madame President, that revolution remains unfinished,\u201d Morial concluded.\n\nThe complete 2016 State of Black America report, including full data sets, ranking lists and articles, is available at www.stateofblackamerica.org.\n\nHazel Trice Edney of the Trice Edney News Wire contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://flcourier.com/2016/05/a-familiar-story/", "site_name": "Florida Courier", "image": "http://flcourier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/160520_front01-233x300.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "A FAMILIAR STORY"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "A FAMILIAR STORYThe National Urban League\u2019s 40th annual State of Black America Report shows little progress in improving the lives of African-Americans.\nThe Equality Index is in its 12th edition of the Black-White Index and its seventh edition of the Hispanic-White Index.\nThe complete 2016 State of Black America report, including full data sets, ranking lists and articles, is available at www.stateofblackamerica.org.\n\u201cThe 2016 National Urban League Equality Index tells an all-too-familiar story of persistent racial disparity in American life.\nMeasures the \u2018pie\u2019\u201cThe Equality Index measures the share of the pie that African-Americans and Hispanics get,\u201d according to the report."}
