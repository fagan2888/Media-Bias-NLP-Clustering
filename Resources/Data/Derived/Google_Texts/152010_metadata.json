She and her husband Ryan had wanted children for some time. However, a month later that joy turned into something entirely different.\n\nSevere abdomen pain led Meyer her to a local emergency room in May.\n\nDoctors performed two surgeries on a blockage in Meyer\u2019s colon. She says they were surprised the baby lived through both surgeries.\n\nHowever, doctors also discovered Meyer has stage IV colon cancer. Stage IV is the most advanced kind.\n\nMeyer is about to start a third round of chemotherapy at Integris\u2019 Cancer Institute in Oklahoma City.\n\nBecause she has been able to carry her baby daughter, she and her husband have named Ahna Marie Lynn for 23 weeks now.\n\nMeyers said even if her daughter is born several weeks early, Ahna Marie Lynn still has a chance.\n\nMeyer was comforted by an ultra-sound a few weeks ago of her baby in her womb.\n\n\u201cShe looks like she\u2019s smiling like she\u2019s saying it\u2019s going to be okay Mom and Dad,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nAs for Meyer\u2019s future, she says doctors give her maybe two years to live.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be one of those miracle stories, and talk about our miracle baby, and live to tell our story,\u201d she said\n\nShe also urges everyone to get screened for colorectal cancer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 33 and this is not genetic. And people will tell you, doctors will tell you you\u2019re too young and the screening age isn\u2019t until age 50, and I really didn\u2019t have any symptoms, and here I am, stage IV,\" Meyer said.\n\nA GoFundMe page has been established to help Amanda Meyer with her medical needs.
