Shrewd drafting saves the second car gasoline and wear and tear until the final push into the lead as the finish line nears.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas is cleverly and successfully \u201cdrafting\u201d Donald Trump on the Republican track of the U.S. presidential race.\n\nTrump is aiding Cruz in three ways: by taking (until now) virtually all of the heat from the American (and indeed world) media; by preventing other potential Cruz competitors from locking in voters; and, most important, by obscuring the fact that in many cases Cruz\u2019s votes and views are more extreme and outlandish than Trump\u2019s.\n\nPolitics is a game of comparison. And at first glance, or sound bite, Trump sounds far more outrageous than anyone else in the race. That, in fact, has been his whole strategy. But on most issues Cruz is not only more to the right, he is far more disciplined, focused, organized and disruptive.\n\nA few examples. Trump wants to change the tax code; Cruz wants to abolish the agency, the Internal Revenue Service, that collects taxes.\n\nTrump says that Chief Justice John Roberts made a bad decision in upholding Obamacare; Cruz says that Roberts never should have been nominated to be on the court.\n\nTrump drew worldwide scorn for his proposal to \u201ctemporarily\u201d bar Muslims from immigrating to the U.S., but Cruz in the Senate has been a foe of all immigration reform efforts and wants to bar all Syrian refugees. No one paid attention, and he looked almost moderate by comparison.\n\nAt the same time, Cruz refused to criticize Trump\u2019s more sweeping statement, bidding to win over Trump voters.\n\nCruz arguably is the most doctrinaire conservative in the race -- and yet has been able to make that clear at the grassroots with minimal coverage on the national level.\n\nCruz would deny abortion rights to women impregnated by rape; believes marriage should only be between a man and a woman; opposes all limits on gun ownership; denies that the climate is warming and that humans are a cause; favors full repeal of Obamacare; and opposed the nuclear arms deal with Iran and new relations with Cuba.\n\nClever maneuvering on the track isn\u2019t the only reason why Cruz is where he is today, poised to take the lead in the race. Here are some others:\n\nAGE AND PEDIGREE. Only 45 years old, Cruz was cultured in the petri dish of the Reagan years and the Reagan coalition of libertarianism and conservative religion.\n\nCruz\u2019s father is an evangelical activist with close ties to the conservative movement from early days. But Cruz himself was schooled in libertarian economics from his high school days.\n\nHe was a star student at Princeton and Harvard Law, plugging into the nascent Ivy League end of a movement -- called the Federalist Society -- to use the law and the courts to topple the entire edifice of the social welfare state.\n\nMONEY. Well-credentialed by institutions he despised, Cruz from the beginning has had access to big money, both in his home state of Texas and on Wall Street in New York.\n\nPerhaps his most important backer is Robert Mercer, a pioneer \u201cquant\u201d whose program trading company has made him many billions.\n\nMercer provides not only \u201cindependent\u201d financial support of unlimited scope, but technical \u201cbig data\u201d savvy for Cruz's campaign.\n\nTECH SAVVY. The Cruz campaign may be the leader in using big data and social media to identify and turn out voters.\n\nSTRATEGY. Focusing on the Iowa caucuses as a way to gain traction is nothing new. An obscure Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter was the first to do it, in 1976, on his way to the White House.\n\nCruz has not only taken the organization effort there to a new and obsessive level, he has the money and reach to capitalize on it in a way that recent GOP winners there have not.\n\nSTAGE SKILLS. His father is a preacher, and Cruz himself was a national collegiate debate champion. His professors at Harvard, while disagreeing with him on issues, admired his tenacity and debating skills. They were on display in recent Republican debates.\n\nNow he will be the focus of fire from his competitors, including Trump. They could come to regret taking him on.\n\nTHE PRIMARY SCHEDULE. The Republican Party officials who set up the 2016 schedule weren\u2019t trying to help Cruz, but they did.\n\nAfter the initial set of caucuses and primaries, the first \u201csuper\u201d day is March 1, in which people will vote in a host of Southern states, including Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas.\n\nCruz could have sufficient momentum for a big sweep that day, and right now Trump is helping propel him in that direction.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "He makes Cruz look sane -- and that's just one of the reasons why the Texas senator is surging.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-12-15 10:40:32 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "He makes Cruz look sane -- and that's just one of the reasons why the Texas senator is surging.", "title": "Donald Trump Is The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ted-cruz_us_566ed46be4b0e292150e6ecf", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/566edbe81f00002c00e9ba79.jpeg?cache=iyopfm4uy3", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He makes Cruz look sane -- and that's just one of the reasons why the Texas senator is surging.", "title": "Donald Trump Is The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Ted Cruz", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/566edbe81f00002c00e9ba79.jpeg?cache=iyopfm4uy3", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@howardfineman", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-14 10:40:32 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_566ed46be4b0e292150e6ecf", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz,Donald Trump,2016 election,Elections 2016,Republican primary,Republican Party", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Ted Cruz,Donald Trump,2016 election,Elections 2016,Republican primary,Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-12-14 10:40:32 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-12-14 10:42:08 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Trump wants to change the tax code; Cruz wants to abolish the agency, the Internal Revenue Service, that collects taxes.\nSen.
