The Washington Wizards waived forward Damion James and guards John Lucas and Xavier Silas on Saturday.

Silas had a chance to claim the 15th and final roster spot, but shot just 29.7 percent in four preseason games.

His departure means the final roster spot goes to veteran Rasual Butler. Despite entering his 12th season, the 6-foot-7, 35-year-old often stayed after practice to shoot more.

Toward the end of the preseason, Butler said he was comfortable at shooting guard or small forward.

“I came here to make the team,” Butler said. “That’s my focus, first and foremost to make the team, then once that works out, then you worry about trying to earn some minutes.”

The Wizards finished the preseason banged up. Shooting guard Bradley Beal (wrist) had surgery Oct. 12 and is expected to miss another month. Martell Webster (back) is still rehabilitating from offseason surgery. Glen Rice Jr. (ankle sprain) is day-to-day.

The Wizards open the season in Miami Oct. 29.
