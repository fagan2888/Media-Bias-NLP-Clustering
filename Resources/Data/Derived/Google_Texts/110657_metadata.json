But this time, the uprising is directed not just against the political candidates of the Beltway Right, but against its intellectual mouthpieces: Conservatism Inc. is being rocked by what Twitter activists have tagged the #NRORevolt. And as I\u2019ve been predicting for years, it\u2019s a battle that American patriots need to fight and win\u2013not just to save the American Right, but to ensure there\u2019s still a country left to defend.\n\nThe battle started when Jonah Goldberg assumed his traditional function of insulting the conservative base. Reacting to Donald Trump\u2019s position as the GOP Presidential frontrunner, Goldberg kvetched: \u201cIf this is the conservative movement now, I guess you\u2019re going to have to count me out.\u201d He wrote:\n\nIf I sound dismayed, it\u2019s only because I am. Conservatives have spent more than 60 years arguing that ideas and character matter. That is the conservative movement I joined and dedicated my professional life to. And now, in a moment of passion, many of my comrades-in-arms are throwing it all away in a fit of pique. Because \u201cTrump fights!\u201d [No Movement That Embraces Trump Can Call Itself Conservative, National Review, September 5, 2015]\n\nGoldberg\u2019s tantrum provoked an explosion of Twitter users firing back using the #NRORevolt hashtag. And of course Goldberg\u2019s rosy history of the noble Conservative Movement\u2122 left a few things out. As even conservative true believers observed, \u201cthe movement,\u201d as we Beltway types still call it, beyond financing all too many Goldbergian \u201cprofessional careers,\u201d hasn\u2019t actually done much to accomplish its stated goals.\n\nIn an \u201cOpen Letter\u201d read aloud on air by Rush Limbaugh, \u201cSundance\u201d at Conservative Treehouse outlined listed the more obvious Republican failings, concluding:\n\nAnd, you wonder why we\u2019re frustrated, desperate for a person who can actually articulate some kind of push-back? Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are what the GOP give us? SERIOUSLY? [An Open Letter to Jonah Goldberg\u2014Re: The GOP and Donald Trump, September 7, 2015]\n\nIn response, Goldberg doubled down, arguing National Review and the \u201cconservative movement\u201d have essentially done their best to push the GOP to the Right. Thus on immigration, Goldberg claims\n\nI came out in favor of a wall on the border in 2006. On specifics \u2014 wolfsbane to Donald Trump \u2014 I tend to agree with Mark Krikorian that you don\u2019t need a literal wall everywhere, that you don\u2019t need a literal wall everywhere, but I am 100 percent in favor of securing the border, and was saying so when Trump was posing with DREAMers and bad-mouthing Romney for being insensitive to Hispanics. [The Great Trumpian Divide, September 11, 2015]\n\nBut this isn\u2019t really true. It was Goldberg who boasted (in the midst of a column ostensibly arguing for immigration law enforcement), \u201cPhilosophically and politically, I am on the side of every pro-immigration movement of the last two centuries\u201d [Immigration\u2019s bad guys, Los Angeles Times, June 5, 2007]. Presumably, this includes the nation-breaking 1965 Immigration Act.\n\nAnd in fact Trump has been pretty \u201cspecific\u201d about his immigration policy.\n\nMore to the point, one can\u2019t help but see a tinge of fantasy about Goldberg\u2019s complaints. For example, in his initial broadside, Goldberg complained\n\nIf you want a really good sense of the damage Donald Trump is doing to conservatism, consider the fact that for the last five years no issue has united the Right more than opposition to Obamacare\u2026 Yet, when Republicans were told that Donald Trump favors single-payer health care, support for single-payer health care jumped from 16 percent to 44 percent.\n\nLeave aside the mischaracterization of Trump\u2019s position. Opposition to Obamacare did indeed deliver several Republican victories, from Scott Brown\u2019s initial upset in Massachusetts and the 2010 midterms. But the resultant Republican Congress did nothing to reverse it and it was ultimately confirmed by a chief justice appointed by a Republican President (thus demolishing forever the argument that we must vote GOP \u201cto get good judges.\u201d)\n\nIf you are actually opposed to single-payer health care or Obamacare, what difference does it make if the \u201cconservatism\u201d exists at all?\n\nBut while the GOP has failed to deliver on the issues that animates its base, it has certainly delivered for its donors.\n\nIn the most obvious example, the Republican Congress won the 2014 elections by campaigning against immigration\u2013then promptly turned around and funded Obama\u2019s unilateral and illegal Amnesty. But not content with betrayal, the GOP the proceeded gleefully to ally with Obama to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite grass-roots conservative opposition. And here too, National Review, rather than representing conservatives to the Republican leadership, acted as a way for the GOP to repress the grassroots.\n\nThe unavoidable reality is that conservative voters can never count on the GOP to pass what they want, even if it\u2019s overwhelmingly popular\u2013but somehow the Beltway Right is always there to tell conservatives to slash the few overwhelmingly popular government programs that actually benefit them.\n\nThe bottom line: William F. Buckley-style conservatism has failed, on three separate levels.\n\nIt failed by its own criteria in the cause of \u201climiting government.\u201d\n\nIt failed to reverse a larger Cultural Marxist takeover of the culture, largely by participating in the ritualistic human sacrifices of conservatives like Jason Richwine, Robert Weissberg, Joseph Sobran, and our own Peter Brimelow in the failed quest for \u201crespectability.\u201d\n\nAnd most spectacularly, it failed to \u201cconserve\u201d the nation in the most basic sense, by facilitating the replacement of the historic American nation with foreign peoples who have no stake in preserving any of the principles, institutions, or cultural norms that conservatives supposedly hold dear.\n\nThus in the #NRORevolt row, there\u2019s something larger at stake than simply conservative impatience with Republican failure. Trump\u2019s declaration that Americans are being played for suckers is especially true for the (overwhelmingly White) conservative base. They are tired of being used as cannon fodder. They are tired of seeing nothing in exchange for their votes except trade and tax policies that help the same plutocrats who support Open Borders.\n\nSo, quite naturally, they are moving towards a more National Conservative position in which the GOP is expected to defend the concrete interests of its core constituency, like the patriotic parties of Europe.\n\nIn a piece on #NRORevolt largely celebrating the split within the American Right, Matt Yglesias at Vox noted that\n\nthe demographic math of the Reagan coalition doesn\u2019t work anymore. To win, conservative politicians either need to broaden their appeal to African-American or Latino voters or else significantly improve their performance among white voters from an already high level. [#NRORevolt Explained, September 8, 2015].\n\nHe continued:\n\nThe strategy favored by much of the party elite\u2026 is to try to neutralize the immigration issue in the Latino community and then win votes from more affluent or more religiously devout Hispanics. The alt-right/identitarian/Trump strategy is to do the opposite, and make increasingly explicit appeals to ethnic nationalism to try to make whites more uniformly loyal to the GOP.\n\nWhat Yglesias doesn\u2019t say is that the elite strategy is already Dead On Arrival. Trump is currently under attack by the Beltway Right because The Donald evidently thinks high salaries for CEOs shouldn\u2019t be a defining principle of the American Right. But Hispanics want more economically progressive policies even more than they want free markets.\n\nThe plan of the GOP \u201cSmart Set\u201d to win by putting a minority or female face (Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina) on the same tired policies will still ultimately depend on high White turnout and voter share in order to be successful. But it\u2019s just far less likely to work. On the other hand, paradoxically, Trump\u2019s populist strategy actually seems more likely to win a sizable minority of black and Hispanic voters than the cringe-inducing pandering of a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation for the Beltway Right. But, after all, they were warned and they chose to shoot the messenger. Popular disgust at the American Right\u2019s cowardice, short-sightedness, and baffling stupidity is one of the key motivations driving the #NRORevolt.\n\nThe existential crisis of Western Civilization in the United States and Europe was utterly unnecessary. But National Review, among others, deliberately chose to treat demographic and racial issues as beneath discussion in the same way they now choose to dismiss Trump.\n\nAnd so at the beginning of what is shaping up to be the Century of Identity, a new politics is needed. And National Review and its cuckservative fellow travelers have nothing to offer.\n\nThey have no one to blame but themselves. When it comes to the death of Beltway Right-style conservatism, I\u2019m reminded of a phrase widely used by the young Alt-Right shaping the new age of Ethnopolitics:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call it a grave. It\u2019s the future you chose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.vdare.com/articles/nrorevolt-proves-national-conservatism-the-only-way-forward?page=no-campaign", "image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RESIZEDCUCKLEY.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d1a\"", "article_summary": "And of course Goldberg\u2019s rosy history of the noble Conservative Movement\u2122 left a few things out.\nThat is the conservative movement I joined and dedicated my professional life to.\nBecause \u201cTrump fights!\u201d [No Movement That Embraces Trump Can Call Itself Conservative, National Review, September 5, 2015]Goldberg\u2019s tantrum provoked an explosion of Twitter users firing back using the #NRORevolt hashtag.\nBut this time, the uprising is directed not just against the political candidates of the Beltway Right, but against its intellectual mouthpieces: Conservatism Inc. is being rocked by what Twitter activists have tagged the #NRORevolt.\nMore than two decades after the Establishment suppressed Pat Buchanan and his \u201cpeasants with pitchforks,\u201d the grassroots are again in revolt against the noodle-armed effetes of the Beltway Right."}
