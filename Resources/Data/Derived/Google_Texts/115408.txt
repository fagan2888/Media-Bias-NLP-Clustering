The people of Meridian weren't the only ones to celebrate Mardi Gras. Canines in the area were also included in the festivities during the annual Krewe of Barkus parade. The pet owners decorate their dogs in the spirit of Mardi Gras and show them off for the judges. This year that list of judges includes our very own Lindsey Hall. And officials say their owners don't hold back when it comes to preparing their pooches.

"People go over the top. We've had dogs dressed as ponies before, dogs with elaborate costumes on this year, dogs that get dyed," organizer Robyn Farquhar says. "Just unbelievable creativity from the residents of meridian with their pets."

Judges pick a king and queen based on enthusiasm and "spirit of Mardi Gras." the pet parade traditionally kicks off the Mardi Gras parade, by leading the way for all the other floats and cars.
