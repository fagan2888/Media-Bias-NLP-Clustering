The death of 19-year-old Christian Taylor has raised some of the same questions as other recent police shootings involving unarmed suspects.\n\nHere are some things to know about the investigation:\n\n___\n\nTHE POLICE ACCOUNT\n\nPolice were contacted by a company that manages security cameras at Classic Buick GMC in Arlington at about 1 a.m. Friday. Sgt. Paul Rodriguez, an Arlington police spokesman, told The Associated Press that police were advised that someone had driven a car onto the lot, started to damage another car, then drove his own vehicle into the glass front of the showroom.\n\nOfficer Brad Miller and another officer entered the dealership and approached the subject as other officers set a perimeter around the dealership, Rodriguez said.\n\nAccording to a police statement, an \u201caltercation\u201d of some kind ensued and Miller shot Taylor.\n\n___\n\nTHE ROOKIE OFFICER\n\nMiller, 49, joined Arlington\u2019s police department in September. Although he had completed the police academy and was a fully licensed officer, he was still completing a 16-week field training program required of new officers, Rodriguez said. His training officer was with him at the time of the shooting, Rodriguez said.\n\nMiller has no disciplinary record and had not fired his gun in the line of duty before Friday, Rodriguez said.\n\nHis work history before joining the Arlington police is unclear. State records show his name and address listed as an executive with two businesses, one of which was a web hosting service that is now dormant.\n\n___\n\nTHE FOOTBALL PLAYER\n\nTaylor graduated last year from Mansfield Summit High School in Arlington and was listed on Angelo State\u2019s roster as a 5-foot-9, 180-pound freshman defensive back.\n\nIn his only known criminal charge, Taylor received six months\u2019 deferred adjudication on a drug charge after police found him with 11 hydrocodone tablets that were not prescribed to him, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. He completed that sentence and the case was dismissed.\n\nHis father, Adrian Taylor, told KTVT-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth that his son was \u201cjust a good dude\u201d who would give the shoes off his feet to someone in need. He said he didn\u2019t know why Christian would have been at the car dealership at that time of night, but that he shouldn\u2019t have been killed.\n\n\u201cYou know, it could have been too much drinking, he could have been wrong place at the wrong time, he could have gotten something and he didn\u2019t know what he was getting,\u201d Adrian Taylor said.\n\n___\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION\n\nPolice say they are investigating Taylor\u2019s death both as a possible criminal case and to determine whether department rules were broken.\n\nPolice officials haven\u2019t yet decided whether they will release video of the incident. Rodriguez said he had not seen it, but that he believed it did not include the showroom where the shooting occurred.\n\nThe Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s office is conducting Taylor\u2019s autopsy. It has not yet released any initial findings on toxicology, and Rodriguez said he wasn\u2019t aware if police found any evidence to suggest Taylor was under the influence.\n\nThe medical examiner and the car dealership\u2019s management did not return a phone message Saturday.\n\n___\n\nTHE BACKDROP\n\nTaylor, who was black, was shot two days before the anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, whose death galvanized the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement and sparked protests that at times turned violent.\n\nSome of the nationwide criticism of police use of force in the last year has happened online, and Taylor\u2019s death resonated on social media, with some posts questioning the official account and calling for video to be released.\n\nRodriguez said that the investigation would take time because \u201cwe\u2019re really trying to focus on the process and get things right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will demand of ourselves a thorough and transparent organization of what took place,\u201d Rodriguez said Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unarmed college football player was shot dead at a suburban Dallas car dealership by a trainee police officer during a middle-of-the-night burglary call.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An unarmed college football player was shot dead at a suburban Dallas car dealership by a trainee police officer during a middle-of-the-night burglary call.", "title": "Christian Taylor, college football player, fatally shot by trainee officer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/college-football-player-fatally-shot-officer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/af695ef96bc28a237e0f6a7067001655.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/af695ef96bc28a237e0f6a7067001655.jpg", "description": "An unarmed college football player was shot dead at a suburban Dallas car dealership by a trainee police officer during a middle-of-the-night burglary call.", "card": "summary", "title": "Christian Taylor, college football player, fatally shot by trainee off"}, "Author": "Nomaan Merchant", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Christian Taylor, Paul Rodriguez, Dallas"}, "article_summary": "DALLAS \u2014 An unarmed college football player was shot dead at a suburban Dallas car dealership by a trainee police officer during a middle-of-the-night burglary call.\nAccording to a police statement, an \u201caltercation\u201d of some kind ensued and Miller shot Taylor.\nOfficer Brad Miller and another officer entered the dealership and approached the subject as other officers set a perimeter around the dealership, Rodriguez said.\n___THE INVESTIGATIONPolice say they are investigating Taylor\u2019s death both as a possible criminal case and to determine whether department rules were broken.\nThe death of 19-year-old Christian Taylor has raised some of the same questions as other recent police shootings involving unarmed suspects."}
