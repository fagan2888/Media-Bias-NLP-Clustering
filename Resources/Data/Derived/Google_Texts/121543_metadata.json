Those actions in the past have caused prices to spike; however, considering inventories remain healthy, the increases should be slow, Speer said.\n\nThe price increases should land in the range of 4-to-6-cents per gallon weekly, and could get closer to $2 per gallon in peak demand times such as Memorial Day weekend, Speer said.\n\nThe national average dropped 3.9 cents during the past week to $1.69 per gallon. The weekly declines in Colorado and metro Denver were 7.7 cents and 7.5 cents, respectively, according to GasBuddy data.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration last week projected that regular gasoline would average $1.98 per gallon nationwide in 2016. It would be the first time since 2004 that gasoline averaged under $2 per gallon for a full year.\n\nThe production cuts will come as refineries prepare for spring maintenance and the transition to the summer blend, which is designed to prevent excessive evaporation in the heat.\n\n\u201c(The production cuts) are not happening just because the inventories are so high, but these refineries are actually starting to lose money,\u201d Speer said, referencing years-low crude prices.\n\nMarch deliveries for light, sweet crude were up 40 cents to $29.84 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nAlicia Wallace: 303-954-1939, awallace@denverpost.com or @aliciawallace", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gas prices nearing bottom in Colorado, fuel analyst says", "title": "Gas prices nearing bottom in Colorado, fuel analyst says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/15/gas-prices-nearing-bottom-in-colorado-fuel-analyst-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160209__Gas_Prices_Denverp1-3.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160209__Gas_Prices_Denverp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-15T10:18:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:41:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty close to the bottom for prices in Colorado,\u201d said Will Speer, GasBuddy senior petroleum analyst for the West and Southwest regions.\nThe weekly declines in Colorado and metro Denver were 7.7 cents and 7.5 cents, respectively, according to GasBuddy data.\nThe production cuts will come as refineries prepare for spring maintenance and the transition to the summer blend, which is designed to prevent excessive evaporation in the heat.\nRefineries laden with the cheaper, winter-blend fuel are talking of making cuts in production, he said.\nThose actions in the past have caused prices to spike; however, considering inventories remain healthy, the increases should be slow, Speer said."}
