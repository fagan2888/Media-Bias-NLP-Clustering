Martin Vigil could be seen shifting in his chair.\n\nWhat the camera didn\u2019t show was that, beneath the table, Vigil had just kicked his superior officer, Sgt. Benito Trujillo.\n\nThis week during the trial of James Nathan Scott in Denver District Court, Vigil explained why he boldly kicked his boss.\n\nVigil testified that he had a strong intuitive feeling during the interview with Scott on Sept. 19, 2007 that the serial rapist was about to confess to a rape and murder in a Denver church 28 years earlier of 19-year-old Martha Guzman. Vigil could see by looking closely at Scott\u2019s face that Scott was about to reveal himself.\n\n\u201cDet. Vigil was right and indeed Mr. Scott started to confess immediately after Det. Vigil kicked Sgt. Trujillo under the table in the interview room,\u201d deputy district attorney Dawn Weber wrote in response to questions by The Denver Post about the trial.\n\nIf Vigil hadn\u2019t kicked Trujillo and the sergeant had interrupted the suspect, Scott may never have confessed to murder and a jury a few days ago might never have found Scott guilty of first degree murder.\n\nMost cold cases, and certainly those that happened decades ago, are only solved with DNA evidence. In this instance, the killer\u2019s own words were used against him by a clever detective.\n\n\u201cIt was crucial to the re-filing of the case,\u201d Weber wrote in a reply to The Denver Post. \u201cThe confession provided an anchor around which we could argue all of the evidence in the case that corroborated the confession.\u201d\n\nThe confession helped ensure belatedly that justice could be served in a case that stunned Denver at a time when such shocking murders were virtually unheard of, said Lynn Kimbrough, spokeswoman for Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey.\n\nThe series of circumstances that led to Scott\u2019s conviction on Wednesday, Dec. 17 began with good police work 35 years ago, according to police records and Weber\u2019s comments.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "boss,church,denver,Denver District Court,Det.
