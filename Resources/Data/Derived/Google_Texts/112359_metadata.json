The researchers trained two mindfulness instructors at each health care center during a six-day training course. Participants of the study, who suffered from depression, anxiety, or severe stress, were gathered into groups of 10 for structured group mindfulness treatment. The patients also received a private training program, and were asked to record their exercises and thoughts in a journal. For eight weeks, all 215 of them went through mindfulness therapy, then answered questions about their depression and anxiety. The researchers found that self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety had decreased during the treatment period.\n\n\u201cThe study\u2019s results indicate that group mindfulness treatment, conducted by certified instructors in primary health care, is as effective a treatment method as individual CBT for treating depression and anxiety,\u201d Sundquist said in a press release. \u201cThis means that group mindfulness treatment should be considered as an alternative to individual psychotherapy, especially at primary health care centers that can\u2019t offer everyone individual therapy.\u201d\n\nThe notion of mindfulness dates back to ancient Buddhism, and is an essential part of the religion. It involves accepting the present moment and focusing on the sensations, feelings, and thoughts that are happening right now. Being able to reduce the extraneous \"noise\" from anxiety, worrying, and fear can help people focus on and live in the moment, and also allow them to lessen unnecessary stress.\n\nLiving in the present, and being \u201cmindful\u201d of simple things like drinking tea or taking walks \u2014 the small details in life \u2014 can help people with anxiety, Dr. Elizabeth Hoge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Disorders, told Harvard Health Publications. \u201cPeople with anxiety have a problem dealing with distracting thoughts that have too much power. They can\u2019t distinguish between a problem-solving thought and a nagging worry that has no benefit\u2026 You might think, \u2018I\u2019m late, I might lose my job if I don\u2019t get there on time, and it will be a disaster!\u2019 Mindfulness teaches you to recognize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s that thought again. I\u2019ve been here before. But it\u2019s just that \u2014 a thought, and not a part of my core self.\u201d\n\nOne of the main proponents of mindfulness, Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk and author Thich Nhat Hahn teaches ordinary people how to focus on breathing and dwelling in the moment \u2014 even if times are rough. \u201cThe therapeutic power of meditation is very great,\u201d he noted in a 2010 interview with the Huffington Post. \u201cThe practices of mindful breathing, sitting meditation and walking meditation release tensions in the body and also in the mind\u2026 We humans have lost the wisdom of genuinely resting and relaxing. we worry too much. We don\u2019t allow our bodies to heal, and we don\u2019t allow our minds and hearts to heal. Meditation can help us embrace our worries, our fear, our anger, and that is very healing.\u201d\n\nSource: Sundquist J, Lilja A, Palmer K, Memon A, Wang X, Johansson L. \u201cMindfulness group therapy in primary care patients with depression, anxiety and stress and adjustment disorders: randomized controlled trial.\u201d The British Journal of Psychiatry, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "depression, anxiety, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study has found that group mindfulness therapy can be just as effective in treating depression and anxiety as the more common cognitive behavioral therapy.", "title": "Practice Mindfulness To Curb Anxiety And Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindfulness-just-effective-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-treating-anxiety-depression-312432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/meditation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study has found that group mindfulness therapy can be just as effective in treating depression and anxiety as the more common cognitive behavioral therapy.", "title": "Practice Mindfulness To Curb Anxiety And Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindfulness-just-effective-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-treating-anxiety-depression-312432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/meditation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/meditation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2014-11-29T14:15:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T14:15:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study has found that group mindfulness therapy can be just as effective in treating depression and anxiety as the more common cognitive behavioral therapy."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c7b\"", "article_summary": "Participants of the study, who suffered from depression, anxiety, or severe stress, were gathered into groups of 10 for structured group mindfulness treatment.\nThe study, led by Professor Jan Sundquist, was held at 16 primary health care centers in southern Sweden.\nFor eight weeks, all 215 of them went through mindfulness therapy, then answered questions about their depression and anxiety.\n\u201cThe study\u2019s results indicate that group mindfulness treatment, conducted by certified instructors in primary health care, is as effective a treatment method as individual CBT for treating depression and anxiety,\u201d Sundquist said in a press release.\nThe researchers trained two mindfulness instructors at each health care center during a six-day training course."}
