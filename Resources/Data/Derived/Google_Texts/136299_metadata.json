Aaron Bean (R-Fernandina Beach) said his focus will be on bringing down health care costs, rather than expanding coverage in 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s because the federal government agreed to extend funding for uninsured patients through next year.\n\nListen to the version of this story aired on WJCT 89.9 FM\n\nSpeaking to the Rotary Club of Jacksonville on Monday, Bean said he\u2019s not expecting another health care funding meltdown next year, but that lawmakers will begin planning to deal with the eventual loss of Low Income Pool program in the near future.\n\n\u201cIt is time to roll up our sleeves and go ahead and prepare for the following year where they have already given us notice that they\u2019re going to pull their funding completely,\u201d Bean said.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion debate paralyzed the Legislature this year. Lawmakers couldn\u2019t agree on how to cover a budget shortfall, with the federal government discontinuing its funding of the Low Income Pool Program, which helps hospitals pay for uncompensated care.\n\nThe Senate proposed a private-sector alternative to Medicaid expansion to make up for the loss of funds, but faced stiff opposition from the House who proposed a package of bills dealing with health care costs instead.\n\nLawmakers finally passed a budget during a special session after the feds agreed to extend the funding through 2016.\n\nNow Bean says he\u2019ll work with the House to control health care costs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already reached out to my counterpart \u2014 Representative chairman Jason Brodeur,\u201d Bean said. \u201cI\u2019ve already asked could we meet together? Is it possible we could all come together and relook at all these programs to see can it deliver better care? Can it deliver better access? Can we get better results?\u201d\n\nBean\u2019s statements may signal that the upper chamber intends to move closer to the House when it comes to addressing health care next session.\n\nSpecifically, Bean wants to expand telemedicine and allow patients to pay primary care doctors directly without involving insurance companies.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A Northeast Florida lawmaker is predicting Medicaid expansion won&#039;t be a factor during the next legislative session.
