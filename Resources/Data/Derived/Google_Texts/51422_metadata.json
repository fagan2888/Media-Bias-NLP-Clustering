Ted Cruz, R-Texas, brought his \u201cCruz Country\u201d bus tour to Arkansas on Wednesday, making a stop in Van Buren along the way in support of his bid for the White House.\n\nAddressing a large crowd at the Republican Party of Crawford County\u2019s 2015 Lincoln Day Dinner, Cruz, one of the 17 Republicans in the 2016 presidential race, said Americans have grown weary of \u201ccampaign conservatives\u201d and were looking for a consistent candidate who would remain truthful to campaign promises.\n\nHe promised if elected he would be tougher on illegal immigration, would secure the nation\u2019s borders and would work to defeat \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe pledged as president he would defend free market principles, defend the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution.\n\nCruz said as president, he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, abolish the IRS and would \u201crescind every unconstitutional executive action\u201d taken by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. He said he would \u201crestore integrity\u201d into the Department of Justice, beginning with instructing the agency to investigate Planned Parenthood.\n\nHe also promised to abolish the Department of Education and end Common Core.\n\nCruz said he would \u201cend the persecution of religious liberty,\u201d a statement met by a resounding standing ovation.\n\nHe also said he would \u201crip to shreds\u201d and undo the recent nuclear agreement with Iran, which he considered \u201cthe single greatest threat to the nation.\u201d\n\nCruz spoke of being chastised by the president, but also from his fellow Republicans on his over-the-top rhetoric about that deal, but said \u201cthe truth is not rhetoric.\u201d\n\nHe also told the audience that Arkansas will play a critical role in the 2016 presidential bid. He noted Arkansas has joined other Southern states in moving its primary up to March 1.\n\nA recent Reuters poll from Aug. 6-10 that surveyed Republican voters showed Donald Trump at the top of the crowded field with Cruz in eighth place, earning 5 percent of the support.\n\nCruz said what differentiates himself from his colleagues is that with him \u201cyou know exactly what you\u2019re going to get, and I will do exactly what I say.\u201d\n\nCruz said the GOP field contained a \u201cwide array of young, dynamic talent\u201d willing to step forward to lead the country a \u201cstark contrast\u201d to his opposition.\n\nSpeaking of his Democratic counterparts, he told the audience the candidates it had to choose from were a \u201cconsistent, wild-eyed socialist who is dangerous for the world,\u201d and \u201cthen you have Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said, taking a shot at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\nCruz spoke to the media prior to his remarks and disputed the \u201cWashington fallacy\u201d that the only way Republicans can win is to run to the middle as \u201cDemocrat light.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time we do that, we lose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said American citizens need a candidate who will energize conservative voters, who will \u201cfight against bipartisan corruption,\u201d and the way for Republicans to win the 2016 election is to follow former Republican President Ronald Reagan\u2019s principles to \u201cpaint in bold colors, not pale pastels.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned to the media prior to his remarks his campaign has raised $14.3 million in more than three months. He noted his campaign has collected more than 175,000 contributions from residents in 55 percent of zip codes across the country.\n\nCruz\u2019s stop in Van Buren was his third of the day, having also attended rallies in Little Rock and Russellville.\n\nThe tour kicked off late last week in South Carolina. Cruz is visiting seven states in seven days.\n\nCruz\u2019s sweep through Arkansas was the third stop in the state for 2016 presidential hopefuls.\n\nTrump headlined the state Republican Party\u2019s annual Reagan Rockefeller fundraising dinner July 17 in Hot Springs.\n\nClinton was the headliner at the Democratic Party\u2019s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on July 18 at Verizon Arena in North Little Rock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential hopeful Sen.
