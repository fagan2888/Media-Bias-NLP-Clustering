Pat McCrory will be here Wednesday to hear about coastal issues from the N.C. Coastal Resources Commission at the commission\u2019s regular meeting.\n\nThe CRC will meet from that day through Thursday, at the Hilton Wilmington Riverside hotel at 301 North Water St. During the Wednesday meeting, at 4 p.m., Gov. McCrory will make comments to the CRC, after which he will hear presentations on seven issues facing the North Carolina coast.\n\nGreg \u201cRudi\u201d Rudolph, Carteret County Shore Protection Manager, said he\u2019s excited that the governor will be at the meeting, which Mr. Rudolph said he\u2019ll also be attending. Mr. Rudolph also serves on the CRC science panel, and said this is the first time since he began that the governor will be present at a CRC meeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on getting these issues to him,\u201d Mr. Rudolph said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad this hasn\u2019t just been a Wilmington thing; there\u2019s been some concern about this only being about their issues,\u201d he added.\n\nA seven-member panel will give their presentation.\n\nAmong the panelists is Todd Rosessler, an attorney with the law firm of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton whom the Carteret County Beach Commission has retained for several years.\n\nMr. Rosessler is scheduled to give a presentation on increasing federal regulations. Mr. Rudolph said his presentation will focus on regulations pertaining to the Endangered Species Act.\n\nSeveral species found in Carteret County \u2013 such as sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon \u2013 are listed as endangered under the ESA.\n\nAnother, the rufa red knot, is being considered for listing; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the agencies which enforces the ESA, expects to issue its final decision by Friday, Nov. 28.\n\nAs a result, areas in Carteret County and elsewhere on the North Carolina coast have been declared critical habitat for sea turtles and may be declared critical habitat for other species, as well.\n\nThis is a designation for habitat that means activities or projects in the habitat that are federally funded, managed or permitted \u2013 including federally managed fishing, federally funded dredging, offshore energy exploration and beach nourishment projects \u2013 have to undergo additional scrutiny before being permitted.\n\nIf threats to the habitat or the species using it were found, special management consideration would be required to get any federal permits the activity or project needs.\n\nMr. Rudolph has been an opponent to sea turtle critical habitat designation. He\u2019s said during public meetings that the final rules for the designations list \u201cevery possible thing a resident or tourist does on the beach\u201d as a threat and that what special management consideration would be required is \u201cwide open.\u201d\n\nThe other panelists and their topics are:\n\n\u2022Dr. Chris Dumas, UNC Wilmington professor of economics \u2013 The economic value of the coast.\n\n\u2022Caswell Beach Mayor Harry Simmons \u2013 The reduced funding of coastal projects.\n\n\u2022CB&I Client Program Manager Ken Wilson \u2013 Dredging policies.\n\n\u2022New Hanover County Shore Protection Coordinator Layton Bedsole \u2013 Dredging policies.\n\n\u2022BlueGreen Outer Banks Director Willo Kelly \u2013 Flood and wind insurance.\n\n\u2022CRC Chairman Frank Gorham \u2013 Concerns with offshore drilling.\n\nSeveral other items on the CRC\u2019s agenda for its October meeting are:\n\n\u2022Exemption for single-family residences in the estuarine shoreline area of environmental concern to get signed statements of no objection from adjacent property owners.\n\n\u2022Occasional flooding criteria for coastal wetlands.\n\n\u2022Proposed amendments to Coastal Area Management Act land-use planning guidelines and land-use planning grants.\n\n\u2022The draft final report for inlet management study priorities.\n\n\u2022Draft rule language for state ports inlet management areas of environmental concern.\n\n\u2022A request for a variance from oceanfront setbacks in Salter Path.\n\n\u2022A petition for rulemaking to amend state regulations on piers and docking facilities.\n\n\u2022A report on static vegetation line alternatives.\n\nA full agenda and meeting packet is available online at the N.C. Division of Coastal Management website portal.ncdenr.org/web/cm/oct-2014-crc-agenda.\n\nContact Mike Shutak at 252-726-7081 ext. 206, email mike@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter at @mikesccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "WILMINGTON \u2014 Gov.
