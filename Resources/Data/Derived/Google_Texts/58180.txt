Over the weekend, a gaggle of Tea Party enthusiasts in trucker hats and veterans gear descended upon the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. for a rally to protest Obamacare, though at times it sounded like they were protesting President Obama himself.

One of the speakers was Larry Klayman, an attorney who founded Judicial Watch, a conservative legal non-profit that teamed with True the Vote last year to sue states that didn't aggressively purge voters from rolls. Klayman, who now works with another conservative nonprofit called FreedomWatch, called for the crowd to engage in "a second American nonviolent revolution" using "civil disobedience" to demand that Obama "leave town."

He called for Obama "to get up, to put the Quran down, to get up off his knees, and to figuratively come out with his hands up."

Sen. Ted Cruz, the Tea Party leader from Texas, and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin were also at the rally, which moved from the World War II Memorial to the White House. Photos from the rally showing one protestor waving a Confederate Flag has circulated heavily across Twitter and other social networks:
