The spread of Enterovirus D68 is now reaching into KELOLAND.

Officials with the South Dakota Department of Health say specimens from several suspected cases of the upper respiratory virus have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control for testing.

The specimens have come from 14 people across the state who range in age from two weeks to 19 years old.

There are more than 100 different subtypes of the enterovirus that can cause cold-like symptoms. The enterovirus infects 10 to 15 million people every year.

Though South Dakota's hospitals can test for enteroviruses, they do not have the capability to test for this subtype of the virus. These specimens are sent to the CDC for testing.

The best way to protect yourself and your family is wash your hands frequently and avoid people who are sick with severe cold symptoms.
