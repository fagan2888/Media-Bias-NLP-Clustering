That sent the two top finishers to the final runoff election on November 21st. In this case that means that Senator David Vitter is representing the Republicans and John Bel Edwards will carry the Democrats\u2019 standard. The third place finisher left out in the cold was the Lt. Governor, Republican Jay Dardenne. It seems that Jay isn\u2019t much for the whole \u201cgraceful in defeat\u201d school of thought though, because this week he came out and endorsed the Democrat. (Washington Post)\n\nJay Dardenne, a defeated candidate for governor of Louisiana, has endorsed a Democratic rival for the job over fellow Republican David Vitter. In a news conference this morning at Louisiana State University, Dardenne called Democrat John Bel Edwards a \u201cpro-life, pro-gun\u201d candidate, as apt for the job as Vitter was unthinkable. Edwards \u201cknows that fear, intimidation and vindictiveness are the enemies of putting Louisiana forward,\u201d Dardenne, the state\u2019s outgoing lieutenant governor, said\u2026\n\nAs the New York Times recalls, the primary race was nasty from the beginning.\n\nDuring the primary Mr. Dardenne and another Republican, Scott Angelle, a public service commissioner, bristled at attacks from the Vitter campaign and, as the weeks went on, gave as good as they got. While Mr. Vitter accused both of being loose-spending liberals, Mr. Dardenne and Mr. Angelle both accused Mr. Vitter of lying and explicitly talked of his 2007 prostitution scandal, in which Mr. Vitter admitted only to a \u201cvery serious sin.\u201d\n\nPolitics is never intended to be softball, but this is one of the nastier races in recent memory. Dardenne isn\u2019t just throwing Vitter under the bus\u2026 he\u2019s going after Bobby Jindal as having damaged the Republican brand and knocking just about everyone else currently in office. The responses from the other side are equally rough and tumble. The state GOP chair is comparing Dardenne to Nick Saban, the LSU coach who moved to the University of Alabama and is widely viewed as a traitor to the state. Reince Priebus got in on the action as well, treating the endorsement as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the cause and linking the Lt. Governor to Barack Obama.\n\nAll of this may be for naught, though. Louisiana has been solidly in the red column for decades, but at this point Jindal\u2019s numbers are so far in the tank that he can\u2019t see the surface anymore and Edwards is leading Vitter in the polls by a wide margin. Only six months ago I never would have dreamed I\u2019d be saying this, but Louisiana may be about to elect a Democrat to their highest office. We\u2019ve lived to see interesting times indeed.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sour grapes", "title": "Sore loser Louisiana Republican endorses Democrat for governor", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/06/sore-loser-louisiana-republican-endorses-democrat-for-governor/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-06T13:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T12:44:14+00:00"}, "keywords": "Bobby Jindal, David Vitter, Louisiana, Republican governors,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dac\"", "article_summary": "Governor, Republican Jay Dardenne.\n(Washington Post)Jay Dardenne, a defeated candidate for governor of Louisiana, has endorsed a Democratic rival for the job over fellow Republican David Vitter.\nWhile Mr. Vitter accused both of being loose-spending liberals, Mr. Dardenne and Mr. Angelle both accused Mr. Vitter of lying and explicitly talked of his 2007 prostitution scandal, in which Mr. Vitter admitted only to a \u201cvery serious sin.\u201dPolitics is never intended to be softball, but this is one of the nastier races in recent memory.\nSore loser Louisiana Republican endorses Democrat for governorposted at 8:01 am on November 6, 2015 by Jazz ShawBack in October the voters of Louisiana held their non-partisan primary for the governor\u2019s race and the results, as usual, failed to produce anyone with a clear majority of support.\nIn a news conference this morning at Louisiana State University, Dardenne called Democrat John Bel Edwards a \u201cpro-life, pro-gun\u201d candidate, as apt for the job as Vitter was unthinkable."}
