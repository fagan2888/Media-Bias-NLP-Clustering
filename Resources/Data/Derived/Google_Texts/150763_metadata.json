At Republican club meetings, public rallies and on Twitter, she praised Cruz\u2019s tenacity and commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, in her bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, 58, Pierson is trying to convince voters that she possesses those same qualities and that Sessions does not. Pierson, 37, a political and media consultant, said she decided last year to challenge Sessions after she attended several meetings between him and local activists.\n\n\u201cEverything became \u2018next time\u2019 basically \u2014 next debt ceiling fight, next continuing resolution,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cPeople seem to forget this nation wasn\u2019t founded on going along to get along.\u201d\n\nShe and her supporters are drawing parallels between her effort and Cruz\u2019s successful campaign. While Cruz surprised many when he won an open Senate seat, Pierson has the trickier task of trying to unseat a powerful incumbent. Sessions has served in Congress since 1997 and chairs the House Rules Committee. He declined a request to comment on Pierson for this article.\n\nThough she trails Sessions in fundraising, Pierson\u2019s campaign has been gaining some momentum by leveraging her ties to the national Tea Party movement. She has drawn endorsements from Michelle Malkin, the conservative blogger, and Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a libertarian advocacy group.\n\nThis month, Pierson gained the support of Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael. Though Cruz has said he was not picking sides in the race, he described Pierson as \u201can utterly fearless principled conservative\u201d at a recent conservative rally.\n\nPierson made clear she planned to treat the senator's comments as an endorsement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to send that out and let everybody know that the senator has not forgotten those who were in the trenches with him,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Pierson, a run for office is the latest step in her growing immersion into Texas politics.\n\nSoon after attending her first Tea Party meeting in 2009, she found herself a leader in the nascent movement, holding advisory roles in several groups and explaining Tea Party positions on cable news. Last year, she left a career in health care administration to start Pierson Consulting Group, a political and media consulting firm. She declined to identify any current or former clients.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Pierson and her supporters have described Sessions as a creature of Washington out of touch with Texans. They have argued that he has not sufficiently supported efforts, led largely by Cruz, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think it would have been a winning strategy had Republicans gotten behind him,\u201d Pierson said.\n\nIn an email, Torrie Miller, a spokeswoman for Sessions\u2019 campaign, described \u201cdismantling Obamacare\u201d as a priority. (At a hearing earlier this month, he predicted that House Republicans would make no more efforts to repeal the health care law but later said he was joking.)\n\n\u201cCongressman Sessions has broad and deep grassroots support across the 32nd Congressional District of Texas,\u201d Miller said.\n\nPierson has also questioned Sessions\u2019 ties to his Dallas district, accusing him of having moved to Florida. In 2012, Sessions married Karen Diebel, a former Florida congressional candidate. The couple owns a house near Orlando, though Sessions listed a Dallas apartment as his address when he filed for re-election.\n\nSessions said in an emailed statement that he still lived in Dallas, though he also spent time in Florida.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are working hard to make our combined families work well,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWith five boys living in four cities and the two of us working in three different cities, it is clearly a balancing act.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at http://www.texastribune.org/2014/01/20/dallas-cruz-backer-challenges-house-leader/.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "In 2012, Katrina Pierson was crisscrossing Texas in her spare time to help Ted Cruz become the state\u2019s next U.S. senator.
