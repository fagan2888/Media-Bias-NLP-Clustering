Heads up America, Syrian refugees have arrived and they are here to stay.

Your State Department funds are being well invested in one-way tickets for Syrian refugees to New Orleans, Louisiana.

Former FBI Special Agent-In-Charge Jim Bernazzani gave his opinion on the matter. "If I was in charge of ISIL, logistically I'd take advantage of this situation and put my people in, into the United States," he said.

Governor Bobby Jindal expressed his concerns to the president by writing a letter to the executive office. "As with former immigration crises and federal relocation policy, Louisiana has been kept in the dark about those seeking refuge in the state and it is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state's knowledge or involvement," he wrote.

We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years. â€” President Obama (@POTUS) September 28, 2015



With the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, maybe we should rethink our strategy of bringing Syrians to America and decide whether or not it puts American lives at a risk.
