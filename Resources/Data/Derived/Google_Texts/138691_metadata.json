The concept has been around for some time, and is now starting to gain traction in the D.C. area.\n\n\u201cThe concept is, we really want to see kids in a natural setting,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Cullins, head of outpatient psychiatry at the Children\u2019s National Health System.\n\nShe said school is a familiar place for kids, and a clinic on site is a logistical plus for parents.\n\nCullins has been working with one of the first schools in the area to set up a mental health center on campus. The program at D.C. Prep, a charter school in the nation\u2019s capital, brings in a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals to provide a wide range of services.\n\n\u201cThese include comprehensive assessments, as well as ongoing treatment, which can involve medication management and/or therapy,\u201d Cullins said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that anywhere between 13 and 20 percent of all children and adolescents need mental health services.\n\nAbout half of all adults with lifelong mental illness are diagnosed before the age of 14.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates mental health parity, meaning insurers have to provide coverage. And with more people covered, that means more demand for help.\n\nCullins said school mental health centers can go a long way to provide access to care \u2014 particularly for families who find transportation is a big barrier to treatment.\n\n\u201cSome of my families have to take five buses to come to Children\u2019s Hospital to see me there,\u201d she explained. With kids already at school, it is easy for parents to get them to a clinician on site.\n\nRight now, D.C. charter schools are leading the way when it comes to setting up mental health centers with psychiatric services.\n\nHowever, all local districts are stepping up their game when it comes to detecting mental and behavioral problems in their student population.\n\n\u201cThey are utilizing early identification and intervention,\u201d said Cullins, noting many of the children she sees in her own practice at Children\u2019s were referred by their schools.\n\nD.C. has added extra school mental health professionals to help spot signs of trouble.\n\nMontgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties have in-school health wellness centers that provide some mental health services; in Fairfax, counseling is available through the country\u2019s public school health program.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2016 WTOP.
