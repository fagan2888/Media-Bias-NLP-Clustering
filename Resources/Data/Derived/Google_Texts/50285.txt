× Customers give mixed reviews to Washington health exchange

SEATTLE (AP) — A customer survey by the Washington health exchange found people gave the site mixed reviews after its first year of operation.

Exchange officials say they obviously still have work to do to improve the customer experience. Some highlights from the survey were released Thursday during a meeting of the board that manages Washington Healthplanfinder.

Not surprisingly, the people who are getting free insurance through Medicaid have a better opinion of the exchange than those who used the website to buy health insurance.

Most said the application process was easy and only about a third of all the customers who responded to the survey said they had some trouble applying for insurance.

People seem generally happy with the number of health plans offered. Most believe they got a good value. And the majority say they are likely to buy dental insurance if it’s offered through the exchange.
