The Non-profits could fill out a form, declaring their religious opposition to contraception and identifying the company that provides their health care insurance. This fix meant the government could work with the insurance provider to ensure that the non-profit\u2019s employees would have coverage for contraceptives.\n\nAs a side note, I find it extremely convenient that \u201cstrongly held\u201d religious beliefs never entail imposing restrictions on men\u2019s access to healthcare services. But I digress.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled on Hobby Lobby, it left people, including dissenting Supreme Court Justices, with the impression that the form fix would pass constitutional muster.\n\nFour days later, the same court came out with another ruling in the case of Wheaton College v. Burwell. In short, Wheaton College argued that filling out the form would make it a birth control enabler and conflict with the college\u2019s \u201cdeeply held\u201d religious beliefs. The court ruled with the college, at least temporarily. In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor did not mince words when she said: \u201cThose who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cNot so today.\u201d\n\nBecause that ruling was temporary, the question of whether the Court will allow artificial persons to deny the natural persons they employ of birth control coverage based on the artificial person\u2019s \u201creligious beliefs\u201d remains unresolved.\n\nCurrently, if a for-profit or non-profit entity objects to filling out a form, they can write a letter stating their religious objections and the identity of their insurance administrator.\n\nThis brings us to Justice Alito\u2019s ruling on Wednesday. Alito stayed the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling in Zubik v. Burwell. In short, the Third Circuit Court upheld the Obama administration\u2019s rules pertaining to religious non-profits that want an exemption from the contraception mandate. But Alito suspended that ruling because apparently writing a letter or filling out a form is unacceptable to these artificial persons with such strongly held religious beliefs.\n\nSo here\u2019s where we are at the moment. Artificial persons claim their \u201cstrongly held\u201d religious beliefs gives them the right to be exempt from a law that mandates employers to provide their employees with contraceptive coverage as part of their healthcare coverage. However, declaring their religious objections and providing the government with the name of their insurance administrator would somehow make the artificial person \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the big scheme of natural persons they employ getting birth control. Like most sane people, judges in the lower courts haven\u2019t been buying this argument.\n\nIn fact, the Third Circuit stated the true nature of this legal fight in its ruling.\n\nFederal law, not the religious organization\u2019s signing and mailing the form, requires health-care insurers, along with third-party administrators of self-insured plans, to cover contraceptive services.\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201creal objection\u201d isn\u2019t to sending a form or letter to the federal government; it is what happens after the form is provided \u2013 that is, to the actions of the insurance issuers and the third-party administrators, required by law once the [plaintiffs] give notice of their objection. Federal law does not give these plaintiffs \u201ca religious veto against plan providers\u2019 compliance with those regulations, nor the right to enlist the government to effectuate such a religious veto against legally required conduct of third parties.\n\nIn short, the plaintiffs are not satisfied with imposing their \u201cdeeply held\u201d religious beliefs on their employees. They want the power of a religious veto to impose their beliefs on health insurers and third party administrators.\n\nIt is very likely that Alito\u2019s order is a warning that the Supreme Court is ready to expand the meaning of an artificial person\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d beyond imposing it on the natural persons it employs. It\u2019s very likely that some on the Court hope to empower \u201creligious\u201d corporations to enlist government as the enforcer of a religious veto against legally mandated actions by third parties.\n\nThis never was about corporations with religious beliefs, strongly held or otherwise. If it were about religious conviction, the companies in question would be satisfied to state their objection, get their exemption and be done with it. As the Third Circuit noted, the objection is about what happens after the company states its objection. That is the difference between the freedom to practice one\u2019s religion and the tyranny that entails imposing a religious belief on unwilling subjects.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito opened a Pandora's box that has the potential to give some corporations the right to impose their \"deeply held\" religious objections to birth control on other corporations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Adalia Woodbury", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito opened a Pandora's box that has the potential to give some corporations the right to impose their \"deeply held\" religious objections to birth control on other corporations.", "title": "Hobby Lobby II Case Could Impose Right Wing Evangelical Tyranny On Health Insurers", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/18/hobby-lobby-ii-impose-religious-tyranny-health-insurers-administrators.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hobby-Lobby-II.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-18T16:30:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,contraception,contraceptive services,federal government,freedom of religion,health care insurance,healthcare coverage,Hobby Lobby,Obama Administration,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,Presidency of Barack Obama,Samuel Alito,Supreme Court,Supreme Court of the United States,Wheaton College,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-04-18T16:29:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-18T16:30:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "contraception, contraceptive services, federal government, freedom of religion, health care insurance, healthcare coverage, Hobby Lobby, Obama Administration, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Presidency of Barack Obama, Samuel Alito, Supreme Court, Supreme Court of the United States, Wheaton College"}, "article_summary": "When the Supreme Court ruled on Hobby Lobby, it left people, including dissenting Supreme Court Justices, with the impression that the form fix would pass constitutional muster.\nAs a side note, I find it extremely convenient that \u201cstrongly held\u201d religious beliefs never entail imposing restrictions on men\u2019s access to healthcare services.\nIn short, the plaintiffs are not satisfied with imposing their \u201cdeeply held\u201d religious beliefs on their employees.\nThis never was about corporations with religious beliefs, strongly held or otherwise.\nRemember when the owners of Hobby Lobby convinced the Supreme Court their company has strongly held religious beliefs and as such, should be exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate?"}
