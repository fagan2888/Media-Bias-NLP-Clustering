On October 1, 2014 IDC-10-PCS coding will be expanded, a move guaranteed to overload the nation's healthcare system. The system is working well today with roughly 20,000 codes covering various disorders and medical contingencies. But the number of codes will be increased nearly eightfold to 155,000 next October. Many procedures will require multiple codes, in the interests of making the data more precise. This will require a huge amount of Information Technology remediation to go from the old to the new system. All medical providers will have to be retrained to code properly. If claims are not coded properly, they will be denied and the hospitals and practitioners will not be paid. The risk to hospitals is huge -- this will be a big \"bump in the road,\" as Obama might put it. The burden on practitioners will be catastrophic, their indirect expenses will soar. It is a debacle about to be sprung, not only on the medical community but on the public. It is an intentional setup.\n\nIn considering this coming crisis, think of Noam Chomsky's second rule for social control: \"The people must look upon the political leaders as the saviors of the nation. Create a problem and then offer a solution. For example, with the help of the media create false alarms, nonexistent dangers. People then begin to worry and later become anxious. When that stage is reached, offer a solution to these nonexistent problems. They will be grateful and ready to accept less freedom in exchange for normalcy.\" The Obama 'solution' to the chaos that will be created by the ICD-10-PCS code explosion is the single payer health care system -- socialized medicine on the European and British models. Obama has stated that single payer is his preference but he knew that it wouldn't sell in America, so he instead offered ObamaCare. We all know the result of that. ObamaCare will collapse on its own when the public has absorbed enough pain from large hikes in insurance premiums, higher deductibles, losing the insurance that they liked, and losing the doctors that they liked. Adding two problems -- the IC-10-PCS code explosion and the collapse of ObamaCare -- enables Obama to promote the single payer model. Like the frog in the pot, the unsuspecting public is about to be slowly manipulated in a masterful application of Chomsky's second rule and Saul Alinsy's Rules For Radicals. Obama is a student of Chomsky and Alinsky. The billing code crisis taken with the collapse of ObamaCare will enable the community-organizer-in-chief to justify imposing his preferred solution -- socialized medicine for America.\n\n\n\nMathew Hurwitz is a retired engineer, BSME, MIT, a consultant and independent inventor with several dozen patents and peer reviewed technical papers.
