I haven't lost any of these things and if yo live here either have you. Quit parroting this right winged garbage. Eeewww! Amycare for US Senate\n\nDear Comrade RX,\n\nI could write a book about how we\u2019ve lost the constitutional limitations on government, but others have already done that job for me.\n\nHere\u2019s a few: Never Enough: America's Limitless Welfare State ;\n\nTerms of Engagement: How Our Courts Should Enforce the Constitution's Promise of Limited Government;\n\nRestoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty;\n\nThe Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic\n\nInstead of just parroting Left-Wing garbage, you should probably try reading those books.\n\nBut more to your point, yes, I think that when the United States' government monitors all Internet traffic, monitors every single domestic telephone call for pattern recognition; when governments install video monitoring devices at every intersection; when the government guarantees entire industries like banking, real estate, autos, the university system, and now healthcare; when the plain language of the Second Amendment-- that says the right to keep and bear arms shall NOT be abridged-- is abridged to only include specific people who can keep and bear arms; when the government starts tracking children in the womb with personally identifiable information\u2013 children who they don\u2019t even recognize as humans under their reading of the constitution\u2014in order to promote some liberal idea of education reform; when that government does all that, then, yes, we have lost the constitution, our liberty and our rights.\n\nWhen you add up the economic activity in so-called \"private industry\" that the government controls, you get a sense why government as a percentage of our GDP is over 40 percent, rivaling the years of World War II when 19 million American men were in uniform.\n\nReal Estate +6.3%; Autos +3.3%; K-12 +5.7%; College +3.1; Healthcare +17.9%. That comes out to 36.3% of GDP in industries closely controlled by the government. If you add in just Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the big six systemic banks that the federal government guarantees, you can figure on another $18 trillion in assets that the government closely controls. Our entire GDP for a year is around $16 trillion.\n\nSeriously. Try reading books.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the intersection between the government and our economy in constitutional terms, then let\u2019s just say there really is no difference between you and communists.\n\nBut of course, that\u2019s why I call you comrade.\n\nReginald10 wrote: Yes, and we need to replace strychnine with arsenic, because strychnine is poisonous. Eeewww! Amycare for US Senate\n\nDear Comrade Reggie,\n\nI think you made the right choice for your career when you switched to the name \"Elton John.\" But I was never a fan of either the glasses or the platform shoes. Or Princess Di.\n\nSorry.\n\nDrayburn wrote [with both fine gramear and speliing]: So Johnny Boy you have lost your faith in God, becoming a Loin of the Devil wondering around stealing souls, at least God found use for a donkey riding it though the city. As most Republicans the Devil has made his deals with for there great power over others and blind them to reality and fact, there comes the time to pay the piper, well time to pay little man time to pay. The braking of the Republican bubble has come for them to face there hate and lies they spread for years. We Are Lions That Are Lead By Donkeys\n\nDear Comrade Dray,\n\nYou seem to be suffering from a flight of ideas or some other similar thought disorder. Or perhaps it\u2019s derailment of ideas.\n\nThe good news is that these conditions are covered under Obamacare.\n\nThe bad new is that you probably need an exorcism too.\n\nAnd what d'ya know? Not covered under Obamacare, yet!\n\nI know. I\u2019m surprised too.\n\n\"For the devil has come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\u201d - Revelation of John 12:12\n\nIt is not I that is rolling out a broken healthcare system because I have such a short time left to accomplish my goal.\n\nBut then when has Obama ever cared for the consequences to his party or his country when contemplating anything?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying Obama\u2019s the devil. He\u2019s not bright enough for that.\n\nBut his works are certainly devilish.\n\nRemember those terrible Republican conservatives who wanted to delay the implementation of Obamacare?\n\nIt looks like they were the only ones who knew what the hell they were talking about.\n\nYou know it\u2019s bad when Ezra Klein, my favorite idiot, thinks there are problems with Obamacare much bigger than the website:\n\nTo understand why these problems are so dangerous to Obamacare it's helpful to understand how the Obama administration thinks about Obamacare.\n\nWith my colleague Sarah Kliff, I spent much of May and June working on that. What we wanted to know -- and asked repeatedly -- was how administration officials defined success for the health care law.\n\nHere is what we learned: \u201cTo the White House, the difference between success and failure is straightforward: They need to entice a sufficient number of young and healthy adults into the new insurance marketplaces that open Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nI want to be clear on this: No one said that success was letting kids up to age 26 stay on their parents' insurance plan. No one said it was regulating insurers or covering preventive care. Instead, everyone in the White House shared a singular definition: Success meant setting up the exchanges and attracting enough young people that premiums stayed low.\n\nAnd he concluded:\n\nThe problem is precisely that the people who really need insurance will be patient and persistent. The people who don't need insurance as badly may not be. And if that happens, then in year two, costs are going to rise sharply for those sicker, older people left in the exchanges. And Republicans who see Obamacare's problems as a path to success in 2014 won't even think about expanding Medicaid.\n\nWhen ANY liberal is being this honest it\u2019s refreshing.\n\nBut Klein has made supporting Obamacare his raison d'\u00eatre for the better part of the last 4 years. And make no mistake, he still a fan. He\u2019s trying to save Obamacare, but he says there isn\u2019t much time: \u201cThe White House has time to right the ship. But not much. Health-care experts suggest the Web site needs to be running smoothly by Thanksgiving at the latest.\u201d\n\nJust another thing to be thankful for on Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree,\u201d said Lincoln, \u201cand I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d\n\nObama blew his four hours. He\u2019s got two left.\n\nGoldilocks wrote: When did conservatives become lions? We Are Lions That Are Lead By Donkeys Goldilocks also wrote: If conservatives are lions, then conservatives are not pachyderms. So conservatives are PINOs!\n\nDear Comrade Goldi,\n\nYou too will qualify for free mental health-screenings under Obamacare. I hear they are coming up with a combined concealed-carry permit, NSA job application, IRS non-profit designation and Obamacare registration all in one.\n\nAnyone who fills it out is automatically registered as a Democrat and their prescriptions arrive in the mail.\n\nAnd the best part? I hear you won\u2019t even have to show up to vote. They make the vote selections for you with one of the \u201cObamacare-approved\u201d candidates. And if there\u2019s a generic alternative, that\u2019s covered as well.\n\nI didn\u2019t call conservatives lions.\n\nI called the American people \u201clions.\u201d\n\nChurchill, a lion himself, was half-American and somewhat of a visionary on the importance of the USA.\n\nAnd despite the shackles and fetters with which they try to bind us, there are still more lions in America than there are donkeys. American solutions to problems tend to come organically out of individuals, not groups, at any event.\n\nIn fact, I called out the elites on ALL sides for letting us down. They are the donkeys in this scenario:\n\nIn many senses the government, the politicians, the media, our newspapers, our radio stations, our chambers of commerce, our professional sports leagues, our schools, our universities, our court system, Democrats and Republicans alike, defaulted a long time ago.\n\nOL1 wrote: We love you John. You, President Obama, and Ted Cruz are creating a much stronger Democratic Party by not understanding or participating in this democracy. Keep up the good work. It\u2019s Stupid, Obamacare\n\nDear Comrade OL1,\n\nDoes Obama know you are using his patented number one?\n\nI\u2019m OK with it, but is he?\n\nNot to worry, even now I am holding up one finger and shouting \u201cYou\u2019re number one.\u201d\n\nGuess which finger?\n\nThe real numbers I\u2019m looking at however say that whatever you might think of Ted Cruz, in the long wrong, he\u2019ll be remembered as the guy who implored Washington to get rid of Obamacare before disaster struck.\n\nBlame who you want but the law was poorly thought out, even worse in execution, and clearly will be a big issue in next year\u2019s upcoming election.\n\nObama\u2019s approval rating is as low as it\u2019s ever been and unless he has magic pixie dust and a herd of unicorns to fix the monument to himself disguised as \u201chealthcare reform,\u201d it\u2019ll get worse.\n\nThe 2010 mid terms were about government overreach. The 2014 midterms will be about that too, plus government incompetence.\n\nElucidated wrote: John, it's understandable that you have reduced your lexicon to \"stupid' when describing Obamacare. . .since you are angry that the GOP just got a big whooping. But in my case, I have a tiny difference of opinion. You see, I have a son with seizures who was denied health insurance last year. Do you have any idea how our lives have been effected by private insurance playing the God card to save money? It\u2019s Stupid, Obamacare\n\nDear Comrade Elucidated,\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your son was denied coverage.\n\nI think, however, you\u2019ve mistaken me --and the rest of America for that matter-- as a giant call-center and complaint department.\n\n\"Helloooooo, I care. Oh, wait. I don't.\" Click.\n\nMy family has it\u2019s own issues. I don\u2019t make you responsible for them, do I?\n\nIf you want high quality healthcare, then you should ask the government to get out of healthcare entirely.\n\nLet me boil it down for you: Healthcare in this country suffers from the same delusion that many things the government gets involved does.\n\nThis is the delusion that you can get people who don\u2019t get many\u2014or any\u2014benefits to pay for people who get many\u2014or most\u2014of the benefits.\n\nThere is very little difference between the ponzi scheme that is Social Security and the scheme that\u2019s known as Obamcare. Both rely on people who don\u2019t get a benefit to support those who get the benefits today.\n\nIt\u2019s immoral.\n\n\u201cAs an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing,\u201d said Lincoln, \u201csoon finds his original means devoured by interest, and next no one left to borrow from - so must it be with a new government.\u201d\n\nBTW- I need you to come by next week and write a check for my mortgage. It\u2019s been a bad few months for me, and I\u2019m a little short.\n\nThat's the same argument you are using.\n\nBSullivan848 wrote: Oh John NOW you want to move center?

For at least two years prior to the Dotcom bubble crash, financial writers had been predicting it to happen. The only real question was how the crash managed to hold off for as long as it did. Here\u2019s To The Yahoo\u2019s Who Ruined A Perfectly Good Shutdown\n\nDear Comrade EricY!,\n\nI was actually working in venture capital at the time. I knew as well anyone what was up. I never got caught up in the dot-com bubble. My clients prior to that were in the stock market, but, generally speaking, I\u2019m a value guy when it comes to stock purchases.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t know what your comments have to do with Bush.\n\nHe was responsible for the dot-com crash? Before he was president?\n\nThe crisis that he inherited, the one that was unforeseen, was the attack on the World Trade Center, which blew about 0.5% off of GDP for that year.\n\nAnd if a big majority of financial writers had predicted the crash many years before, the crash never would have happened.\n\nInstead, there would have been an orderly retreat in the stock market, as the public reacted to changing media opinion. That\u2019s how the market works. At any given time there are writers who are bearish on the market, like Doug Kass, who one day are right.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that those bears missed one of the all-time great bull markets for about a ten-year period because they are permanent bears on the market.\n\nOf the two of us, comrade, there is only one who has an intergalactic problem with reality.\n\nIt\u2019s not I.\n\nThat's it for this week,\n\nV/r,\n\nJR", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "The Gospel According to Comrades: Hark!
