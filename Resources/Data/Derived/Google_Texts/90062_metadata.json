On September 11, 2001, as our nation watched in horror as tragedy unfolded, I responded with my brothers and sisters from EMS Station 22, running against the crowds fleeing the horror of Lower Manhattan to do my job as an EMT. That day the brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs and other first responders who answered the call of duty didn\u2019t hesitate to put their lives on the line.\n\nThe selflessness and bravery we witnessed on 9/11 wasn\u2019t an anomaly; heroism of all shapes and sizes is the backbone of our work. As people who serve the public, we dedicate our lives to helping others. It\u2019s the job we signed up for and love. But without my union advocating on my behalf, doing my job would be impossible.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnions, at their core, are groups of everyday people who come together to make their voices heard on issues that affect all of us. They are fighting for smaller class sizes, quicker response times in emergencies and better staffing for hospitals. Their victories are our victories, improving the quality of life in the cities and towns we call home.\n\nToo often, though, these same public service workers become the targets of radical politicians, corporate CEOs and wealthy special interests, who want to make it even harder for working people to earn a living wage and support their families. Their latest attack is coming as they attempt to hijack our nation\u2019s highest court for their dishonest purposes. A new case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, seeks to undermine the effectiveness of unions by allowing some people to avoid paying their fair share.\n\nPublic service worker unions benefit everyone in the workplace. Through the power of negotiating together, we are able to make sure that working people earn wages and benefits that can support their families, and win improvements to make their work more effective. The only way to do that is by using our strength in numbers \u2013 coming together and speaking with one voice. We all benefit from having our voices heard.\n\nThe Friedrichs plaintiffs want to make it even harder for us to come together by allowing some employees to shirk their fair share of the fees that support these negotiations. The union, by law, has to represent all employees in the workplace. So if the people bringing this case get their way, they will receive the benefits from the union negotiating on their behalf, but won\u2019t pay their fair share to cover the costs of that work. That\u2019s like going out to dinner with a group of your friends and having someone walk away from the table without putting something down for the bill.\n\nImportantly, the benefits of unions speaking together extend far beyond the workplace. If the Court rules against unions, public safety standards across America will be weakened. Police, firefighters, EMS, and first responders won\u2019t be able to push for life-saving equipment and shorter response times, and social workers won\u2019t be able to push for better nurse-to-patient ratios. Our teachers \u2013 entrusted with the education of our children \u2013 would lose the ability to negotiate for smaller class sizes and improved educational standards. This case could even eliminate protections for whistleblowers who work in food safety \u2013 the people we count on to speak out against toxic chemicals polluting our food products, air and water.\n\nNo one lobbies for average Americans, but our public service worker unions help middle class families build better lives for themselves, and can help stop the economic scales in this country from tilting even more toward corporations and billionaires. When the Supreme Court hears this case in the upcoming term, I hope that the justices will remember the heroism of our public service workers and act to protect them, just as they protect and serve our communities every day.\n\nVariale is an EMS lieutenant at FDNY.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Unions, at their core, are groups of everyday people who come together to make their voices heard on issues that affect all of us.", "description": "Unions, at their core, are groups of everyday people who come together to make their voices heard on issues that affect all of us.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Unions, at their core, are groups of everyday people who come together to make their voices heard on issues that affect all of us.", "title": "9/11 first responder: Unions work for all of us", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/253283-9-11-first-responder-unions-work-for-all-of-us", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/253283-9-11-first-responder-unions-work-for-all-of-us", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-11T12:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Vincent Variale", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T12:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/253283-9-11-first-responder-unions-work-for-all-of-us", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Unions, at their core, are groups of everyday people who come together to make their voices heard on issues that affect all of us.", "card": "summary", "title": "9/11 first responder: Unions work for all of us"}, "dcterms.title": "9/11 first responder: Unions work for all of us"}, "article_summary": "If the Court rules against unions, public safety standards across America will be weakened.\nThe selflessness and bravery we witnessed on 9/11 wasn\u2019t an anomaly; heroism of all shapes and sizes is the backbone of our work.\nPublic service worker unions benefit everyone in the workplace.\nPolice, firefighters, EMS, and first responders won\u2019t be able to push for life-saving equipment and shorter response times, and social workers won\u2019t be able to push for better nurse-to-patient ratios.\nNo one lobbies for average Americans, but our public service worker unions help middle class families build better lives for themselves, and can help stop the economic scales in this country from tilting even more toward corporations and billionaires."}
