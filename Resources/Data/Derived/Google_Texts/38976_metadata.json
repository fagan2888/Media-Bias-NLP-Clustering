Michael Eric Dyson, for example, called the president\u2019s statement about the case on Monday a \u201cstunning epic failure.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s defenders point to his second-term commitment to issues that touch the lives of poor communities of color, especially his initiative to assist young minority men, My Brother\u2019s Keeper. But what both sides are ignoring is the president\u2019s first-term record.\n\nA true measure of a president\u2019s priorities lies hidden in plain sight in his budget proposals. Under that standard, Mr. Obama has been more committed to communities like Ferguson than any Democratic president in the past half century.\n\nBy looking at what percentage of the budget presidents propose to spend to fight poverty, we can compare their degree of commitment.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama advocated for the Affordable Care Act as a way to assist poor African-Americans, for example, we can\u2019t put that on an effort scale and compare it to President Bill Clinton\u2019s advocacy for his health care plan. Our method also avoids the problem of accounting for forces beyond presidents\u2019 control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUsing this method, we find that President Obama attempted to deliver far more than his counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s inflation-adjusted numbers show that Mr. Obama sought to spend far more on means-tested anti-poverty programs than other first-term Democratic presidents. The targeted needs include food, housing, education, health care and cash.\n\nMr. Obama earmarked 17 percent of his budget for these needs, versus Mr. Clinton\u2019s 12 percent and Jimmy Carter\u2019s 8 percent. These presidents all faced economic challenges, although of different degrees and strength. Each was committed to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. But Mr. Obama made good on that commitment far more concretely.\n\nNo president gets all he requests, but the outcomes speak well for Mr. Obama, too. Christopher Wimer of Columbia University found, for example, that tax and transfer policies lowered the poverty rate by only 1 percentage point in 1967, under President Lyndon B. Johnson, but by almost 13 points in 2012.\n\nDid Mr. Obama plan to spend more simply because he had more mouths to feed? No. Even after accounting for the higher numbers of poor people caught in the Great Recession, Mr. Obama\u2019s record outshines his predecessors\u2019. His proposed first-term spending per poor individual was $13,731 to Mr. Clinton\u2019s $8,310 and Mr. Carter\u2019s $4,431, in 2014 dollars.\n\nMr. Obama even exceeds Mr. Johnson, whose budget priorities amounted only to $111 per poor person. (Because Mr. Johnson was the first postwar president to tackle poverty issues with so many new programs, it is not surprising that his proposed funding levels were low at the start.) The same pattern shows up in spending per poor family. Mr. Obama allocated $67,132, Mr. Clinton $39,820, Mr. Carter $20,790, and Mr. Johnson $546, again using 2014 dollars.\n\nNor is Mr. Obama simply a big spender across the board. His spending on the Department of Agriculture, for example, was lower than Mr. Clinton\u2019s and Mr. Carter\u2019s, removing food stamps and adjusting for inflation.\n\nA final test of priorities is how much a president proposes to spend compared with his immediate predecessor. By that yardstick, Mr. Obama does well too. The percent change in anti-poverty spending per poor individual is highest for Mr. Clinton relative to the first President Bush (27 percent), and lowest for Mr. Carter, who actually spent slightly less than Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Obama\u2019s increase relative to George W. Bush was a respectable 17 percent. When it comes to the poor, Mr. Obama does not appear a failure, much less an epic one.\n\nSo why does Mr. Obama elicit fiery condemnation for lacking empathy? His first four State of the Union speeches provide several telltale clues. These are a president\u2019s showcase, watched, in recent years, by up to 52 million viewers. What did Mr. Obama signal to those millions?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFirst, he rarely mentioned poverty. Listeners had to hunt for words like \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201chomeless.\u201d His average poverty word count is seven, lower than Mr. Carter\u2019s nine and Mr. Clinton\u2019s 23. Second, the little he did say was drowned in a wave of words aimed at the middle class, like \u201caverage earner.\u201d His ratio of middle-class-related words to poverty-related words was nearly 3 to 1.\n\nWhen he did mention the needs of the poor, he tiptoed around them. His ratio of direct mentions of poverty to indirect mentions was 1 to 3. Contrast that with Mr. Clinton\u2019s 8-to-1 ratio. Even Mr. Carter\u2019s was higher than Mr. Obama\u2019s (1 to 2). By favoring words like \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201cunemployed\u201d so heavily, Mr. Obama nearly gave up the bully pulpit.\n\nWhile critics are right to chastise Mr. Obama for his pallid rhetoric on race, at least as president, they are wrong to say that he does not care about poor communities of color. Mr. Obama has been spending without saying. He should get at least as much credit for the former as vilification for the latter.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140821205029, "twitter": {"description": "Has the president hidden his own war on poverty too well?", "title": "Obama Cares.
