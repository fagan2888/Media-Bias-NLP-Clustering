The arguments over whether to expand Medicaid vary state by state, but proponents often point to the federal government’s offer to foot almost the entire bill

But a new study released by the Civitas Institute suggests that this argument doesn’t account for associated increases in state and local spending

Analyzing all federal funding to state and local governments finds that each additional dollar of federal money sent to the states is associated with an average increase of 82 cents in new state and local taxes
