President Barack Obama's insistence that he will sign an executive order that will allow as many as 6 million illegal immigrants to stay in the country will only create a new surge of illegal migrants across the U.S. border, says the National Border Patrol."We definitely see increases in illegal aliens coming across the border when there is national talk of an amnesty," Shawn Moran of the National Border Patrol Council told Newsradio 1200 WOAI He said that Mexican and Latin American smuggling cartels seize on messages from the administration to recruit people who may be desperate to escape poverty and violent crime in their own countries."Under President Bush there was talk of immigration reform, and they would say, 'we're coming here for the amnesty,'" Moran said, adding that changes in the administration's immigration policy will create a new surge.Moran used as an example the recent influx of minors from Central America."That was largely fueled by the idea that we were not enforcing our immigration laws, and if you got to this country, you could stay here," he said, according to WOAI.President Barack Obama told congressional leaders at a meeting on Friday that he intended to take executive action on immigration even though he had been warned against the move by the GOP in the aftermath of their electoral victories.Before the announcement, House Speaker John Boehner said the president would "poison the well" if he changes immigration policy without waiting for Congress to act, and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said executive action on immigration would be like "waving a red flag in front of a bull."On Sunday, Obama defended his decision to act and said he was not trying to circumvent Congress, but that he had waited long enough for it to take action."The minute they pass a bill that addresses the problems with immigration reform, I will sign it and it supersedes whatever actions I take," Obama said on CBS' "Face the Nation.""And I'm encouraging them to do so . . . on parallel track we're going to be implementing an executive action."But if in fact a bill gets passed, nobody's going to be happier than me to sign it, because that means it will be permanent rather than temporary."Just days before the election, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus , promised that if the GOP won control of the Senate the party would do "everything we can do to stop" executive amnesty for illegal immigrants.
