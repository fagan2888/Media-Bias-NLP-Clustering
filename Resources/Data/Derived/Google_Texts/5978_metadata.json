Raul Labrador (R-ID).\n\nThe conflict has been brewing since last September, when former House Speaker John Boehner (OH) helped forge a two-year deal that lifted looming budgets caps by raising discretionary spending by $50 billion in fiscal 2016 and $30 billion in 2017.\n\nThe agreement was the final achievement for Boehner, who was driven out of office by his increasingly public brawls with the Freedom Caucus, and conservatives gave his successor Paul Ryan (WI) a pass as he worked to pass the deal. However, 179 House Republicans voted against the deal, a clear sign of deep-rooted conservative anger.\n\nRelated: As National Debt Hits $19 Trillion, a Spending Showdown Looms in Congress\n\nNow Ryan -- a former House Budget Committee chair who has spent months promising that Republicans will no longer just be the party of \u201cno\u201d and give the American public a clear contrast with Democrats in a presidential election year -- faces a fork in the road that could open him up to the same criticisms that hounded Boehner into retirement and prompt new complaints from the minority that the GOP can\u2019t govern.\n\nCongressional budget resolutions don\u2019t become law but they do serve as a fiscal roadmap that lays out in detail the majority party\u2019s spending priorities for the year. If Ryan can\u2019t quiet his right flank, he could be forced to ditch the budget process all together and skip straight to drafting the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund the federal government.\n\nSuch a move would violate his promises to return the chamber to \u201cregular order\u201d and take up the spending bills individually.\n\nThat route could also be problematic for conservatives because without the budget blueprint to guide appropriators there is less incentive to write the 12 separate spending bills, thereby greatly increasing the chances of a free-spending, catch-all omnibus bill to keep the government\u2019s doors open.\n\nRelated: Four Trillion Reasons to Throw the Bums Out\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream Republican might revolt if Ryan buckles under conservative demands and reneges on the budget agreement. He also would face new opposition from defense hawks, who already want to see the topline number increased by over $20 billion.\n\nFreedom Caucus members argue the choice is simple: a smaller budget is in line with conservative values and therefore meets Ryan\u2019s goal of contrasting with the Democrats.\n\nLabrador said billionaire Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide earlier this week because \u201cthe American people don\u2019t trust the Republican Party to do the things we promised to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are $19 trillion in debt and we\u2019ve got a whole town that wants to ignore that,\u201d said Tea Party Caucus chair Tim Huelskamp (R-KS). \u201cWe\u2019re talking about $30 billion.\u201d ***\n\nRep. David Brat (R-VA), who dubbed the two-year deal a \u201ccrap sandwich,\u201d said he could support higher spending if Ryan made commitments \u201cin writing\u201d to find savings quickly on other issues the Wisconsin lawmaker has highlighted, like welfare reform.\n\nJordan rejected the idea that just because the two-year budget deal set the topline numbers, lawmakers must adhere to it.\n\nHe noted that the budget panel passed a blueprint last year only to see it grow on the chamber floor after defense hawks won more money for the Pentagon and grew again in the final bargain after leaders promised Democrats to match every new dollar in defense with one on the domestic side.\n\n\u201cThe logic that we have to follow that number \u2026 We have never done that. Are you kidding me?!\u201d he asked.\n\nTensions could come to a head on Friday when Ryan, who has spent the last few weeks casually meeting with members, reveals the path forward to the entire House GOP Conference.\n\nIf Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t find a way to trim $30 billion from a $4 trillion budget, \u201cthen none of us deserve to be here as members of Congress,\u201d said Labrador.\n\n\u201cWe should hang our heads in shame.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One week after the Republican-controlled Congress broke with over 40 years of tradition by denying the White House budget director a chance to explain the administration\u2019s annual budget request, the GOP is coming precariously close to not even being able to come up with its own spending blueprint.", "title": "Why Paul Ryan's Budget Deal Could Go Down in Flames", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/12/Why-Paul-Ryans-Budget-Deal-Could-Go-Down-Flames", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/12/Why-Paul-Ryans-Budget-Deal-Could-Go-Down-Flames", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One week after the Republican-controlled Congress broke with over 40 years of tradition by denying the White House budget director a chance to explain the administration\u2019s annual budget request, the GOP is coming precariously close to not even being able to come up with its own spending blueprint.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jordan rejected the idea that just because the two-year budget deal set the topline numbers, lawmakers must adhere to it.\nIf Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t find a way to trim $30 billion from a $4 trillion budget, \u201cthen none of us deserve to be here as members of Congress,\u201d said Labrador.\nFreedom Caucus members argue the choice is simple: a smaller budget is in line with conservative values and therefore meets Ryan\u2019s goal of contrasting with the Democrats.\nHowever, 179 House Republicans voted against the deal, a clear sign of deep-rooted conservative anger.\nRelated: Four Trillion Reasons to Throw the Bums OutMeanwhile, mainstream Republican might revolt if Ryan buckles under conservative demands and reneges on the budget agreement."}
