In an Oct. 7 column for National Review Online, Stanford University historian Victor Davis Hanson asserted scandals constitute the defining feature of President Obama‘s administration. Mr. Hanson even went so far as to suggest Mr. Obama will surpass Warren Harding – he of Teapot Dome and Ohio Gang infamy – as the American president most tainted by scandal.

Read this fascinating piece here.

I tend to agree that Mr. Obama’s doings make Mr. Harding’s malfeasance look like small potatoes. However, I think that only is part of what he will be remembered for. As far as I’m concerned, Mr. Obama’s lasting legacy will be as a leader who did not live up to expectations.

Mr. Obama won his office in 2008 by a convincing margin. At the time of his election, it seemed some Americans truly believed him to be a God-like figure capable of miracles. In fact, before he had even been sworn in, scholars and non-scholars alike were comparing him with some of America’s most well-regarded presidents, namely Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

Instead, Mr. Obama presided over a stream of debacles. Throughout his presidency, it seems policy failures – like the decline in America’s standing on the world stage and problems with Obamacare – bureaucratic incompetence and scandals have been mainstays in news reports. For this reason, the president barely has the support of 40 percent of Americans, and his Democratic Party is bracing for mass losses in next month’s midterm elections.

While no president is perfect, it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that things got so messy under Mr. Obama’s watch. As such, he can fairly be described as a weak leader who never had the right stuff for the presidency to begin with.

Needless to say, things certainly did not play out in the manner anticipated by the people who blindly bought Mr. Obama’s “hope and change” rhetoric six years ago.
