YOLA, Nigeria (AP) — A Nigerian official says that hundreds of girls and women, many bewildered and traumatized, are being registered, fed and given medical care in their first day out of Nigeria’s war zone.

The group of 275 women and children are among the nearly 700 released by the Nigerian military from Boko Haram extremists and the first to be transported to the safety of Malkohi refugee camp here in Yola in northeastern Nigeria.

Officials on Sunday are still registering the 61 women and 214 children, almost all girls, said Zakari Abubakar, Malkohi camp team leader for the National Emergency Management Agency. Many critically malnourished babies and children have been put on intravenous drips in the camp’s clinic and 21 are being treated for gunshot wounds and fractured limbs.
