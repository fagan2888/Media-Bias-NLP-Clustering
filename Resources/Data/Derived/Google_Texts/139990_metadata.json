Employees are encouraged to adopt a volunteer project through a local nonprofit or public school. The employees at the Highway 31 Lowe\u2019s in Spring Hill chose to give Fire Station No. 1, located at 440 Beechcroft Rd., a slick, new upgrade.\n\n\u201cLowe\u2019s is 100 percent dedicated to being part of the community, growing with the community and showing that,\u201d said Lowe\u2019s store manager Mike Behrens. \u201cThat\u2019s what these projects are about. It\u2019s not about anything, but just being a partner with the community.\u201d\n\nSixteen Lowe\u2019s employees worked alongside SHFD firefighters, who volunteered during their off-duty time to complete the project, which took around two weeks. Together, they applied a fresh coat of paint on the station\u2019s walls, installed kitchen cabinets and counter-tops, refinished the truck bay floor, put up new ceiling tiles, built a custom desk at the front entrance, and installed new door hardware and kick plates.\n\nThe paint used was donated by Olympic Paints &Stains.\n\nThe donation will end up saving the station around $15,000 of its yearly expenses, Spring Hill Fire Chief Terry Hood said.\n\n\u201cYou should have seen it before, the walls were yellow and you walked in and it was just like a day-care,\u201d Hood said.\n\nHe said the way the fire station got involved with the Lowe\u2019s Heroes program came after he went in to buy a new front door for the Spring Hill station, which he said had a gap in it, which was causing grass to blow in.\n\n\u201cOne thing led to another, and they said \u2018Here\u2019s what we do for the community,\u2019 so that\u2019s how we came about doing it, because we replaced the front door,\u201d Hood said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s kind of funny how things happen.\u201d\n\nOther donors for the Fire Station No. 1 project included local restaurants and grocery stores \u2014 Jet\u2019s Pizza, Papa John\u2019s of Spring Hill, Amigos Mexican Grill, Publix and Chik-Fil-A \u2014 who provided workers with free meals.\n\nLowe\u2019s Heroes have also completed other projects in the Spring Hill area, including \u201cbeautifying\u201d Eden Park with a new fountain and building dugouts for the baseball fields at Heritage Park.\n\nBehrens said in 2013, Lowe\u2019s donated $1.75 million, which included rebuilding projects in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas and other states impacted by destructive fires, floods and tornadoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to be able to give back,\u201d Behrens said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for us to be able to have the freedom to do something like this and give back to the community, especially the folks that when something happens to us, they\u2019re responding to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRING HILL \u2014 Fire Station No. 1 opened its doors Friday to showcase a recent remodel that was made possible through an $11,000 donation from Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "JAY POWELL jpowell@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "SPRING HILL \u2014 Fire Station No. 1 opened its doors Friday to showcase a recent remodel that was made possible through an $11,000 donation from Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement.", "title": "Fire station unveils remodel", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/fire-station-unveils-remodel", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Remodeled-SH-Firehouse--Station-Bay_swt_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/fire-station-unveils-remodel", "title": "Fire station unveils remodel", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1027972", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1027972", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-09T19:11:36-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "SPRING HILL \u2014 Fire Station No.\nThe employees at the Highway 31 Lowe\u2019s in Spring Hill chose to give Fire Station No.\nThe donation will end up saving the station around $15,000 of its yearly expenses, Spring Hill Fire Chief Terry Hood said.\n\u201cLowe\u2019s Heroes\u201d is an annual employee volunteer program, which provides thousands of hours of community support each year.\nHe said the way the fire station got involved with the Lowe\u2019s Heroes program came after he went in to buy a new front door for the Spring Hill station, which he said had a gap in it, which was causing grass to blow in."}
