Royal Gorge CrossFit recently moved from 710 Main St. to 130 North Third St.

Their grand reopening is from 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. July 4. There will be refreshments, games and bounce houses.

"Everyone is welcome to see what we do," Nick Nelson, one of the owners, said.

Nelson said the classes, which last about an hour, increase strength and strength endurance.

"We warm up, we stretch, we go through the movements on our form. Then we'll start doing strength workouts. That usually takes about 20 minutes," he said. "Then we'll do a cardio movement which really involves more than one movement. It involves anything from pull-ups to pushups to air squats to overhead squats, just a whole broad spectrum of exercises. We usually put those at a little lighter weight with high intensity to get cardio in."

Classes are at 5:30 a.m., 6:30 a.m., 8:30 a.m., 4:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. There is also a 9 a.m. Saturday class, which is free to the public, Nelson said. From 10 a.m. to noon is open gym. At that time, people are welcome to work on any exercise of their choice.
