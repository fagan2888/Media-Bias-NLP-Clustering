Patients can pick the skin tone of their virtual arm \u2014 many prefer green \u2014 and the game\u2019s theme, Hodges said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Wild West Ducks, we\u2019ve got Seascape Ducks, and we have everybody\u2019s favorite, which is Ducks in Space,\u201d he says. The next generation, currently in development, features Cows in Space.\n\nThe game can also be customized according to patient ability. In the setup, patients extend their arms as far as they can. The game makes up the difference so that patients with very limited motion can still play.\n\nTherapists can use \u201cDuck Duck Punch\u201d to track patients\u2019 progress and provide analytic data, which is important under the Affordable Care Act, Hodges says.\n\nHayes and Hodges have been working with Michelle Woodbury, an associate professor and director of the Upper Extremity Motor Function Lab at Medical University of South Carolina. \u201cEverything about the game was developed in conjunction with her,\u201d Hodges says. \u201cWe\u2019re the computer guys. She knows what stroke survivors really need to regain reuse of their arms.\u201d\n\nThe origins of the game go back to 2011 when Hodges and Woodbury met at a MUSC conference that brought researchers together to look for possible collaborations. Woodbury told the group about her idea for a game that would encourage patients to do stroke-recovery exercises. Hodges knew that the technical know-how could be found at Clemson, where he is a professor in the Human-Centered Computing Division in the School of Computing.\n\nHodges told Hayes, then a Ph.D. student, about the game idea. They began work on a prototype and a year later, it took second place out of more than 500 entries at the 2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe team formed Recovr in 2013 to help expand \u201cDuck Duck Punch.\u201d Hayes set aside his Ph.D. plans to become the company\u2019s full-time CEO.\n\n\u201cI knew that if it just stayed in the research lab, it was going to be awesome but for a limited number of people,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cWe wanted to pull it out and see it help more people in more locations. I really wanted to do well and do good at the same. To make an impact on someone\u2019s daily life \u2014 that\u2019s really rewarding for me.\u201d\n\nHodges serves as chief operating officer. Kevin Jett, scheduled to graduate in December 2015 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Clemson, is the company\u2019s software engineer.\n\nRecovr is now one of two companies, both from Clemson, in the Concepts to Companies portfolio. The founders, John Warner and Brian McSharry, help turn academic ideas into commercial enterprises by investing capital and offering their business expertise.\n\n\u201c\u2018Duck Duck Punch\u2019 is a great illustration of collaboration between Clemson University and Medical University of South Carolina,\u201d Warner says. \u201cIt shows that South Carolina has high quality intellectual capital. There is a huge need for this kind of product, and it\u2019s growing. We\u2019re expecting big things from Recovr.\u201d\n\nEileen Kraemer, the C. Tycho Howle director of the School of Computing, says she is proud that Recovr\u2019s roots trace back to the school. \u201c\u2018Duck Duck Punch\u2019 could have a global impact on stroke survivors not only in the United States but around the world,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the best, brightest and most inventive students and faculty members in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering and Science, \u201cDuck Duck Punch\u201d is an excellent example of how \u201ctranslational research\u201d can take projects from the lab to a patient\u2019s bedside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new generation of entrepreneurial leaders,\u201d Gramopadhye says. \u201cThey are not only qualified to take jobs, but they are also prepared to create jobs. It\u2019s exciting to see Clemson students, alumni and faculty members put that into practice. The Recovr team has a bright future.\u201d\n\nFor more about Duck Duck Punch and Recovr, you can contact Austen Hayes at or go to the company website at www.recovrinc.com.\n\nPaul Alongi is a technical and feature writer for the College of Engineering and Science.\n\nListen to Clemson News Now student reporter Jackie Veliz\u2019s story on Duck Duck Punch:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Clemson World Magazine", "description": "Visit the post for more.", "title": "Duck Duck Punch", "url": "http://clemson.world/2015/12/duck-duck-punch/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://clemson.world/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FEAT-Duck-Duck-Punch-Recovr.jpg", "height": 2092}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-29T13:00:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T21:34:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ClemsonWorld", "image": "http://clemson.world/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FEAT-Duck-Duck-Punch-Recovr.jpg?w=640", "description": "Post by @ClemsonWorld.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ClemsonWorld"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201c\u2018Duck Duck Punch\u2019 could have a global impact on stroke survivors not only in the United States but around the world,\u201d she says.\nListen to Clemson News Now student reporter Jackie Veliz\u2019s story on Duck Duck Punch:\n\u201c\u2018Duck Duck Punch\u2019 is a great illustration of collaboration between Clemson University and Medical University of South Carolina,\u201d Warner says.\nThe team formed Recovr in 2013 to help expand \u201cDuck Duck Punch.\u201d Hayes set aside his Ph.D. plans to become the company\u2019s full-time CEO.\nThe Recovr team has a bright future.\u201dFor more about Duck Duck Punch and Recovr, you can contact Austen Hayes at or go to the company website at www.recovrinc.com."}
