Q: Is it true that women athletes need to have extra iron in their diets?

A: “It’s quite common for female athletes to have iron deficiency,” says Nancy Clark, author of the “Sports Nutrition Guidebook.”

Clark attributes iron deficiency among female athletes to monthly blood loss and an added demand on iron stores through high-intensity training, as well as a focus on lean, vegetarian and natural foods.

Too much iron is not healthful, either, so it’s important to be tested before taking an iron supplement.

But iron is readily available in food — especially in red meat and seafood (in particular, clams). It is also abundant in green-leafy vegetables such as spinach and in beans and fortified cereals.

And so, Clark says, the trend among female athletes and other health-conscious consumers to move away from red meat and to give up fortified foods creates a “perfect storm” for iron deficiency.

For example, good ol’ Grape Nuts — a fortified (“processed”) cereal — has 90 percent of the recommended daily allowance for iron, while the natural Kashi Go Lean Crunch has 8 percent.

For women who want to get more of their iron from plants, one possibility is to consume greens or beans together with vitamin C, which improves iron absorption. It’s also worth limiting consumption of foods that inhibit the uptake of iron, including calcium and coffee and tea.
