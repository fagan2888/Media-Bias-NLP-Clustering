ACA prices shock older Hill aides\n\nVeteran House Democratic aides are sick over the insurance prices they\u2019ll pay under Obamacare, and they\u2019re scrambling to find a cure.\n\n\u201cIn a shock to the system, the older staff in my office (folks over 59) have now found out their personal health insurance costs (even with the government contribution) have gone up 3-4 times what they were paying before,\u201d Minh Ta, chief of staff to Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), wrote to fellow Democratic chiefs of staff in an email message obtained by POLITICO. \u201cSimply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the email, Ta noted that older congressional staffs may leave their jobs because of the change to their health insurance.\n\n( PHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout)\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, and federal regulations, many congressional staffers \u2014 designated as \u201cofficial\u201d aides \u2014 were forced to move out of the old heavily subsidized Federal Employees Health Benefits program and into the District of Columbia\u2019s health insurance marketplace exchange. Others designated as \u201cunofficial\u201d were allowed to stay in the FEHB program. Managers had to choose whether aides were \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cunofficial\u201d by Oct. 31, and Ta said that wasn\u2019t enough time to make an informed decision about who would benefit and who would lose out by going into the new system.\n\nMoore\u2019s office was one of those in which all staff were designated as \u201cofficial\u201d and pushed into the exchanges. That ended up being a problem for older staff, who weren\u2019t accustomed to paying higher premiums because of their age.\n\nBut age is one of the few factors insurers can use to adjust prices under Obamacare \u2014 and older people will often pay much more than younger people.\n\n( IN 90 SECONDS: Republicans coordinate message on Obamacare)\n\nFor instance, the premiums for gold-level Aetna HMO plans in D.C. cost an average of $684.40 per month for a 55-year-old. A similar plan would cost an average of $287.11 for a 27-year-old. The gold-level CareFirst HMO plans have an average premium of $573.07 for a 55-year-old \u2014 more than double the $240.41 average for 27-year-olds. That\u2019s before the federal employee contribution toward the premium.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Ta emphasized that \u201cemployees are not dissatisfied with the Affordable Care Act\u201d and that some younger staffers have seen their premiums fall. But, he noted, congressional aides are treated differently now than other federal employees, and he would like to be able to offer the best health insurance option available to his employees \u2014 even if that means some of them are covered under the old system and others jump into the exchanges.\n\nHe wrote in his email that he had asked Democratic staff on the House Administration Committee whether she could redesignate some of the aides on Moore\u2019s payroll as nonofficial office staff so that they could avoid the exchange and keep their FEHB plans.\n\n( POLITICO's full coverage of Obamacare)\n\n\u201cSo far the answer is no, and that we have the opportunity next year to redesignate staff,\u201d Ta wrote. \u201cI am asking for a solution now though because I will lose staff in my office because of this snafu and I mentioned to payroll and House Admin[istration Committee] that it was unfair for our offices to make this designation without allowing our staff the ability [to] actually go on the DCshop to compare rates. I would have made a different decision on the designation of my older staff.\u201d\n\nTa concluded by asking other chiefs of staff to join him in petitioning the Administration Committee for an immediate fix. Glenn Rushing, chief of staff to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, quickly replied to the group that he would join the fight.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Some staffers see prices up to four times greater.", "title": "ACA prices shock older Hill aides", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/older-capitol-hill-aides-obamacare-affordable-care-act-prices-health-insurance-100226.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/29/102913_hill_staffers_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1822),Affordable Care Act (583),Capitol Hill (193),Staffers (59),Health Insurance (238),Obamacare (1051)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Some staffers see prices up to four times greater.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd168\"", "article_summary": "ACA prices shock older Hill aidesVeteran House Democratic aides are sick over the insurance prices they\u2019ll pay under Obamacare, and they\u2019re scrambling to find a cure.\nThat ended up being a problem for older staff, who weren\u2019t accustomed to paying higher premiums because of their age.\n( POLITICO's full coverage of Obamacare)\u201cSo far the answer is no, and that we have the opportunity next year to redesignate staff,\u201d Ta wrote.\n\u201cSimply unacceptable.\u201dStory Continued BelowIn the email, Ta noted that older congressional staffs may leave their jobs because of the change to their health insurance.\nBut age is one of the few factors insurers can use to adjust prices under Obamacare \u2014 and older people will often pay much more than younger people."}
