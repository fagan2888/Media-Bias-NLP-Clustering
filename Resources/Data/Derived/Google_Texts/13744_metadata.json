He singled out one of the first names on the alphabetical list of exclusive RSD merchandise for proof.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody rushing out to buy a limited-edition A-ha record.\u201d\n\nHoenack and the rest of his Twin Cities record-shop peers nonetheless expect music fans to flock to their stores Saturday.
