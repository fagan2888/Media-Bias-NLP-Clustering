The PUC then posted it online.\n\nThe filings include plans to lower residential electricity bills by more than 20 percent by the year 2030 and nearly triple the amount of rooftop solar allowed as part of a more comprehensive strategy, ordered by the commission back in April.\n\nThe HECO Companies\u2019 filings included the following:\n\nPower Supply Improvement Plan to expeditiously retire older fossil generation, reduce must-run generation, increase generation flexibility, adopt new technologies, such as demand response and energy storage, for ancillary services, and institute operational practice changes.\n\nto expeditiously retire older fossil generation, reduce must-run generation, increase generation flexibility, adopt new technologies, such as demand response and energy storage, for ancillary services, and institute operational practice changes. Distributed Generation Interconnection Plan to develop technical solutions and action plans to increase distributed generation interconnection capability in major capacity increments.\n\nto develop technical solutions and action plans to increase distributed generation interconnection capability in major capacity increments. Integrated interconnection queue proposal to provide transparent information on the status of all distributed generation interconnection requests.\n\nRead the filings online here.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious plan that relies heavily on switching from generating units that run on oil to newer units that run on liquefied natural gas, known as LNG.\n\nAnd customers would eventually pay less for their electricity, if all goes as planned over the next two decades.\n\nBack in April, the PUC sent a strong message to the Hawaiian Electric Companies \u2014 that it\u2019s not moving fast enough to lower utility rates and connect more photovoltaic systems into the grid.\n\nHECO answered back late Tuesday afternoon, meeting the deadline set by the PUC.\n\nIsaac Moriwake, an attorney with the non-profit environmental law firm Earthjustice, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a definite improvement from the plan that they issued previously which the PUC basically trashed. And they\u2019re being more ambitious in getting rid of their old dinosaur plants and trying to go with clean as possible towards the future.\u201d\n\nHawaii residents pay some of the highest utility rates in the nation \u2014 a source of frustration for many.\n\nHECO says its proposed plan \u201cwill lower electric bills, nearly triple the amount of distributed solar, while achieving the highest level of renewable energy in the nation by 2030.\u201d\n\nMoriwake says the plan raises several concerns.\n\n\u201cOne concern, it looks like initially this is a plan to convert all their generators to LNG or gas and so is that the right answer? The other major concern that the plan raised is they\u2019re proposing pretty substantial reductions in the paybacks for rooftop solar and is that truly fair? Is that the right answer given that rooftop solar is only going to get cheaper and cheaper and that\u2019s what customers want,\u201d he said.\n\nHECO says it plans to work with the solar industry \u2014 supporting a sustainable growth of rooftop solar, and letting customers and the solar companies know how much more solar can be added each year.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re going to nearly triple it but that\u2019s all the way out to 2030 and that\u2019s what HECO wants but is that what the customers want? That\u2019s what HECO is planning but is that what the market is going to dictate,\u201d Moriwake said.\n\nAnd whatever energy needs are not met by renewables will be met with LNG.\n\n\u201cThis plan banks on gas it banks on LNG and most of the cost savings as far as I can tell us based on that. is that going to pan out, is that going to work? It remains to be seen,\u201d Moriwake said.\n\nHECO\u2019s President and CEO Dick Rosenblum said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s the start of a conversation that all of us \u2013 utilities, regulators and other policymakers, the solar industry, customers and other stakeholders \u2013 need to be a part of, as we work together to achieve the energy future we all want for Hawai\u2019i.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good start and it\u2019s headed in the right direction but it does raise major questions,\u201d Moriwake said.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? The PUC says it\u2019ll immediately start evaluating the filings to determine the extent to which the plans are consistent with the PUC\u2019s orders and the state\u2019s energy goals.\n\nMany in the PV industry said HECO\u2019s new plan has been a long time coming.\n\n\u201cWe need answers, basically for everyone to know what the best thing to do is going forward,\u201d said Colin Yost, general counsel for RevoluSun. \u201cIt should give people more certainty as to when you\u2019ll be able to get approved to have solar connected and how much it will cost.\u201d\n\nWhile hopeful the new plan should help, Yost said he\u2019s still cautious. \u201cThere\u2019s cause for concern because it has taken so long for this plan to come forward,\u201d he said.\n\nWith 300 customers that have signed PV contracts but are just waiting for HECO\u2019s approval, \u201cwe hope that the filing today will give some answers to all those customers and everyone else who\u2019s been waiting to see what HECO does before signing up,\u201d Yost said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The day for Hawaiian Electric Company to present a plan to reduce costs and allow more people to use renewable energy is finally here.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411526747", "og": {"site_name": "KHON2", "description": "The day for Hawaiian Electric Company to present a plan to reduce costs and allow more people to use renewable energy is finally here.", "title": "HECO delivers massive comprehensive strategy to PUC at deadline", "url": "http://khon2.com/2014/08/26/heco-delivers-massive-comprehensive-strategy-to-puc-at-deadline/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/heco-puc-report.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The day for Hawaiian Electric Company to present a plan to reduce costs and allow more people to use renewable energy is finally here.", "title": "HECO delivers massive comprehensive strategy to PUC at deadline", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/heco-puc-report.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@khonnews", "site": "khonnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Working for Hawaii - Hawaii News, Weather, and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.khon", "fb": {"pages": 66874361378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khon2.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b26093ebd87004d2709601aeb29b2013?s=16", "application-name": "KHON2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/khon2news", "published_time": "2014-08-27T02:50:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T08:39:10+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "F8HhCy2NOcu_QvRKzZJGqFMMgASTuCT3_KKw72WqXWw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Distributed Generation Interconnection Plan to develop technical solutions and action plans to increase distributed generation interconnection capability in major capacity increments.\nIntegrated interconnection queue proposal to provide transparent information on the status of all distributed generation interconnection requests.\nto develop technical solutions and action plans to increase distributed generation interconnection capability in major capacity increments.\nHECO answered back late Tuesday afternoon, meeting the deadline set by the PUC.\nThat\u2019s what HECO is planning but is that what the market is going to dictate,\u201d Moriwake said."}
