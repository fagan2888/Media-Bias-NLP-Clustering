For many NFL fans in the late 1970s, when they thought of Denver, they thought of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hang-up was,\u201d said former Broncos quarterback Craig Morton. \u201cHe was really overdue. I played with a guy, Bobby Hayes. Rick was like a reincarnation of Hayes. Nobody could cover him. He was a guy where if you needed something, you had to figure out how to give him the ball as fast as you could and let him run.\u201d\n\nAt long last, the Ring of Fame caught up to Upchurch. The NFL\u2019s all-decade punt returner in the 1970s and second-team all- decade returner in the 1980s, Upchurch joined original Broncos halfback and kicker Gene Mingo and longtime coach Dan Reeves during an induction ceremony at the Ring of Fame Plaza at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Friday night.\n\nThe humble Upchurch thanked his blockers and coaches for the honor and said he never gave the Ring of Fame much thought.\n\n\u201cI did hear some of that, but you have other players that should be in,\u201d Upchurch said. \u201cSimon Fletcher, Riley Odoms, Red Miller. And I think by the Broncos going back now, and bringing in myself and Dan Reeves and Gene Mingo, some positive things can happen and maybe some of those other guys will get in as well that are deserving.\u201d\n\nMorton and Reeves were rookies together with the Dallas Cowboys in 1965.\n\n\u201cI knew he was going to be a coach from the very beginning,\u201d Morton said of Reeves. \u201cHe just knew the game better than anybody I had played with. \u201c\n\nReeves had seven 10-win seasons and a franchise-best five division titles during his 12 years as Broncos coach. His best team?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been asked that question,\u201d Reeves said after a pause. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to hurt somebody\u2019s feelings if you pick the wrong one. The exciting game no question was \u2018The Drive.\u2019 To go to the first Super Bowl is something you never forget.\u201d\n\nMingo led the American Football League in scoring in both its inaugural season of 1960 and in 1962. He became emotional Friday when he recalled Chuck Gavin, a starting defensive end in 1962, being concerned about Mingo\u2019s weight that year. Gavin would bring Mingo to a local park and have him do push-ups, sit-ups and jumping jacks.\n\n\u201cChuck wanted me to get into the Ring of Fame,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cI miss him and I wish he was here.\u201d Gavin died in 2012 at 78.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rick Upchurch\u2019s return includes induction into Broncos\u2019 Ring of Fame", "title": "Rick Upchurch\u2019s return includes induction into Broncos\u2019 Ring of Fame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/12/rick-upchurchs-return-includes-induction-into-broncos-ring-of-fame/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140912_112302_rick-upchurch.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140912_112302_rick-upchurch.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T21:24:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:42:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As the years went by, the wonderful existence and celebration of the Broncos\u2019 Ring of Fame was taking on a tinge of bafflement.\n\u201cChuck wanted me to get into the Ring of Fame,\u201d Mingo said.\n\u201cReeves had seven 10-win seasons and a franchise-best five division titles during his 12 years as Broncos coach.\nWhy wasn\u2019t Rick Upchurch in the Ring of Fame?\nThe humble Upchurch thanked his blockers and coaches for the honor and said he never gave the Ring of Fame much thought."}
