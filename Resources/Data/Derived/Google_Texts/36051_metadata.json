( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nWhen George Coates was 14, he decided to mix Thanksgiving leftovers with a gourmet recipe into a turkey gumbo.\n\nNow a professional chef at Mo' Betta Gumbo in Loveland, Coates (Chef Boomer) still believes the flavor of turkey, Cajun spices and andouille sausage is a winning mix.\n\n\"It's just an amazing meal,\" said Coates, who learned to cook in New Jersey from his grandmother. \"It has so many things in it.\"\n\nAnd it changes the flavor of the turkey for a totally different meal.\n\nThanksgiving is a time to fill the table with traditional foods in most homes across America. And after Thanksgiving is a time of turkey sandwiches, turkey noodle soup and, quite often, waste.\n\nYear-round, Americans waste 40 percent to 50 percent of the food that is produced, according to studies from the University of Arizona and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Much of that is lost in the production process and from restaurants, but as estimated 14 percent is lost in the home.\n\nExperts advise residents to carefully plan meals, check what they have before going to the store, compost food waste, freeze extra portions for future meals and, of course, make leftovers into something completely new.\n\nLoveland mother and daughter, Linda Robinson and Jessica Kuhns, created a turkey tortilla soup with their Thankgsiving leftovers about six years ago because they were tired of the traditional turkey noodle soup. Their families love it and now, the creation made by melding several recipes with what was in the cupboard, is a new tradition.\n\nRobinson still makes the broth from the turkey carcass, but now the soup is a new, fresh taste.\n\n\"It's a completely different flavor,\" said Kuhns.\n\n\"I would say it's more zesty than spicy,\" added Robinson. \"It's very flavorful with the onions and peppers and all.\"\n\nWhile Robinson, Kuhns and Coates incorporate leftover turkey with other ingredients for new meals, Big Thompson Canyon resident Laura Emerson uses almost all the Thanksgiving leftovers in a one turkey sweet potato pie.\n\nChef Boomer poses with a freshly-baked pan of corn bread Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2015, at Mo' Betta Gumbo that he says goes great with gumbo. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nShe admits that it doesn't sound tasty. But things are not always as they seem.\n\n\"It was really good,\" said Emerson, who started with a recipe from Better Homes and Gardens Heritage Cookbook then modified the the ingredients significantly for her very own version, using what she has each time, once even putting in the green bean casserole.\n\n\"You do get tired of the same old thing,\" Emerson said. \"It's a different, more savory way to use sweet potatoes.\"\n\nShe added, \"You look at a recipe like this and think it's either really good or really awful. You've just got to find out.\"\n\n-- Recipes --\n\nChef Boomer's Turkey Gumbo\n\n2 onions\n\n2 peppers\n\nCelery\n\nTurkey leftovers\n\nAndouille sausage\n\nChicken stock\n\n16 ounces of butter\n\n16 ounces of flour\n\nCajun seasoning\n\nTobasco Sauce\n\n1 bag ochre (optional)\n\nStart a mixture called chocolate rue in advance of the gumbo, maybe even the day before. This must cook at least four hours; the longer it cooks, the more robust the flavor. On medium to high heat, mix 8 ounces of butter and equal parts flour. Cook at least four hours stirring constantly. You can lower the temperature as the roux cooks.\n\nJust before starting gumbo, create a blonde roux. Start with 8 ounces of butter and equal parts flour and cook over medium heat just until the ingredients are incorporated.\n\nHave both roux handy as you begin the gumbo.\n\nCombine chopped onions, peppers and celery so there are equal amounts of each in a stock pot. Sweet them down in oil. Add precooked turkey and sausage, each portion equal to the amount of chopped onions and peppers, as well as ochre if you choose. Then add three times that amount of chicken stock, 6 ounces of tobasco sauce and Cajun seasoning\n\nBegin cooking the gumbo on medium heat. Stir in the chocolate roux and the blonde roux before the mixture starts to boil, making sure they do not form lumps. Stir constantly. When the gumbo begins to boil, cook for two minutes then turn down heat and simmer for another five minutes.\n\nServe over rice.\n\nLinda Robinson and Jessica Kuhns' Turkey Tortilla Soup\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n2 bell peppers, diced (your favorite color)\n\n1-2 jalapenos seeded and dices (optional for spicier soup)\n\n6-8 cups turkey broth (see recipe for homemade broth)\n\n1 tbsp taco seasoning or to taste\n\n2 cups shredded turkey\n\n1 can black beans, drained (preseasoned with cumin and chili for more flavor)\n\n1 can diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup frozen corn (or 1 can)\n\n\u00bd cup chopped cilantro\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n4-6 Tortillas, cut into strips (corn or flour)\n\n1-2 Cups frying oil separated for cooking vegetables and tortilla strips\n\nCondiments: Cilantro, diced tomato, sour cream, shredded cheese, avocado\n\nAfter removing all the roasted meat from the turkey, place the carcass in a stock pot with some onions, celery, and carrots. Cover with water and simmer 2 hours to make a broth.\n\nSaute onions and peppers in a bit of oil in a stock pot.\n\nAdd broth, turkey, beans, tomatoes and corn to the pot. Bring to boil, then simmer for 20 minutes.\n\nIn a separate pan, heat oil and try strips of tortillas in batches, salting to taste.
