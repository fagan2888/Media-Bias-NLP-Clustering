And about one-third of those cases involve children who are being adopted or placed in foster homes.\n\nThis week's reform will clarify the tribe's position in those cases, Nimmo said.\n\n\"Parental rights could still be terminated if necessary,\" she said. \"But a court would have to find good cause to pass over a biological parent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more than three months after Veronica left Oklahoma, attorneys for the adoptive parents are still trying to collect more than $1 million in legal fees from the Cherokee Nation and Veronica's biological family.\n\nCourts in Nowata County and South Carolina have not yet ruled on whether Matt and Melanie Capobianco's legal team has a right to the money.\n\nDuring the drawn-out court case, the attorneys repeatedly said they were working \"pro bono,\" or for free.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "It probably wouldn't have made a difference in Baby Veronica's case, but a recent change in Cherokee Nation tribal law might prevent future custody battles, officials said Tuesday.", "title": "Cherokee Nation adoption laws clarify biological parents' rights", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/cherokee-nation-adoption-laws-clarify-biological-parents-rights/article_43cecf06-32b2-5864-86e7-7b6c654c7ea4.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It probably wouldn't have made a difference in Baby Veronica's case, but a recent change in Cherokee Nation tribal law might prevent future custody battles, officials said Tuesday.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "cherokee,nimmo,nation,biological,parents,tribe,veronica,cases,adoption,child,local,news,state,homepagelatest", "news_keywords": "cherokee,nimmo,nation,biological,parents,tribe,veronica,cases,adoption,child,local,news,state,homepagelatest"}, "article_summary": "It probably wouldn't have made a difference in Baby Veronica's case, but a recent change in Cherokee Nation tribal law might prevent future custody battles, officials said Tuesday.\nBut that wasn't sufficiently clear in tribal law, said Chrissi Nimmo, an assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation.\nThe tribe has always believed that biological parents, as long as they are fit and willing, should be the first choice to raise a child, officials said.\nBut the Cherokee Nation is involved in more than 1,200 Indian Child Welfare cases a year.\nIn a resolution passed Monday night, the Tribal Council gave biological parents first preference in adoption and foster-care cases, moving them ahead of a child's extended family, other members of the Cherokee Nation or other Indian families."}
