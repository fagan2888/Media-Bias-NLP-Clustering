The company says having access to borrowers\u2019 bank accounts allows the company to deposit the loan funds quickly and allows borrowers to make loan payments conveniently.\n\nA spokeswoman for Prosper, Sarah Cain, said borrowers could contact the company to stop the electronic bank withdrawals. But Prosper needs to update its website to reflect that borrowers can pay by personal check, she said.\n\nThe lenders\u2019 technological efficiency can also have a dark side.\n\nNew Innovative Products, a maker of specialty carrying cases in North Carolina, borrowed $70,000 in December from OnDeck, an online lender whose largest shareholders include a venture capital unit affiliated with Google. OnDeck was allowed to withdraw $604 from the company\u2019s bank account each day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut OnDeck crossed the line, according to a bankruptcy judge, when it kept collecting payments after being informed multiple times that the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In July, a bankruptcy judge imposed sanctions on OnDeck and ordered the lender to return the money.\n\nLast month, OnDeck was chided by a different judge for taking cash from Wayco Ham, a company in Goldsboro, N.C., that cures and sells hams and that also filed for bankruptcy protection. After its filing, Wayco Ham opened a new bank account.\n\nIn a move the judge called \u201cparticularly willful and malicious,\u201d OnDeck tapped Wayco Ham\u2019s new bank account and took out the loan payments. The bankruptcy judge had not granted permission to OnDeck for access to the new account, according to court documents.\n\nIn a statement, OnDeck said: \u201cWe are taking all corrective actions to rectify the situation, including complying with the court and making any required payments. Additionally, we have instituted further internal process improvements and controls to prevent such lapses in the future.\u201d\n\nWhen borrowers sign up for a Lending Club loan, it defaults to automatic bank withdrawals. The Lending Club website informs borrowers that they can opt out of the electronic withdrawals by either calling or emailing the company, but they have to pay a $7 processing fee for each paper check.\n\n\u201cIt is more cost-efficient for us, and we pass those savings along to borrowers,\u201d Renaud Laplanche, the chief executive of Lending Club, said of the automatic withdrawals.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome borrowers like Mr. Mansour said they ended up closing their bank accounts because they thought it was the only way to stop the lenders from taking out the money.\n\n\u201cIt can lead to people feeling trapped,\u201d said Peter Barker-Huelster, a lawyer at MFY Legal Services in New York, who has advised clients with marketplace loans. \u201cThey don\u2019t approach the lender to work out a lower payment because they think there is no way around it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the $12 billion in marketplace loans issued last year represents only a fraction of the overall consumer and small-business lending market, the industry has all the ingredients to become systemically significant.\n\nBillions of dollars of investments from hedge funds and other Wall Street firms are flowing into these marketplaces, creating a seemingly endless capacity to extend more loans.\n\nMarketplace lenders are also forming partnerships with the same banks they are seeking to disrupt.\n\nSmaller banks are buying up marketplace loans as investments, while others are offering co-branded loans with the online lenders.\n\nOne big bank, Citigroup, is teaming up with Lending Club to provide up to $150 million in loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers.\n\nThe deal may allow Citigroup to satisfy regulatory requirements for making loans in poor communities. Analysts said the deal could be a model for how other banks could essentially outsource some lending, required by the Community Reinvestment Act, to the marketplace industry. Citigroup said regulatory obligations did not drive the deal.\n\nSome banks have been cashing in on the boom since the start. Wells Fargo, through its venture arm, Norwest Venture Partners, was one of Lending Club\u2019s earliest investors. Today, Norwest is among the company\u2019s largest shareholders.\n\nMarketplace lenders say the loans often help borrowers straighten out their finances and improve their credit scores.\n\nLending Club\u2019s proportion of bad loans is generally in line with credit card losses at many other banks. The company says most of its borrowers have good credit scores and low debt-to-income levels. And the company says its surveys show that the vast majority of its customers have positive experiences with their loans, which carry an average interest rate of 11.25 percent, compared with the average credit card interest rate of about 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCredit cards are an apt comparison to marketplace loans because both are unsecured forms of credit, unlike mortgage or car loans, which are backed by real assets.\n\nLending Club, one of the few marketplace lenders that are public, was founded in 2006 by Mr. Laplanche.\n\nA French-born lawyer, Mr. Laplanche was inspired to start Lending Club after seeing how little banks paid people to deposit their money and how much those same banks charged to lend. \u201cWe wanted to lower the spread,\u201d he said.\n\nThe industry\u2019s nonbank qualities appealed to Eric Kim, 33, who lives outside San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI liked that it wasn\u2019t a bank,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who took out a $21,000 loan from Lending Club with a roughly 9 percent interest rate to clear out his credit card debt.\n\n\u201cIt felt more like people helping people,\u201d he said, \u201cnot some multibillion-dollar conglomerate.\u201d\n\nLending Club says most of its borrowers, like Mr. Kim, indicate they are using their loans to pay down credit cards.\n\nMr. Kim prefers that his payments are automatically deducted from his bank account every month because it forces him to stay on a budget.\n\n\u201cIt adds a level of responsibility, and I don\u2019t have to monitor it,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who works in operations for a large retail company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt first, a marketplace loan also seemed like a great idea to Vella Parker, 59, a lab technician who is out of work on disability. She could roll up thousands of dollars of debt from her five credit cards into one Lending Club loan and pay a lower interest rate.\n\nBut instead of paying off her credit cards, she spent much of her $8,375 loan to keep up with everyday expenses, including health insurance co-payments and taxis to her doctor\u2019s visits.\n\n\u201cI fell into the same trap as before,\u201d said Ms. Parker, who lives in the Bronx and had a previous bankruptcy.\n\nHer $288 monthly loan payment was far more than she had to pay each month as a minimum payment on her credit cards. She stopped making her payments.\n\nLisa Giordano\u2019s payments to Lending Club were even larger, about $740 a month. Unable to persuade the company to grant her a permanent loan modification, she stopped making her payments last year.\n\nMs. Parker\u2019s lawyer, Charles Juntikka, said an increasing number of his bankruptcy clients had marketplace loans. \u201cUp until a few months ago, I had never heard of these companies,\u201d he said.\n\nLending Club said it tries to work with struggling borrowers, including Ms. Giordano, who lives in Brooklyn. But it is also obligated to investors to honor the terms of their investments.\n\n\u201cBy and large, our borrowers are using us responsibly,\u201d Mr. Laplanche said. \u201cSome people will make bad decisions or they are in a situation where they will have to make bad decisions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mansour, the Queens accountant, readily admits that he made some financial mistakes trying to raise two children on a single salary in New York.\n\nHe said the ease with which he could borrow from marketplace lenders \u2014 he took out four loans within 19 months in addition to his multiple credit cards \u2014 enabled him to live far beyond his means. In July, Mr. Mansour filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cI made my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am paying for it now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150913212139, "twitter": {"description": "Marketed as a way to get out of debt, loans from online lenders are instead leaving some people deeper underwater.", "title": "Pitfalls for the Unwary Borrower Out on the Frontiers of Banking", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/dealbook/pitfalls-for-the-unwary-borrower-out-on-the-frontiers-of-banking.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003877197"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/business/lenders2/lenders2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/dealbook/pitfalls-for-the-unwary-borrower-out-on-the-frontiers-of-banking.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003877197", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/dealbook/pitfalls-for-the-unwary-borrower-out-on-the-frontiers-of-banking.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/dealbook", "hdl_p": "Pitfalls for Unwary on the Frontier of Banking", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/dealbook/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 13, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Moody's Investors Service Inc", "keywords": "Credit and Debt,Lending Club,Computers and the Internet,Moody's Investors Service Inc,Banking and Financial Institutions,Personal Finances,Interest Rates,Credit Cards", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael Corkery", "SCG": "dealbook", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MICHAEL CORKERY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Marketed as a way to get out of debt, loans from online lenders are instead leaving some people deeper underwater.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/business/lenders2/lenders2-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Marketed as a way to get out of debt, loans from online lenders are instead leaving some people deeper underwater.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/michael_corkery/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "DealBook", "modified": "2015-09-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/dealbook/index.jsonp", "tag": "Credit Cards", "published": "2015-09-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14db-lenders", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150914144112, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/dealbook/pitfalls-for-the-unwary-borrower-out-on-the-frontiers-of-banking.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/business/lenders2/lenders2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Marketed as a way to get out of debt, loans from online lenders are instead leaving some people deeper underwater.", "title": "Pitfalls for the Unwary Borrower Out on the Frontiers of Banking"}, "pdate": 20150913, "des": "Credit Cards", "articleid": 100000003877197, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Pitfalls for the Unwary Borrower Out on the Frontiers of Banking", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/business/lenders2/lenders2-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc62c\"", "article_summary": "Smaller banks are buying up marketplace loans as investments, while others are offering co-branded loans with the online lenders.\nMs. Parker\u2019s lawyer, Charles Juntikka, said an increasing number of his bankruptcy clients had marketplace loans.\n\u201cIt can lead to people feeling trapped,\u201d said Peter Barker-Huelster, a lawyer at MFY Legal Services in New York, who has advised clients with marketplace loans.\nLisa Giordano\u2019s payments to Lending Club were even larger, about $740 a month.\nShe could roll up thousands of dollars of debt from her five credit cards into one Lending Club loan and pay a lower interest rate."}
