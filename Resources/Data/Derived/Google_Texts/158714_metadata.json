Insurance companies asked to preview the program advised Health and Human Services that the website would not be ready by the October 1st launch date, identifying problems with the CMS\u2019 retention of enrollment data and the assimilation of all fifty-five contractors involved in the process. The insurance companies recommended the rollout be either delayed or circumscribed to a particular state as a pilot program.\n\nOfficials said the launch date was inflexible, referring to it as \u201cthe tyranny of the October 1 date.\u201d Despite this, as of September 26 the site had not been tested to ensure a customer could complete the entire process from logging on to enrolling.\n\nAn anonymous source familiar with the project reported HHS is now finding further problems not only with accessing the site, but also shopping for and enrolling in plans, adding that \u201cthose issues would have shown up earlier if testing had been done sooner.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the website failures in a Rose Garden speech on Monday, pledging a \u201ctech surge\u201d of web experts to address the structural problems with the sites.\n\n[h/t WaPo]\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a report by the Washington Post, the Affordable Care Act federal exchange websites failed tests up to a week before they went live, but federal", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-22-at-8.52.43-AM.png", "title": "Report: Obamacare Website Launched Despite Testing Failures"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to a report by the Washington Post, the Affordable Care Act federal exchange websites failed tests up to a week before they went live, but federal officials continued with the rollout anyway.", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-22-at-8.52.43-AM.png", "title": "Report: Obamacare Website Launched Despite Testing Failures", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "online", "date": "2013-10-22T09:08:26+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde673\"", "article_summary": "The insurance companies recommended the rollout be either delayed or circumscribed to a particular state as a pilot program.\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, the Affordable Care Act federal exchange website failed tests up to a week before it went live, but officials continued with the rollout anyway.\nJust days before the launch, the website was stress-tested to determine whether it could handle large traffic volume, and crashed when only a few hundred participants tried to log on.\n[h/t WaPo][Image via screengrab]\u2014\u2014>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter\nOfficials said the launch date was inflexible, referring to it as \u201cthe tyranny of the October 1 date.\u201d Despite this, as of September 26 the site had not been tested to ensure a customer could complete the entire process from logging on to enrolling."}
