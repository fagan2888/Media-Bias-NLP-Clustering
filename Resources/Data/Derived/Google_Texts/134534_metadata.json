Based on the past five years of polling on the law, however, that scenario seems very unlikely.\n\nThe invaluable Kaiser Family Foundation has been polling on the Affordable Care Act since it was passed into law -- and provides a great illustration of how the public has viewed the bill over that time.\n\nAnd, this from the June tracking poll conducted by Kaiser:\n\nThere remains a large partisan divide with 65 percent of Democrats saying they have a favorable view and 69 percent of Republicans saying the opposite. Independents fall more in the middle with 37 percent reporting a favorable view and 45 percent reporting an unfavorable view. Views also continue to diverge along party lines for perceptions of the law\u2019s personal impact and what should happen next with the law.\n\nThe reality is that opinion on Obamacare has effectively become just another way of asking for opinions on Obama himself. Compare the Kaiser chart above to this one from HuffPost pollster that tracks Obama's job approval ratings over a similar time period:\n\nWhen Obama dipped -- in 2011 and again in 2014 -- support for the law dropped, too. When he started to trend back upward, same for approval of the law.\n\nWhat does that tell you? That polling on Obamacare has very, very little to do with the actual elements of the law and almost everything to do with the man whose name is attached to it. That fact also explains why external events -- whether it's the first court ruling on the individual mandate in June 2012 or the subsequent presidential election that November -- tend to have very little effect on how people view the ACA.\n\nOpinions about Obama have long since been decided with very little fluctuation in his job approval numbers. Since \"Obamacare=Obama\" for people, it's not surprising that numbers on the law barely fluctuate.\n\nIn short: Don't expect the Obamacare numbers to move much now -- or anytime in the foreseeable future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare = Obama.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obamacare = Obama.", "title": "What does today\u2019s SCOTUS ruling mean for public opinion on Obamacare?
