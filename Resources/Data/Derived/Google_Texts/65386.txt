Cal-Maine Foods Inc. said Thursday that it is teaming up with Rose Acre Farms Inc. to build a shell-egg facility in Texas, in an effort to meet growing demand for cage-free and specialty eggs.

The complex, which could accommodate between 1.8 million and 2.9 million laying hens, is expected to begin initial operations by August.

Cal-Maine CALM, +0.11% and Rose Acre are both egg producers. Closely held Rose Acre has wagered in recent years that the future lies in cage-free, deciding that every facility it builds or refurbishes will not have cages. The new plant will use Rose Acre Farms’s cage-free aviary designs.

Producers across the U.S. egg industry are grappling with new state laws and food-company policies aimed at improving the well-being of the country’s more than 300 million egg-laying hens. Revised rules target the cramped cages that have dominated the industry for decades, enclosures that typically confine birds to 67 square inches each--smaller than a standard sheet of paper.

Cal-Maine Chief Executive Dolph Baker said in a news release the joint venture with Rose Acre allows it to mitigate some of the regulatory risk of the facility.
