Maybe it’s the rumor that just won’t go away: that country music icons Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton were romantically involved back in the day – at least since their 1983 duet “Islands in the Stream” climbed to the top of the charts and became the anthem of a generation.

The rumor persisted for more than three decades, even as they recorded the single “You Can’t Make Old Friends” last year.

But Rogers recently was moved to put the kibosh on the rumor once again.

“Oh, I started that,” Rogers told Jenna Bush Hager of NBC’s Today show. “I always say we just flirted with each other for 30 years.”

An exhibit on the singer-songwriter’s life and career opened at Nashville’s Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on Aug. 15.
