There's no denying Friday's Hillary Clinton rally at the Pierce Arrow Museum in Buffalo was catered to the crowd. “I ate more chicken wings and beef on weck than I can remember,” said democratic presidential frontrunner, Hillary Clinton.

Clinton repeated referenced her eight year tenure as US Senator and what she said she accomplished for Buffalo. “I worked my heart out to save the Niagara Reserve Station,” she said.

Of course, she also had her presidential talking points, which included improving the Affordable Care Act, fighting for equal pay for equal work, and expanding clean renewable energy. She also took shots at the GOP for its stance on climate change and her opponent, Bernie Sanders for his free college tuition plan. She said it shouldn't be free for the wealthy.

Some supporters like Aida Cruz waited in line for hours to hear Clinton in person. “She's an honest woman. She's caring. She's powerful. And she's loves America and I believe she'll do a lot for us and for Buffalo,” Cruz said.

Clinton said she will. In fact, it was one of many campaign promises packed into her Buffalo speech. “If I'm your President, I'll fight for upstate,” Clinton said.

Clinton next stop was at Monroe Community College in the Rochester suburb of Brighton.
