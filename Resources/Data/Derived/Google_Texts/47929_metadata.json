In the valley, where jobs are plentiful and talent scarce, people want to work for the recovering search giant, and investors are similarly optimistic with the company\u2019s stock price nearly doubling since her arrival.\n\nSpeaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, the CEO described Yahoo as a personalization company focused on organizing content and advertisements for users. She credited much of Yahoo\u2019s success on Wall Street to cofounder and former CEO Jerry Yang. \u201cI think there have been certainly very smart investments that I owe to my predecessors,\u201d Mayer said, highlighting the Sunnyvale, Calif. company\u2019s stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Yahoo pocketed $7.6 billion when it sold half its investment in Alibaba last year\u2013\u2013money for her spending spree\u2013\u2013and the remaining stake could reap another $20 billion.\n\nMayer laid out four areas Yahoo is focusing on: hiring the right people, using them to build products consumers love, using those products to bring in traffic, and using that traffic to grow revenue. \u201cThey are a chain reaction, and they work somewhat like a funnel,\u201d she said. Her high\u2013profile acquisitions, including Tumblr, have helped bring in talent, but the company also gets 12,000 resumes each week. With roughly the same number of employees, \u201cfor basically every job we have, we get a resume, each week.\u201d The number of applications coming in have grown \u201cby a factor of five or six\u201d since Mayer joined last July.\n\n\u201cBoomerangs,\u201d a term used to describe former Yahoo employees who have since returned, make up about 10% of hires in the year to date: 14% in the first quarter, 10% in the second quarter, and about 7% to 8% so far into the third quarter. That last number is lower because of the number of new grads joining the ranks, she noted.\n\nSince last summer, traffic has grown about 20% with more than 800 million monthly visitors globally. The focus moving forward is adapting Yahoo\u2019s products for mobile, with more than 350 million people accessing the site from mobile devices. Mayer mentioned the mobile team has grown by \u201calmost a factor of 10\u2033 since she came on board. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity there for mobile when you look at what Yahoo\u2019s strong on\u2013\u2013mail, news, finance, stock quotes, games, sharing photos, group communication, all these different pieces\u2013\u2013that\u2019s what people do on their phones,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Yahoo CEO said the tech company's turnaround depends on making the right hires", "title": "Marissa Mayer didn\u2019t expect to be happy anywhere except Google", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Yahoo CEO said the tech company's turnaround depends on making the right hires", "title": "Marissa Mayer didn\u2019t expect to be happy anywhere except Google", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/12/marissa_mayer_says_turning_yahoo_around_begins_with_hiring_the_right_people_newscred/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/07/marissa-mayer4.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Yahoo CEO said the tech company's turnaround depends on making the right hires", "title": "Marissa Mayer didn\u2019t expect to be happy anywhere except Google", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/07/marissa-mayer4.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alice Truong", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, employees, Jobs, Marissa Mayer, TechCrunch Disrupt, Yahoo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd28e\"", "article_summary": "The focus moving forward is adapting Yahoo\u2019s products for mobile, with more than 350 million people accessing the site from mobile devices.\nTopics: employees, Jobs, Marissa Mayer, TechCrunch Disrupt, Yahoo, Technology News, Business NewsSteering Yahoo on the right course hasn\u2019t been easy, but with Marissa Mayer at the helm, there\u2019s excitement around the company again.\nMayer mentioned the mobile team has grown by \u201calmost a factor of 10\u2033 since she came on board.\nSpeaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, the CEO described Yahoo as a personalization company focused on organizing content and advertisements for users.\nSince last summer, traffic has grown about 20% with more than 800 million monthly visitors globally."}
