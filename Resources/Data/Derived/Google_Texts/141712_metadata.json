Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., is a proud supporter of the National Security Agency. And she doesn\u2019t think much of exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nShe thinks so little of him, she\u2019s apparently not aware of his name.\n\nMikulski assigned the former spy a new identity during an open-to-the-public Senate intelligence committee hearing Thursday focused on surveillance reform legislation.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve seen the revelations of Eric Schnowden, and we\u2019re not here to debate whether he was a traitor or a whistleblower, but I will say this, I am deeply disturbed,\u201d the five-term senator told colleagues. \u201cI do not want to see the continual demonization of the National Security Agency, whether it\u2019s in the media or in other forums.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a one-time mistake.\n\n\u201cNow, Eric Schnowden has his time, he gets an hour on TV, he gets a hoorah from Brian Williams, but I think we ought to say to the national security staff that while we look at the constitutionality and other issues here that we do not demonize them,\u201d she added.\n\nThe NSA is headquartered in Fort Meade, Md.\n\n\u201cI represent the National Security Agency,\u201d Mikulski reminded colleagues. \u201cOver 15,000 people get up every day and wonder how to protect America.\u201d\n\nMikulski and colleagues were discussing the USA Freedom Act, which would end the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of phone metadata and institute other reforms. The bill passed the House May 22, but lost the support of many pro-civil liberties members after it was weakened at the behest of the Obama administration and surveillance hawks.\n\nSeveral members of the Senate intelligence committee, including Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Dan Coats, R-Ind., said surveillance programs should not be altered to assuage public outrage.\n\nThursday marked the anniversary of Snowden's first disclosure: that the NSA collected the phone records of all Americans without public knowledge for years.\n\nMikulski's support for the NSA is long-standing.\n\nIn February Mikulski scolded eight Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates who introduced legislation to deny the NSA \u201cmaterial support, participation or assistance in any form\u201d from the state, its political subdivisions and companies with state contracts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked that the Republicans would go ahead and do that to the National Security Agency,\u201d she told U.S. News in reaction to the bill, which later died in committee. \u201cWhen I think back to Ronald Reagan and how strong he was on defense and the way he led the end of the Cold War, I am shocked that the Republicans would want to negatively impact the National Security Agency.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Senator Upset That 'Eric Schnowden' Leaks Inspired Anti-NSA Outrage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Maryland senator asks public to share her appreciation for NSA workers.", "title": "Senator Upset That 'Eric Schnowden' Leaks Inspired Anti-NSA Outrage", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/06/05/senator-upset-that-eric-schnowden-leaks-inspired-anti-nsa-outrage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3e/b6/35f9e3644b90bd1ffff8ad15e10d/140605-mikulski-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Maryland senator asks public to share her appreciation for NSA workers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senator Upset That 'Eric Schnowden' Leaks Inspired Anti-NSA Outrage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Steven Nelson,Pulse,picks,NSA,Snowden, Edward,Mikulski, Barbara,Collections: US,Collections: Political,Washington Whispers [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Maryland senator asks public to share her appreciation for NSA workers."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI represent the National Security Agency,\u201d Mikulski reminded colleagues.\n\u201cI do not want to see the continual demonization of the National Security Agency, whether it\u2019s in the media or in other forums.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a one-time mistake.\nSen.
