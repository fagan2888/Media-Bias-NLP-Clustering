Note: Check the date on the post\u2026\n\n\n\nThis morning on FOX News, Governor Rick Perry announced his intention to enroll in Medicaid once his term as governor ends. Citing recent financial difficulties, Perry sees Medicaid as his best option once he no longer has a salary, savings or health care.\n\n\u201cIf I become President I think I'll be okay financially,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut if that doesn't work out, I don't really have a back-up plan. And to be honest I've been mowing through my governor's salary and my savings at a pretty fast clip \u2013 I mean, my new glasses weren't cheap.\u201d\n\nPerry has identified Medicaid as the best and often the only health care option for low-income Texans, and plans to be a low-income Texan himself soon. In addition, Perry has had numerous issues with his back and expects his medical bills to be out of control once he no longer has government health insurance.\n\nFind out how Ted Cruz feels about the announcement below the jump.The announcement has come as a surprise to many, since Perry has long fought against a Medicaid expansion in Texas. Under the Affordable Care Act, Texas could have received $9 billion in federal funds to insure over 1 million low-income people. But Perry repeatedly rejected this option, despite Texas having the highest uninsured rate in the country.\n\n\u201cSure, I fought against a Medicaid expansion as governor,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut that was when I thought I would never need it. Now that I'm going to be low-income myself and have actually seen what health insurance costs, I kind of get it.\u201d\n\nHowever, when asked if he would reconsider expanding Medicaid before his term ends, Perry replied, \u201cAbsolutely not. Obamacare is the worst.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to comment, Senator Ted Cruz was very supportive. \u201cGenerally I believe that anyone who enrolls in Medicaid is just mooching off the system and needs to get a real job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Rick Perry has obviously worked really hard all his life, so it's okay for him.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is an April Fools' Day post. Unfortunately, it is not true. But imagine if it were!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ed. Note: Check the date on the post...
