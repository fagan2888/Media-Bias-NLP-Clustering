I really wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do \u2013 I was an artistic person but not necessarily focused on being an actress. And they were the people that instilled \u2018Go do your auditions and see how you go\u2019 in me.\n\n\u201cI have great respect for the school and great respect for the teachers and that\u2019s great that it\u2019s doing so well. I\u2019m very proud of that.\u201d\n\nMarais, who has a daughter, Scout, who turns two in May, with her actor fianc\u00e9 James Stewart, said she loved nothing more than showing her young family around her hometown last month.\n\nAnd while the former Packed To The Rafters lovebirds are sharing the limelight in Brisbane in Louis Nowra\u2019s iconic play Cosi, she has not ruled out a hometown return to the stage.\n\n\u201cLast time we were (in WA) for about two months, over Christmas and January,\u201d Marais said.\n\n\u201cAnd we got to spend some really good quality time with grandparents and also enjoy just being in my home town. I loved showing Jimmy around Perth and saying, \u2018This is where I did this and this is where I did that\u2019. It\u2019s exciting to show him where I come from.\n\n\u201cEvery day Perth is growing as a town and the CBD is becoming more and more interesting. But outside of that also, we have an incredible landscape \u2013 we love driving down south to Cowaramup to visit beautiful friends of ours who live there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to live in Perth. We love Perth and we love Brisbane because they\u2019re our hometowns. Sydney seems to be where it\u2019s all happening a lot of the time. But Perth and Brisbane both have a very vibrant arts scene and we ultimately see ourselves as (having) no state or nationality, which is what gypsy actor folk have to do.\n\n\u201cThe Heath Ledger Theatre is an incredible facility. Black Swan (Theatre Company) are fantastic as well as Perth Theatre Company. Melissa Cantwell is an incredible artistic director as is Kate Cherry. Both of them are people that I greatly admire and would love to work with in the future.\u201d\n\nMarais, who hopes to be a mother again, said she felt blessed that her partner had chosen to care for their daughter, turning down many projects \u2013 \u201cnone of which he has found have equalled having time with our child\u201d \u2013 in the past year.\n\n\u201cPut it this way \u2013 we didn\u2019t plan Scout so the next one will come when it comes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut we would like her to have a brother or a sister.\u201d\n\nLove Child premieres on Channel Nine, tomorrow at 8:40pm.\n\nTwitter: @PhillipsYasmine", "article_metadata": {"description": "PERTH golden girl Jessica Marais has issued an apology to her former maths and science teachers at St Hilda&#8217;s Anglican School for Girls.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "PerthNow", "description": "PERTH golden girl Jessica Marais has issued an apology to her former maths and science teachers at St Hilda&#8217;s Anglican School for Girls.", "title": "Love Child star Jess Marais says sorry to her teachers", "url": "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/love-child-star-jess-marais-says-sorry-to-her-teachers/story-fnhocxo3-1226828203392", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/203356-7fb25124-9489-11e3-831f-628faee552fc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/203892-4d44b2e4-9543-11e3-831f-628faee552fc.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@perthnow", "id": "@perthnow"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135447496484311}, "articleid": 1226828203392, "keywords": "science teachers, home town, golden girl, school teacher spellings, incredible artistic director, vibrant arts scene, gypsy actor folk, artistic person, incredible landscape, Trudy Dunn, Louis Nowra, Melissa Cantwell, Photography David Kelly, quality time, beautiful friends, young family, star loves home, ,Perth,Western Australia,Australia, ,West End,Queensland,Australia, Heath Ledger Theatre, Brisbane, Queensland News, James Stewart, David Kelly, Donna Hughes", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Feb 15 20:52:28 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Feb 15 20:52:28 EST 2014", "author": "YASMINE PHILLIPS"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd08a\"", "article_summary": "We love Perth and we love Brisbane because they\u2019re our hometowns.\n\u201cDonna Hughes, Trudy Dunn and Robyn Tourney were my drama school teachers and I believe that they\u2019re the reason that I\u2019m an actress now.\nPERTH golden girl Jessica Marais has issued an apology to her former maths and science teachers at St Hilda\u2019s Anglican School for Girls.\nI really wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do \u2013 I was an artistic person but not necessarily focused on being an actress.\nBlack Swan (Theatre Company) are fantastic as well as Perth Theatre Company."}
