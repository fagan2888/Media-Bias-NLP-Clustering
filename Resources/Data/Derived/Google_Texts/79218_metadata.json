Charlie Baker demanded and received resignations from four members of the Massachusetts Health Connector board.\n\nAccording to reports, the resignees were John Bertko, Rick Jakious, George Gonser, and Jonathan Gruber, all of whom served under former Gov. Deval Patrick. Gruber, a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is perhaps most notable in this group for advising the Obama administration in the creation of the Affordable Care Act. Prior to that, he advised then-Gov. Mitt Romney in developing health care reform in Massachusetts. The New York Times even nicknamed him \u2018Mr. Mandate.\u2019 Gruber was the only member out of the four who was appointed by Gov. Romney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, Gruber has been covered in mainstream national media for public speeches where he seemed to be boasting that \u201clack of transparency [about the law] is a huge political advantage\u2019\u2019 about deceiving the public with regard to the Affordable Care Act. He was called in for questioning by a Congressional panel, during which he apologized for his \u201cglib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting\u2019\u2019 comments.\n\nBaker\u2019s move, and his future appointments, establish him in majority control of the state health insurance exchange board as the end of the state\u2019s open enrollment season approaches this week.\n\n\u201cAll that was communicated to me is that the governor would like to have his own set of people on the Connector,\u2019\u2019 Gruber told The Boston Globe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
