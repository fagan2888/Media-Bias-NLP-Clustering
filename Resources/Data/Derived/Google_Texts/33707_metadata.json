In collaboration with the medical staff, the board needs to have a reasonable understanding of the overall quality of healthcare services provided to patients, as well as an understanding of how things are handled when mistakes are made.\n\nThe board and hospital leaders are charged with implementing a patient safety program that has rigorous quality monitoring and improvement activities. In addition to routine quality, patient safety and risk management reports from senior leaders, the board should receive regular reports on liability claim trends and results.\n\nUnderstanding this data can:\n\nPersonalize the nature and cost of adverse events;\n\nDetermine whether medical malpractice claims are resolved in a way that\u2019s consistent with the reputation, vision and goals of the organization;\n\nEnhance understanding of how claim payments impact the bottom line\n\nSupport ongoing patient safety efforts.\n\nAsking three questions can help unlock the right approach to evaluating your hospital\u2019s claims management program, and help identify strengths and improvement opportunities.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll begin a 3-part series by tackling the first question:\n\nQUESTION #1: Why should I evaluate my organization\u2019s liability claims management program?\n\nANSWER: It\u2019s your duty and it impacts your hospital\u2019s mission.\n\nFirst, the board fulfills key governance responsibilities when liability claims are assessed, and this information also helps the management team analyze insurance costs, risk controls, adverse event trends, and deployment of resources for ongoing patient safety and clinical risk management activities.\n\nThe reputation of the hospital is also at risk in certain high-profile claims, so that knowing claims outcomes and processes ensures consistency in the way the hospital presents itself to the public and eliminates surprises when reporters call after a verdict or settlement.\n\nSecond, the assessment helps to validate the organization\u2019s financial viability to meet expected claims costs, particularly for hospitals or systems that self-insure or have large deductibles exposed on each claim.\n\nThird, appropriate claims policies and procedures to manage financial obligations are confirmed. Identifying contributing factors that resulted in liability claims being made \u2013 and implementing appropriate corrective actions \u2013 can reduce the potential for such future claims.\n\nFinally, the claims function directly connects with ongoing safety and improvement efforts to eliminate errors in clinical processes or with providers that result in injuries. Thus, claims management information is wholly intertwined with any hospital\u2019s core mission of providing safe, high-quality patient care, and increasing patient satisfaction.\n\nThis post appeared first at Action for Better Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/evaluating-your-hospitals-liability-claims-management-program", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Asking three questions can help unlock the right approach to evaluating your hospital's claims management program, and help identify strengths and improvement opportunities.", "title": "Evaluating your hospital's liability claims management program"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "Asking three questions can help unlock the right approach to evaluating your hospital's claims management program, and help identify strengths and improvement opportunities.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Evaluating your hospital's liability claims management program"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hospital board members have a fiduciary duty to the organization and community they serve.
