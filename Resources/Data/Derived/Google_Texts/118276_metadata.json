Discussion topics ranged from the instructional, namely how to avoid insulting women when you\u2019re trying to sell them stuff, to the philosophical, which asked tough questions to the tune of, essentially, \u201cCould it be women\u2019s fault they\u2019re not being promoted?\u201d Panels with titles like \u201cWomen Aren\u2019t Creative?\u201d readily recognized that women make 80 percent of household purchasing decisions. What the smiling executives at center stage were a little slower to acknowledge is that women are only 3 percent of the creative directors making decisions about how to best sell things to these millions of shopping ladies. The word \u201cfemvertising\u201d was thrown around a lot, but never the word \u201cfeminism.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s because in an industry famous for being sexist, feminism is scary even if it sells.\n\nOn Friday, during the \u201cWomen Aren\u2019t Creative?\u201d discussion, an advertisement from Under Armour\u2019s \u201cI Will What I Want\u201d campaign played on a movie screen for hundreds of ad industry veterans and hopefuls, most of us women. In the ad, ballerina Misty Copeland dances a stunning solo as a child\u2019s voice narrates a rejection letter telling Copeland that she\u2019s not cut out to be a ballerina.\n\nAt the end of the ad, the crowd cheered: for femvertising, for Copeland, and for an ad that gets it right when it comes to women, never mind that the creative team who made the Misty Copeland ad at Droga5 was comprised of 56 human beings, only 11 of them women, and was, in essence, a lot of men telling women what they think women probably want to hear. And never mind the fact that the campaign features three women: Copeland, a ballerina, Gisele Bundchen, a supermodel and Lindsey Vonn, a skier and swimsuit model. Accomplished women, absolutely, but also very attractive ones who have succeeded in ways that most men probably don\u2019t find particularly threatening.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay that \u201cI Will What I Want\u201d features virtually flawless women succeeding in entertainment. This is an advertisement for overpriced running shorts, after all. We all understand that advertisements are glossy lies, right?\n\nWell, no.\n\nThe real problem with ads like \u201cI Will What I Want\u201d is that the industry has been able to sell these idealized snapshots as legitimate feminist commentary to the media at large. Another problem is that the ad industry, which has one of the worst track records around in terms of equality, seems to be falling for its own spin.\n\nAt a later session called \u201cWomen Aren\u2019t Creative?\u201d Charlotte Beers, former CEO of Oglivy and Mather, explained that one of the biggest challenges women face in the workplace is their \u201cwomanly\u201d nature, which she described as a female tendency to be cooperative with co-workers and collaborative on teams. To put it simply, the women around her just aren\u2019t willing what they want hard enough.\n\nAs an alternative, she suggested that women be more \u201cleaderly,\u201d a trait she sees in the men around her office. Leaderly men are assertive and persuasive, willing to insist that they\u2019re right in the face of opposition.\n\nA few hours after that session, I was treated to a firsthand view of that leaderly attitude. After a closely packed panel on how to win Instagram followers, limited space and an excess of bodies created a bottleneck near the exit. I was waiting in line between a middle-aged man in a business suit and a techy-type guy in khakis and flannel. Since we weren\u2019t moving, I glanced down at my phone. I was pressing the home key to put it away when an older man on my left, trapped in a row of chairs by the standstill yelled at me to \u201cStop texting and move.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At New York's recent Advertising Week, a slew of panels for women were proof of the industry's biggest blind spot VIDEO", "title": "Spare me your \u201cfemvertising\u201d: The advertising industry\u2019s weird, persistent woman problem", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "At New York's recent Advertising Week, a slew of panels for women were proof of the industry's biggest blind spot VIDEO", "title": "Spare me your \u201cfemvertising\u201d: The advertising industry\u2019s weird, persistent woman problem", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/spare_me_your_femvertising_the_advertising_industrys_weird_persistent_woman_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/under_armour_ad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At New York's recent Advertising Week, a slew of panels for women were proof of the industry's biggest blind spot VIDEO", "title": "Spare me your \u201cfemvertising\u201d: The advertising industry\u2019s weird, persistent woman problem", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/under_armour_ad.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Emily Alford", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Advertising, new york advertisting week, under armour, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad13\"", "article_summary": "Leaderly men are assertive and persuasive, willing to insist that they\u2019re right in the face of opposition.\nAnother problem is that the ad industry, which has one of the worst track records around in terms of equality, seems to be falling for its own spin.\nAnd never mind the fact that the campaign features three women: Copeland, a ballerina, Gisele Bundchen, a supermodel and Lindsey Vonn, a skier and swimsuit model.\nAs an alternative, she suggested that women be more \u201cleaderly,\u201d a trait she sees in the men around her office.\nOn Friday, during the \u201cWomen Aren\u2019t Creative?\u201d discussion, an advertisement from Under Armour\u2019s \u201cI Will What I Want\u201d campaign played on a movie screen for hundreds of ad industry veterans and hopefuls, most of us women."}
