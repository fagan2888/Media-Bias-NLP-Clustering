Under the moratorium, the center could operate with 16 patients and be fine \u2014 but their plan called for room for potential future growth.\n\nThe center currently is licensed for 16 beds, but its board maintains a self-imposed internal cap of 10 beds, since the center\u2019s approach to youth rehabilitation is quality over quantity at its current facility on Julie Lane.\n\nThe moratorium sort of came out of nowhere for the center\u2019s leaders, since they deal primarily with the Department of Health and not the Department of Family Services, said Powell Economic Partnership Executive Director Christine Bekes. A new application will be submitted soon.\n\nThe moratorium originated with a 2012 budget footnote to the Wyoming Department of Family Services budget. At the time, legislators implemented a moratorium on new beds as they undertook a study of costs. In 2014, the footnote was amended to establish a statewide cap on treatment center beds.\n\nThe moratorium changed in 2014 to be a combination of group home beds and residential treatment beds. If a facility closes, those licenses stay in the mix \u2014 which is why Northwest Treatment Center is aiming to build for 20 beds and not just 16.\n\n\u201cI think the moratorium was put on and requested by residential treatment centers to keep the Walmart of residential treatment centers from coming in,\u201d Bekes told the Powell City Council on Sept. 8. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a 100-bed facility opening.\u201d\n\nThe center already is licensed to treat 16 patients at a time, but it can\u2019t do that in the facilities they currently use, Bekes said.\n\n\u201cThey want to expand, and they need assistance to make it happen,\u201d Bekes said.\n\nThe strange thing about the moratorium blocking the center\u2019s expansion is that the legislative study within its footnote actually backs up the center\u2019s application and supports what Northwest Treatment Center is trying to do, Bekes said.\n\n\u201cYou would think more beds available would be better,\u201d Powell City Councilman Josh Shorb said.\n\nGroup homes are a different level of care; they are like a home, and the patients go to school during the day. Northwest Treatment Center does residential treatment for juvenile males with addiction issues, which is more involved and complex with on-site schooling and an all-encompassing drug rehabilitation program.\n\nThe center\u2019s leaders planned on expanding for a long time and had saved up $600,000 by setting aside a building fund under the direction of their board of directors, said the center\u2019s director, Ty Barrus. When they found out about the grant, they applied using those funds as their match, with the city of Powell sponsoring their application through the Business Ready Communities Grant and Loan Program from the Wyoming Business Council.\n\n\u201cWe were saving money for a bigger facility to buy and build, then this came about and we thought it was an opportunity to benefit us and the community,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cWe were probably another year or so out from getting the facility we would like, but now we are months away from it.\u201d\n\nThe center needs to be able to show and identify the treatment-needs gap, and that Wyoming has youth in need of treatment, said the center\u2019s clinical director, Greg Bennett. They also need to find out how many patients are being sent to Montana for issues aside from drug addiction, when the case is really that the patient has more than one disorder.\n\n\u201cWe want to treat Wyoming kids,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nThe center also needs to educate people about their program so that they can be known as an option, he said.\n\nThere is no timeline for the revised application process, but another site visit from the Wyoming Business Council is anticipated for the center and the council to learn more about the moratorium, Bekes said. If all goes well, a special meeting will then take place with the business council and the State Loan and Investment Board.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we get the grant application approved and funded, the sooner we can move forward,\u201d Bekes said.\n\nThere are no changes to the floor plan and design of the new facility, since it means the difference between two bedrooms. There is the possibility that the moratorium will be lifted or changed by the time Northwest Treatment Center is ready to take full use of its license and facilities.\n\n\u201cThe cost difference in terms of not building for 20 beds and building for 16 is minimal,\u201d Bekes said.\n\nThe highest number of patients the center has ever had at a single time was 11, and the typical amount is about six or seven patients, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cGoing up to capacity would create more jobs,\u201d Bennett said.\n\n\u201cThe work we do with 16 (patients) might as well be 120, because it is so individualized and takes more work \u2014 we are willing to do it, but need low numbers to be successful,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cI think having a facility that has school rooms, therapy rooms and security and everything for safety measures \u2014 it is vital to move in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd with a home-like atmosphere,\u201d Bennett added.\n\n\u201cThe kids leave saying we cared about them,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cWe know them and their families and the intimacies of their lives.\u201d\n\nDespite having operated in Powell for six years, many locals do not know the center exists or what they do. The following is an introduction to the neighbors local may not have met yet:\n\nQ: Why does Powell support the center?\n\nA: The city of Powell supports the center\u2019s endeavors primarily due to the help it can provide local families who have a child with addiction problems, said Mayor Don Hillman. Providing rehabilitation treatment in Powell means families do not have to travel far to get the help they need.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the big reasons I see,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cIt is nice to have the center here for local people, and when they have family in that situation, you don\u2019t have to travel hundreds of miles.\n\n\u201cIt is nice for the city to support anything that is going to provide that service locally. Why wouldn\u2019t we want that facility here?\u201d\n\nQ: Who owns the center and who governs it?\n\nA: Northwest Treatment Center is a 501c3 nonprofit organization with a board of directors. The board is comprised of Powell residents, president Joe Bridges, Trace Paul, Sarah Mainwaring, Jason Wardell and Shelly Schultz. Barrus and Bennett are also present for board activities, but are not voting members.\n\nDirectly below the board are Barrus, Bennett and the center\u2019s CFO Chad Lindsay.\n\nBarrus grew up in Meeteetse and his wife is from Powell. He\u2019s a licensed clinical social worker and has been working with local treatment centers since 2000.\n\nBennett moved to Powell from Louisiana when he was just 2 years old and was involved in several Powell athletics while growing up. He said he might still hold the track record for pole vault, but wasn\u2019t sure. He left from 2001-07 and moved back with his wife, a fellow Powell native. Now he coaches several youth teams, and is the northwest regional vice president of the Association for Addiction Professionals.\n\n\u201cI love working with kids, it keeps me young,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nLindsay was born in Powell and lived in Lovell his entire life, except for while attending University of Wyoming. He went on to earn his master\u2019s from the University of Phoenix. He previously worked in drug and alcohol prevention in Big Horn County and has been with the center for five years.\n\nFrom there, the center has a team of case managers, treatment planners, certified addiction practitioners and more to help perform an all-encompassing rehabilitation program. Overcoming drug addiction means an entire lifestyle change and giving the kids the tools needed to succeed \u2014 everything from life skills like cooking and changing oil to coping with problems in a healthy way instead of with drugs.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy is, if you can\u2019t make your bed and cook breakfast, how will you do anything else correctly,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cDrug use comes with numbing of emotions because of childhood trauma, and those things are used to cope with it. We teach about their emotions and how to cope with them and how they co-mingle.\u201d\n\nOutside their walls, the center works along with the criminal justice center, judges, probation officers and child protection services, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cDrug addiction isn\u2019t just an addiction for one \u2014 it is a family illness and affects everyone,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nQ: Why are these services needed?\n\nA: According to the Association for Addiction Professionals, drug addiction costs $385 billion every year because it impacts everything from school and work attendance, criminal behavior, vandalism, theft and legal fees, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge need for the public to get educated on drug addiction; it is a stigmatized and misdiagnosed problem,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, there were 23.2 million Americans over 12 years old who needed treatment for illicit drug or alcohol problems in 2007. Of those Americans, only 2.4 million, 10.4 percent, received treatment at a specialized facility.\n\n\u201cThe need for beds is huge,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIf everyone was identified and screened, there would be a bigger need for beds.\u201d\n\nIf those same numbers are applied to Powell, 10 percent of the population, or 500 people, would be in need of treatment, and the center only has a license for 16 beds.\n\n\u201cThe kids who need services in Park County, before us, went to Casper, Rock Springs, or Cheyenne, and they came back and nothing changed,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nNorthwest Treatment Center is trying to create a facility to comfortably house 16 patients at a time, since smaller is better and there always will be a need for adolescent treatment, Barrus said.\n\nAs far as what needs to be treated, that part changes over time.\n\n\u201cAnother interesting statistic from July is among high school seniors \u2014 driving under the influence of marijuana has surpassed alcohol,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nMany of the center\u2019s patients became addicts when they started using drugs or alcohol to deal with the traumatic realities they faced in life. For instance, one patient\u2019s mother died, then he was sent to his grandmother and she died as well, so he was left with no family at all.\n\n\u201cThey come to us with trauma, and their drug and alcohol use is something they do to cope with trauma,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cThey want to change. We are trying to change those thought processes and get them motivated to deal with the world sober.\u201d\n\nPlacement into treatment facilities has a 60-90-day wait time for adults, and for adolescents the issue of quality of care arises, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cBig centers aren\u2019t effective,\u201d Bennett said, noting that kids who act out violently get more attention than well behaved kids even though both need help overcoming their addictions. \u201cOur modality is to provide individualized care according to their needs.\u201d\n\nQ: What kind of treatment does the center do?\n\nA: Treating addiction means more than just addressing the substance itself; it\u2019s everything surrounding it, and that means taking a \u201cbiopsychosocial modality\u201d approach. Patients participate in individual sessions and processing groups to address how they are feeling mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually and socially. They also participate in topic groups, morning meditation, recreational activities and equine-assisted therapy, family work and groups to address emotions.\n\n\u201cIt is ever-evolving,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nAll of this is done within as close to a home-like setting as possible with bedrooms, bathrooms, desks and preferences on food for each patient.\n\n\u201cEach kid has their own history, so the treatment is focused on them,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cTreatment is built and structured around the individual and what they need.\u201d\n\nQ: Who are the patients and where do they come from?\n\nA: Some of the center\u2019s patients are court ordered through drug court treatment, some through regular adolescent courts and some are sent there at their parents\u2019 request. All of them come from Wyoming and are between the ages of 12 and 17 years old.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to help local kids,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cBig Horn Basin is a priority for us.\u201d\n\nAbout 60 percent of the patients are from the Basin and the other 40 percent are from other parts of Wyoming, Bekes said.\n\nTreating kids close to home means family work is easier to do.\n\nThe center has a special therapist designated for family work at a distance, whether it is by phone or Skype, Barrus said.\n\n\u201cIt is an essential component to success,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cSome of their home lives are part of the problem ... Sometimes we find that mom and dad supply the drugs or are hosting the parties.\u201d\n\nClients from outside the community benefit from losing their connections to drug dealers or other negative influences, Lindsay said.\n\nIn addition to drug addiction, some of the patients are also dealing with learning disabilities, Barrus said.\n\nQ: Do the patients continue with their schooling in-house, and if so, who is their teacher?\n\nA: Because of their struggles with addiction, the center\u2019s patients can be as much as a couple of grades behind on their schoolwork, so the center brings a teacher onsite to help catch the kids up as much as possible.\n\n\u201cA huge risk factor is falling behind in school ... so credit recovery is our main goal,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nThe students remain enrolled in their original school district while at the center.\n\n\u201cSince they are addicts, we don\u2019t want them having access to students outside because, potentially, they could obtain some type of substance,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nSome have been able to make up an entire year\u2019s worth of school work while treating their addictions at the center, Bennett said.\n\nFormer Powell High School employee Christy Muecke teaches at the treatment center with lessons during the day and evening time. But, the current facility lacks a dedicated classroom setting that\u2019s conducive to the learning experience, so most lessons are done at the dining room table. Part of their proposed facility includes a classroom to address that issue.\n\n\u201cThey come in a year or more behind for a reason, school isn\u2019t a priority,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cThe kids we get are smart, it is just a matter of motivation. Drug culture just deflates motivation in school.\u201d\n\nOnce treatment kicks in and the drugs leave their system, the fog starts to lift and they are able to retain what they\u2019ve learned and pass academic tests, Barrus said.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to watch them get excited about school,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the patients are almost 18 years old and only have a sophomore-equivalent amount of school work done, so graduating on time is impossible. Some of the patients earn their GED and others go on to earn their diploma after their treatment at the center. Others move on to employment through the Wyoming Job Corps.\n\nQ: What happens once the patients turn 18 years old?\n\nA: Just because a patient turns 18 years old does not mean that he or she is turned loose to battle their addiction recovery on top of the challenges that come with adulthood. The center establishes a transitional discharge plan for employment, home life and medical problems, Bennett said.\n\nPatients normally have a roommate, but they get their own room once they turn 18, Barrus said.\n\nQ: Do the patients get involved in the community?\n\nA: Going out into the community allows the center\u2019s patients to use the tools they\u2019re learning in treatment. The patients can often be found at the gym, the aquatic center or exploring the parks.\n\n\u201cCommunity integration is not only one of our top priorities; it is also an opportunity for them to practice the things they learn in treatment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey can\u2019t practice in a controlled environment.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the recreational outings is because some of the patients don\u2019t know of any alternatives to drug and alcohol use, Barrus said.\n\n\u201cSome haven\u2019t gone on hikes or fishing,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cWe do these things to show there are options out there to do when bored, and to teach a hobby is a huge thing.\u201d\n\nThe center tries to take patients out each week and to Yellowstone as well.\n\n\u201cThere are kids who were from Wyoming who never went to Yellowstone,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cWe take them to waterfalls, and they didn\u2019t even know there are waterfalls here \u2014 they are like \u2018Oh my gosh, there is more to life than sitting at home and smoking pot.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of the outings are staffed and supervised with about three staff members for seven kids.\n\nQ: Are there enough beds in Wyoming for juveniles with addiction problems?\n\nA: It\u2019s not a simple yes or no answer when it comes to determining whether there are enough beds in Wyoming\u2019s treatment facilities to care for all of the patients. Part of this is due to changes in how society handles drug addiction.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a need,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cWe had kids in our beds since we started \u2014 if that means the need is being met, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNorthwest Treatment Center is categorized along with residential treatment centers, and that brings into question how many of those centers serve addictions, Bekes said. And how many have qualified personell to treat addictions, added Bennett.\n\n\u201cNWTC is unique, because the primary issue is addiction \u2014 they usually have co-occurring disorders,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nThe Wyoming Boys School doesn\u2019t do treatment, and the 12-step model used at Narcotics Addicts Anonymous groups doesn\u2019t help if the kids learn best with hands-on approaches, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cThere is not another NWTC,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nInstead of sending drug addicts to jail, as was the practice in the past, more courts are sending addicts to treatment facilities. The Department of Health defines drug addiction as a brain disorder that is treatable and manageable, similar to other diseases such as diabetes, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cAbout 10 years ago, 93 percent of the people incarcerated were due to drug charges, and they didn\u2019t have any treatment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cNow that number has dropped, and they are getting options for treatment.\u201d\n\nMore people need treatment now and one of the stipulations of the Affordable Care Act is for insurance to cover treatment, he said. But, loopholes are often found, and the state and federal governments usually end up footing the bill.\n\n\u201cIt is recognized as a brain disorder and not a moral weakness issue,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt is not as stigmatized as it was before.\u201d\n\nQ: How is the center funded?\n\nA: The U.S. government has a substance abuse block grant with funding set aside for each state, based on population size, and the state matches those funds, Bennett said. He estimated that 90 percent of Wyoming\u2019s treatment facilities get 90 percent of their funding from state and federal dollars.\n\nInsurance companies have loopholes to avoid paying for drug addiction treatment, Bennett said. When that happens, Medicaid steps in to foot the bill. Medicaid also pays when treatment is court ordered, Bennett said.\n\nThe majority of substance users are low income, so most go to Blue Cross Blue Shield or a subsidiary of Medicaid, he said.\n\n\u201cOne reason for opening a center was because kids were getting thrown into Montana and Provo Canyon, Utah,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe want to keep those state funds here.\u201d\n\nQ: Who decides when treatment is needed and when it is done?\n\nA: A decision to send a juvenile to a treatment facility can be made by parents, or it can be court ordered. It also can be suggested by mental health practitioners who find that an illness such as depression is tied in with a substance abuse issue.\n\nOnce placed at the center, the staff develops a treatment plan with the adolescent and his parents. Long-term goals are made and meetings are held regularly to discuss their progress.\n\nDischarge from the center is based on the progress they make, and every drug and child is different.\n\nThe average stay at the center is six months. Once previously high-risk criteria has transitioned into medium or low risk, then steps are made to get the patients back into the community.\n\n\u201cWe sign off when they have the best shot of succeeding,\u201d Barrus said.\n\nQ: What kind of jobs would the expansion create?\n\nA: The revised plan lowered the number of new jobs created by expanding from ten to nine, which still is an economic boon for the community, since most of those jobs are specialized and require workers with degrees, certification and special training.\n\n\u201cTraining and education specific to addiction disorders is a paramount thing,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nFinding highly trained and experienced staff who are dedicated to helping young people overcome their addictions and also \u201cbuy into Wyoming\u201d is another goal, Barrus said.\n\nSubstance abuse treatment is a career field with a lot of emotional value that tends to attract relatives of former addicts, Bennett said. Of course, there are degrees and certificates that need earned on top of the desire to help others.\n\nSo far, the center has helped multiple employees further their education so they can provide better services to their patients. Three of their employees went from no higher education to one nearly completing a master\u2019s degree, another is nearly done with a bachelor\u2019s degree and one finished a bachelor\u2019s degree, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cI love people that love Wyoming, so when they go through their first winter they don\u2019t leave,\u201d Barrus said. \u201cI like people that buy into Wyoming, because these are Wyoming kids.\u201d\n\nRetaining or bringing back Wyoming residents by creating jobs within the state also helps the grant application, Bekes said.\n\n\u201cThese are professional jobs to attract people here,\u201d Bekes said.\n\nSome of the staff moved to Powell from outside the state, one from South Dakota and another from New Mexico, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cPeople know the treatment we do and are excited about it,\u201d Bennett said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Your news source for what's happening in Park County.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Matt Naber", "og": {"url": "http://www.powelltribune.com/news/item/14038-treatment-center-plans-to-reapply-for-state-grant-program", "type": "article", "description": "Your news source for what's happening in Park County.", "title": "Treatment center plans to reapply for state grant program"}, "title": "Treatment center plans to reapply for state grant program", "keywords": "Powell, Powell WY, Park County, Powell News", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Northwest Treatment Center\u2019s original application was withdrawn from the Wyoming Business Council at the end of August because of a state moratorium on residential treatment center beds.\nIn 2014, the footnote was amended to establish a statewide cap on treatment center beds.\nNorthwest Treatment Center does residential treatment for juvenile males with addiction issues, which is more involved and complex with on-site schooling and an all-encompassing drug rehabilitation program.\nA: Northwest Treatment Center is a 501c3 nonprofit organization with a board of directors.\nInsurance companies have loopholes to avoid paying for drug addiction treatment, Bennett said."}
