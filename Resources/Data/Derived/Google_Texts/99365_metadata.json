He now lives in the United States.\n\nOne day during the small talk after a meal around the dinner table, he said to me, \u201cI lived under communism. I know how they think. I know their methods, their lies, their deceptions to achieve power and control others. I can smell a communist. Barack Obama is a communist.\u201d\n\nThat comment has always stuck with me. It scared me at the time, and it frightens me now. If someone who has first hand knowledge of living under a totalitarian system says our Dear Leader is a socialist on steroids, seriously, what has America gotten herself into?\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nI believe today\u2019s progressive in his heart desires nothing less than the control of others. Have you noticed the common thread between Obamacare, Global Warming, Political Correctness, etc, etc? Yep, you guessed it. The common thread is that all of these are essentially ways to control the actions of other human beings.\n\nVladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks had this art down to a science. The Bolsheviks essentially stole power and instituted authoritarian rule by promising the fruits of communism to the masses, all the while killing those who did not agree with them. They promised higher wages for the proletariat, or the blue-collar worker; they promised an egalitarian society (colorblind); they promised equal outcomes for everyone; and they promised a job and a living wage.\n\nDoes all of this sound familiar?\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt\u2019s familiar because these are essentially the talking points of today\u2019s Democratic Party and their supporters in the labor movement, which having been discredited in the private sector is today essentially the communist party running the federal government of the United States.\n\nLenin was famous for saying, \u201cA lie told often enough becomes the truth.\u201d Today, in addition to the Democratic Party and their supporters, we have the so-called Mainstream Media spreading the lies of the communists within our midst. The fifth estate of the United States has become corrupt and is assisting in the control of others. This is why the Left and the media (or are they one in the same?) get so angry with independent and right-of-center-leaning media outlets such as Western Journalism. These entities don\u2019t fit their narrative and don\u2019t spew the party line. In short, they can\u2019t control them.\n\nThat is also why the Left also gets so angry about Second Amendment rights. Because at the end of the day, when the agenda is control, it\u2019s hard to control someone holding a semi-automatic weapon. Just ask the federal agents who had to back off from the Bundy Ranch situation.\n\nDoes anyone think that the feds would have quit killing cows had they not been stopped by armed citizens? The first thing the communists did after killing all the intellectuals, professionals, patriots, and anyone else who could think for themselves was to confiscate all the weapons. And then they proceeded to become the biggest mass murderers in history\u2013Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and so on.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThat is why it is so important to fight for our freedoms and for the America we once knew. It\u2019s not for us; it\u2019s for our children. They deserve to not be controlled and to enjoy the freedoms that America once stood for and could again. That is, if we can call progressives for what they are: card-carrying communists.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does all of this sound familiar?", "author": "L.
