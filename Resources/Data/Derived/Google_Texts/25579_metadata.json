It\u2019s the news that star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and star outfielder Carlos Gonzalez both could play in a Cactus League game on Monday, when the Rockies host the Reds at Salt River Fields.\n\nBoth players are coming off surgeries and manager Walt Weiss had not expected them to play in a game until mid-March or later.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that they may play tomorrow,\u201d Weiss said Sunday. \u201cWe have to get through the day and see what that looks like. We are hopeful.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki is coming off surgery last August to repair a torn labrum in his left hip. Gonzalez had surgery in August to repair the injured patella tendon in his left knee.\n\n\u201cI was really thinking, before I got down here, that those guys would play maybe around the middle of spring training, or a couple of weeks in,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThings have gone so well that there is a possibility they will be out there tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s game will be the Rockies\u2019 sixth of the Cactus League schedule.\n\nOnce CarGo and Tulo get on the field, Weiss said he will still proceed with some caution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be playing it by ear,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cA lot of it depends on how they show up every day. But the plan all along has been to take it slow. But I\u2019m excited that we are talking about them being in a game at this point in spring training.\u201d\n\nWeiss said he didn\u2019t expect either player to be this far along because \u201cthere was still a lot of baseball activity they hadn\u2019t performed, even when spring training started. So I was being very conservative looking at it this spring for both of them.\u201d\n\nBut Weiss said Tulo and CarGo both responded well to baseball drills last week, including running the bases.\n\nTulowitzki played 91 games last season and was a possible MVP candidate, hitting .340 with 21 homers, 52 RBIs and a 1.035 OPS.\n\nGonzalez, slowed by knee pain and a benign tumor in his left middle finger, struggled mightily, hitting just .238 with 11 homers in 70 games.\n\nWeiss said neither player pressed him to get on the field earlier than expected.\n\n\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t lobbied me,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI check in with them daily, and a couple of times a day with Doogie (trainer Keith Dugger), but they have just progressed so nicely.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Troy Tulowitzki, Carlos Gonzalez might play Monday", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Troy Tulowitzki, Carlos Gonzalez might play Monday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/08/rockies-troy-tulowitzki-carlos-gonzalez-might-play-monday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__tulo-cargop1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__tulo-cargop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-08T10:48:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T17:38:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a53\"", "article_summary": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The best surprise of the Rockies\u2019 spring training?\nIt\u2019s the news that star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and star outfielder Carlos Gonzalez both could play in a Cactus League game on Monday, when the Rockies host the Reds at Salt River Fields.\nBoth players are coming off surgeries and manager Walt Weiss had not expected them to play in a game until mid-March or later.\n\u201cI was really thinking, before I got down here, that those guys would play maybe around the middle of spring training, or a couple of weeks in,\u201d Weiss said.\n\u201cIt is possible that they may play tomorrow,\u201d Weiss said Sunday."}
