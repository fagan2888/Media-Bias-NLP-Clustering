Cleveland, Ohio. Staten Island, New York. Eutawville, South Carolina.\n\nIn each place, individuals \u2014 all unarmed except for a child carrying a pellet gun \u2014 died at the hands of police officers. All of the dead were black. The officers involved, white.\n\nTo many Americans, it feels like a national tidal wave. And yet, no firm statistics can say whether this spate of officer-involved deaths is a growing trend or simply a series of coincidences generating a deafening buzz in news reports and social media.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge scandal in that we don\u2019t have an accurate count of the number of people who die in police custody,\u201d says Samuel Walker, emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a leading scholar on policing and civil liberties. \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nThere are some raw numbers, but they\u2019re of limited value.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports, for instance, track justifiable police homicides \u2014 there were 1,688 between 2010 and 2013 \u2014 but the statistics rely on voluntary reporting by local law enforcement agencies and are incomplete. Circumstances of the deaths, and other information such as age and race, also aren\u2019t required.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, detailing its own examination of officer-involved deaths at 105 of the nation\u2019s 110 largest police departments, reported last week that federal data failed to include or mislabeled hundreds of fatal police encounters.\n\nPut simply: It\u2019s hard to know for certain what is happening on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe want a comprehensive picture \u2026 so people can be aware of what really goes on, and not the claptrap put out by people with agendas,\u201d says David Klinger, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who has studied use of deadly force and hopes to get funding for a pilot project that could provide better national statistics.\n\nTo those who have taken to the streets to protest in recent weeks, that lack of context is almost beside the point.\n\n\u201cThese are communities that have been living for generations under the yoke of what has felt like an occupying force,\u201d says Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder of UCLA\u2019s Center for Policing Equity. \u201cAnd regardless of what any of the stats are ever going to say, if we don\u2019t address the reality of that experience, then we\u2019re shooting ourselves in the foot in our attempts to make good on our promise of democratic principles.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile cases have erupted one after the other.\n\nOn July 17, 43-year-old Eric Garner died after officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes on a New York City street. Cellphone video captured the scene as one officer wrapped his arm around Garner\u2019s neck, and the black man repeatedly pleaded, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nTensions escalated on Aug. 9, when Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot unarmed, 18-year-old Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.\n\nOn Nov. 22, a Cleveland officer shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice after responding to reports of an armed man at a city park. Rice had been holding a pellet gun.\n\nTwo days later, officials announced that a grand jury had declined to return an indictment in the Brown case. Fires from the resulting protests in Ferguson had barely stopped smoldering when word came there would be no charges against the officer in New York City. Again, angry protesters marched.\n\nThen a grand jury in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, returned a murder indictment Wednesday against a former small-town police chief in the May 2011 shooting death of an unarmed black man.\n\nRichard Combs, who was the sole officer for the town of Eutawville, had been charged with official misconduct for shooting Bernard Bailey, who had come to the town hall to argue about a ticket his daughter had received. Combs\u2019 attorney questioned prosecutor David Pascoe\u2019s motives in seeking the murder charge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "title": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "title": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/statistics_lacking_in_debate_over_police_behavior/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/killings-by-police-how-many.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "title": "Statistics lacking in debate over police behavior", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/killings-by-police-how-many.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allen G.
