Marco Rubio (R-FL), who has recently come under fire for failing to name a single source to justify his assertion that \u201cthere\u2019s no scientific evidence\u201d to prove humans are contributing to climate change, is defending his comments by claiming that at least he knows the science about abortion.\n\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, the senator said that liberals who criticize him for ignoring climate science are revealing their \u201chypocrisy\u201d because they ignore the science supporting the idea that life begins at conception. Rubio claimed this concept is a \u201cproven fact\u201d that people on the left are ignoring.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a bit of settled science that they\u2019ll never admit to. The science is settled, it\u2019s not even a consensus, it is a unanimity, that human life begins at conception,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo I hope the next time someone wags their finger about science, they\u2019ll ask one of these leaders on the left: \u2018Do you agree with the consensus of science that human life begins at conception?'\u201d\n\nIf Rubio is trying to use abortion politics to prove that he and his Republican colleagues have a clear grasp of science, though, he waded into the wrong issue area.\n\nAlthough \u201clife begins at conception\u201d is certainly a deeply held religious belief for many Americans, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the concept of \u201clife\u201d here actually has more to do with philosophy than it does with science. As Jodi Jacobson points out at RH Reality Check, \u201cthe phrase is highly \u2014 and purposefully \u2014 misleading because it confuses simple biological cell division both with actual pregnancy and with actual, legal personhood, which are all very different things.\u201d\n\nWhen scientists talk about conception, they use terms that are more medically specific than \u201clife.\u201d The current definitions relate to fertilization, implantation, and when a woman is officially considered to be pregnant. The medical community agrees that conception begins once a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterine lining \u2014 but, thanks largely to Republicans, this hasn\u2019t reached total consensus. State policies have increasingly been attempting to define pregnancy as beginning at fertilization. This divide has huge implications, particularly because social conservatives are now exploiting it to redefine methods of birth control as \u201cabortifacients.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s up for debate in Hobby Lobby\u2019s current Supreme Court challenge against Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate \u2014 and conservatives aren\u2019t exactly coming down on the side of science.\n\nAnd even though Rubio\u2019s comments assume that all abortion rights supporters must deny that life begins at conception, not all of them do. The ethical debate over reproductive rights isn\u2019t necessarily about when life begins, but rather about what agency women have over deciding whether to sustain a potential life within their bodies. Abortion is complex, and many Americans have a mix of complicated opinions about it that are related to factors other than when life begins. Some people are more concerned about when life can survive outside women\u2019s wombs, a medical term known as \u201cviability.\u201d\n\nWe have a lot of scientific evidence about viability, which is the cut-off point for legal abortion services under Roe v. Wade. Most OB-GYNs say that fetal viability occurs at about 24 weeks gestation. Scientists know a lot about fetal development during pregnancy, and there\u2019s a lot of medical precedent about how to treat premature deliveries. But, just like conception, this is a medical term that\u2019s been twisted by right-wing abortion opponents with serious policy consequences.\n\nThe anti-choice community is currently relying on junk science about \u201cfetal pain\u201d to claim that fetuses are developed enough at 20 weeks gestation to warrant abortion bans beginning at this point. The medical community agrees that there\u2019s no actual evidence to support the assertion that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks. Nonetheless, it\u2019s been an extremely successful strategy for abortion opponents, as an increasing number of states have enacted 20-week bans under this specious logic.\n\nRubio himself has been a proponent of \u201cfetal pain.\u201d In 2013, the Florida lawmaker co-sponsored a national 20-week ban in the Senate \u2014 the same type of bill that his GOP colleagues are currently trying to push to a floor vote. \u201cI think there\u2019s significant support across the country for the idea that after 20 weeks, abortion should be significantly limited,\u201d he told the New York Times at the time.\n\nReproductive rights supporters have been refuting bad science for decades, in a similar manner that climate scientists have been forced onto the defensive against people who deny the realities of climate change. In fact, several years ago, sociologists started wondering if climate denialism would become the \u201cnew abortion debate.\u201d So if Rubio was trying to pivot to a completely different issue, he failed.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "But the senator waded into the wrong issue area.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "But the senator waded into the wrong issue area.", "title": "Marco Rubio Defends His Climate Denialism With Unscientific Rant On Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/05/15/3438179/marco-rubio-abortion-climate-science/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP169229893880-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But the senator waded into the wrong issue area.", "title": "Marco Rubio Defends His Climate Denialism With Unscientific Rant On Abortion", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP169229893880-1-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP169229893880-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP169229893880-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T10:14:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd009f\"", "article_summary": "The science is settled, it\u2019s not even a consensus, it is a unanimity, that human life begins at conception,\u201d Rubio said.\nAnd even though Rubio\u2019s comments assume that all abortion rights supporters must deny that life begins at conception, not all of them do.\nAbortion is complex, and many Americans have a mix of complicated opinions about it that are related to factors other than when life begins.\nThe ethical debate over reproductive rights isn\u2019t necessarily about when life begins, but rather about what agency women have over deciding whether to sustain a potential life within their bodies.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s significant support across the country for the idea that after 20 weeks, abortion should be significantly limited,\u201d he told the New York Times at the time."}
