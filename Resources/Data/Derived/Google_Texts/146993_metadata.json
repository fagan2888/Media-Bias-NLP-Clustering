E-cigarettes will be subject to new safety requirements and their packaging will have to carry health warnings.\n\nThe Netherlands, known for its relaxed attitude towards the consumption of soft drugs, is one of few countries left in Europe where it is still permitted to smoke indoors in certain bars.\n\n(Reporting By Anthony Deutsch, writing by Thomas Escritt, editing by Jeremy Gaunt)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dutch, ban, vaping, under, 18s, say, more, harmful, thought", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Netherlands government said electronic cigarettes and water pipes are harmful and will be banned for children under 18 starting next year.", "title": "Dutch Ban Vaping For Children Under 18", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dutch-ban-vaping-under-18s-say-more-harmful-thought-365102", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/13/vaping.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Netherlands government said electronic cigarettes and water pipes are harmful and will be banned for children under 18 starting next year.", "title": "Dutch Ban Vaping For Children Under 18", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dutch-ban-vaping-under-18s-say-more-harmful-thought-365102", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/13/vaping.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/13/vaping.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-13T10:36:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-13T10:36:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Netherlands government said electronic cigarettes and water pipes are harmful and will be banned for children under 18 starting next year."}, "article_summary": "E-cigarettes, which electrically vaporize a nicotine-infused solution, are defended by their proponents as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes, but the government said its studies showed they were still harmful.\n\"With this ban I want to protect young people from the damage e-cigarettes cause,\" said health state secretary Martin Van Rijn in a statement.\nThe government said that studies carried out by the Dutch food safety and public health institutes had shown that e-cigarettes were \"more harmful than expected\" to users' health.\nThe Netherlands will ban advertising of the devices when the new law comes into force in May 2016.\nTobacco companies, including BAT, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco, are all jostling for position in the emerging vaping market, which could top $7 billion in size this year."}
