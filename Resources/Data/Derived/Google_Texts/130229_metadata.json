We are confident that SLED will conduct a complete and thorough investigation in to the incident and provide their findings to all concerned.\"\n\nSLED is investigating the incident which unfolded at about 9:30 a.m. when Slager conducted a traffic stop at Craig Street and Remount Road, according to Pryor.\n\nAn NCPD sergeant who was conducting a traffic stop in the area of Dorchester Road and Scarsdale Avenue reported hearing Slager's transmission that he was out on a traffic stop, and a few minutes later heard Slager say he was in a foot pursuit with the driver who was reportedly running down Craig Street toward the Singing Pines subdivision.\n\nThe sergeant said he then heard Slager advise dispatch officials the direction of travel and a description of the suspect as a \"black male wearing a blue hat and blue jeans.\"\n\nThe sergeant reported that he then discontinued his traffic stop and proceeded to Slager's location. At this point, another officer reported that Slager had requested another unit to \"step up his response\" to his location.\n\nSlager deployed his Taser weapon to detain the driver but was unsuccessful, Pryor said.\n\nPolice say an altercation then began between Slager and Scott resulting in a fight for the officer's Taser.\n\nDuring the fight, Scott gained control of the Taser to use it against the officer who then fired his service weapon at the suspect, Pryor said.\n\nWhile en route, the sergeant reported that he heard Slager say that he deployed his Taser and was requesting for back up units, and seconds later reported \"shots fired and the subject is down, he took my taser.\"\n\nThe sergeant said he and another officer performed CPR on Scott until EMS units arrived; the other officer also reported that he was also directing EMS and fire officials the best route to take to get to the victim faster.\n\nA police report states when EMS and first responders arrived, EMS took over providing care to Scott who was pronounced dead a short time later.\n\nAn NCPD officer reported that he made contact with Slager and secured his duty weapon. The officer said he put Slager in his patrol car and asked him for the approximate area of the incident.\n\nThe officer said he then located and marked the shell casings from the incident. The officer reported that he made contact with Scott's brother and secured his cell phone at the request of SLED.\n\nAccording to police, departmental notifications were made as well as notifications to the Charleston County Coroner's Office.\n\nNCPD officials say the duty chief and detectives arrived and took command of the incident location, and a perimeter was established around both the driver's vehicle and the incident location.\n\nPolice say SLED was notified and responded to the location to assume control of the investigation.\n\nWorkers at Auto Zone across the street say they heard the gunshots.\n\n\"The cop pulled someone over, all of sudden the doors swung open,\" Joseph Sanchez said.\n\n\"With in a few minutes EMS was already here,\" Jonah Perez said.\n\nPerez and Sanchez were just hundreds of feet from the shooting.\n\n\"It's pretty scary to hear somebody got shot,\" Sanchez said.\n\nCrime scene tape blocked off Craig Road and people surrounded the busy street asking questions. A busy North Charleston street moved a little slower Saturday as people wondered what caused it all.\n\n\"Hopefully it was done for the right reasons, you know?\" Sanchez said.\n\n\"We're asking everybody to please, before they react on this, to please let the investigation be completed,\" said Elder James Johnson with the National Action Network on Sunday.\n\nJohnson was urging people to wait until the investigation into the shooting is over to make any judgments.\n\nJohnson said the tragedy should not be made any worse.\n\n\"I don't want this to become another Ferguson,\" said Elder Johnson. \"I don't want anymore lives to be taken or anyone else to be in jail.\"\n\nDocuments state two complaints were filed against Slager including an incident for using a taser on a suspect in 2013. Slager was cleared in that incident.\n\nSlager was also given a warning for not filling out a police report earlier this year for a woman who claimed she was harassed by a neighbor.\n\nCopyright 2015 WCSC.
