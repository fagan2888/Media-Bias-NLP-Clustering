Noel Canning. You may recall that by a vote of 9 to 0, President Obama \u201clost\u201d this case, in as much as the court held that his recess appointments of three members of the labor board were unauthorized by the Constitution\u2019s recess appointments clause.\n\nThe president had made the appointments during a monthlong Senate recess that was punctuated by momentary twice-weekly \u201cpro forma sessions,\u201d intended to keep the president from using his recess appointment power to fill positions that the Republicans were determined to keep empty. The court ruled that the pro forma sessions were real, not phony, sessions, and that the \u201crecesses\u201d between them were thus only three days long. That was too short, the court held, to count as a recess within the meaning of the recess appointments clause.\n\nI put \u201clost\u201d in quotation marks because by any objective view, this narrowly technical decision was a major victory for the president, considering the damage to presidential authority the court might have done \u2013 and came very close to doing \u2013 had it affirmed the lower court in functionally eliminating the recess appointment power altogether. Only an inside-the-Beltway commentariat, infected by a toxic politic atmosphere that obliterates all nuance, could have construed the decision as a defeat \u2013 thus enabling the Republicans\u2019 effort to sweep the decision up into their false \u201cpresidential power grab\u201d narrative. The unsung architect of the president\u2019s unsung victory was Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who engaged in a head-to-head battle with his interpretive nemesis, Antonin Scalia, and came out the winner, marking the 20th anniversary of his appointment to the Supreme Court with perhaps the most important opinion of his tenure.\n\nI had intended to offer this contrarian take on the Noel Canning decision back in June. But then came the Hobby Lobby decision, along with new developments in the contraception and abortion wars and other summertime distractions. The moment passed. But two developments in recent days sent me back to contemplating Noel Canning, and I have come away more convinced than ever that this important Supreme Court decision has been profoundly misunderstood. Hence this column.\n\nThe first development was a fascinating interview that Marcia Coyle of the National Law Journal conducted with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ms. Coyle, a highly experienced observer of the court and the author of \u201cThe Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution,\u201d published last year, drew a number of pointed observations from an obviously energized Justice Ginsburg. For example, the justice commented that while the Supreme Court was \u201conce a leader in the world\u201d in combating racial discrimination, \u201cwhat\u2019s amazing is how things have changed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat jumped out at me in the interview was Justice Ginsburg\u2019s comment on the recess appointment decision: \u201cI think some of the reports about Noel Canning, some of the headlines \u2013 \u2018Court rejects Obama\u2019s nominees\u2019 \u2013 they missed what was really important about Noel Canning. The administration prevailed on the first two questions.\u201d\n\nIndeed, had the administration not prevailed on those questions \u2013 by a vote of 5 to 4 \u2013 this president and future occupants of the White House would have been constitutionally disabled from making the kind of recess appointments that have been regarded as a standard executive branch prerogative for much of the past century. The first question was the definition of \u201crecess\u201d: was the recess appointment power temporally limited to the recess between the two annual sessions of a Congress, or was it broader \u2013 a summer or holiday recess, for example. The second question was whether the vacancy had to have arisen during a recess, a definition that would have sharply limited the vacancies eligible to be filled by recess appointments in the first place.\n\nOver a furious objection by Justice Scalia (joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.), Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion rejected the analysis of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and adopted the answer to both questions that\u2019s least restrictive of the president. As a result, a recess appointment can (still) be made for any vacancy, pre-existing or newly occurring, during any \u201csignificant interruption of legislative business\u201d that the Senate deems a recess. So what\u2019s a significant interruption? \u201cPresumptively,\u201d Justice Breyer said, a recess had to be at least 10 days long to qualify, although he added that an exception might be made if a \u201cnational catastrophe\u201d required filling a vacancy on a more urgent basis.\n\nThe other recent development that induced me to revisit Noel Canning was a real-world application of the decision, in a ruling last week by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Before reviewing a National Labor Relations Board order, issued in a dispute between the Teamsters Union and an employer over the threatened hiring of permanent replacement workers during a lockout, the Denver-based appeals court said it first had to address the question of whether the board had authority to act in the first place. The five-member labor board can act only if at least three members are present, and at the time of the disputed order, the board had only three members. One of them, Craig Becker, had been appointed by President Obama during a two-week Senate recess in the spring of 2010. Given the uncertainty surrounding the validity of that appointment, the appeals court had placed the case on hold to await the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Noel Canning.\n\nThe 10th Circuit\u2019s decision, Teamsters Local Union No. 455 v. National Labor Relations Board, was written by Judge Neil Gorsuch, a rising star among Republican-appointed judges on the federal appellate bench. He wrote last week that given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, \u201cthere seems little reason to doubt the validity of the appointment before us and the power of the board to issue the order under review.\u201d\n\nThat conclusion required no heavy lifting \u2013 and that\u2019s the point. Any judge in the country would have ruled the same way. A question that was deeply disputed just a few months ago is now settled. (The 10th Circuit went on to uphold the board\u2019s order and rule against the union.)\n\nTo return to the Noel Canning decision itself, and to why I credit Stephen Breyer with an important victory: It\u2019s hard to imagine a more perfectly designed contest between two justices, Breyer and Scalia, and between the contrasting approaches to constitutional interpretation that they have come to stand for.\n\nTo start with the constitutional text \u2013 and, for the Scalia camp, that\u2019s basically where the analysis ends \u2013 the language of the recess appointments clause appears to favor a tightly constricted power. The clause gives the president authority \u201cto fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.\u201d The recess of the Senate? At the founding, and until the 1860s, the Senate knew only one kind of recess, the recess between the two annual sessions of a single Congress. May happen during the recess at least suggests that the Constitution\u2019s framers intended the clause to apply to those vacancies that came about while senators were away on their annual recess.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe constitutional text is thus ambiguous,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote in an understatement. His opinion, of course, didn\u2019t end there. Text for him is a beginning, not an end point: \u201cThe Founders knew they were writing a document designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries.\u201d He has made clear over the years that for him, text is to be interpreted in light of a provision\u2019s overall purpose and of the understanding that has built up over the centuries.\n\nFor the two questions \u2013 the definition of \u201crecess\u201d and whether a vacancy must have occurred during a recess \u2013 both purpose and historical practice support the broader reading of presidential authority, Justice Breyer concluded. The purpose of the clause, he said, was \u201cto permit the president to obtain the assistance of subordinate officers when the Senate, due to its recess, cannot confirm them.\u201d The narrower answer to the two questions, he said, would thus restrict the president in a way the framers couldn\u2019t have intended, preventing recess appointments \u201cno matter who the official, no matter how dire the need, no matter how uncontroversial the appointment, and no matter how late in the session the office fell vacant.\u201d Historical practice, with longstanding Senate acquiescence, supported the broader readings, he concluded.\n\nThis analysis was anathema to Justice Scalia. \u201cThe majority sweeps away the key textual limitations on the recess-appointment power,\u201d he wrote. His opinion was labeled \u201cconcurring in the judgment\u201d because the court\u2019s bottom-line judgment was that the three disputed appointments were invalid. But in the \u201cconcurring opinion\u201d he delivered from the bench \u2013 surely a first for an expression of disagreement so labeled \u2013 he denounced the court\u2019s \u201cjudicial adventurism\u201d and made abundantly clear that this was a dissent in all but the most formal sense.\n\nThe text was \u201cclear,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote in his opinion, which at 49 pages was eight pages longer than Justice Breyer\u2019s. (I\u2019ve wondered whether Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion started out speaking for a majority, and whether Justice Breyer picked off Justice Anthony M. Kennedy as a fifth vote. But lacking proof and sources, I\u2019ll leave it at that.) He said there was \u201cno ground for the majority\u2019s deference to the unconstitutional recess-appointment practices of the Executive Branch.\u201d\n\nThe \u201creal tragedy of today\u2019s opinion,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote, was the \u201cdamage done to our separation-of-powers jurisprudence.\u201d Maybe so. Or just maybe it was the damage done to the rigid formalism that governs his approach to constitutional interpretation, the originalism of which Justice Breyer\u2019s functional pragmatism is the polar opposite. Not for nothing did Justice Breyer give his 2010 book its title: \u201cMaking Our Democracy Work.\u201d\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s tragedy, it\u2019s not unfair to say, is Justice Breyer\u2019s
