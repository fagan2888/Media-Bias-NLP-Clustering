I\u2019m Hillary.\u201d\n\nThe commercial immediately drew the wrath of the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, who called it \u201cwoefully short on substance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of what Hillary Clinton would do to grow our struggling economy, fix the disaster of Obamacare, or repair our damaged reputation abroad,\u201d a visibly furious Priebus told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s just cats.\u201d\n\nIn defense of the ad, the Clinton campaign issued the following statement: \u201cAmerica loves kittens. Loving kittens makes America strong. Hillary is ready for kittens. Kittens are ready for Hillary. Meow meow meow meow.\u201d\n\nGet news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Hillary Clinton has followed up the official announcement of her candidacy with a new campaign ad featuring nothing but kittens.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "At various points in the advertisement, the kittens are shown playing in a sock drawer, tangled up in yarn, and chasing a duckling.", "title": "New Hillary Clinton Ad Features Just Kittens - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Borowitz-New-Hillary-Clinton-Ad-Features-Just-Kittens-1200-630-13100027.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-04-13T10:08:13-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/new-hillary-clinton-ad-features-just-kittens", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At various points in the advertisement, the kittens are shown playing in a sock drawer, tangled up in yarn, and chasing a duckling.", "creator": "@BorowitzReport", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Borowitz-New-Hillary-Clinton-Ad-Features-Just-Kittens-1200-630-13100027.jpg", "title": "New Hillary Clinton Ad Features Just Kittens - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3029018\",\"title_alt\":\"New Hillary Clinton Ad Features Just Kittens\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/04\\/Borowitz-New-Hillary-Clinton-Ad-Features-Just-Kittens-728-375-13100127.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Borowitz Report", "tag": "Satire", "published_time": "2015-04-13T10:08:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T10:08:13-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3029018, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "2016 election, Hillary Clinton, Humor, Presidential Candidates, Satire"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd869\"", "article_summary": "Meow meow meow meow.\u201dGet news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just cats.\u201dIn defense of the ad, the Clinton campaign issued the following statement: \u201cAmerica loves kittens.\nBROOKLYN (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Hillary Clinton has followed up the official announcement of her candidacy with a new campaign ad featuring nothing but kittens.\nHillary is ready for kittens.\nKittens are ready for Hillary."}
