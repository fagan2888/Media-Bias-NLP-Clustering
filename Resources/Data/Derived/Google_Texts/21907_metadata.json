When officers arrived, they found the suspect had been shot.\n\nThe Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office and the police department turned to the public for help identifying the suspect. The Coroner\u2019s Office later identified the suspect as 19-year-old Joshua Jermaine Davis. It is unknown where Davis resided, but the family believes he lived with a friend in downtown Charleston, according to Johnson.\n\nJohnson said police are not pressing any charges against the customer at this time.\n\nWaffle House employees spent the morning sweeping shards of broken glass in the doorway, preparing for a noontime reopening.\n\nBrandon Rogers, division manager for the restaurant chain, said nothing was stolen in the incident, the first he could recall there since it opened a year ago.\n\n\u201cNo one was hurt, which is the best part,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cNo one was injured \u2014 besides the suspect.\u201d\n\nDavid MacDougall and Christina Elmore contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Would-be Waffle House robber dies after having been shot by customer, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, armed robbery,crime,North Charleston,Waffle House", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The Waffle House crew was busily going about its typical early-morning ritual \u2014 smothering and scrambling breakfast, clanking through the dirty dishes \u2014 when a robber jolted them out of their routine.", "title": "Would-be Waffle House robber dies after having been shot by customer", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151010/151019902/would-be-waffle-house-robber-dies-after-having-been-shot-by-customer", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019902/AR/0/AR-151019902.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019902/AR/0/AR-151019902.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Waffle House crew was busily going about its typical early-morning ritual \u2014 smothering and scrambling breakfast, clanking through the dirty dishes \u2014 when a robber jolted them out of their routine.", "title": "Would-be Waffle House robber dies after having been shot by customer", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019902/AR/0/AR-151019902.jpg?201510110029", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019902}}, "keywords": "Would-be Waffle House robber dies after having been shot by customer , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, armed robbery,crime,North Charleston,Waffle House", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T08:18:45Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-11T00:29:00Z", "author": "Deanna Pan"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Waffle House crew was busily going about its typical early-morning ritual \u2014 smothering and scrambling breakfast, clanking through the dirty dishes \u2014 when a robber jolted them out of their routine."}, "article_summary": "Waffle House employees spent the morning sweeping shards of broken glass in the doorway, preparing for a noontime reopening.\nThe Waffle House crew was busily going about its typical early-morning ritual \u2014 smothering and scrambling breakfast, clanking through the dirty dishes \u2014 when a robber jolted them out of their routine.\nShortly after 5 a.m., police responded to reports of an armed robbery and shots being fired at the Waffle House at 6907 Dorchester Road.\nA customer decided he was having none of that and opened fire in the North Charleston eatery, thwarting the holdup Saturday by fatally shooting the suspect.\nInvestigators with the North Charleston Police Department collect evidence at the scene of a shooting that stopped an attempted armed robbery at a Waffle House on Dorchester Road, according to police."}
