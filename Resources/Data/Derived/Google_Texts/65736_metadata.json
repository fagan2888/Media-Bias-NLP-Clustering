(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSure, Hillary Clinton is viewed as untrustworthy by the majority of voters. Yes, she is about as representative as one can be of the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 in a year in which both parties\u2019 bases are marching with pitchforks. And yet early polling suggests she is going to beat Donald Trump handily. The explanation is simple: Trump solves nearly all her problems. Here are just eight:\n\n1. Worried about reconstructing President Obama\u2019s base? Never will it be so easy for her to rally Hispanics, single women and college-educated whites. Rather than artificially whip up fear that the Republican nominee is bigoted, misogynistic and ignorant \u2014 the usual Democratic game plan in presidential races \u2014 Clinton will have the facts on her side. She can run ad after ad simply with Trump talking. That should do it.\n\n2. Worried about going up against a 40-something Republican? Rest easy. Trump is a year older than she.\n\n3. Worried a rich former first lady will be seen as entitled and out-of-touch? Republicans will give her an opponent who is a billionaire, who inherited a good deal of his fortune, who brags about buying politicians and who lives ostentatiously. Clinton will seem like the salt of the earth in comparison.\n\n4. Worried about her penchant for tall tales, obfuscation and misleading statements? Puh-leez. Virtually everything that comes out of Trump\u2019s mouth is suspect. Politico looked at 4.6 hours of Trump speeches and press conferences: \u201cThe result: more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false \u2013 the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories, or made the whole thing worthy of the spike. It equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average.\u201d\n\n5. Worried that she is secretive? When Trump releases his taxes, let\u2019s talk.\n\n6. Worried about her Wall Street ties? No one is more connected to financiers, lobbyists and big business than Trump.\n\n7. Worried about her foreign policy record? She is Henry Kissinger (in fact, she got in trouble for citing him) compared with Trump, who is frightfully ignorant on everything from Syria to China. If Clinton\u2019s Russian reset might seem awfully naive, Trump\u2019s infatuation with Vladimir Putin will make her seem like a sage judge of character. Clinton strained some alliances (e.g., with Israel) in office; Trump has outraged and frightened Arab allies even before the primary is over. Hillary applauded a rotten Iran deal, but it cannot be all that rotten if Trump is just going to \u201cpolice\u201d it.\n\n8. Worried about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s bookkeeping and conflicts of interest? Trump gave $100,000, so it must have been \u201csmart\u201d to support her cause, right? Moreover, his own charitable giving is a subject of extreme skepticism. Clinton will seem like Mother Teresa in comparison.\n\nIn short, Clinton\u2019s many weaknesses, which one or more other Republican candidates could effortlessly exploit, are hard for Trump to use against her. Repeating over and over that she and other pols are \u201cdumb\u201d and make \u201cdumb deals\u201d is not very compelling when Trump\u2019s only solution is to hire smarter dealmakers, such as Carl Icahn. (Couldn\u2019t Clinton just hire him?)\n\nAnd for all Trump\u2019s populism, Clinton can easily point out that his tax plan benefits the rich disproportionately and his repeal of Obamacare with no coherent substitute is going to have people \u2014 yup! \u2014 \u201cdying in the street\u201d before Trump figures out how Medicaid works.\n\nIn short, Clinton\u2019s dullness becomes steadiness, her insider-ness becomes reliability, and her lack of charm becomes almost endearing when you put her up against Trump. Considering how many Republicans she will win over (or who will sit home if Trump is the GOP nominee), you have the potential for a wipeout of 1964 or 1984 dimensions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Compared to Trump Hillary will look like Mother Teresa and Henry Kissinger rolled into one", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Compared to Trump Hillary will look like Mother Teresa and Henry Kissinger rolled into one", "title": "All the problems Donald Trump would solve for Hillary Clinton", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/03/14/all-the-problems-donald-trump-would-solve-for-hillary-clinton/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/13/Others/Images/2016-03-13/11hrc1457894650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/03/14/all-the-problems-donald-trump-would-solve-for-hillary-clinton/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump and hillary matchup, hillary foundation and trump, trump lose republican voters", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump and hillary matchup, hillary foundation and trump, trump lose republican voters"}, "article_summary": "(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)Sure, Hillary Clinton is viewed as untrustworthy by the majority of voters.\nHillary Clinton in Marion, Ohio, on Sunday.\nHillary applauded a rotten Iran deal, but it cannot be all that rotten if Trump is just going to \u201cpolice\u201d it.\nClinton strained some alliances (e.g., with Israel) in office; Trump has outraged and frightened Arab allies even before the primary is over.\nAnd yet early polling suggests she is going to beat Donald Trump handily."}
