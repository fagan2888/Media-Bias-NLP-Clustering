A Fox News poll taken shortly after the government shutdown had begun showed very consistent numbers for what Democrats think of their own party (a net approval rating of + 75 points \u2014 with 86 percent approving and 11 percent disapproving), what they think of Republicans (minus 75 points \u2014 10 to 85 percent), and what Republicans think of Democrats (minus 73 points \u2014 11 to 84 percent). The clear outlier was what Republicans think of their own party, as they gave it a net approval rating of only + 46 points (71 to 25 percent).\n\nThis is surely not a problem that is going to be solved by having Republicans become more accommodationist on Obamacare, as the mainstream press would very much like. And it\u2019s certainly not a problem that\u2019s going to be solved by having Republicans jettison the Tea Party, as David Frum would like. One marvels at how quickly establishment Republicans forget that the tea-party-fueled, anti-Obamacare election of 2010 resulted in the biggest GOP gains in the House since before World War II, along with wins in the Senate by tea-party-backed candidates like Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey, and Rand Paul. This amnesia is especially remarkable given that, just two years later, an establishment Republican presidential candidate \u2014 who thought \u201cObamacare was very attractive\u201d \u2014 lost by 126 electoral votes to a vulnerable incumbent.\n\nIn this light, the way forward for the Republican party is not to listen to the liberal media or to Frum, or to look to nominate more Mitt Romneys or John McCains. Rather, the way forward for the GOP is to combine tea-party principles with greater prudence and pragmatism. There was a moment in the budget battles when House Republicans were remarkably united around a sensible and moderate-sounding proposal: fund the government, delay Obamacare\u2019s unprecedented individual mandate for a year, and nix the illegal Obamacare congressional carve-out. Congressional Republicans, however, failed to stay on message and convey this position to the American people, and they abandoned it altogether after just a few days. But if the GOP will coalesce around similarly unifying proposals going forward, and will make the effort to sell them to the American people, it will be the Democrats whose stock will quickly fall.\n\nAs for avoiding yet another Republican presidential candidate who doesn\u2019t adequately represent the views of the party faithful, the GOP would be wise to embrace much-needed presidential-selection reforms that would empower rank-and-file Republican voters. Such reforms would go a long way toward alleviating the problem captured in Fox\u2019s polling.\n\n\u2014 Jeffrey H.
