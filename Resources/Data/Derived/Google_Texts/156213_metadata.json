The research was written by Joshua Aizenman of the University of Southern California, Michael Hutchinson of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Mahir Binici of the Central Bank of Turkey.\n\nThe paper considered a tumultuous period for emerging-market economies. Late last spring, Federal Reserve officials began hinting at coming cutbacks to what was then an $85 billion per month bond-buying program aimed at spurring stronger economic growth. With the U.S. recovery improving, Fed officials indicated they would soon start scaling back, or \u201ctapering,\u201d the bond purchases.\n\nThe rising possibility the Fed would trim its bond purchases slammed markets worldwide, but developing markets took some of the biggest tumbles. Money that had poured in seeking high-yielding investments in riskier economies drained out.\n\nSome emerging market nations weathered this storm better than others. In some quarters, it\u2019s been argued emerging market nations with good policies, strong international capital positions and healthy government budgets navigated the shifting fortunes of American monetary policy best.\n\nThe NBER paper says that\u2019s not quite right. In a study of a 27 emerging-market countries, the authors said nations they considered to be the best economic and financial performers got the biggest walloping. The authors argue the hardest hit countries have been punished, in a sense, for having been such an attractive place to invest during times of ample liquidity.\n\nThe authors took stock of a wide range of Fed communications on the subject of cutting back on bond buying, and noted then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was the decisive voice when it came to guidance about tapering Fed stimulus.\n\nMr. Bernanke\u2019s tapering comments \u201chit hardest the countries typically associated with strong international positions \u2013 countries running current account surpluses, having high reserves and low debt,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cA possible interpretation is that fragile economies were less exposed to financial flows in search of higher yields during the earlier [bond buying] years; thereby they were expected to be less exposed to the immediate impact of the tapering news.\u201d\n\nMr. Bernanke\u2019s comments signaling a higher likelihood of tapering were associated with large drops in stock prices and increases in the cost of insurance on government bonds in the stronger countries, while having an \u201cinsignificant impact\u201d on the weaker countries, the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate depreciated in both groups following tapering news from Chairman Bernanke, yet the depreciations of the stronger group were three times as large as the weaker group.\u201d\n\nNations the authors grouped in the \u201crobust\u201d group of emerging nations included Peru, Venezuela, Israel, Korea, Malaysia and the Phillipines based on their current account balances, international reserves and external debt relative to GDP. The \u201cfragile\u201d group was topped by Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and Chile.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New research argues emerging-market nations hit hardest in the run up to the Fed\u2019s decision to cut back its bond buying were those whose financial houses were in the best order, relatively speaking\u2014a finding contrary to much recent conventional wisdom.", "title": "Taper Talk Slammed Strong Emerging Nations Most", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/taper-talk-slammed-strong-emerging-nations-most/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Taper Talk Slammed Strong Emerging Nations Most", "description": "New research argues emerging-market nations hit hardest in the run up to the Fed\u2019s decision to cut back its bond buying were those whose financial houses were in the best order, relatively speaking\u2014a finding contrary to much recent conventional wisdom.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Michael S.
