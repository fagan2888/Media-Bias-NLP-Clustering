In a new summer ad campaign, A&E is telling you to “celebrate different” — even as its most popular stars, conspicuous in their absence, speak out against diversity.

A panoply of stars from the A&E portfolio of networks, among them Nick Lachey, Susan Lucci and Henry Rollins, tell the camera to celebrate “the girls who like girls, the guys who like guys, the old-school, the new-school.” It’s a savvy way to get in both a gay-friendly message and a plea for tolerance of the intolerance of the cast of “Duck Dynasty.” That show, A&E’s most popular, stars a family whose patriarch, Phil Robertson, has spoken out in crass terms about his belief that homosexuality is “not logical” and sacrilegious. Upon reinstating Robertson after his suspension (one that became a political cause célèbre on the right), A&E noted that Robertson was entitled to his own “personal views based on his own beliefs” but that his “coarse language” was unacceptable.

And Robertson is entitled to his beliefs — but are A&E viewers entitled to a lecture about how we have to be as tolerant of “the old school” as we are of “girls who like girls”? In putting out a PSA that doesn’t featuring the “Duck Dynasty” stars, and that dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don’t tolerate others, A&E is playing the oldest and most worn-out card of all. Declaring that people who notice bigotry aren’t celebrating “the old-school,” that they’re indeed the ones who are prejudiced, won’t be extinct so long as there’s money to be made.
