An additional 800,000 are considered low-income, earning between 100 and 199 percent of the poverty level.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was once critical of an individual mandate precisely because of its effect on low-income Americans. During a primary debate against Hillary Clinton, then-candidate Obama criticized the idea of a mandate for imposing fines on people who could not afford health insurance.\n\n\u201cYou can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care, but choose to accept the fine because they still can\u2019t afford it even with the subsidies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are then worse off, they then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.\u201d\n\nThis year Americans opting to not purchase health insurance will pay a $95 fine or 1 percent of their household\u2019s adjusted gross income\u2014whichever amount is greater. By 2016, the minimum fine will be $695 or 2.5 percent of the household income.\n\nIn addition, the report estimated that under Obamacare 30 million Americans will still be uninsured by 2016.\n\n\u201cThe central promise of the new health care law was that by bringing down the cost of insurance and making it more affordable, virtually all Americans would have good health insurance at reasonable rates,\u201d said Daniel Garza, executive director of the LIBRE Initiative, a nonprofit organization devoted to economic freedom for Hispanic Americans.\n\n\u201cInstead, 30 million Americans will be uninsured,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd four million will pay tax penalties for not complying with the law.\n\n\u201cMoreover, this administration has hit a new low by penalizing 200,000 of America\u2019s most needy,\u201d Garza said.\n\nThe CBO report noted that many uninsured Americans would be exempt from the penalty in 2016. The government will exempt unauthorized immigrants, incarcerated individuals, members of Indian tribes, people with earnings so low they are not required to file an income tax return, and individuals whose premium exceeds 8 percent of their income.", "article_metadata": {"description": "200,000 earning less than 100 percent of the poverty level to pay fine", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Roughly one million low-income Americans will pay a fine under Obamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\u00a0    The CBO estimated that four million people would pay the individual m", "title": "Obamacare Penalty to Hit One Million Low-Income Americans", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obamacare-penalty-to-hit-one-million-low-income-americans/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Obamacare-ACA-AP-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roughly one million low-income Americans will pay a fine under Obamacare, according to the Congressi", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Obamacare-ACA-AP-150x150.png", "title": "Obamacare Penalty to Hit One Million Low-Income Americans", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBRoughly one million low-income Americans will pay a fine under Obamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nIn addition, the report estimated that under Obamacare 30 million Americans will still be uninsured by 2016.\nThe CBO report noted that many uninsured Americans would be exempt from the penalty in 2016.\n\u201cInstead, 30 million Americans will be uninsured,\u201d he said.\nDuring a primary debate against Hillary Clinton, then-candidate Obama criticized the idea of a mandate for imposing fines on people who could not afford health insurance."}
