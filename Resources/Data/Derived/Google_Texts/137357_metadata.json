When Toure read a quote from Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) saying he wants to replace the ACA with a more patient-centric plan, Josh Barro of The New York Times wondered, \u201cwhat does that mean,\u201d and added that \u201cit can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.\u201d\n\nLater in the discussion, Toure and Kystal Ball sarcastically threw out words to dismiss GOP alternatives to the current health care law. Ball shouted, \u201cpatient centric!...cheaper!...flexible!\u201d Taking a cue from his fellow host, Toure cried, \u201cyay!...freedom!...no more tyranny!\u201d Barro rejected other conservative ideas, like selling insurance across state lines and tort reform, as insignificant solutions.\n\nBarro delved deeper into why he felt Republican alternatives to ObamaCare would struggle to gain traction among voters:\n\nOften, the way Republicans would prefer to do that would be even more expensive. For example, they\u2019d like to move people off Medicaid on to private insurance. Private insurance costs more than Medicaid. So, you\u2019d have to come up with extra money. Alternatively, you could have a plan that\u2019s cheaper because it doesn't cover as many people and then you have to explain whose coverage you\u2019re gonna take away.\n\nBarro\u2019s point was that the greater the specificity of a plan, the more likely it would be to alienate some voters: \u201cSo, either way, once you get specific, saying replace ObamaCare is less popular then when you just sort of generically say replace ObamaCare with something that\u2019s better than ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans \u2013 while it is true that they have yet to unite around a single plan \u2013 have produced several different specific alternatives to ObamaCare. However, the narrative has persisted that the GOP lacks any clear health care plan.\n\nThe relevant portion of the transcript is below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "On Wednesday, the hosts of The Cycle on MSNBC mocked Republican alternatives to ObamaCare.
