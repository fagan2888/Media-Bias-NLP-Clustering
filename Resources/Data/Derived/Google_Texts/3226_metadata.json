Meanwhile, non-expansion states like Texas grew their rolls by just over five percent. This might seem a brag-worthy statistic for fans of limited government and ideological foes of Medicaid as a whole. But when placed in the context of taxpayer bang-for-buck, that five percent growth in enrollment loses much of its luster.\n\nThat\u2019s because even though expansion states boosted the reach of their health care safety net by almost a fifth, their average state spending on Medicaid rose by just 3.4 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Medicaid costs to non-expansion states like Texas rose by a troubling 6.9 percent.\n\nSo while Texas and other non-expansion states allowed less than a third as many people to join Medicaid as in expansion states, they also ended up paying twice as much for that modest boost.\n\nOf course, overall spending in expansion states \u2013 that is, Medicaid spending including federal dollars \u2013 rose commensurate with the jump in enrollment. So the 18 percent increase in number of enrollees in expansion states came with a 17.7 percent rise in total Medicaid spending.\n\nBut the federal government paid 80 percent of that increase. In non-expansion states, federal spending on Medicaid grew by less than state spending\u2014meaning, if it weren\u2019t already obvious, that Uncle Sam is getting the sweet end of the deal as Texas and other states continue to resist Medicaid expansion.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Kaiser report looks at state spending directly on Medicaid. It doesn\u2019t quantify the expected savings to counties and businesses caused by having fewer uninsured people seek free medical care through emergency rooms. Nor does it address the short- and long-term savings created by giving poor people access to preventative care and early treatment.\n\nCatching illness early\u2014or keeping it from ever starting\u2014reduced health care costs at every level, in addition to improving the economic health of communities and reducing citizen reliance on other parts of the social safety net.\n\nIn short, there may be reasons not to expand Medicaid in Texas. It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, to argue that fiscal responsibility is one of them.\n\nCopyright October 20, 2015, Harvey Kronberg, www.quorumreport.com, All rights are reserved.
