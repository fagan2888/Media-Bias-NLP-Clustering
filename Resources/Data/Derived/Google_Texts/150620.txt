GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) — Some Jefferson County students are protesting a proposal to change the way history is taught in the district.

Dozens of students walked out of classes at Evergreen High School on Monday to protest outside the district’s offices in Golden before returning to class. Superintendent Dan McMinimee met with some of them to discuss their concerns.

The protest came after a sick out by teachers closed two other high schools in the district on Friday.

Teachers are upset about the school board’s plans to change their pay scales as well as a proposal to promote patriotism and the free-market system and downplay civil disorder in the curriculum.

Students say more protests are possible this week.
