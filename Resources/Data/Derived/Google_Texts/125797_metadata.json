(AP) \u2014 Make no mistake, these women kick ax. Their T-shirts even say so.\n\nThey fling their throwing axes 20 feet into bull\u2019s-eyes and race to obliterate pieces of wood with cutting axes, long saws and chain saws \u2014 all while in lipstick, polished nails and tight-fitting jeans and shirts.\n\nThey\u2019re the Axe Women Loggers of Maine, a group of friends with their own pinup calendar who travel across the country showing off their skills at county fairs, music festivals and motorcycle shows.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s empowering that we\u2019re women and we\u2019re doing a very male-dominated sport,\u201d said Alissa Harper, a 35-year-old native of Bar Harbor, Maine, who formed Axe Women in 2010. \u201cI like to show that we\u2019re feminine, that we\u2019re girls, but we\u2019re super athletic. That\u2019s one of my selling points: all my girls are serious professional competitors.\u201d\n\nMembers of the group have won events and set records at major competitions including the World\u2019s Open Lumberjill Championship in Boonville, New York, where Harper won the ax throwing contest in 2006. Members of Axe Women hold six world titles in various events.\n\nMen\u2019s lumberjack competitions have been around for decades and have been gaining popularity, especially with the Stihl Timbersports series featuring professionals and collegians televised on ESPN and ABC. Women\u2019s competitions have only gained a foothold in recent years, and there\u2019s no tour like the high profile Stihl series.\n\nThree Axe Women were among more than a dozen \u201clumberjills\u201d competing recently at the Town of Erin Wood Festival in upstate New York. No dressing pretty on this day \u2014 the women were vying for cash prizes based on how quickly they could cut and chop.\n\n\u201cWith Axe Women we always have a blast and we\u2019re just kindred spirits basically,\u201d said Chelsey Black of Buffalo. \u201cWe like to keep it light-hearted, but we\u2019re also very talented and serious about the sport.\u201d\n\nBlack took home about $90 for top-seven finishes in a handful of ax and saw events.\n\nWhen Harper began working in her first lumberjack show in Maine about 15 years ago, she was the only woman and had to compete against men. She was well versed in swinging axes and running chain saws, having worked with her father in his wood-cutting business.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "title": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "title": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/08/kicking_ax_women_compete_in_lumberjack_sports/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/axe-women.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "title": "Kicking Ax: Women compete in lumberjack sports", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/axe-women.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dave Collins", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWith Axe Women we always have a blast and we\u2019re just kindred spirits basically,\u201d said Chelsey Black of Buffalo.\nMembers of Axe Women hold six world titles in various events.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsVERNON, Conn.
