Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans, a former Morehouse College baseball player who has pitched and hit House Democrats to three straight lopsided wins over the Republicans, said he bumped into Rep. Vance McAllister, R-Swartz, on the House floor last week. The GOP's newest pitcher \"told me he was going to hit me,\" Richmond said. \"If he hits me, I'm going to hit Scalise,\" said Richmond, 40, alluding to Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, the newly elected House majority whip.\n\nThough partisanship is intense on Capitol Hill, it appears both Richmond and McAllister were joking. The game is scheduled Wednesday night at Nationals Stadium, the home of Major League Baseball's Washington Nationals. Washington area charities will be the beneficiary.\n\nRichmond told some reporters last week that he didn't think McAllister could throw hard enough to hurt him. But on Monday, he was more diplomatic, suggesting that because he is a right-handed hitter and pitcher, McAllister could only plunk him on his non-throwing left arm.\n\nRichmond, who has been mostly unhittable in the three previous House baseball games, led his team to a 22-0 win in 2013. He predicts another Democratic victory, though he expects the GOP, with its larger squad, to be more competitive.\n\nScalise is the starting shortstop for the Republicans, He managed to get a hit against Richmond in the 2012 game.\n\nPreparation for this year's game paid off for Scalise, who used the Geaux Scalise T-shirts produced by his staff for Wednesday's game for his majority whip race. He won that post Thursday.\n\nRichmond will be wearing a uniform from the New Orleans Urban Youth Academy. Scalise has picked a jersey from his alma mater, Archbishop Rummel High School Metairie. McAllister, who won a special election to the House in November, plans to wear a uniform from the University of Louisiana at Monroe.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "br-homepage, br-news, br-politics, cedric richmond, homepage, news, politics, sports, steve scalise, vance mcallister", "title": "Rep.
