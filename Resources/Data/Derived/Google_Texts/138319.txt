While Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in Memphis, Tenn., for an education and outreach session about Obamacare on Friday, a state senator presented her with a gift she didn’t seem happy to receive.

Tennessee Sen. Brian Kelsey gave Sebelius a copy of “Web Sites for Dummies,” with a photographer from the local newspaper, The Daily News, snapping a shot of her disapproving expression:

Sebelius says people are unhappy about Obamacare because they have been misinformed, telling the Sun Herald:

“There is no question there is still an extraordinary amount of misinformation. If 55 percent of the people understand a little more about how it affects them and their families, that means that 45 percent of the people still don’t have any idea, and may have believed that there is anything from death panels for Medicare constituents or something will happen to their health benefits or any number of things that continue to be said over and over again.”

Sebelius’ visit Friday was criticized by U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who has introduced legislation that would require the administration to provide weekly reports on the progress of Obamacare enrollment.

“The secretary is always welcome in Tennessee, but her time would be better spent in Washington fixing the Obamacare website so that millions of Americans won’t find themselves without health insurance starting January 1st,” Alexander said in a news release given to the Herald on Thursday.
