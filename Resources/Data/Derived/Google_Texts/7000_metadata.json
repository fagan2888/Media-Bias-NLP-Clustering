Dogs aren\u2019t the only source \u2013 farm animals and wildlife contribute, as well -- but it\u2019s one that people can easily control.\n\nDog waste is particularly nasty stuff, says biologist Eric Mayer of BioPet Vet Lab, an animal genetics research company based in Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nIt \u201cactually has more bacteria per gram than human waste, than cow, horse, mouse, rabbit, all of your wild animals combined,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nEnvironmentalists are fighting several misconceptions. For one, they say, people wrongly assume that dog waste is a kind of fertilizer that\u2019s good for the grass. They assume that if it washes down a storm drain, it will flow to a sewer-treatment plant.\n\nNeither of those assumptions is correct, said Nanette O\u2019Hara of the non-profit Tampa Bay Estuary Program.\n\nSomeone who steps in dog waste while walking barefoot is exposed to parasites that can cause roundworm or hookworm infection, O\u2019Hara said. But there\u2019s a larger problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either going to wash down into our groundwater over time, or when it rains it\u2019s going to wash off the land and into the nearest waterway,\u201d she said.\n\nSwimmers in contaminated water can get salmonella or giardia, O\u2019Hara said. And fish die when the waste causes algae blooms that dissolve the oxygen supply.\n\n276 pounds of waste per dog\n\n\n\nMany of those who now live in Florida are from states up North where storm drains connect to the same water-treatment plants that treat human sewage. But Southern states, including Florida, do not have combined sewer systems, O\u2019Hara said. That means whatever washes down the storm drain goes straight to the nearest body of water.\n\nMost urban areas require dog owners to dispose of feces left on others\u2019 property, and recent surveys found that 60 percent of dog owners say they do.\n\nJoanna Scleidorovich of Tampa, who hangs out at Rowlett Dog Park with her pit-bull mix, says most pet owners at the dog park clean up the waste. But in other places, not so much.\n\nShe has to watch out for dog waste when she\u2019s out in the neighborhood, she said, and \u201cat night, I don\u2019t walk around on the grass.\u201d\n\nThe population of dogs keeps growing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s close to 80 million dogs (in the United States) now, and when you get these pets living close together, they generate quite a lot of pet waste,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cAbout 276 pounds of waste per year per dog is about the average.\u201d\n\nFlush It Down the Toilet?\n\nEnvironmental groups are pushing public awareness of the need for proper disposal.\n\n\u201cThe absolute best way to dispose of dog waste is to actually capture it and flush it down your commode,\u201d says O\u2019Hara. \u201cIt goes into the treatment stream along with all the (human) waste.\u201d\n\nBut she recognizes people are reluctant to carry their dog\u2019s feces back to the house and flush it. \u201cThere\u2019s an ick factor associated with that,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\n\nNext best, she said, \u201cis to put it in a bag and put it in the garbage can.\u201d From there, it goes to an official landfill or to a garbage-burning plant, which actually produces energy.\n\n\u201cIt is always \u2013 always -- a better option to dispose of pet waste in a landfill than on the ground, because landfills are specially-designed facilities to prevent pollution from escaping that area,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\n\nPublic and private groups are pushing public education campaigns, such as one by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program called Pooches for the Planet. It uses media, from simple signs and bag stations to YouTube videos and events, urging the public to \"Help Prevent Poo-lution\" and \"Scoop the Poop.\"\n\nWhen public education and ordinances aren\u2019t enough to change behavior, BioPet Vet Labs can use DNA analysis to identify the \u201cpoopatraitor,\u201d as Mayer jokes. The program, available nationally, is being used by apartment complexes and gated communities in four Florida metro areas, he said.\n\nThe name of the program? \u201cPooPrints.\u201d\n\n\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
