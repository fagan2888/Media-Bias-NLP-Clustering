National Geographic Photo Contests are always reliable sources for some of the most amazing pictures of the stunningly diverse world we live in. Last year’s competition received over 7,000 entries from more than 150 countries in the categories of nature, place and people. The submitting photographers come from a variety of backgrounds–from old pros to amateurs–and the only rule is to “keep it real.” The Grand Prize winner will receive $10,000 and a trip to Washington, D.C. to participate in the National Geographic Photography Seminar in January of 2015.

This year’s entries do not disappoint. We have compiled some of the best contenders in the slideshow below. Which are your favorites?
