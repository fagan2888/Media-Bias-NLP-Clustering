Noted Taylor Swift BFF and forgotten Weasley sibling Ed Sheeran was given a royal welcome at the Grammys this year, sharing his “Grammy moment” with the likes of John Mayer (noted Swift ex-BF) and Questlove, who joined him for an emotional rendition of his track “Thinking Out Loud,” and then accompanying ELO on their 1977 track “Mr. Blue Sky.” It was one of the better team-ups of the night, although we wish someone had the foresight to cutaway to Taylor’s reaction shot.
