Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Luke Messer (R-Ind.) \u2014 told The Times the measure is intended to ease growing worries that student data is being abused.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step in providing a framework that can address the concerns of parents and educators and, at the same time, allow the promise of education technology to transform our schools,\u201d Polis said.\n\nThe bill dovetails closely with a legislative proposal the White House unveiled earlier this year, which was meant to ensure data collected in the classroom was only used for educational purposes.\n\nThe Messer-Polis offering is based on this concept. It includes provisions similar to the White House proposal that require third-party companies to delete student records at a school\u2019s request. The bill would also let schools or parents access and correct any student data on file at a third-party vendor.\n\nBut digital rights advocates and education privacy groups have opposed previous iterations of a student online privacy bill, arguing the measures contained numerous loopholes and were largely toothless.\n\nThose same issues are likely to arise with the Messer-Polis bill.\n\nThe measure could allow compaies to disclose student data for \u201cemployment opportunities,\u201d a vaguely-worded term. And it permits these third-party comapnies to make unilateral changes to their contracts and privacy policies with the school.\n\n\u201cAlthough this bill has some promising features,\u201d Khaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Times, \u201cit ultimately fails to uphold President Obama\u2019s promise that the data collected in an educational context can be used only for educational purposes.\u201d\n\nSen.
