He was in a coma, fighting for his life, and Kanaan\u2019s wife was one of many who wondered why the drivers were putting their lives on the line week after week.\n\nLauren Kanaan pointed out that her husband had won the Indianapolis 500, accomplished all of his goals, and earned a very nice living in 18 years of American open-wheel racing.\n\nHis answer was simple.\n\n\u201cNo one puts a gun to our heads and makes us do this,\u201d Kanaan said. \u201cWe\u2019re not rich, [and] we certainly won\u2019t starve if I don\u2019t do this, but I do it because I can\u2019t live without it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the mentality of drivers, and none put themselves in as much danger as they do in the IndyCar Series. Wilson died Monday night from his injuries, just four years after Dan Wheldon was killed in the IndyCar season finale in a horrific crash.\n\nWilson\u2019s death, from what by all accounts was simply a fluke accident, has again thrust the series into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. It comes as IndyCar heads into Sunday\u2019s season finale looking to crown a new champion.\n\nSix drivers are eligible for the tile, including points leader Juan Pablo Montoya, who returned to IndyCar last season after stints in NASCAR and Formula One. His comeback year has included a second win in the Indianapolis 500, 15 years after his first victory.\n\nMontoya takes a 34-point lead into Sonoma, California, over Graham Rahal, who is having a breakout year. He has two wins driving for his father\u2019s race team and seeks to give the Rahal name its first title since his father\u2019s 1992 championship.\n\nAll that could be overshadowed by Wilson\u2019s death in a year IndyCar has seemingly bounced from one crisis to another.\n\nIndyCar had to cancel its opener in Brazil over a promoter issue. The season began with a good race in Florida, but it was marred by the debut of the cars\u2019 new aerodynamic bodykits, which proved too brittle for even the slightest contact. The streets of St. Petersburg were littered with broken parts and pieces, and a chunk of debris sailed over the grandstands and struck a pedestrian. IndyCar required Honda and Chevrolet to make structural upgrades.\n\nTwo weeks later, the inaugural race in New Orleans was a rainy, caution-filled train wreck, and the lead-up to the showcase Indianapolis 500 was marred by three accidents in which cars went airborne and a fourth incident in which James Hinchcliffe nearly bled to death when his leg was punctured by a broken piece of a crashed car.\n\nIt led to frantic rule changes before the race in which Honda grudgingly agreed to design changes it felt only the Chevrolet cars needed.\n\nOne month later, the rules package for Fontana, California was so aggressive that drivers openly complained the racing was too dangerous. They put on a spectacular show that day, but in front of a crowd of less than 10,000 people. The track won\u2019t return to the schedule next season, and IndyCar has since implemented a conduct policy that prohibits drivers from speaking negatively about the series.\n\nJust last month, IndyCar\u2019s competition chief, Derrick Walker, said he was quitting at the end of the season, and series CEO Mark Miles said Walker believed he\u2019d lost the support of many key players in the paddock.\n\nThe 2016 schedule has yet to be released and owners have complained that the season is too short. The series doesn\u2019t seem viable with an offseason stretching nearly seven months. By comparison, NASCAR will have a dozen more races after IndyCar shutters its season this weekend.\n\nThose inside the paddock are used to the chaos and taking it in stride.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of opinions out there \u2026 and from people who aren\u2019t qualified to give them,\u201d former racer and team owner Bobby Rahal said Tuesday. \u201cThis stuff happens, especially when you are pressing the boundaries. These are the fastest race cars on earth, and there is a high level of risk to it. But it is what it is. People are always looking for any little hiccup to make a mountain out of a molehill.\u201d\n\nBobby Rahal pointed to improved television ratings \u2014 \u201cdo they need to be much higher? Yes. But they are trending in the right direction,\u201d he said \u2014 and the addition of a street race in Boston next year, as well as the return of Road America in Wisconsin to the schedule. IndyCar is also in talks to get Phoenix back on the schedule after a 10-year absence.\n\nBut Fontana is gone for 2016, New Orleans had first-year financial trouble that could prevent it from returning and Pocono officials said it was \u201c50-50\u201d that the Pennsylvania track would return next year \u2014 even before Wilson\u2019s accident.\n\nTo those inside the series, the problems aren\u2019t as dire as they appear.\n\n\u201cI think this year has been much better than last year. I think each year, the series improves,\u201d said Mario Andretti. \u201cCertainly the series is not at the level we\u2019d like for it to be, but the sky isn\u2019t falling. And we\u2019ve shown time and time again that when things like this accident happen, we address the issue and find an improvement.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s still the best racing out there and we find a way to persevere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "No drivers put themselves in as much danger as they do in the IndyCar Series, which tries to cope with the death of Wilson after an accident last weekend as it enters its final race at Sonoma, California on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "No drivers put themselves in as much danger as they do in the IndyCar Series, which tries to cope with the death of Wilson after an accident last weekend as it enters its final race at Sonoma, California on Sunday.", "title": "IndyCar heads to season finale reeling from death of driver Justin Wilson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/justin-wilson-death-indycar-season-finale/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/AP_587537843458.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/AP_587537843458.jpg", "description": "No drivers put themselves in as much danger as they do in the IndyCar Series, which tries to cope with the death of Wilson after an accident last weekend as it enters its final race at Sonoma, Califor", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "IndyCar heads to season finale reeling from death of driver Justin Wil"}, "Author": "Jenna Fryer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Justin Wilson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9eb\"", "article_summary": "Wilson died Monday night from his injuries, just four years after Dan Wheldon was killed in the IndyCar season finale in a horrific crash.\nThese are the fastest race cars on earth, and there is a high level of risk to it.\nIt comes as IndyCar heads into Sunday\u2019s season finale looking to crown a new champion.\nWhen Tony Kanaan arrived home following the IndyCar race at Pocono Raceway, his wife asked him why he continued to race in a series that carries such a high risk.\nThe track won\u2019t return to the schedule next season, and IndyCar has since implemented a conduct policy that prohibits drivers from speaking negatively about the series."}
