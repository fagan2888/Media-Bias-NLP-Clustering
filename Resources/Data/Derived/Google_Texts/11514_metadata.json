Over the past three years, the fund\u2019s 11.38% average annual gain topped 80% of its peers, which averaged 9.48%, while the S&P 500 averaged 10.41%.\n\nThe fund seeks highly profitable companies that look poised to keep growing. It aims for large, industry-leading companies that have sustainable accelerating earnings growth and positive price momentum.\n\nWhere does the fund expect the best odds of finding such companies? A look at the fund\u2019s portfolio weightings offers a clue: As of March 31, managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeff Bourke had their key overweights in the information technology and health care sectors. In tech, the fund was finding opportunities in Internet software and services, IT services and communications equipment.\n\nThe fund\u2019s top 10 holdings reflect that tilt toward tech and health care. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were the top four as of Feb. 29. The top 10 also included health care names UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).\n\nSocial networking giant Facebook is still in a buy range from a 117.09 buy point after gapping up April 28 on strong earnings.\n\nIts recent action in the stock market is not perfect. Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C- from a worst-possible E, but the weak rating is still a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks.\n\nBut earnings-per-share growth has sped up, going from 16% four quarters ago to 33%, 46% and 83% in the past three frames, respectively.\n\nAnd the stock\u2019s IBD Composite Rating is a solid 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD\u2019s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.\n\nManaged health-care services provider UnitedHealth\u2019s EPS rebounded to 17% growth in the most recent stanza after falling 15% in the previous quarter.\n\nShares are up 13% over the past 52 weeks, even after falling nearly 1% on Thursday as a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund ObamaCare.\n\nShares of many key health care stocks went down after the decision. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer\u2019s ruling was a win for House Republicans who brought the legal challenge. The government was slated to pay $175 billion over 10 years to health insurers, lowering copayments for lower-income people.\n\nRobotic surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is a health care name that was unharmed by the ObamaCare ruling. Shares rose nearly 1% on Thursday. They\u2019re up more than 28% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nThe stock\u2019s EPS grew a respective 34%, 20% and 24% over the past three quarters.\n\nBank of America/Merrill Lynch recently said Intuitive was one of 16 S&P 500 stocks that could soon start paying a dividend. It cited the company\u2019s low debt compared with its industry, at least 2% of its market cap coming from cash, a stable earnings trend and EPS growth the prior fiscal year, as well as growth expected in the current year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How to fight the current up-and-down market?
