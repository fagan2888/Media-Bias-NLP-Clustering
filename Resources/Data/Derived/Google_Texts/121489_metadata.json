The auditor suggested the Postal Service leverage \u201caugmented reality\u201d to grow business, an emerging technology that adds a \u201cdigital layer of information on top of real world images.\u201d\n\nRelated: Post Office Uses a Celebrity Lifeline - Will It Work?\n\nAugmented reality requires four tools: back-end software, a mobile phone, an application and an Internet connection. AR users often wear glasses that display the digital layer of information, but they can also use the camera on their phones. Developing the software and buying new devices would require a steep investment by the Postal Service - AR glasses range from $400 to $1,500 a piece - but the efficiencies they can bring about would outweigh that price, the IG said.\n\nLetter carriers could benefit the most from an investment in augmented reality. With AR glasses, they could better load and unload their vehicles. While looking at the back of their truck, the glasses could add a layer of information displaying exactly where the letter carriers should place each package (see the IG\u2019s illustration of this process here).\n\nMail deliverers spend more than 5 percent of their time loading and unloading mail, the IG said, not including the initial loading at the beginning of each shift. More efficient loading and unloading could reduce the need for overtime, leading to dramatic savings for the Postal Service.\n\nRelated: Post Office Paid $287K for Trucks It Can't Find\n\nA digital display instructing postal employees on how to fix their vehicles could save $39 million annually, according to the report. Directions could be projected onto postal workers\u2019 windshields, leading to safer and more efficient driving.\n\nAugmented reality could also directly benefit postal customers. The IG suggested a facial recognition program, in which letter carriers would take a picture of a package recipient with their AR glasses to verify it is going to the proper person. Mail users donning their own AR devices could find assistance in choosing the right box to ship something and better track their packages to ensure they are home for delivery.\n\nThe idea of augmented reality is not entirely new to the Postal Service; USPS has encouraged its mailers to use AR technology on their products, such as catalogues. The agency has experimented with its own use of AR, launching stamps in 2013 that when viewed through a mobile device\u2019s camera become animated. Mailing agencies in foreign countries, such as those in the United Kingdom and Sweden, have launched programs similar to those the IG suggested for USPS.\n\nThe Postal Service is \u201calways looking for ways to keep up in today\u2019s increasingly fast-paced world,\u201d the IG said, and AR could \u201cinnovate the way the Postal Service moves, packs, and delivers mail and packages to create a more efficient delivery system.\u201d\n\nThe IG proposed USPS roll out pilot programs to evaluate the \u201coperational feasibility and financial viability\u201d of the various AR opportunities. A spokeswoman for the Postal Service said the agency is still reviewing the IG\u2019s findings.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Government Executive.\n\nRead more at Government Executive:\n\nSay Good-Bye to the Classic White Boxy Postal Truck\n\nFuture of the Service: End Monopoly or Grow the Business?\n\n9 Questions and Answers for Federal Couples", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In recent years, U.S.", "title": "This \u2018Alternate Reality\u2019 Could Save Post Office Millions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Alternate-Reality-Could-Save-Post-Office-Millions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/07/Alternate-Reality-Could-Save-Post-Office-Millions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In recent years, U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee49\"", "article_summary": "More efficient loading and unloading could reduce the need for overtime, leading to dramatic savings for the Postal Service.\nA spokeswoman for the Postal Service said the agency is still reviewing the IG\u2019s findings.\nWith AR glasses, they could better load and unload their vehicles.\nThe auditor suggested the Postal Service leverage \u201caugmented reality\u201d to grow business, an emerging technology that adds a \u201cdigital layer of information on top of real world images.\u201dRelated: Post Office Uses a Celebrity Lifeline - Will It Work?\nThe idea of augmented reality is not entirely new to the Postal Service; USPS has encouraged its mailers to use AR technology on their products, such as catalogues."}
