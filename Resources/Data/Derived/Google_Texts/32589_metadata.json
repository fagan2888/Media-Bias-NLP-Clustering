In some cases, though, these changes may stem from a little-known condition that sends testosterone levels soaring.\n\nWriting in the Oct. 22 New England Journal of Medicine, doctors describe just such a case: A 57-year-old woman who came to them with body-hair growth, balding, an increasingly male-sounding voice, and other signs of excessive testosterone levels.\n\nAfter ruling out some of the usual suspects \u2014 including tumors of the adrenal glands and ovaries \u2014 her doctors eventually settled on an obscure diagnosis known as ovarian hyperthecosis.\n\nIt\u2019s a condition that many doctors may not be aware of. Even endocrinologists \u2014 specialists in hormonal disorders \u2014 see relatively few cases come their way, said Dr. Graham McMahon, an endocrinologist who was at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston when he co-wrote the case report.\n\nOvarian hyperthecosis arises when certain cells in the ovaries overproduce androgens \u2014 \u201cmale\u201d hormones such as testosterone, the report authors said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how common it is,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Wierman, a spokesperson for the Endocrine Society who was not involved in the case, but has treated and written about ovarian hyperthecosis.\n\nThere have been no large studies on the condition, so its prevalence is unclear. In fact, Wierman said, there has been little research of any kind beyond case reports.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes ovarian hyperthecosis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the risk factors might be.\u201d\n\nOne suspected risk factor, Wierman said, is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a fairly common disorder that affects women of childbearing age.\n\nAs with hyperthecosis, PCOS involves an overproduction of androgens in the ovaries. The symptoms include irregular menstrual periods and fertility problems, acne and weight gain.\n\nOne theory, Wierman explained, is that ovarian hyperthecosis could be a more-severe form of PCOS.\n\n\u201cSome women who develop ovarian hyperthecosis after menopause might have had milder PCOS that was never caught \u2014 maybe because it was just causing irregular periods,\u201d Wierman said.\n\nBut after menopause, when estrogen levels drop, those women could see worsening problems related to their high androgen concentrations.\n\nThat, however, remains only a theory.\n\nThe patient in the current case was a 57-year-old woman who\u2019d visited an outpatient clinic after several years of bothersome body changes. She\u2019d been noticing facial hair growth for the past three years; then other, more \u201cprominent\u201d symptoms had cropped up in the previous year \u2014 including a deepening voice, hair growth on her abdomen, balding on the crown of her head, and an increased libido.\n\nLab tests showed she had high testosterone levels, but normal levels of a hormone called DHEAS, which is released by the adrenal glands.\n\nIf a tumor in the adrenal gland had been the cause of the woman\u2019s symptoms, her DHEAS levels would have been high, Wierman said.\n\nAfter more tests \u2014 including CT and ultrasound scans \u2014 produced no clear diagnosis, she ended up at Massachusetts General Hospital for further evaluation, according to the case report.\n\nUltimately, the woman was diagnosed with ovarian hyperthecosis and underwent surgical removal of both ovaries \u2014 a standard treatment for women who are past their childbearing years.\n\nThree months later, her testosterone levels had plummeted. (Because removing her ovaries also sent her estrogen to undetectable levels, she developed severe hot flashes and needed hormone therapy, in the form of estrogen patches.)\n\nThere was only a mild improvement in her balding, and no change in body hair \u2014 so she ultimately turned to medication for her hair loss, and electrolysis (a type of permanent hair removal) for the body hair, the report said.\n\n\u201cSome of the effects of ovarian hyperthecosis tend to be persistent, like facial hair,\u201d said McMahon, who is currently president of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, in Chicago.\n\nHowever, he said, removing the source of the excess testosterone often improves the \u201cmetabolic abnormalities\u201d commonly seen in ovarian hyperthecosis. Those include high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nMcMahon stressed that women should not be \u201calarmed\u201d by changes that can come with menopause \u2014 including thinning hair on the scalp, some body-hair growth, and weight gain around the middle.\n\n\u201cThose changes are very common among postmenopausal women,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd only a small fraction will have a medical condition underlying it.\u201d\n\nBut if the changes come on \u201crapidly\u201d or severely, that is a red flag, according to McMahon. And any time a woman feels concerned about signs or symptoms that arise after menopause, she should feel free to talk to her doctor, he said.\n\nPrimary care doctors can easily measure blood levels of testosterone and DHEAS, McMahon pointed out.\n\nMore information\n\nThe North American Menopause Society has more on menopause and body changes.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "For most women, some hair loss from the scalp along with more body hair are just regular signs of aging.
