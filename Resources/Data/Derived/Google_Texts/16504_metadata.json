He added:\n\nHamas is a terrorist organization, listed as such by the State Department since 1997. This is required by U.S. law. For Carter to suggest that the law just be ignored is inexcusable for a former president of the United States.\n\nCarter penned the opinion piece on ForeignPolicy.com with Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland. In addition to arguing that the U.S. and the European Union should recognize the legitimacy of Hamas, Carter and Robinson describe the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 use of bombs, missiles and artillery as \u201cwar crimes.\u201d\n\nAlthough they note Hamas\u2019 \u201cindiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians is equally unacceptable,\u201d Carter and Robinson appear to blame the West for fueling the conflict:\n\nEver since the internationally monitored 2006 elections that brought Hamas to power in Palestine, the West\u2019s approach has manifestly contributed to the opposite result.\n\nCarter previously has spoken out in support of Hamas, and visited with the terrorist group\u2019s leaders in 2009. In the commentary, Carter and Robinson argue that lasting peace depends upon \u201ccreation of a Palestinian state next to Israel.\u201d\n\nCarafano also had strong words for any concessions:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A leading national security experts has choice words for Jimmy Carter's suggestion that the U.S. recognize terrorist group Hamas as \"a legitimate actor.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A leading national security experts has choice words for Jimmy Carter's suggestion that the U.S. recognize terrorist group Hamas as \"a legitimate actor.\"", "title": "Why One Critic Trashes Jimmy Carter's Latest Peace Proposal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140806_JimmyCarter.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-07T15:27:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tX3YKg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A leading national security experts has choice words for Jimmy Carter's suggestion that the U.S. recognize terrorist group Hamas as \"a legitimate actor.\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140806_JimmyCarter.jpg"}, "title": "Why One Critic Trashes Jimmy Carter's Latest Peace Proposal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "conflict,terrorism", "published_time": "2014-08-06T12:10:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T15:27:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gaza, terrorism, jimmy carter, hamas, Israel, war crimes, mary robinson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1492\"", "article_summary": "President Carter continues to have a perfect record for decades of being consistently wrong on U.S.-Israeli relations.\nIn the commentary, Carter and Robinson argue that lasting peace depends upon \u201ccreation of a Palestinian state next to Israel.\u201dCarafano also had strong words for any concessions:\nFor Carter to suggest that the law just be ignored is inexcusable for a former president of the United States.\nCarter previously has spoken out in support of Hamas, and visited with the terrorist group\u2019s leaders in 2009.\nCarter penned the opinion piece on ForeignPolicy.com with Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland."}
