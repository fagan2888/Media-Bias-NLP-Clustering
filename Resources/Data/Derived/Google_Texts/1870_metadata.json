Regular guest on NPR, you blog at Caf\u00e9 Hayek. You were educated at the University of North Carolina and then got a PhD at the University of Chicago under Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize winner. You\u2019ve taught at George Mason, Washington University, Stanford, and elsewhere, and you\u2019re now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Russ, let\u2019s get right to it. Your book, How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life, seeks to recapture the energy and the power and the influence\u2014or, what should be the bigger influence of Smith\u2019s first great work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. What brought you to talking about The Theory of Moral Sentiments?\n\nROBERTS: I opened to the fact, I have to confess, as I do in the book: here I was, an economist for decades, and I\u2019d never read Adam Smith\u2019s other book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and Dan Klein, at the time was my colleague at George Mason, approached me about doing a podcast episode on the book. I thought this is good, this will give me a chance to read it, and I picked up the book and after about three minutes I put it back down because I couldn\u2019t understand what Adam Smith was talking about. I picked it up again and eventually, I got the hang of it and ended up doing a six part, six hour long series with Dan\u2014a little intense. Because I fell in love with the book\u2014\n\nGILLESPIE: Intense or boring?\n\nROBERTS: I like to think intense. You be the judge.\n\nGILLESPIE: So it\u2019s like Orange is the New Black or something: it gets more and more intense as it goes on?\n\nROBERTS: I don\u2019t know what to do with that, I\u2019ll leave that alone. I appreciate the cultural reference. But I started reading The Theory of Moral Sentiments really for the first time only a few years ago and I was totally captivated by many different factors that made the book interesting. One is that Smith is a great writer. He\u2019s fun to read, he\u2019s charming, he\u2019s the Jane Austen of economics\u2014which is maybe damning with faint praise, but I think not. He can really write a beautiful sentence and he had some deep insights into human nature, I thought. And what we\u2019re here for and what we\u2019re able to achieve and happiness that I thought were worth trying to convey to a general audience.\n\nGILLESPIE: Moral Sentiments, he revised it over the course of his life, but actually he wrote that before The Wealth of Nations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\"It's kind of shocking to realize the person known as the father of modern economics, Adam Smith, didn't think the pursuit of wealth was a very good idea,\"", "title": "Russ Roberts: Adam Smith's Surprising Guide to Happiness (But Not Wealth)", "url": "http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/10/08/russ-roberts", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_10/-2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It's kind of shocking to\nrealize the person known as the father of modern economics, Adam\nSmith, didn't think the pursuit of wealth was a very good idea,\"\nsay Russ Roberts. \"He thought it was corrosive, thought it was bad\nfor you, thought ambition was bad for you, thought the pursuit of\nfame would destroy your character and your happiness, your\nserenity, your tranquility.\nRoberts is the author of the just-released How\nAdam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human\nNatur", "title": "Russ Roberts: Adam Smith's Surprising Guide to Happiness (But Not Wealth)", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_10/-2.png", "creator": "@nickgillespie", "site": "@reason", "player": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://reason.com/embed/reasontv/2014/10/08/russ-roberts", "height": 360}, "card": "player"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Reasontv", "published_time": "2014-10-08T15:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/todd-krainin"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cd6\"", "article_summary": "\"It's kind of shocking to realize the person known as the father of modern economics, Adam Smith, didn't think the pursuit of wealth was a very good idea,\" say Russ Roberts.\n25:09 - Adam Smith's personal life.\nGILLESPIE: Moral Sentiments, he revised it over the course of his life, but actually he wrote that before The Wealth of Nations.\nRoberts is the author of the just-released How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness, an extended and lively meditation of Smith's classic The Theory of Moral Sentiments, first published in 1759, years before Smith's better-known Wealth of Nations.\nWhat brought you to talking about The Theory of Moral Sentiments?"}
