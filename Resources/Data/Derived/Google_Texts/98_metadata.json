Patty Wentz, OHA communications director, said the money for hiring temporary employees is coming from existing funds that were budgeted for Affordable Care Act implementation. Most of the cost is for staffing as the state will repurpose computers and other needed equipment.\n\nNorthwest Watchdog has asked what that money was originally supposed to be used for before the website failed to work properly. We\u2019ll update when we hear back.\n\nCover Oregon, additionally, is on track to hire 290 workers by December at a cost of $2.7 million.\n\nWhat does it mean when Oregon, the poster child for the implementation of Obamacare, falters?\n\nIf you ask the governor, president or anyone supporting the new health care law, it\u2019s no big deal. They are working to fix the problem and ensure those who need health insurance get it.\n\n\u201cAs Cover Oregon works to get online enrollment up and running, we are adding new sign-up options and more resources so that Oregonians get the insurance they want and need,\u201d Gov. John Kitzhaber said in a press release. \u201cTogether with the insurance agents and community partners who are really stepping up, we are going to do whatever it takes to get this done for Oregonians.\u201d\n\nBut to critics who claim they saw this coming, it\u2019s just another sign the system is flawed.\n\nThe issues plaguing Cover Oregon come despite hundreds of millions of federal dollars poured into the state, an early start toward this new health care law, a months long ad campaign and nothing but positivity from the powers that be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another indication that this model as a whole is a problem,\u201d Ben Domenech, senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, told Northwest Watchdog. \u201cNo state has done more to try and be ahead of the curve on this type of approach to reworking our health care markets than Oregon. It is a reflection that this approach was always from the beginning an ill thought out and ill structured approach.\u201d\n\nKitzhaber likes to point out that the state has already enrolled 70,000 through the \u201cfast track\u201d option via the Oregon Health Plan. That\u2019s 10 percent of the uninsured in Oregon, but they\u2019re signing up for Medicaid, not private health insurance.\n\nThis is a common trend in other states. Though Washington\u2019s exchange is working, 42,605 sign-ups have been for Medicaid while 6,390 are for private insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat that makes Obamacare look like more and more is significant Medicaid expansion,\u201d Domenech said.\n\nOHA is now focusing on getting the 10,300 at-risk Oregonians not eligible for the state\u2019s fast track enrollment covered, Wentz said. The agency has set up a processing center at the Cherry Avenue Training Center in Salem with about 170 workstations.\n\nThe temporary workers will be available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, except for Thanksgiving and possibly Veterans Day. They\u2019ll get paid between $14 and $17 and won\u2019t get health benefits, according to Wentz. Cover Oregon employees will have the option of health benefits.\n\nWhile Kitzhaber said Obamacre is more than a website, Domenech said that\u2019s like saying Amazon.com is more than a website.\n\n\u201cIf the website is down you can\u2019t actually access any of the products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exchange is a website fundamentally.\u201d\n\nContact Shelby Sebens at Shelby@NorthwestWatchdog.org\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
