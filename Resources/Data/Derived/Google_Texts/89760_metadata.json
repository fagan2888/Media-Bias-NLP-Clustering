Earlier, officials had said the sole purpose of the embedded connections to private firms was to monitor the health insurance website and improve performance for consumers.\n\nThe AP previously reported that HealthCare.gov was quietly sending consumers\u2019 personal data to companies that specialize in advertising and analyzing Internet data for performance and marketing.\n\nCooper Quintin, a staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the government\u2019s changes are \u201ca great first step,\u201d but more needs to be done.\n\nFor example, the health site should disable third-party tracking for people who enable the \u201cdo not track\u201d feature on their web browsers.\n\n\u201cHealthCare.gov should meet good privacy standards for all its users,\u201d he said. The foundation is a civil liberties group.\n\nQuintin had verified the AP\u2019s initial findings and added more detail, showing that HealthCare.gov was sending personal health information to at least 14 third-part Internet domains.\n\nPrivacy advocates say the mere presence of connections to private companies on the government\u2019s website -even if they don\u2019t explicitly receive personal data- should be examined because of their ability to reveal sensitive information about a user.\n\nThird-party outfits that track website performance are a standard part of e-commerce. It\u2019s a lucrative business, helping Google, Facebook and others tailor ads to customers\u2019 interests. Because your computer and mobile devices can be assigned an individual signature, profiles of Internet users can be pieced together, generating lists that have commercial value.\n\nThe third-parties embedded on HealthCare.gov can\u2019t see your name, birth date or Social Security number. But they may be able to correlate the fact that your computer accessed the government website with your other Internet activities.\n\nHave you been researching a chronic illness like coronary artery blockage? Do you shop online for smoking-cessation aids? Are you investigating genetic markers for a certain type of breast cancer? Are you seeking help for financial problems, or for an addiction?\n\nGoogle told the AP it doesn\u2019t allow its systems to target ads based on medical information.\n\nSens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the situation \u201cextremely concerning\u201d for consumers. Grassley said Friday it\u2019s still unclear how consumers\u2019 information is being used and he wants a full explanation.\n\n\u201cPeople using HealthCare.gov should have the confidence that their information is secure and not being used for sales pitches by outside firms,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nOfficials of the Health and Human Services Department had at first defended their information-sharing practices. There is no evidence that consumers\u2019 personal information was misused, they said.\n\nThe website\u2019s privacy policy says in boldface type that no \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d is collected by outside Web measurement tools. That is a term defined in government regulations, but other personal details were being allowed through.\n\nHealthCare.gov is the online gateway to government-subsidized private insurance for people who lack coverage on the job. It serves 37 states, while the remaining states operate their own insurance markets. The privacy concerns surfaced just as the president was calling for stronger Internet safeguards for consumers, in his State of the Union speech.\n\nThe website was crippled by serious technical problems when it made its debut in the fall of 2013. This year it has worked much better, a marked contrast. The administration is aiming to have more than 9 million people signed up by Feb. 15, the last day of open enrollment.\n\nBut the privacy issues were a reminder that the website remains a work in progress, like the underlying law that created it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Privacy advocates say the Obama administration needs to make more changes to protect consumer privacy on the government's health insurance website.", "pubdate": 20150124, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Privacy advocates say the Obama administration needs to make more changes to protect consumer privacy on the government's health insurance website.", "title": "Advocates seek greater privacy protections for HealthCare.gov", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/182585880-US-POLITICS-ECONOMY-BUDGET-HEALTH.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/privacy-advocates-seek-protection-consumers-feds-healthcare-site/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Privacy advocates say the Obama administration needs to make more changes to protect consumer privacy on the government's health insurance website.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/182585880-US-POLITICS-ECONOMY-BUDGET-HEALTH.jpg", "title": "Advocates seek greater privacy protections for HealthCare.gov", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, consumer privacy, Healthcare.gov, obamacare, PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1dc\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Privacy advocates say the Obama administration needs to make more changes to protect consumer privacy on the government\u2019s health insurance website.\nGrassley said Friday it\u2019s still unclear how consumers\u2019 information is being used and he wants a full explanation.\nThere is no evidence that consumers\u2019 personal information was misused, they said.\nQuintin had verified the AP\u2019s initial findings and added more detail, showing that HealthCare.gov was sending personal health information to at least 14 third-part Internet domains.\nThe AP previously reported that HealthCare.gov was quietly sending consumers\u2019 personal data to companies that specialize in advertising and analyzing Internet data for performance and marketing."}
