VP Biden appears on ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ to get ask young people to sign up for Obamacare

With three weeks to go until the Obamacare deadline to purchase insurance, the Obama administration is pulling out all the stops to encourage young people to sign up.

The renewed push included a stop by Vice President Joe Biden on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Monday so he could appeal to moms who are good at guilt-tripping.

“Once you hit 26, your parents can’t cover you anymore. And all of you think you are invincible, so you say, ‘Why do I need health insurance?'” Biden said. “So I want every mom out there to tell their adult child between the ages of 26 and 35 sign up, for no other reason than give mom peace of mind.”

“It’s easy, it’s finally working, the website,” Biden added, noting that the deadline is Feb. 15.

The demographic of the daytime talk show is not really the “young people” Biden wanted to reach directly. But the “mom” age group is certainly more of Biden’s scene.

He charmed the audience during the rest of the interview, especially when he was coy about his Valentine’s Day plan with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden.

“We’re doing a lot and I’m not gonna tell you,” Biden announced to DeGeneres.
