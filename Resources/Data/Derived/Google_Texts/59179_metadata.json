That pace is expected to continue, he says, as hospitals embrace outsourcing to streamline operations and create efficiencies.\n\nIn addition, Neysmith says, the Medicaid expansion under the PPACA means that more people will have health insurance and that bad debt levels will fall at physician staffing companies doing business in Medicaid expansion states.\n\nUnfortunately, providers in states that have rejected the Medicaid expansion will likely continue to see high bad debt levels in the near term.\n\nNeysmith singled out TeamHealth Inc., Envision Healthcare Corp., and AmSurg Corp., as particularly well positioned to take advantage of the shifting care delivery and reimbursement landscape.\n\n\"Physician staffing companies will continue to grow through a combination of acquisitions, new contracts and organic growth,\" Neysmith says. \"The industry is very fragmented, so acquisitions will be a focus for TeamHealth, Envision and AmSurg. These likely will be small-to-medium tuck-in acquisitions that they can fund from cash flow, maintaining their credit quality.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The physician staffing sector has grown by more than 10% annually over the past four years, and that pace is expected to continue, says a Moody's Investors Service analyst.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "physicians", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6383\"", "article_summary": "Physician Staffing Firms Seeing Double-Digit GrowthThe physician staffing sector has grown by more than 10% annually over the past four years, and that pace is expected to continue, says a Moody's Investors Service analyst.\n\"Physician staffing companies will continue to grow through a combination of acquisitions, new contracts and organic growth,\" Neysmith says.\nRon Neysmith, a senior analyst at Moody's Corporate Finance Group, says the physician staffing sector has grown by more than 10% annually over the past four years.\nIn addition, Neysmith says, the Medicaid expansion under the PPACA means that more people will have health insurance and that bad debt levels will fall at physician staffing companies doing business in Medicaid expansion states.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the healthcare sector's move toward value-based reimbursements have created a favorable environment for hospital-based physician staffing companies to consolidate and grow even larger, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. says."}
