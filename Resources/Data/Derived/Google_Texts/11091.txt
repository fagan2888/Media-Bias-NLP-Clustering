Sioux Falls, SD

Doctors are diagnosing an increasing number of Americans with the most deadly type of skin cancer.

25-year-old Amy Goodrich of Vermillion is one of about 76,000 people who are diagnosed with melanoma every year.

The American Cancer Society believes indoor tanning is one of the factors to blame for the increase in cases.

"I knew it was a risk, but it was more like if that's going to happen to me, that's going to happen to me when I'm 80, not 23," Goodrich said.

Tonight on HealthBeat on KELOLAND News at 6 p.m., Casey Wonnenberg will tell you about a bill in the South Dakota legislature that aims to keep teens out of tanning beds.
