John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and 38 other senators, mostly Republicans, voted against cloture, a procedural motion that requires 60 votes to move a bill to final consideration. 58 senators voted for the measure, while two did not vote at all.\n\nCruz blamed the president\u2019s policies for the nation\u2019s high \u2014 but subsiding \u2014 unemployment rate. And he suggested a range of conservative policies to increase job creation, including repeal of Obamacare, easing regulations on small businesses and moving forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\u201cInstead of continually extending unemployment benefits, we should instead work together to bring back economic growth and jobs,\u201d Cruz said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, President Obama and Senate Democrats refuse to do anything to address the underlying problem: crushing taxes and regulations from Washington that have killed growth and produced economic stagnation.\u201d\n\nThe proposed three-month extension on unemployment benefits represented a compromise between Republicans and Democrats over an earlier attempt that also stalled. That extension, proposed in January, didn\u2019t offset the $6 billion cost of the extension with cuts elsewhere in the budget.\n\nThe latest bill payed for itself by adjusting government pensions. It also adjusted some elements of the unemployment insurance program to prevent abuse. Despite these concessions, Democrats still couldn\u2019t win over enough moderate Republicans to move the bill forward. After the vote, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., promised to keep trying to pass an extension.\n\nUpdate:\n\nDavid Alameel and Maxey Scherr, both Democratic challengers for Cornyn\u2019s Senate seat, chided Cornyn for voting against the extension.\n\n\u201cShame on you, John Cornyn,\u201d Alameel said in a statement. \u201cWhile thousands of Texans are out-of-work and struggling to make ends meet, your response to them is: you\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\nBoth Scherr and Alameel accused Cornyn of standing up for \u201cWall Street executives and millionaires\u201d over Texans.\n\n\u201cToday, John Cornyn joined Ted Cruz in turning their backs on working people when they voted to cut unemployment benefits,\u201d Scherr said. \u201cSadly, this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened.\n\nTime and time again Senators Cruz and Cornyn have shown that they are not on the side of Texans. This is just one of the many battles in the ongoing war on working people led by the millionaire majority in Congress today.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi9jb3JueW4tYW5kLWNydXotaGVscC1ibG9jay1leHRlbmRlZC1qb2JsZXNzLWJlbmVmaXRzLWluLXNlbmF0ZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--Relief for the long-term unemployed was put on pause again today as an extension for unemployment benefits fell two votes short of moving forward in the Senate.
