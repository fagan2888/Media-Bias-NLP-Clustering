Chuck Todd, the host of NBC’s Meet the Press, is certainly no conservative. But he is an astute observer of Washington politics, and his new book on Barack Obama is prompting even some liberals to reevaluate the president’s effectiveness. At a recent event promoting his book The Stranger, Todd gave a withering critique of Obamacare:

This is a case where Rahm Emanuel’s whole mindset as the first chief of staff was “we’re not going to make the same mistakes Bill Clinton made.” I would argue a little overcorrecting. Well, one overcorrection was, “We’re not going to hand Congress a bill, let Congress write the bill.” I think in hindsight they regret that . . . This bill is a mess. There’s a reason it’s in the front of the Supreme Court. It’s amazing how many people I have in here who were telling me stories, “We just assumed we could fix that in conference committee and we could do this here” and all that stuff, so they allowed a lot of sloppy language and sloppy this and sloppy that to happen and they just let all these guys put whatever they wanted in it because they said we’ll clean it up in conference. Well, obviously that didn’t happen. . . . At the end of the day, it’s the “Keep the Insurance Companies’ Industry Intact Act.” They own it and obviously they want all these customers so I wonder if that’s something somebody you’ll start hearing more and more Democrats second-guessing themselves on.

It’s fascinating to watch liberals such as Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Harkin and establishment-media types such as Todd suddenly discovering the flaws — political or policy — of Obamacare. It’s almost as if they’ve finally followed Nancy Pelosi’s advice and read the bill and found out what was in it.
