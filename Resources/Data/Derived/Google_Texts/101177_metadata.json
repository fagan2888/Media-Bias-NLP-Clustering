In the future, the phrase may come to mean something very different. The next frontier for drone technology\u2014and particularly autonomy\u2014is on and under the seas.\n\nAlready, the U.S. and other militaries are doing research into ways armed robots could do much of the work that is today performed by manned warships and submarines, especially in difficult environments like the Arctic. But a newwhite paper from the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, released last month, warns that ever-smarter naval robots could make for very choppy waters in places where the United States, Russia, and other nations have a growing presence and competing interests.\n\n\u201cExperts have suggested that fully autonomous weapon systems are likely to first appear in the relatively \u2018uncluttered\u2019 maritime environment,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhile a small group of experts are actively considering the legal and ethical issues raised by maritime autonomy, policy-makers have directed little attention to the specific issues and challenges that arise in this context.\u201d.\n\nSea Monsters of the Future\n\nWhile Elon Musk and others debate the logic of more autonomous aerial drones, the U.S. Navy has long used autonomous weapons on its ships. The need for a sea system that could shoot on its own was evident to military leaders as far back as the 1950s, when advances in electronics and missile propulsion raised the prospect of highly accurate anti-ship weapons that could strike faster than human reflexes could defend. In the 1980s, U.S. Navy ships began to install the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System, a radar-directed Gatling gun with an autonomous mode. In 2004, the Navy deployed a system called the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, capable of automatically finding and firing upon incoming ballistic missiles across an entire region. When missiles are streaking toward your destroyer at a thousand or more miles an hour, who has time for human reflexes?\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nOther naval forays into autonomy include the MK-60 CAPTORsubmerged torpedo launcher, which can listen for enemy submarines \u2014 even waiting until a specific sub happens by \u2014 and pull the trigger automatically. Designers have also engineered a growing array of undersea robots for surveillance and mine-hunting. In 2003, the U.S. became the first nation to deploy an autonomous robot to look for submerged mines, near Iraq\u2019s port of Umm Qasr.\n\nWhile the Reaper gets most of the press, its waterborne cousins are currently evolving more quickly along the spectrum of autonomy. Last year, the Navy tested a swarm of 13 small robot boats on Virginia\u2019s James River. They were able to maneuver in concert with one another to protect a target ship from enemy boats with almost no human direction.\n\nThe military is also working on a 132-foot robotic ghost shipthat can follow diesel-powered submarines around the globe while also obeying the world\u2019s nautical laws. And the Defense Advanced Projects Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, is developing a \u201cworld-wide architecture\u201d of robot sea pods. Somewhat like mines, they would sit on the ocean floor\u2014possibly for years\u2014until commanded to deploy their payloads \u2014 possibly a drone, or some other weapon. \u201cToday, the U.S.Navy puts capability on the ocean floor using very capable but expensive submarine platforms. What we would like to do in this program is pre-position capability on the ocean floor and have it be available to be triggered in real-time when needed,\u201dDARPA deputy director Steven Walker said in March.\n\nThe need for autonomy is dictated by the isolated conditions under which naval drones may operate. Whereas the Predator or Reaper rely on the Global Positioning System, most underwater vessels can\u2019t pick up GPS. A greater level of autonomy, in many instances, isn\u2019t just an asset but a necessity of basic operation. That\u2019s especially true for systems built to stay in the water for years at a time.\n\nJust as militaries are working to establish a more permanent presence at sea, especially in today\u2019s contested waters in the Pacific and Persian Gulf, they\u2019re also looking to do so in newly accessible waters northward. Here\u2019s where armed naval robots, the competing interests of naval powers, and an absence of clear law could be explosive.\n\nRelated: 10 Military Weapons You Won't Believe the Police Have Access To\n\n\u201cMany of the world\u2019s conflict flashpoints are on coastal or contested waters. With rising seas, changing weather patterns, and other consequences of global warming, access to previously impassable areas will render the maritime environment an increasingly strategic battlespace for an ever-growing number of States,\u201d the report says.\n\nCase in point: President Obama visited Alaska last week to highlight the Arctic region\u2019s growing economic importance, and discuss the impacts of climate change. A warmer Arctic has less sea ice coverage during the summer, allowing more shipping, fishing, and, especially oil development \u2014 which perpetuates the burning of fossil fuels, which causes a warmer Arctic \u2014 rinse, repeat.\n\nRussia, which claims most of the oil rights under the Arctic Circle, has taken to bellicose assertions of its dominance in the region, like planting a flag under the North Pole. Meanwhile other Arctic states are getting itchy under their parkas.\n\nAs Obama was helping salmon to spawn, five Chinese warships were sailing the nearby Bering Sea. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s foreign minister sent a claim to the U.N. for 1.2 million square kilometers of Arctic sea shelf, citing \u201cAmple scientific data collected in years of Arctic research.\u201d In other words, the ability to access the Arctic, explore it, and document the process is all a part of making a legal claim to it. Autonomous underwater systems play a role in all of those processes.\n\nIn 2014, Denmark appealed to the United Nations for 900,000 kilometers of the Arctic seabed, a claim that conflicts with rival assertions by Canada and Russia. That same year, Canada began to test its military drones in Arctic conditions. \u201cThe project team deployed vehicles into situations that might be dangerous or difficult for a Canadian Armed Forces responder at a remote location to support search-and-rescue and hazardous-material operations,\u201d Simon Monckton, the mission\u2019s lead scientist, told Newsweek.\n\nThe United Nations report makes no clear recommendations for fixing increased autonomy in naval weapons except to ask: Do \u201cincreasingly autonomous technologies in the maritime environment require the development of a fundamentally new set of categories, concepts and rules?\u201d\n\nThe answer, clearly, is yes. But as with climate change, new rules may not be enough to change the rising temperature.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.\n\nRead more from DefenseOne:\n\nNATO Caught'Surprised' By Russia's Move Into Syria\n\nMilitary Revises Count, Says 500 Americans Likely Killed in Iraq By 'Iranian Activities'\n\nThe Next Wave of Cyberattacks Won't Steal Data-They'll Change It", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Do a Google image search for \u201carmed\u00a0drone\u201d and you\u2019ll see General Ato", "title": "A New Kind of Drone That Could Change Naval Warfare Forever", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/12/New-Kind-Drone-Could-Change-Naval-Warfare-Forever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-yemen-security-usa-navy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/12/New-Kind-Drone-Could-Change-Naval-Warfare-Forever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/us-yemen-security-usa-navy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Do a Google image search for \u201carmed\u00a0drone\u201d and you\u2019ll see General Ato", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18c2\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s where armed naval robots, the competing interests of naval powers, and an absence of clear law could be explosive.\nIn the 1980s, U.S. Navy ships began to install the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System, a radar-directed Gatling gun with an autonomous mode.\nSea Monsters of the FutureWhile Elon Musk and others debate the logic of more autonomous aerial drones, the U.S. Navy has long used autonomous weapons on its ships.\nBut as with climate change, new rules may not be enough to change the rising temperature.\nThe need for autonomy is dictated by the isolated conditions under which naval drones may operate."}
