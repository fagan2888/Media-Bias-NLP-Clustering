So tourists off a Mexican beach were shocked last week when not one, but two, suddenly began swimming alongside them.\n\nThe two oarfish showed up in shallow water in the Sea of Cortes, which is what divides Mexico and Baja California, in March, according to officials from the Shedd Aquarium of Chicago, which was co-sponsoring a trip along with Un-Cruise Adventures.\n\nBut this did not bode well, a marine biologist told NBC News. Although the sight and the swimming experience were a treat, the fish were most likely not long for this world, said Milton Love, a research biologist at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California at Santa Barbara, to NBC News.\n\n\"As far as is known all of the ones that somehow get close to shore wind up dying,\u201d Love said. \u201cTheir usual haunts are in deeper, quieter waters at least somewhat offshore. Why they wind up near shore is unknown, but likely at least sometimes the fish get carried into these turbulent waters by unexpected currents.\"\n\nOarfish are known to keep to themselves, as far down as 3,000 feet under the ocean depths.\n\nRELATED: Gentle Giant: Massive and Mysterious Oarfish Caught on Video\n\nSure enough a couple of days after being videotaped, one of them washed up on the beach and died Britain\u2019s Daily Star reported on April 10: \u201c48 hours later, the fish was found dead on the nearby Isla San Francisco.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the rarely spotted creatures gave swimmers a thrill. Though the fish are jarring to see up close\u2014they can grow as long as 56 feet, and the two that spent some of their last moments with tourists were 15 feet long\u2014but they are harmless, as Discover Magazine noted in its online edition. Their main diet is small ocean prey like zooplankton, shrimp and other crustaceans.\n\nThese are not the first oarfish to swim to the surface and then die. They are merely the first ones to be seen, or filmed, swimming first.\n\nRELATED: Mysterious Oarfish Found off California's Catalina Island Rivals Spanish 'Horned Sea Monster'\n\nOarfish Redux: Another Dead Sea Serpent Washes Ashore, Creeping Out Californians\n\nHere is the video of the two oarfish from this year, during happier, albeit short-lived, times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oarfish, the lengthy, serpentine creatures that factor prominently in ancient mariners\u2019 tales of sea monsters, normally stick to the deepest ocean depths.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/11/video-oarfish-spend-last-moments-swimming-tourists-mexico-154407", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/oarfish_swimming-youtube.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Oarfish Spend Last Moments Swimming With Tourists Off Mexico"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-11T10:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Video: Oarfish Spend Last Moments Swimming With Tourists Off Mexico"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/11/video-oarfish-spend-last-moments-swimming-tourists-mexico-154407", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Oarfish, Sea of Cortes, California, Baja California, Mexico, marine life", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Video: Oarfish Spend Last Moments Swimming With Tourists Off Mexico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf5c\"", "article_summary": "\"As far as is known all of the ones that somehow get close to shore wind up dying,\u201d Love said.\nSo tourists off a Mexican beach were shocked last week when not one, but two, suddenly began swimming alongside them.\nOarfish, the lengthy, serpentine creatures that factor prominently in ancient mariners\u2019 tales of sea monsters, normally stick to the deepest ocean depths.\nOarfish are known to keep to themselves, as far down as 3,000 feet under the ocean depths.\nThey are merely the first ones to be seen, or filmed, swimming first."}
