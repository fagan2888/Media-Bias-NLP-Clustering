Still, U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Hernandez Covington last week sentenced the 58-year-old Brandon doctor to 20 years in prison and ordered he pay nearly $2 million, the Times reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Goodman, who is 70-years old and weighs 551 pounds, wanted to shorten his 2012 sentence of probation and home confinement, the Times reports. Goodman\u2019s attorney asked that his 30-month at-home sentence be shortened, arguing he is largely confined to his bed as a result of his morbid obesity. Attorneys say he would use the freedom to make end-of-life preparations, the Times reports. U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra declined the request, claiming that his already lessened sentence was done as a favor to the Bureau of Prisons who would have had to care for him, according to the Times.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "Poor health is no excuse to avoid serving time, two health care professionals convicted in separate pill mill schemes have learned.
