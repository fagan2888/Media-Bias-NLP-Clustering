In 2014, Molina recorded $1.06 billion in revenue, earning $26.7 million in net income.\n\n\n\nMolina still remains far behind in membership to Detroit-based Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, which also has been experiencing double-digit growth and now stands at 420,000 Medicaid members.\n\n\n\nBut Molina, a for-profit subsidiary of Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare Inc., also began participating this May in a demonstration program to integrate care of 13,000 Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries in Southeast Michigan and other parts of Michigan.\n\n\n\nAdding HealthPlus \"was an opportunity to serve the Medicaid population and expand that into Genesee County, Saginaw and the bay area,\" said Christine Surdock, Molina's COO in its Troy office.\n\n\n\nSurdock said Molina's experience in Medicare's special needs plan will help it manage the dual-eligible population, which historically is a sicker patient group. \"The new program is more care coordination, more member touches and long-term care and support,\" she said.\n\n\n\nFlint-based HealthPlus, meanwhile, is re-forming this year into a \"flatter and leaner organization,\" said incoming CEO Mike Genord, M.D., in an interview with Crain's last week.\n\nState watch list\n\nOn March 9, the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services placed HealthPlus under state financial supervision because losses in 2014 lowered its capital reserves below the required state minimum.\n\n\n\nIn May, Molina announced it would acquire the Medicaid and MIChild business units of HealthPlus for an unspecified price. Molina has declined numerous interview requests on the transaction.\n\n\n\nOver the past two years, HealthPlus lost $60 million in its Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and commercial HMO and PPO business, according to state regulatory filings and interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial factors\n\nA variety of actuarial miscalculations, higher-than-expected medical utilization and a flood of new PPO clients led to HealthPlus underpricing its various products the past two years, Genord said.\n\n\n\n\"There were multiple factors,\" he said. \"Past financial models didn't serve us well in the future market. We had new membership, (many of whom) were underwritten for the first time, (and it) led to significant losses we didn't predict.\"\n\n\n\nGenord said HealthPlus' various preferred provider organization products with employers and individuals haven't performed well for several years.\n\n\n\n\"At year end, we expect to be out of the PPO market,\" he said. \"The (Affordable Care Act) market didn't serve us well the past years.\"\n\n\n\nGenord said HealthPlus also is phasing out its PPO contracts with employers at the end of this year. HealthPlus has 43,000 PPO members.\n\n\n\n\"We have informed our customers and are looking to move to self-funded options for our PPO customers and offer PPO projects with other health insurers,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBefore joining HealthPlus in 2013, Genord, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was in private practice for 17 years and affiliated with William Beaumont Hospital and United Physicians Inc., a Bingham Farms-based physician organization.\n\n\n\n\"I am excited about the turnaround we had this year with the executive team, employers, community and employees all going forward,\" said Genord. \"We have paid our bills, taken care of our employees and are proud of what we went through. We have grown as an organization.\"\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325.
