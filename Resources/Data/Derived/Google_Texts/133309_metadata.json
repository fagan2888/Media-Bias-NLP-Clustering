It would also prohibit the VA from placing any employee on paid administrative leave for more than 14 days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBonuses paid to VA employees would be limited to $300 million annually through 2018, and $360 million from 2019 through 2024.\n\n\u201cWe have seen how the presence of poor performance and misconduct ranging from unethical practices to outright criminal behavior can spread like a cancer throughout the workforce,\u201d said House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.).\n\nThe Obama administration said that curtailing employees\u2019 ability to appeal a decision, along with another provision in the bill that requires rotation of VA senior executives every five years, would deter talent from the agency.\n\n\u201cWhile VA supports authority permitting efficient removal of employees who have engaged in misconduct, this bill will have unintended consequences,\u201d the White House said in a Statement of Administration Policy.\n\nIn the aftermath of reports showing excessive wait times for medical care, Congress last year passed legislation that allows veterans to seek private care outside of VA facilities and provides funding for the VA to hire more doctors. But many lawmakers say that the VA has not implemented the reforms quickly enough.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the House passed a three-month highway funding patch that includes a provision to provide $3.4 billion to fill a gap in the VA budget in order to avoid a shutdown of agency-affiliated hospitals and clinics.\n\nEarlier this week, the House passed bills to ensure a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans' disability benefits and to urge the VA to define military sexual assault as a service-connected cause of mental health disorders so victims can receive disability benefits.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill passed 256-170 despite a veto threat from the White House.", "description": "The bill passed 256-170 despite a veto threat from the White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill passed 256-170 despite a veto threat from the White House.", "title": "House passes bill to speed up VA employee firings", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249715-house-passes-bill-to-speed-up-va-employee-firings", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/va_hospital_veteran_110509getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249715-house-passes-bill-to-speed-up-va-employee-firings", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-29T18:22-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Department of Veterans Affairs,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T18:22:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249715-house-passes-bill-to-speed-up-va-employee-firings", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill passed 256-170 despite a veto threat from the White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "House passes bill to speed up VA employee firings"}, "dcterms.title": "House passes bill to speed up VA employee firings"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTBonuses paid to VA employees would be limited to $300 million annually through 2018, and $360 million from 2019 through 2024.\nThe bill passed 256-170 despite a veto threat from the White House, which is concerned that it would limit federal employees\u2019 due process rights.\nThe House passed legislation on Wednesday to make it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire or demote employees for poor performance.\nThe legislation limits the amount of time VA employees have to appeal disciplinary actions to within seven days of their removal.\n\u201cWhile VA supports authority permitting efficient removal of employees who have engaged in misconduct, this bill will have unintended consequences,\u201d the White House said in a Statement of Administration Policy."}
