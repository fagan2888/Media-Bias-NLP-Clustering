(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nOver the past decade, the federal government has devised 115 different ways to measure medical quality in hospitals, from assessing wait times in emergency departments and noise levels outside hospital rooms to tracking blood clots in surgical patients. But the latest effort, to combine dozens of metrics into one patient-friendly quality indicator, has proven the most contentious.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently postponed its plan to release the new rating system, which would award one star to the worst-quality facilities and five stars to those with the best marks. The delay came after a majority of members of Congress signed a letter supporting the hospital industry\u2019s concerns.\n\nHospital leaders who previewed the preliminary rating system say the formula is skewed against institutions that treat the poorest or toughest patients, meaning those with complex illnesses. The number of stars would be based on 64 different measures, which CMS has posted on Medicare\u2019s Hospital Compare website. The metrics on mortality, readmission, patient experience and patient safety are the most influential, each representing 22 percent of a facility\u2019s rating.\n\n[How hospitals hope to boost ratings on Yelp, HealthGrades, ZocDoc and Vitals]\n\nSteven Lipstein, president of BJC HealthCare, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that runs 14 hospitals, said the ones in his organization that initially earned five stars were smaller, located in affluent areas and handled less complicated cases. \u201cThey don\u2019t have comprehensive cancer centers, they don\u2019t have major cardiovascular disease, they don\u2019t have neuro-specialties,\u201d he said.\n\nBJC\u2019s more advanced hospitals did worse, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising when you look inside the ratings and see how they\u2019re built,\u201d he added.\n\nConsumer advocates defend the rating system, saying that while not perfect, it correctly reflects higher rates of problems in some big institutions despite their lofty reputations. They worry that delay and congressional resistance are undermining Medicare\u2019s attempt to help consumers select a hospital based on something more substantive.\n\n[The most unexpected hospital billing development ever: Refunds]\n\n\u201cThe star ratings hopefully will get quality into that decision-making process,\u201d said Andrew Scholnick, a lobbyist for AARP, the advocacy group for seniors.\n\nMedicare officials first said they wanted to make the results public in July. But in a presentation to hospitals and other interested parties last Thursday, they did not set a firm date.\n\nMedicare has already made minor tweaks in the formula to calculate the stars. Yet it remains a tough grader, the presentation shows. Were the ratings posted in July, nearly half of the 3,658 hospitals being evaluated would get three stars, according to the program\u2019s preliminary calculations. Just 100 hospitals would receive five stars, while 135 would receive a single star.\n\nOfficials indicated that they still intend to release the scores at some point. \u201cThe Overall Star Rating represents a performance summary designed to facilitate patient and consumer use of Hospital Compare,\u201d the presentation noted. They plan to update the scores every three months through the end of this year and then twice annually thereafter.\n\n[You can now look up ER wait times, hospital noise levels and nursing home fines on Yelp]\n\nThe broader debate about the government judging hospitals has been going on since Medicare began publishing quality ratings in 2005. But it has intensified since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, which instructed the program to use quality metrics in setting payments.\n\nTeaching hospitals as a group have tended to fare poorly through some of the financial incentives. This year, for instance, nearly half of major teaching hospitals are losing 1 percent of their Medicare payments because of high rates of infections and surgical complications. Facilities with more low-income patients, who often face difficulties affording medication, following complicated recovery instructions and getting to doctors regularly, typically have higher readmission rates.\n\nSome health care researchers are also skeptical. \u201cIf you come out with a rating that says Cleveland Clinic is terrible but podunk hospital in North Carolina, they\u2019re the bomb, there\u2019s a disconnect,\u201d said Ashish K. Jha, a professor at Harvard\u2019s public health school. \u201cIf it completely contradicts everything you\u2019ve known, you need to ask yourself, \u2018Did I not understand the way hospital care works, or is there a problem with the metric?\u2019\u201d\n\nMedicare\u2019s move toward using star ratings is part of a greater focus on easy-to-grasp composite judgments of hospital quality. The Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit patient safety group, uses report-card letter grades to characterize hospital safety based on many of the same individual measures as Medicare. Healthgrades, a Denver-based company, judges hospital quality with one, three or five stars. Consumer Reports calculates a safety score on a 100-point scale.\n\nMedicare hopes a star rating from the government will carry even more credibility.\n\n\u201cPeople need this information now,\u201d Scholnick said. \u201cTrying to wait until everyone\u2019s 100 percent happy with everything just delays it further than it needs to be.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.
