Around 1 a.m., Hill staffers Heath Hall and Brett Thompson found themselves facing a serious challenge: They could not stomach another night of delivery pizza.\n\nWhat was worse, they grumbled, they couldn\u2019t think of a single spot offering decent barbecue in the entire Washington, D.C., area.\n\nFor Kansas City native Heath, and barbecue convert Brett\u2014the son of a man who was literally allergic to charcoal and made up for it by grilling his way through some 300 recipes in \u201cWeber\u2019s Big Book of Grilling\u201d as an adult\u2014enough was enough.\n\n\u201cThe Senate was debating pork barrel spending projects and earmarks, and we were debating dinner,\u201d Hall says. \u201cWe were talking about how we wished we had some barbecue. So we\u2019re thinking pork barrel spending, barbecue, and that\u2019s where the name came from.\u201d\n\nFast-forward nearly 10 years and Pork Barrel BBQ products are in over 8,000 stores in the U.S., Canada, Asia and Europe; there\u2019s a Pork Barrel restaurant in Alexandria, Va.; and, including that staff, they employ around 50 people. The brand is synonymous with first place finishes in barbecue competitions nationwide.\n\nHall, who speaks slowly and thoughtfully, a slight drawl hinting at his Southern-Midwest roots, contemplates this boom with the laid-back approach of someone deciding what to order off a lunch menu: \u201cWhen we started putting together our first product, we thought \u2018Oh, this will be small and fun and for our friends maybe.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe laughs, at both their naivet\u00e9 and the whirlwind success they never could have expected, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy.\u201d\n\nThe Kitchen Cabinet\n\nAfter that late night in 2006, the friends, both lawyers, sat on the idea for another year and a half. Meanwhile, their former boss, Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., lost his bid for re-election.\n\nHall and Thompson left the Senate, landing day jobs elsewhere and remaining friends. They found themselves with considerably more free time, and decided the business idea was worth a real shot, even if it was during the height of the Great Recession.\n\nThey started by having friends over to Hall\u2019s house to taste-test their first item, a spice rub. They called the tribunal the \u201cKitchen Cabinet,\u201d a nod to their time on the Hill.\n\n\u201cHeath is this amazing creative talent with food,\u201d Thompson says of his friend, who has no formal culinary training. \u201cYou always wanted to get invited over to Heath\u2019s house. The funny thing was, he often would have nothing planned but you\u2019d go over and he\u2019d take what he had and create these amazing tasting things.\u201d\n\nBased on feedback from their friends, they honed in on a blend of roughly 14 spices and herbs, things like ancho chile powder and garlic, and created what\u2019s now known as the Pork Barrel \u201cAll American Spice Rub.\u201d (It generates an impressive five-star rating on Amazon.)\n\nThey discovered their skill sets were perfectly complementary (\u201cWe joke Heath likes to make food, and I like to make money,\u201d Thompson says), as well as the steep learning curve that comes with food regulation and meeting necessary food handling and preparation standards.\n\n\u201cHad Heath and I not been so determined, it would have been easier to just not start the company,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThe Virginia Department of Agriculture sent us an inch and a half worth of regulations that had to be complied with in order to manufacture your own products. They essentially said that to make our product ourselves we would have to build onto our house a completely separate kitchen, even though we had all of the equipment necessary.\u201d\n\nThey decided to use a manufacturer in Petersburg, Va., and received their first batch of 2,000 jars of spice rub just after Thanksgiving of 2008. Despite getting landed with barbecue products at the start of winter, they managed to sell a good amount of product to family and friends looking for holiday gifts.\n\nThey found a butcher in Alexandria that agreed to buy 12 jars, their biggest sale to date, after the owner admitted to understanding the troubles that can accompany launching a small business.\n\nAnd then they set their sights on grocery behemoths like Giant and Whole Foods.\n\n\u201cWe got the door slammed in our face,\u201d Hall says. \u201cIt was a lot of, \u2018We have a hundred different spice rubs. We don\u2019t need another one.\u2019\u201d\n\nDiscouraged and looking for a free way to market their product, they turned to social media. As it turned out, they were pretty good at it.\n\nSocial Climbers\n\n\u201cTwitter was still fairly new at that point,\u201d Hall says. \u201cWe built up our following to the point where we were the most followed brand in barbecue, more followed than, like, Kraft barbecue sauce.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, they got a call from Mark Burnett\u2019s casting department (\u201cThis was at the height of reality TV,\u201d Hall says. \u201c\u2018Survivor\u2019 and \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 were really hot.\u201d). The producers were developing a new show called \u201cShark Tank\u201d and had stumbled upon Pork Barrel\u2019s Twitter account. They thought the brand might be a good fit.\n\nBrett and Heath eagerly sent in an audition tape\u2014not content with anything standard or boring, their tape featured two members of Congress, a senator, news correspondent Tucker Carlson, and two chefs from \u201cTop Chef\u201d\u2014and were thrilled to find out they\u2019d made the cut.\n\nWhile they waited to fly out to LA to film, they began grilling in barbecue competitions, something they now do nearly every weekend during the summer. On a whim, before one in Washington, they developed and entered a barbecue sauce in the \u201cBest Sauce in America\u201d contest. Hall\u2019s kitchen skills shone again as the sauce wound up taking second place\u2014and generating a decent amount of press.\n\nMeanwhile, Virginia restaurant developers Mike Anderson and Bill Blackburn were looking to add a barbecue restaurant to their portfolio. It was something they\u2019d never tried, so they wanted to partner with barbecue industry experts to bring a little credibility and competition networking know-how to their venture. They heard about Pork Barrel and reached out.\n\n\u201cHeath and Brett are tremendous marketers,\u201d Blackburn says. \u201cThose guys, they\u2019re always looking for an angle, they\u2019re always looking for another way to get their product out there. Their social media and, kind of, guerrilla marketing tactics \u2026 that\u2019s what they do best.\u201d\n\nThe four men partnered and began developing the Pork Barrel BBQ restaurant that now sits on a corner in Alexandria, Va.\n\nAnd then Heath and Brett flew to California.\n\nGetting Grilled\n\nWatch Hall and Thompson\u2019s appearance on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d which can be found online, and you\u2019ll notice an enviable confidence and that laid-back swagger mentioned earlier. Even when \u201cshark\u201d Barbara Corcoran, the real estate mogul who wound up investing in the company, tells Hall he looks like he should be the company \u201cmascot,\u201d a pig, he laughs and smiles.\n\n\u201cI remember standing there on national television, and there\u2019s 20 cameras on you,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThis is when you know you\u2019ve chosen a great business partner. Barbara says that and, without missing a beat, Heath says, \u2018I guess I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u2019 Had Heath not handled that so well, I don\u2019t think we would have gotten the deal.\u201d\n\nThe deal, as presented on TV, was a $50,000 investment for 50 percent of the company\u2019s business. (If you\u2019re curious, Hall and Thompson say that getting a deal on \u201cShark Tank\u201d is really just an invitation to continue negotiations off-camera, to allow the sharks to do due diligence on the company. The exact specifics of the deal are unknown.)\n\n\u201cHeath and Brett looked the part,\u201d Corcoran says. \u201cThey looked and sounded like two guys who loved to barbecue \u2026 they had wild-eyed enthusiasm and seemed like they could have talked barbecue for days if we let them. They were rock solid in all their answers on set \u2026 the kind of guys who would not quit when the going got tough.\u201d\n\nHall and Thompson had to remain mum on the deal for several months, until the episode aired. And then the calls came flooding in.\n\n\u201cOvernight, we went from, let\u2019s say we were at Step B, overnight we were at Step H,\u201d Hall says. \u201cWithin three weeks of airing the show we were in Costco selling our products \u2026 within a year, we were in over 1,000 stores.\u201d\n\nCorcoran, the pair\u2019s biggest advocate, remains an active owner and adviser in Pork Barrel\u2019s success\u2014and is not without a sense of humor. Hall says he still regularly receives packages containing everything from pig costumes to pig potholders from the mogul.\n\nAfter Shark Tank\n\nSince appearing on \u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2009, Hall and Thompson have continued to grow their business.\n\n\u201cWe got to ring the closing bell at the NASDAQ, traveled all over the place, and within the barbecue world we\u2019re pretty well known,\u201d Hall says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge segment, but it\u2019s kind of pretty cool. And we get calls from entrepreneurs around the country asking us for advice on how to start a business and things like that.\u201d\n\nThey have generated over $10 million in sales, investing most of the profit right back into the company. And they continue to use the \u201cguerrilla-style\u201d marketing tactics Blackburn mentioned, developing \u201cCue Cologne,\u201d a barbecue scented gag gift for men, and giving out over 2,000 free sandwiches to government employees out of their restaurant during the government shutdown of 2013.\n\nHall has also testified before the House Small Business Committee on the dangers of overregulation and the necessity of small businesses to economic recovery.\n\nAs for the future of Pork Barrel, they hope to continue to expand and rack up accolades at grilling competitions. This year, for the first time, they made their way onto the shelves of Sam\u2019s Club, a big get for the budding company.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is to celebrate every victory,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThat victory could be completing the forms you have to send into the city for your license, or a little order. You\u2019re going to have successes and failures, and you have to just dust yourself off and get back to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heath Hall and Brett Thompson started Pork Barrel BBQ out of their homes in 2008.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Heath Hall and Brett Thompson started Pork Barrel BBQ out of their homes in 2008.", "title": "How Two Former Hill Staffers Launched $10 Million BBQ Business", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Brett-and-Heath.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T13:42:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GWoIrl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Heath Hall and Brett Thompson started Pork Barrel BBQ out of their homes in 2008.", "title": "How Two Former Hill Staffers Launched $10 Million BBQ Business", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Brett-and-Heath.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream,regulation,society", "published_time": "2015-06-21T03:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T13:42:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Pork Barrel BBQ, Heath Hall, Brett Thompson, Shark Tank, barbecue, barbecue sauce, spice rub"}, "article_summary": "Around 1 a.m., Hill staffers Heath Hall and Brett Thompson found themselves facing a serious challenge: They could not stomach another night of delivery pizza.\nAs for the future of Pork Barrel, they hope to continue to expand and rack up accolades at grilling competitions.\nMeanwhile, Virginia restaurant developers Mike Anderson and Bill Blackburn were looking to add a barbecue restaurant to their portfolio.\n\u201cThe Senate was debating pork barrel spending projects and earmarks, and we were debating dinner,\u201d Hall says.\nAfter Shark TankSince appearing on \u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2009, Hall and Thompson have continued to grow their business."}
