Another candidate, Marco Rubio, seemed open to libertarian ideas on immigration, as indicated by his participation in the Gang of 8 proposal for immigration reform.\n\nBut the longer this campaign has gone on, the more the strains of the relationship have been revealed. The public didn\u2019t take to Rand Paul any more than it did to his father \u2013 who was on the losing end of more 400-vote margins than anyone in the history of the House of Representatives.\n\nRubio has crawfished from his earlier immigration activism, and the two leaders on the Republican side now both advocate building a wall and deporting the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally now.\n\nTension between conservatives and libertarians on immigration is nothing new. But in the last year, that tension has spread to an area in which libertarians and conservatives traditionally have gotten along \u2013 energy and environment policy.\n\nBoth recognized the problems a hyperactive regulatory state could cause for the environment and the economy. They joined forces to fight regulatory overreach, spurious scientific claims by the green grant-seeking community and the crackpot conspiracy theories of the left.\n\nBut in recent months, the Niskanen Center, a libertarian group, has begun to make noise on the other side of the issue. Jay Faison, the North Carolina businessman who helps fund Niskanen, announced recently he will put up $175 million to try to forge a \u201cconservative solution\u201d to global warming.\n\nFaison wants to use social media, an online advertising blitz, state and national digital advocacy efforts and a series of strategic grants through the ClearPath Foundation, which he created, to push the effort.\n\nJust as there long have been advocates on the right for more open borders, there have always been some on the right who wanted to seek accommodation on this issue. They fear winding up on the wrong side of scientific consensus, and they see suburban votes in pressing for a green environment.\n\nBut Niskanen seems intent on taking this in a whole other direction. It has taken to bringing on former aides to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., among the most irresponsible members of Congress when it comes to climate rhetoric. Whitehouse has called for using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO statute \u2013 designed to prosecute drug and organized crime kingpins \u2013 to go after those who don\u2019t buy his story on global warming.\n\nWhitehouse has compared fossil fuel industries to the tobacco and lead paint industries in that the major players knew the harm their products caused but colluded to keep the dangers out of the public eye. He wants Salem witch trials for global warming skeptics and said indicting them under RICO would be no different than indictments handed down against tobacco executives a decade ago. Indictments that went nowhere.\n\nThe entire body of proof of this great conspiracy Whitehouse posits comes down to one sentence in one memo written in support of a PR campaign by the coal industry that did not even end up occurring. The sentence cited the need to \u201creposition global warming as theory rather than fact.\u201d\n\nA whole cottage industry of enviro-crazies has sprung up around that quote \u2013 which was about PR strategy; not the kind of scientific dissembling found so often on the green left. Al Gore sites the quote. So does Naomi Oreskes, the \u201cscientific historian\u201d who carries so much water for the global warming cult. So does George Monbiot, the Union of Concerned Scientists and others. Robert Brulle, an academic from Pennsylvania, has promoted this yarn for years.\n\nBeyond that, books have been written, accusations leveled, careers, funding and even liberty threatened. And now a sitting U.S. senator wants to throw people in prison for decades because they do not share his fantasies about imminent destruction from global warming.\n\nAll because of a supposed conspiracy of which most observers can find little evidence.\n\nRussell Cook, who has followed closely the accusations of conspiracy, said they all go back to a global warming alarmist named Ross Gelbspan. Cook said there is \u201cno independent corroboration of the accusation\u201d of a conspiracy and that Gelbspan\u2019s claims are \u201cdevoid of evidence proving industry money corrupted skeptic climate scientists to lie and knowingly fabricate false reports.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for conservatives and libertarians to stand together \u2013 the conservatives to fight for pro-growth energy policies; libertarians to fight for the right of people to use their resources as they see fit.\n\nIt certainly is no time to bring in loonies from Camp Whitehouse and cut a deal. And anyone who tries to do so is missing the point and needlessly threatening one of Washington\u2019s most productive and beneficial alliances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This time a year ago, there was talk conservatives and libertarians finally might be ready to truly join forces on an agenda to win the 2016 elections and govern as principled believers in limited government..05/26/2016 23:52:02PM EST.", "author": "Brian McNicoll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "This time a year ago, there was talk conservatives and libertarians finally might be ready to truly join forces on an agenda to win the 2016 elections and govern as principled believers in limited government.", "title": "Brian McNicoll - Sheldon Whitehouse, Libertarians and Climate Change", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/brianmcnicoll/2016/03/07/sheldon-whitehouse-libertarians-and-climate-change-n2129823", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/25/11.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "This time a year ago, there was talk conservatives and libertarians finally might be ready to truly join forces on an agenda to win the 2016 elections and govern as principled believers in limited government.", "title": "Brian McNicoll - Sheldon Whitehouse, Libertarians and Climate Change", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/brianmcnicoll/2016/03/07/sheldon-whitehouse-libertarians-and-climate-change-n2129823", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/25/11.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Sheldon Whitehouse, Libertarians and Climate Change, Brian McNicoll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It has taken to bringing on former aides to Sen.
