The former inmate, Alexandria Gregg, is seeking class action status for a lawsuit that alleges the warden practiced sexual shaming against her and other female inmates. Via the Garden Island:\n\n\u201cDuring open public meetings of male and female detainees in front of KCCC staff members, defendant Wagatsuma repeatedly forced plaintiff and other class members to stand at a podium and speak about their private, intimate and traumatizing sexual experience,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cWagatsuma asked plaintiff what kind of drugs she used, whether she had sex while on drugs, and how many partners plaintiff previously had sex relations with.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt claims that the warden ordered Gregg to elaborate on previous incidents of rape as well as sexual preferences. The public questionings were videotaped by male detainees, the suit states, while Gregg and other alleged victims were instructed to stand at the podium during the \u201cpublic shamings.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDefendant Wagatsuma would often film these public sexual shamings. Typically, the detainees selected for filming were young attractive women,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\n\n\nAt one point, a male detainee asked Gregg questions about whether she enjoyed certain sexual acts, which the warden did nothing to stop, the suit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit claims other jail employees didn\u2019t respond to complains about the shaming out of fear of retribution. Hawaii doesn\u2019t have county jail facilities. Kauai houses both male and female inmates, and touts, among other services, its \u201csubstance abuse treatment\u201d as well as a \u201cLifetime Stand Program\u201d which it describes as \u201ca structured, paramilitary regimen of marching, drill exercises, physical training, education, and community outreach.\u201d Corrections officers, saving the world.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In Hawaii", "title": "Jailhouse Sexual Shaming Alleged in Lawsuit", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/10/jailhouse-sexual-shaming-alleged-in-laws", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13920523302196.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former female inmate at the Kauai Community\nCorrectional&nbsp;Center in Hawaii is suing the state\u2019s department\nof public safety and Neal Wagatsuma, the warden at Kauai.
