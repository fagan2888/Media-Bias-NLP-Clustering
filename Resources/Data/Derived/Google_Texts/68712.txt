The family of a murdered Oklahoma City man spoke out Monday as police continued searching for a killer. Rayvon Lee, 22, was shot Friday night outside the Willow Cliff Apartments in northwest Oklahoma City.

Police found Rayvon in pool of blood near the entrance of the complex, where family members said their loved one was scheduled to start a new job Monday.

Hours after the squad cars pulled out and crime scene tape went away, Rayvon's mother, Carol Lee, received a knock on her door from Oklahoma City homicide detectives.

"After that I just lost it," said Carol. "I wasn't able to talk to [the detectives] any further … For the most part I know that he was a good kid, and I know that my son did not deserve to be shot and left for dead in a puddle of blood."

Three days after the killing, police were still searching for a suspect. As of late Monday, detectives said they have not been getting solid information from people living in the area -- frustrating family members who are desperate for answers.

"This family will not have any peace until I know what happened to my son," Carol said. "I need to know what happened to my son."

According to court records, Rayvon Lee is no stranger to police -- but overall -- his mom said he was a good son, a loving father and caring brother. She believes her son knew people at the Willow Cliff Apartments where residents told News 9 Saturday hardcore crime is nothing new. The violence is something the Lee family and many others are praying will soon end.

"Live your life, and don't take [life] … just treat people right," Rayvon Lee's sister told News 9.

Willow Cliff Apartment's parent company, Warren Properties, Inc., said it could not immediately find a record of Rayvon being hired at the complex.

Anyone with information on the case is urged to call Oklahoma City police at 405-297-1200.
