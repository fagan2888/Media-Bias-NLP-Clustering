Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD), who have announced an investigation into the staggering increases.\n\nAccording to the report, Valeant and drug manufacturer Hospira have refused a request Cummings and Sanders submitted in early September, asking the pharmaceutical giants to turn over a number of documents that would explain the massive price hikes. This refusal led the representatives to send a letter on Sept. 28 to the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requesting a subpoena that would force Valeant to turn over documents tied to the price hikes.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is critical to hold drug companies to account when they engage in \u2018a business strategy of buying old neglected drugs and turning them into high-price \u2018specialty drugs,'\u201d wrote the Dems in the letter, which sites a Wall Street Journal article that illustrates Valeant\u2019s drug price increases.\n\n\u201cValeant is using precisely the same business model as Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager whose company recently purchased the lifesaving drug Daraprim and increased the price from $13.50 to $750 per pill.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on to explain that Valeant purchased the rights to sell Nitropress, a drug used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertensive episodes, along with Isuprel, which is used to treat heart block and abnormal heart rhythm, in February. The same day, the drug company imposed the massive price hikes on these drugs.\n\nWhen asked about the enormous increases, a Valeant spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal the company\u2019s \u201cduty is to our shareholders\u201d and its main purpose is \u201cto maximize the value\u201d of the drugs it sells.\n\nIn the letter, Sanders and Cummings have asked the committee to subpoena the requested documents and also requested that the CEO of Valeant be asked to testify next week, along with Mr. Shkreli.\n\n\u201cBoth appear to be engaging in the same business model of acquiring potentially life-saving drugs to maximize their own corporate profits.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton has also launched a variety of attacks on Big Pharma, including condemning the industry\u2019s recent round of price hikes, her health care strategy is much different than Sanders,\u2019 Time reported.\n\n\u201cClinton has made the defense of Obamacare a key platform of her campaign, vocally supporting the Affordable Care Act and strongly criticizing Republicans for their calls to repeal it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Bernie Sanders is offering voters another plan to deal with drug price hikes that supports a single-payer system similar to those that have already been adopted in Western Europe and Canada, comparing what we pay while speaking to an audience in New Hampshire on Sept. 20.\n\n\u201cToday, Americans pay, by far, the highest prices for prescription drugs anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful has made it clear that he views health care as a human right and, although he and Clinton both voted for the Affordable Care Act, Sanders thinks the legislation has made little progress so far beyond paving the first steps toward universal coverage.\n\nSanders has also introduced new legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to obtain lower prices for prescription drugs, and he supports loosening some restrictions on importing drugs from Canada, where they are available for much less than in the U.S.\n\n[Photos by Phil Walter / Joe Raedle / Scott Olson / Staff / Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent controversy over massive price hikes by pharmaceutical companies on prescription drugs has not stopped Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals from", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The recent controversy over massive price hikes by pharmaceutical companies on prescription drugs has not stopped Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals from", "title": "Big Pharma Price Hikes Could Lead To A Congressional Subpoena", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2470527/big-pharma-price-hikes-could-lead-to-a-congressional-subpoena/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Price-hikes-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T20:09:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-04T22:55:55+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Price-hikes-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-10-04T20:09:13+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "big pharma,economic justice,elections and politics,global health,healthcare,healthcare reform,money,pharmaceutical companies,price hikes,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Price-hikes-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The recent controversy over massive price hikes by pharmaceutical companies on prescription drugs has not stopped Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals from"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83df\"", "article_summary": "The same day, the drug company imposed the massive price hikes on these drugs.\nThe recent controversy over massive price hikes by pharmaceutical companies on prescription drugs has not stopped Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals from raising the price of two lifesaving heart drugs by a combined total of more than 735 percent this year, reported CBC News.\nIn the letter, Sanders and Cummings have asked the committee to subpoena the requested documents and also requested that the CEO of Valeant be asked to testify next week, along with Mr. Shkreli.\nThis refusal led the representatives to send a letter on Sept. 28 to the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requesting a subpoena that would force Valeant to turn over documents tied to the price hikes.\nAccording to the report, Valeant and drug manufacturer Hospira have refused a request Cummings and Sanders submitted in early September, asking the pharmaceutical giants to turn over a number of documents that would explain the massive price hikes."}
