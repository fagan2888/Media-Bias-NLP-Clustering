Also, Medicare doctors and hospitals that administer drugs \u2014 many of which are injections, rather than pills \u2014 are compensated for the average sales price of a drug, plus an additional 6 percent.\n\nIn the first phase of the test change, Medicare Part B\u2019s drug payment would move to a flat fee of $16.80 per day, per person, and would cut the additional payment from 6 percent to about 2.5 percent.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s proposed rule \u201camounts to another significant Medicare payment cut, on top of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare payment cuts already authorized by the Affordable Care Act, as well as the 2 percent Medicare cut authorized by the Budget Control Act,\u201d Moffit said.\n\nThe rule is particularly alarming for cancer patients and for patients in rural areas who depend on local providers to administer their cancer drugs, he said.\n\n\u201c[I]t will threaten access to patient care in Medicare Part B, particularly for already beleaguered cancer patients, just as Obamacare\u2019s projected payment cuts will certainly \u2018jeopardize\u2019 access to patient care in Medicare Part A, as Medicare\u2019s own Office of the Actuary has repeatedly warned,\u201d he asserts.\n\n\u201cThis program has selected zip codes from Primary Care Service Areas,\u201d says anesthesiologist Marilyn M. Singleton. \u201cIt is unclear where these areas are located. Patients will have no choice as to whether they are included in a test area,\u201d she told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cMost of the drugs involved are cancer treatments and ophthalmologic treatment to prevent blindness,\u201d said Singleton, a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. \u201cThese are areas where none of us want to cut corners.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the rule could provide another incentive for doctors to drop Medicare patients.\n\nMedicare payments to providers are already lower than private payments, so the new rule will be especially damaging to small-practice doctors who have attempted to avoid joining the multi-doctor practices which have become more common under Obamacare.\n\nSmall cancer-focused practices already plummeted from 64 percent in 2014 to 41 percent in 2015 of cancer-treating doctor\u2019s offices, reports the American Cancer Society.\n\nMoffit warns:\n\nWhile the proposed rule could encourage doctors to use more effective but less expensive drugs, it could also encourage doctors to use less expensive but also less effective drugs. In any case, payment reductions will hurt smaller practices the most, encouraging patients to seek hospital-based therapy. A shift of patients from less expensive physicians\u2019 offices to more expensive hospital outpatient providers would be another classic \u201cunintended\u201d consequence, hurting patients and taxpayers alike.\n\nSingleton explains how the Obama administration rule would further destroy individualized medicine:\n\nCMS will offer physicians \u201cevidence-based\u201d tools to change their prescribing patterns. The stated goal is to \u201cpay for what works for patients.\u201d But the first rule of medical practice is to treat each patient as an individual. \u201cOne-size-fits-all\u201d soon morphs into \u201cone-size-fits-none.\u201d Moreover, if a patient believes their Medi-Gap policy will cover a drug the physician (but not Medicare) chooses, they may discover that the policy will only cover drugs authorized by Medicare. If outlying smaller physicians\u2019 offices stop administering such drugs, the patient will then go to the hospital where the drug is more expensive, thus saving no money for the government and increasing the inconvenience for the patient.\n\n\u201cIn short, beneficiaries get less choice and potentially lower quality,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH), the Medicare regulatory change may lead to \u201cnegative consequences\u201d for older Americans on Medicare:\n\nIn summary, the FAH has very serious concerns regarding this proposed Part B Drug Demo. While this proposal is intended to address concerns about high drug prices, its broad scope and design is unlikely to lead to the intended results and may, in fact, have unintended negative consequences on Medicare beneficiaries as well as posing particular challenges to hospitals\u2026\n\nIn addition, FAH warns the proposed rule represents another overreach by the Obama administration, one that essentially comes down to \u201cpicking winners and losers in the hospital community\u201d:\n\nWe find nothing in the law or legislative history that supports such a delegation of authority, and in fact the limited legislative history on this provision indicates the exact opposite. Notably, nowhere does the law expressly state that CMS can make models mandatory.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee is considering legislation to block the proposed rule. During a subcommittee hearing on May 17, cancer specialist Dr. Debra Patt testified:\n\nThe \u201cPart B Drug Payment Model,\u201d which is aimed at reducing Medicare drug spending is ill-conceived and, most importantly, lacks a patient-centered focus. I am disappointed that CMS has masked their efforts to control rising drug costs by suggesting physicians are not providing their patients with the most appropriate, highest quality medical care but instead prescribe more expensive drugs for \u201cprofit.\u201d CMS is absolutely incorrect in its assumptions that reducing reimbursements for Part B drugs will both lower Medicare costs and drug prices. In fact, looking at the oncology landscape documents that the reimbursement cuts proposed by CMS in Phase 1 of the \u201cPart B Drug Payment Model\u201d will actually increase Medicare costs and further fuel drug prices\u2014the exact opposite of what CMS intends.\n\n\u201cMore fundamentally, CMS\u2019 proposal is an experiment on the care of seniors with cancer and other diseases that will hinder their access to life-saving/prolonging new treatment advances, such as the new immunotherapy that has former President Carter\u2019s cancer in remission,\u201d Patt asserted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Older Cancer Patients Threatened by Concealed Medicare Funding Cuts", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Older Cancer Patients Threatened by Concealed Medicare Funding Cuts", "title": "Older Cancer Patients Threatened by Concealed Medicare Funding Cuts - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_763297742944.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/23/cancer-obama-administrations-executive-rule-to-impact-medicare-cancer-patients/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Older Cancer Patients Threatened by Concealed Medicare Funding Cuts", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_763297742944.jpg", "title": "Older Cancer Patients Threatened by Concealed Medicare Funding Cuts - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "administrative state, cancer drugs, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, CMS, executive overreach, Medicare, Medicare Part B, Obama administration,Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,Cancer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Obama administration", "published_time": "2016-05-23T19:22:08-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Experts, however, say the pending Medicare rule will essentially amount to another Medicare funding cut that will likely discourage doctors from treating many Medicare patients.\nThe rule is particularly alarming for cancer patients and for patients in rural areas who depend on local providers to administer their cancer drugs, he said.\n\u201cThese are areas where none of us want to cut corners.\u201dAdditionally, the rule could provide another incentive for doctors to drop Medicare patients.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe rule will affect all Medicare Part B providers and nearly all Medicare drugs, explains Heritage Foundation healthcare policy fellow Robert Moffit at The Daily Signal.\nDuring a subcommittee hearing on May 17, cancer specialist Dr. Debra Patt testified:The \u201cPart B Drug Payment Model,\u201d which is aimed at reducing Medicare drug spending is ill-conceived and, most importantly, lacks a patient-centered focus."}
