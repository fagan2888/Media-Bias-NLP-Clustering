We stopped him from eating this roll of toilet paper. Reasons My Kid Is Crying by Greg Pembroke

Greg Pembroke’s book “Reasons My Kid Is Crying” grew out of photos that Pembroke posted online of his three-year-old having a tantrum, and why.

Parents the world over responded, sending in their own photos and the hilarious reasons why their kids lost it.

Pembroke’s website is updated with videos and photos of adorable tots screaming because “We told him his dinosaur is blue”, or “The postman didn’t have any mail for us today” or, as this gem on YouTube shows, “He found out he’s going to have another sister.”

Pembroke’s book similarly presents kids freaking out all over the world, and the inexplicable reasons why. For a preview, click through the slideshow.
