Her defense of Gawker and in particular Jezebel, which she has said she wrote with \u201csarcasm,\u201d couldn\u2019t have been done better by the site\u2019s worst enemy.\n\nThey report on media news, and I am a media-ist, so\u2026 it\u2019s where I\u2019ve gotta get my news. [\u2026] It\u2019s a web portal that celebrates the written word \u2014 and its sister site, Jezebel, is a place feminists can go to support one another, which we need in this modern world full of slut-shaming [\u2026] I think that you need a place to go and gather up the information that\u2019s important to your industry and then discuss it with other like-minded individuals. That\u2019s why the comments board is so important to me and why I\u2019ve made so many e-friends!\n\nAs Gawker has moved away from the sort of close, granular coverage of minor media figures that made it famous at first, it\u2019s honed in on bigger game \u2014 like Dunham herself, whose book proposal was both reported on and mockingly picked apart by an older male editor on Gawker. The \u201clike-minded individuals\u201d remark in particular is impossible to separate from the commenters who disdained Dunham\u2019s book proposal and attached $3.7 million paycheck.\n\nAs for Jezebel\u2019s role in preventing slut-shaming and endorsing feminist ideals, the website\u2019s recent bounty on unretouched photos from Dunham\u2019s spread in Vogue could go either way depending on one\u2019s point of view, but Dunham herself called it \u201cfaux altruism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lena Dunham doesn't like online \"snark\" -- but her character Hannah Horvath loves it!", "title": "\u201cGirls\u201d sharply parodies Gawker and Jezebel", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lena Dunham doesn't like online \"snark\" -- but her character Hannah Horvath loves it!", "title": "\u201cGirls\u201d sharply parodies Gawker and Jezebel", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/27/girls_sharply_parodies_gawker_and_jezebel/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/girls5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lena Dunham doesn't like online \"snark\" -- but her character Hannah Horvath loves it!", "title": "\u201cGirls\u201d sharply parodies Gawker and Jezebel", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/girls5.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gawker, gawker media, Girls, Jezebel, Lena Dunham", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Gawker, gawker media, Girls, Jezebel, Lena Dunham, Entertainment NewsOn tonight\u2019s episode of \u201cGirls,\u201d Lena Dunham revealed that she has at least one thing in common with her fellow HBO creative Aaron Sorkin \u2014 a healthy disdain for those who live their lives critiquing others on the Internet, including \u201cGirls\u201d protagonist Hannah Horvath.\nHer defense of Gawker and in particular Jezebel, which she has said she wrote with \u201csarcasm,\u201d couldn\u2019t have been done better by the site\u2019s worst enemy.\nThey report on media news, and I am a media-ist, so\u2026 it\u2019s where I\u2019ve gotta get my news.\nThat\u2019s why the comments board is so important to me and why I\u2019ve made so many e-friends!\nThe \u201clike-minded individuals\u201d remark in particular is impossible to separate from the commenters who disdained Dunham\u2019s book proposal and attached $3.7 million paycheck."}
