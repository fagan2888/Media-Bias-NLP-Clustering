For those that have, the implications became apparent immediately, with Medicaid and Medicaid managed care revenue increasing nearly 6 percent (from 11.44 percent to 17.33 percent) from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014. This increase was offset in large part by the decrease in self-pay and commercial/managed care revenue \u2013 by 4.14 percent and 1.56 percent, respectively. Medicaid Expansion Effects on Uncompensated Care\n\nWhen assessing uncompensated care in between 2013 and 2014, a large variance exists between providers in expansion states and those in nonexpansion states. While bad debt and charity write-offs remained flat in nonexpansion states, in expansion states bad debt increased subtly (from 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent), and charity write-offs decreased dramatically (from 3.2 percent to 1.7 percent). Nonexpansion Effects in the Marketplace\n\nOutside of Medicaid expansion, the healthcare industry also has been affected by the continued adoption of high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and a rise in insured patients' responsibility. Further cost shifting within benefit plan designs, as well as the adoption of health insurance exchanges, has increased the healthcare consumer's financial responsibility. As such, more patient care appears to be shifting to lower-cost settings, including moving from hospital admissions to outpatient care.\n\n\"The increase in HDHPs has caused providers to take a closer look at self-pay after insurance collections and has increased the need to address patient collections and point-of-service collections,\" said Bang. \"Also, the data clearly shows the impact HDHPs are having on hospitals, where patients are encouraged to shop around for better pricing and use fewer hospital services.\"\n\nAbout the Crowe RCA Benchmarking Analysis\n\nThe Crowe RCA Benchmarking Analysis includes 326 distinct hospitals classified as acute-care facilities, critical-access facilities, or rehabilitation, psychiatric or cardiovascular clinics.
