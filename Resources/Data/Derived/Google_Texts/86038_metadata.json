The hottest summer on record, they said, with Midwest cornfields burnt crisp and the whole West aflame, a summer when the last thing a card-carrying environmentalist would want to be caught dead doing was going on a nine-thousand-mile road trip through those parched lands.\n\nI was going anyway. For almost a decade I had dreamed of getting back out West, where I had lived during my early and mid-thirties, and as it happened the summer I picked was the one when the region caught fire. Just like today drought was the word on everyone\u2019s dry lips, and there was another phrase too\u2014\u201cthe new normal\u201d\u2014that scientists applied to what was happening, the implication being that this sort of weather would be sticking around for a while. Though I hadn\u2019t planned it that way, I would be driving out of the frying pan of my new home in North Carolina and into the fire of the American West. In Carolina, I had been studying the way hurricanes wracked the coast, but now I would be studying something different. Though my hurricane-magnet hometown\u2019s problem was too much water, not too little, I had the sense these things were connected.\n\nI loved the West when I lived there, finding it beautiful and inspiring in the way so many others have before me, and at the time I thought I might live there for the rest of my life. But circumstances, and jobs, led me elsewhere. It nagged me that the years were passing and I was spending them on the wrong side of the Mississippi. But I followed the region from afar, the way you might your hometown football team, and the news I heard was not good. A unique land had become less so, due to an influx of people that surpassed even the Sunbelt\u2019s. The cries of \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill!\u201d might be loudest in the Dakotas, but they echoed throughout the West. The country\u2019s great release valve suddenly seemed a place one might long to be released from. And now the fires, biblical fires, wild and unchecked, were swallowing up acreage comparable to whole eastern states.\n\nIt was a summer much like this summer promises to be, with historically low snowpacks, in the Sierras this time, not the Rockies, and early fires. And though there would be no one else in the car with me, I was not traveling alone. Along with my atlases and gazetteers, I carried a box filled with a couple dozen books. Over the previous year, knowing I would be returning to the West, I had also returned to the two writers who had helped me make sense of the region. When I mentioned the names of these writers in the East, I sometimes got befuddled looks. More than once I had been asked: \u201cWallace Stevens? Edward Albee?\u201d No, I would patiently explain. Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey.\n\nIt was kind of funny, really. Stegner and Abbey were both so firmly entrenched in the pantheon of writers of the American West that if the region had a literary Mount Rushmore their faces would be chiseled on it. But back east their names, as often as not, elicited puzzlement. When this happened, I would always rush to their defense. Wallace Stegner, I would explain, won the Pulitzer Prize for one novel and the National Book Award for the next, and singlehandedly corrected many of the facile myths about the American West, myths we still cling to today, earning him the role of intellectual godfather, not just of the region but of generations of environmental writers. As for Ed Abbey, I would say, he wrote a novel that sparked an entire environmental movement\u2014have you heard of monkeywrenching or Earth first!?\u2013and another that some consider the closest thing to a modern Walden, a book that many describe as life-changing.\n\nWhat I came to believe over the course of the year, and what I suspected all along if I am honest, is that Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey, far from being regional or outdated, have never been more relevant. What I came to believe is that, in this overheated and overcrowded world, their books can serve as guides, as surely as any gazetteer, and as maps, as surely as any atlas. It was thrilling, really, if you are allowed to use that word for reading. To see that as far back as fifty years ago Stegner and Abbey were predicting, facing, digesting, and wrestling with the problems that we now think uniquely our own.\n\nStegner in particular was a master of playing the child\u2019s game of connecting the dots on a large scale. He understood that the first two dots to connect were geography and climate, and that Americans had treated a place that was desert like anything but, importing their wetland habits into the dry West. He saw the West as clearly distinct from the East due to its aridity and vulnerability to human incursion, but also because the land could be so hostile to those who tried to settle it. Many of his ideas grew directly out of his own childhood, a childhood spent migrating from the Dakotas to Washington state to a frontier homestead in Saskatchewan and then down through Montana before landing in Utah. The man driving the Stegner family\u2019s constant movement was his father, George, whose motivation was one well known in the West: he was looking to strike it rich. His father embodied a type of Western character that Stegner would write about all his life, the \u201cboomer\u201d who searched for the quick strike whether in oil, gold, land, or tourism. In contrast to the boomer, Stegner idealized his mother as a \u201csticker,\u201d one who tried to settle, learn a place, and commit to it. From these latter qualities the writer built the platform from which he both wrote and preached: commitment to place, respect for wild and human communities, responsibility for and to the land. Having grown up with a man who was the classic Western \u201crugged individualist,\u201d Stegner spent a lifetime debunking that myth. And having spent a good deal of his youth in Utah, he was one of the few to see in Mormon culture an overlooked quality that made them one of the only communities to thrive in the West. That quality, surprisingly, was sharing. It\u2019s easy to laugh and note that this notion can get a little twisted when applied to, say, marriage, but it turned out that it worked quite well when it came to sustaining agriculture in what was, despite the insistence of many boomers, a desert. Stegner understood, and put forcefully, the fact that the West\u2019s greatest resource wasn\u2019t gold or oil or uranium or even land, but water. In 1920 drought drove his family from Saskatchewan, the place where the young Wally felt most at home, and he saw in his own past his region\u2019s future. He would have been saddened, but not surprised, by this summer\u2019s conflagrations. Nor would he be surprised that a dry place has become drier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In this overheated, overcrowded world, the books of these \"reluctant environmentalists\" can be our guides", "title": "Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey have never been more relevant in the drought-stricken West", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In this overheated, overcrowded world, the books of these \"reluctant environmentalists\" can be our guides", "title": "Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey have never been more relevant in the drought-stricken West", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/wallace_stegner_and_edward_abbey_have_never_been_more_relevant_in_the_drought_stricken_west/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/stegner_abbey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this overheated, overcrowded world, the books of these \"reluctant environmentalists\" can be our guides", "title": "Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey have never been more relevant in the drought-stricken West", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/stegner_abbey.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Gessner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Climate Change, Edward Abbey, Environmentalism, the west, Wallace Stegner, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Climate Change, Edward Abbey, Environmentalism, the west, Wallace Stegner, Writers and Writing, Sustainability News, Entertainment NewsIt was 2012, a summer of fires and fracking.\nWallace Stegner and Edward Abbey.\nWhat I came to believe over the course of the year, and what I suspected all along if I am honest, is that Wallace Stegner and Edward Abbey, far from being regional or outdated, have never been more relevant.\nTo see that as far back as fifty years ago Stegner and Abbey were predicting, facing, digesting, and wrestling with the problems that we now think uniquely our own.\nThe cries of \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill!\u201d might be loudest in the Dakotas, but they echoed throughout the West."}
