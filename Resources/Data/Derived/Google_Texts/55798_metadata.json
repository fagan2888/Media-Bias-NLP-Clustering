What is more, it can help soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to new research.\n\nSome of the most damaging consequences of seeing combat can happen in the mind. Of the 2.3 million American veterans who returned from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, up to 20 percent go on to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some point. In a report published by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, at least 22 American veterans take their lives every day.\n\nRelated: Four Military Veterans See Their Service in a New Light\n\nThe effects of PTSD can include intrusive memories, heightened anxiety and personality changes. Individuals can also experience hyper-arousal, where they are easily startled, feel \u201cjumpy\u201d and constantly on guard. Standard current treatment for PTSD generally involves prescriptions for antidepressants and psychotherapy, with mixed results.\n\nIn a new study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress, researchers say that yoga can be used to bring better mental balance. Yoga has previously been shown as valuable in reducing the stress of university students, and depression, anxiety, alcoholism and PTSD in tsunami survivors, as well as helping cancer patients. The charity Yoga for America runs programmes for serving soldiers and war veterans.\n\nAgnieszka Golec de Zavala, senior lecturer in psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, said the benefits of yoga included moving people away from negative thoughts. \"The beneficial effects are due to the increased ability to focus on breathing that, firstly, focuses a person on a present moment and breaks rumination on negative traumatic thoughts, and secondly, increases ability of \u2018intraception\u2019 \u2013 observing and understanding internal states and the ability to control them, or understanding them as temporal and passing.\"\n\nBut the new study is the first of its kind to provide scientific support for the benefits of yoga\u2019s breathing techniques for PTSD patients in a randomized and controlled (though small) long-term study, which monitored effects of yoga over the course of the year.\n\nRelated: Veterans Finally Catch a Break\n\nThe study focused on the effects of sudarshan kriya yoga, a practice of breathing-based meditation which has a balancing effect on the autonomic nervous system.\n\nTwenty-one male veterans who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan, diagnosed with PTSD, were included in the study: 11 undertook a seven-day program involving daily three-hour sessions of sudarshan kriya, including meditation, stretching and group discussion, while ten others didn\u2019t take part were used as a control group.\n\nThe soldiers' PTSD symptoms were assessed one week before the beginning of the program and then a week, a month and a year after its completion. Seven of the 11 involved in the active group continued practicing yoga after completing the program.\n\nThe study found that the group who had done yoga demonstrated fewer or less intense PTSD symptoms in comparison. Those who took part in the yoga sessions showed lower anxiety and lower respiration rates. They performed better in tests measuring eye-blink and breathing frequency in response to stimuli such as noise bursts, which are used to measure hyper-arousal and how well individuals are regulating emotions.\n\nRelated: D.C.

She emphasized, however, that like many other studies examining the benefits of yoga, this study is limited by the small study groups on which their results are based.\n\n\u201cMore studies are needed and such studies would be highly valuable regarding low costs of this form of treatment and the initial evidence suggesting its effectiveness,\u201d she added.\n\nRichard Davidson, professor of psychology and psychiatry at the UW-Madison and one of the authors of the study, said he hoped that that the study could be extended to more participants with wider demographic representation. If still promising, then doctors could prescribe yoga as treatment for patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder in the future.\n\n\"A clinician could use a \u2018tool box\u2019 of psychological assessments to determine the cognitive and emotional style of the patient, and thereby determine a treatment that would be most effective for that individual. Right now, a large fraction of individuals who are given any one type of therapy are not improving on that therapy. The only way we can improve that is if we determine which kinds of people will benefit most from different types of treatments.\"\n\nAnd one of those tools could be yoga.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
