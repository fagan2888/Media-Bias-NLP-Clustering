Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.\u201d That\u2019s how I feel about this time of year. I love the meaning of Christmas; I do not love what the celebration of Christmas has become. The celebration is so unlike the meaning.\n\nAs a theoretical physicist, I can\u2019t help but recognize in this important seasonal matter a parallel with quantum mechanics \u2013 specifically, with something called the complementarity principle. In a manner of speaking, it describes certain vexing trade-offs that characterize our relationship with the world generally, not just Christmas. An inevitable competition between pairs of measurements, concepts, phenomena \u2013 call them what you will \u2013 that forces us to choose between them.\n\nI could give you many specific examples of such dueling couples, but I\u2019ll settle for the one attributed to Niels Bohr, the famous Danish co-founder of quantum mechanics. \u201cTruth and clarity,\u201d he reportedly observed, \u201care complementary.\u201d\n\n\n\n[READ: What Would Jesus Do Today?]\n\nEntire books can and have been written on the subject \u2013 I myself am working on one right now. But simply put, Bohr's claim can be interpreted to mean this: The more diligently we seek out certain truths, the less clear things become; and the more faith is required to understand the truths. Conversely, the more stubbornly we insist on keeping things clear-cut and down-to-earth, the less likely we are to apprehend or even credit certain complex truths.\n\nThe same, I believe, can be said about the meaning and celebration of Christmas. The two are complementary. The two compete for our attention and favor.\n\nThe meaning of Christmas is like truth. The more you contemplate it, the more incredible it seems. A God who becomes flesh? In the form of a baby, born to poor parents? A God who loves us so much he\u2019s bent on offering us total and eternal amnesty? Those are truths that require more than just a little faith to believe.\n\nBut the celebration of Christmas is like clarity. The more you give yourself to it, the more it becomes about stuff that\u2019s easy to understand \u2013 decorations, gifts, parties, the list of revelries is long and getting longer. Not much faith is required in this department \u2013 just a whole lot of stamina and money.\n\nSo what are we Christians to do at this time of year?\n\n\n\n[READ: Christmas Compassion]\n\nWe could focus entirely on the meaning of Christmas and forget the celebration. In the mid-17th century, England\u2019s upstart Parliament did just that. As early as 1642, seven years before ordering the beheading of King Charles I, it set about passing laws that would make the feast of Christmas illegal. Why? Because celebrating Christmas was unbiblical \u2013 nowhere in Scripture do we see Christians partying over the Nativity. And because, to the straight-laced Puritans, Christmas was nothing but a takeover of Saturnalia, the pagan winter festival celebrated by the ancient Romans.\n\nOne pious Scrooge \u2013 Thomas Mockett, rector of Gilston in Hertfordshire \u2013 even complained that the ill-advised holiday hijacking had brought \u201call the heathenish customs and pagan rites and ceremonies that the idolatrous heathens used, as riotous drinking, health drinking, gluttony, luxury, wantonness, dancing, dicing, stage-plays, interludes, masks, mummeries, with all other pagan sports and profane practices into the Church of God.\u201d\n\nParliament\u2019s earnest efforts at banning Christmas celebrations didn\u2019t work out too well. Most people of the day ignored the injunctions and partied on \u2013 in many cases, harder than ever, just to spite the authorities. In 1660, with the Restoration, the anti-Christmas laws were declared null and void altogether; celebrating Christmas was once again officially sanctioned.\n\n\n\n[READ: Jesus Is Your Reset]\n\nFrom what I\u2019m able to tell, today\u2019s popular culture is the very antithesis of the aforementioned Parliament. Nowadays, it seems, it\u2019s all about banning the message of Christmas and playing up the celebration. Radio stations play so-called Christmas carols celebrating wintertime, jingle bells and Rudolf. Television networks air movies such as \"Deck the Halls,\" \"A Boyfriend for Christmas\" and \"Holiday in Handcuffs\" \u2013 which are all window-dressing (at best) and no meaning. And more recently, our tireless, clever friends on Madison Avenue who cooked up the lucrative idea of kicking off the Christmas season with Black Friday have treated us to a \u201cjump-start\u201d on Black Friday. Stores are now opening for business at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day! Black Friday has now turned into Black Friday week.\n\nSo, I repeat, what are Christians to do?\n\nMy family and I, for one, choose to avoid the two extremes. For us, the meaning of Christmas deserves to be celebrated. In fact, we can\u2019t see how anyone who truly understands it can help but leap for joy.To start with, we place magnetic bumper stickers on our two cars that depict the Nativity. Yes, I know it sounds corny; but it\u2019s a concise, sincere way for us to declare our faith publicly. Next, we do our best to be involved with our church\u2019s Christmas pageant. My wife loves singing in the choir, and I love listening to her. One year, my wife, son and I acted in our community theater\u2019s staging of Gian Carlo Menotti\u2019s one-act opera \"Amahl and the Night Visitors.\" What fun! My wife was a singing peasant, my son a dancing shepherd boy and I the slightly deaf King Kaspar.\n\n\n\nRelated Content Related Content Stuck on the Way to Equality We can learn from his encounter with the Samaritan woman.\n\nOf course, we decorate our house for Christmas. That\u2019s my joyful task and, truth be told, I used to go overboard. But now we\u2019ve banished Santa from our displays and replaced him with a beautiful, life-sized cr\u00e8che. We love listening to carols and watching movies. But we heavily favor the ones that really do celebrate the meaning of Christmas, not just its superficial ambiance. Finally, yes, we give gifts, but increasingly, not to each other. Our guide in the matter is the Biblical story of Christmas, in which the only gifts exchanged on that remarkable occasion were from the Magi to the Christ child.\n\nFor us today, that example means giving gifts to those in need. In doing so, we emulate simultaneously what the wise men did two millennia ago and hearken to the words of Jesus in Matthew 25:40: \"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\"\n\n\n\n[READ: Jesus Is Not the Reason for the Season]\n\nOne year, my son and I volunteered at the Variety Boys and Girls Club of East Los Angeles to hand out gifts to needy kids. Afterwards, I treated him to a simple lunch at a small, family-owned restaurant not far away from the club and close to where I was born and reared. That experience by itself made our Christmas!\n\nThis year, our family decided to sponsor four more children through the Compassion International program \u2013 bringing our total to five. Recently, we spent an afternoon sitting at the dining room table \u2013 with the fireplace lit and carols playing in the background \u2013 writing letters to \u201cour kids\u201d and sending them gifts. Afterwards, we drank hot chocolate and tried imagining how happy the kids would be when they received their presents \u2013 some basic necessities, plus a few fun items.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Christians Should Celebrate the True Christmas Meaning and Give to Others", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "At Christmas, celebrate the true meaning of God's gift through simple pleasures and helping those in need.", "title": "Finding the Heart of the Holiday", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/faith-matters/2014/12/25/christians-should-celebrate-the-true-christmas-meaning-and-give-to-others", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/30/8c/036cdaff4851baebfecb66267bef/141222-christmaslunch-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At Christmas, celebrate the true meaning of God's gift through simple pleasures and helping those in need.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Christians Should Celebrate the True Christmas Meaning and Give to Others"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Michael Guillen,religion,holidays,philanthropy,Christmas,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "At Christmas, celebrate the true meaning of God's gift through simple pleasures and helping those in need."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbbd\"", "article_summary": "I love the meaning of Christmas; I do not love what the celebration of Christmas has become.\nBut we heavily favor the ones that really do celebrate the meaning of Christmas, not just its superficial ambiance.\n[READ: Christmas Compassion]We could focus entirely on the meaning of Christmas and forget the celebration.\nThe same, I believe, can be said about the meaning and celebration of Christmas.\nThe meaning of Christmas is like truth."}
