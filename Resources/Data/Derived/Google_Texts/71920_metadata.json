The City Council should reshape it before passing the plan into law.\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s administration announced it wants to extend a two-year moratorium set to expire Jan. 1 that allows only existing medical marijuana businesses to open recreational dispensaries, grow houses or edible manufacturers. The plan would also freeze medical marijuana outlets.\n\nThe last part of this proposal certainly makes sense. The city should indeed suspend new licensing for medical marijuana outlets.\n\nOf the city\u2019s 212 marijuana storefronts, only 13 are retail-only. A total of 128 are combined medical and retail shops and 71 are medical-only. It had long been thought that retail pot would reduce the need for medical marijuana. That clearly hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe latest figures show 113,862 Coloradans have medical marijuana red cards, roughly 2,000 more than when retail marijuana was legalized in January 2014.\n\nAnd no wonder. Patients don\u2019t have to pay the special taxes imposed on retail pot and can purchase more of the product at one time.\n\nDenver has plenty of medical pot facilities to serve legitimate patients, but it\u2019s time to stop encouraging the growth of an industry that boomed before retail pot was born \u2014 especially given the scant medical evidence to support marijuana\u2019s use for all but a handful of maladies.\n\nThe process for obtaining red cards has been tightened but clearly is still subject to gamesmanship aided by a poorly written constitutional amendment.\n\nThe city, however, should allow new owners to set up retail shops and let competition and the market play out in that arena.\n\nDenver\u2019s rationale for extending the moratorium on retail is that the market could outgrow demand. Officials fear excess marijuana could drift into the black market or fall into the hands of young people. But that\u2019s an argument that can be marshaled indefinitely to impose an artificial quota and protect an oligopoly.\n\nThere is little data to back up these fears. And the data on the black market in particular are not likely to be any more definitive two years from now.\n\nIt\u2019s up to regulators, especially at the state level, to refine the system they promised to track marijuana grown commercially \u201cfrom seed to sale\u201d to ensure it isn\u2019t diverted illicitly.\n\nIt will be more difficult to open new retail shops after Jan. 1 anyway, since they will go through what\u2019s known as a \u201cneeds-and-desires\u201d licensing procedure.\n\nSimilar to alcohol licensing, the law says new businesses must gather signatures from neighbors to show the community welcomes a new establishment in their midst.\n\nThis step alone should put a brake on the excessive growth of pot shops.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver pot plan would go too far", "title": "Denver pot plan would go too far", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/13/denver-pot-plan-would-go-too-far/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151113__OP15MARIJUANAp1.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151113__OP15MARIJUANAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-13T16:58:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:45:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Patients don\u2019t have to pay the special taxes imposed on retail pot and can purchase more of the product at one time.\nThe latest figures show 113,862 Coloradans have medical marijuana red cards, roughly 2,000 more than when retail marijuana was legalized in January 2014.\nThis step alone should put a brake on the excessive growth of pot shops.\nIt had long been thought that retail pot would reduce the need for medical marijuana.\nThe plan would also freeze medical marijuana outlets."}
