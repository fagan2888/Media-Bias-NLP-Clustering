Part B covers doctors visits, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment and other items. The program charges certain higher-income beneficiaries, which represent less than 5% of the Medicare population, more than the standard Part B premium; these income-adjusted rates will also remain flat for 2015.\n\nMost beneficiaries pay no premiums for Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care. The Part A deductible that beneficiaries with original Medicare incur when admitted to the hospital will rise $44, to $1,260, in 2015.\n\nOver the past four years, per capita Medicare spending growth has averaged just 0.8% annually, versus a 3.1% annual increase in per capita gross domestic product over the same period, according to Health & Human Services. In a statement, Burwell attributed this slowed growth, and the stabilization of Part B premiums, to cost savings realized under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nExperts have cited other factors behind the slowdown in Medicare spending rates, including an influx of younger, relatively healthy boomers into the system.\n\nMedicare open enrollment runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. During this time, beneficiaries can choose a new Part D drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan, or switch from Medicare Advantage to original Medicare and vice versa.", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-10-09T16:26:29-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles will stay flat in 2015 for the third year in a row.", "title": "Medicare: 2015 \u2018Part B\u2019 prices won\u2019t rise", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/10/09/medicare-members-get-good-news-on-2015-prices/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV454_medica_MG_20141001165603.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Elizabeth O'Brien", "article.section": "Retirement", "keywords": "Health,health care,Medicare,Obamacare,retirement income", "article.headline": "Medicare: 2015 \u2018Part B\u2019 prices won\u2019t rise", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Health,health care,Medicare,Obamacare,retirement income", "author": "Elizabeth O", "article.page": "Encore Blog", "description": "Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles will stay flat in 2015 for the third year in a row.", "article.published": "2014-10-09T16:26:29-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/10/09/medicare-members-get-good-news-on-2015-prices/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles will stay flat in 2015 for the third year in a row.", "title": "Medicare: 2015 \u2018Part B\u2019 prices won\u2019t rise", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/10/09/medicare-members-get-good-news-on-2015-prices/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV454_medica_MG_20141001165603.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Encore", "article.id": "BL-235B-2327", "article.updated": "2014-10-09T16:28:37-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c42\"", "article_summary": "cms.govPrices for Medicare Part B coverage won\u2019t rise for 2015, according to an announcement today by Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services.\nExperts have cited other factors behind the slowdown in Medicare spending rates, including an influx of younger, relatively healthy boomers into the system.\nDuring this time, beneficiaries can choose a new Part D drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan, or switch from Medicare Advantage to original Medicare and vice versa.\nIn a statement, Burwell attributed this slowed growth, and the stabilization of Part B premiums, to cost savings realized under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Part A deductible that beneficiaries with original Medicare incur when admitted to the hospital will rise $44, to $1,260, in 2015."}
