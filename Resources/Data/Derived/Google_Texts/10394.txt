The phrase “take a hike” soon will have a literal meaning for patients of the Cleveland Clinic’s Twinsburg (Ohio) Family Health & Surgery Center.

The hospital is in the midst of creating a 1.4-mile walking trail through a wooded section of its 80-acre campus located about 25 miles outside of downtown Cleveland.

When completed this month, the wildlife-filled hiking trail is expected to give patients, members of the community and employees a hospital campus experience not easily found. “This property’s unique because of its size, and all of the different rock formations and wildflower areas we have,” says Mario Cammarata, administrative program coordinator in charge of grounds. “The rock formations are 10 to 15 feet high, and there are caverns to walk through,” he said. Geese, turkey and buzzards are among the wildlife that can be seen there.

The trail itself is being built in such a way as to minimize disruption of the natural area, and with no chemicals, including in the wood used for bridges, says Frank Monteleone, regional business development manager for Davey Tree Expert Co., which is working with the clinic to develop the trail.

And since the trail will sit on land designated as a wetland, the trail should be around for awhile, Cammarata says. “It’s a pretty primitive area; it’s never going to get touched.”
