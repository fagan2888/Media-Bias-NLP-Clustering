In an official statement, college administrators expressed concern over the \u201ctheological implications\u201d of her statements and promising a full review.\n\nFounded in 1860, Wheaton has long been considered a fairly open-minded institution within evangelicalism. Science professors can teach evolution, government professors need not support conservative political theories, and students don\u2019t have to worry about strict dress codes or stringent curfews like students at more fundamentalist colleges. In 2003, it eased bans on alcohol consumption and dancing.\n\nBut a string of politically charged events, culminating in Hawkins\u2019 suspension, place Wheaton at an important crossroads. The school must now decide what kind of evangelical college they wish to be.\n\nWheaton has been no stranger to political controversy in recent years. The college has experienced racial tension including an incident in March when football players wore KKK robes and carried confederate flags in a skit as part of a team building exercise. Last year, a group of feminist students on campus \u2014 some who are pro-choice \u2014 began speaking out about their views on gender equality. Also looming large: Controversies over contraception and homosexuality.\n\nWhen Obamacare mandated contraception coverage, the school sued the federal government to avoid providing emergency birth control. They eventually got an temporary exemption from the Supreme Court. In order to increase their chances of winning the lawsuit, Wheaton ceased providing healthcare for its students. A school official admitted that \u201cstudents have been hurt by the decision.\u201d\n\nWheaton\u2019s firm stance against homosexuality has led to it being named one of the least LGBT friendly colleges in the nation, even ranking as the #1 worst some years. The school created consternation within the student body when it invited a \u201cformer lesbian\u201d to speak about sexuality in chapel. A coalition of pro-LGBT alumni and students calling themselves \u201cOneWheaton\u201d has garnered some media attention in recent years, but the school has not wavered.\n\nSome progressives were pleased when Wheaton hired a \u201cgay Christian\u201d named Julie Rodgers. Even though Rodgers advocated celibacy for LGBT Christians at the time, it appeared like a shift for the school. But Rodgers\u2019 hire created controversy among some associated with Wheaton. In July, Rodgers announced that she now \u201csupported same-sex relationships\u201d and resigned her post in the school\u2019s chaplaincy office.\n\nAll of this brings us to Dr. Hawkins. She wrote in a Dec. 10 Facebook post, \u201cI stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God.\u201d\n\nThough it may not seem to be so at first glance, it\u2019s unclear what Hawkins means by \u201cworship the same God.\u201d Other conservative Christians of late have made similar arguments despite also believing that Muslims must accept Jesus in order to be \u201csaved.\u201d These Christians claim that Muslims, like Jews, are speaking truly but incompletely of the same God of Abraham that Christians worship.\n\nBecause of this nuance, Hawkins\u2019 statements about \u201ctheological unity\u201d with Muslims may or may not be a denial of the conservative Christian view that \u201cJesus Christ is the only way to heaven.\u201d If it turns out she still holds to evangelical doctrine as laid out in Wheaton\u2019s statement of faith, this could all blow over. If not, Hawkins\u2019 future at Wheaton may be in serious jeopardy.\n\nBut the political nature of this situation means there will be an impact to Wheaton\u2019s identity no matter what it decides.\n\nPeople of various interests will be elated or upset regardless. Yet the college must decide\u2014not just about Hawkins\u2019s future, but about its future also.\n\nWheaton students and faculty often brag that they are the \u201cHarvard of evangelicalism.\u201d Now the school must decide to what extent that is true.\n\nDoes it wish to welcome a wider range of students and faculty into its fold, like an Ivy League school would? Or will it choose to calcify commitments to political and theological conservatism on par with schools like Liberty University?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a moment when relations between Christians and Muslims are so strained, claiming that adherents of the two religions worship the same God can be controversial.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jonathan Merritt, Religion News Service", "og": {"site_name": "Sojourners", "description": "In a moment when relations between Christians and Muslims are so strained, claiming that adherents of the two religions worship the same God can be controversial.", "title": "Can Wheaton College Still Claim to Be the 'Harvard of Evangelicalism'?", "url": "https://sojo.net/articles/can-wheaton-college-still-claim-be-harvard-evangelicalism", "image": "https://sojo.net/sites/default/files/blog/Larycia2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-18T14:46:34-05:00", "type": "article"}, "abstract": "In a moment when relations between Christians and Muslims are so strained, claiming that adherents of the two religions worship the same God can be controversial.", "robots": "follow, index", "fb": {"admins": "bob.sabath", "app_id": 340008959366108}, "keywords": "wheaton college, Larycia Hawkins, wheaton, evangelicalism, hijab, muslim-christian relations, Interfaith", "article": {"tag": "Interfaith", "published_time": "2015-12-18T14:46:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T14:46:34-05:00"}, "original-source": "https://sojo.net/articles/can-wheaton-college-still-claim-be-harvard-evangelicalism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "wheaton college, Larycia Hawkins, wheaton, evangelicalism, hijab, muslim-christian relations, Interfaith"}, "article_summary": "Wheaton students and faculty often brag that they are the \u201cHarvard of evangelicalism.\u201d Now the school must decide to what extent that is true.\nWheaton College in Illinois announced on Tuesday that they had put Hawkins on administrative leave for her \u201csame God\u201d comments.\nBut when the person making such a claim is employed by an evangelical college, it might mean losing one\u2019s job.\nFounded in 1860, Wheaton has long been considered a fairly open-minded institution within evangelicalism.\nIn an official statement, college administrators expressed concern over the \u201ctheological implications\u201d of her statements and promising a full review."}
