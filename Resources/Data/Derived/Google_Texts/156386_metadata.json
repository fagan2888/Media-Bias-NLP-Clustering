During his speech, Cruz read from the Dr. Seuss classic, Green Eggs and Ham. John McCain even spoke out against the Junior Senator from Texas saying Cruz didn\u2019t recognize that \u201celections have consequences.\u201d Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have held a joint press conference singing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s praises. Considering the fact that Cruz had read from Green Eggs and Ham, the President\u2019s speechwriters have come out with a parody of Dr. Seuss\u2019s book entitled, I Didn\u2019t Like the Healthcare Plan, Scum I Am, which was mailed to Cruz\u2019s Texas office with the intent being that the Texas Senator can read it on the floor of the Senate after people experience all of the wonderful things that go along with the healthcare bill.\n\nHere now is that parody:\n\nI am Scum. I am Scum.\n\nScum I am.\n\nThat Scum I am.\n\nThat Scum I am. I do not like\n\nThat Scum I am.\n\nDo you like the Affordable Care Act Plan?\n\nI do not like it, Scum I am.\n\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act Plan.\n\nWould you like it if your health were severe?\n\nI would not like it if my health were severe.\n\nI would not like it anyhow.\n\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act Plan.\n\nI do not like the plan, Scum I am.\n\nWould you like it if you were confined to your house?\n\nWould you like it to delouse?\n\nI would not like it if I were confined to my house.\n\nI would not like it to delouse.\n\nI do not like it if my pain were severe.\n\nI do not like it, I\u2019m sincere.\n\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nI do not like it, Scum I am.\n\nWould you like it if it treated chickenpox?\n\nHealthcare already eradicated smallpox.\n\nNot if it treated chickenpox.\n\nEven though healthcare eradicated smallpox.\n\nI would not like it if my pain were severe.\n\nI would not like it. Look at my sneer.\n\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nI do not like it, Scum I am.\n\nWould you, could you like it if you wrecked your car?\n\nBut pain. But pain.\n\nBut pain. But pain.\n\nCould you like it if you had pain?\n\nLet your constituents try them. Try them.\n\nLet them try them and you may.\n\nScum.\n\nIf you will let me be.\n\nI will let my constituents try them. You will see.\n\nSay. My constituents like the Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nI do. I like it, Scum I am.\n\nThey will like it if they have pain.\n\nIt can treat chicken pox.\n\nIt can be used to delouse.\n\nI do so like the Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nThank you. Thank you,\n\nAccording to my constituents, Scum I\u2019m not.\n\nWritten By: Jon Webster\n\nUPI\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Ted Cruz recently took to the Senate floor engaging in what many of his colleagues, even Republican elected Congressmen, are calling an \u201cunnecessary filibuster\u201d again\u2026", "title": "Ted Cruz: \u201cI Do Not Like the Healthcare Plan, Scum I Am\u201d", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2013/09/ted-cruz-i-do-not-like-the-healthcare-plan-scum-i-am/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ted-Cruz.jpg", "height": 790}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-27T15:55:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-27T16:00:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ted-Cruz.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Do you like the Affordable Care Act Plan?\nI do so like the Affordable Care Act plan.\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act Plan.\nI do not like the Affordable Care Act plan.\nMy constituents like the Affordable Care Act plan."}
