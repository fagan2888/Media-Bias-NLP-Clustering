Graham said.\n\nThe act extends the free trade provision between the United States and Bahrain, which expires in 2016.\n\n\"That provision helps us bring in duty free products that we then continue to manufacture and provide jobs here and complete the product, and so when that expires, we will lose a competitive edge,\" explained WestPoint Home Vice President of Business Development Terry Ellis.\n\nCurrently WestPoint Home is the last major home-textiles producer in the county and without the extension, the 250 jobs at the factory are at risk.\n\n\"This area right here really don't have like opportunities and this job right here is a good opportunity. I mean it's hard to find a job.\"\n\nCongresswoman Graham says the bipartisan bill has to go before Congress and signed into law by the president before it can be enacted.\n\nRepresentative Steve Southerland first introduced the act last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
