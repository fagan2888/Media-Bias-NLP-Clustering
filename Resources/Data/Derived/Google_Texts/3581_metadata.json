Since then, only one Michigan Republican, Spencer Abraham in 1994, has been elected to the Senate and for only one term. Evidence that former Michigan secretary of state Terri Lynn Land might end this GOP drought is that Democrats are attacking her for opposing \u201cpreventive health care.\u201d\n\nThis is a phrase Democrats use to include abortion as they try to reprise their 2012 alarms about Republicans\u2019 \u201cwar on women,\u201d which began with the martyrdom of Sandra Fluke. She was the Georgetown University law student aggrieved because the Catholic university she chose to attend was not paying for her contraception. The median starting annual salary of Georgetown law graduates entering the private sector is $160,000. Wal-Mart sells a month\u2019s worth of birth control pills for $9.\n\nIn the almost half-century since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s flood of Great Society legislation, Democrats have had one significant new idea, Obamacare, which many Democrats consider one too many. Hence their reliance on the specter of Republican hostility to people with two X chromosomes.\n\nLand is delighted to have Democrats raising the subject of \u201cpreventive\u201d or other health care. It is one topic of about $5 million of Michigan ads by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. In one, a woman addresses Land\u2019s opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters:\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

The biggest right-wing radio show host in America has spoken to a generation of conservatives. Micah Walter/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\n\u201cMy name is Julie Boonstra and five years ago I was diagnosed with leukemia. I found out that I only have a 20 percent chance of surviving. I found this wonderful doctor and a great health-care plan. I was doing fairly well fighting the cancer, fighting the leukemia, and then I received the letter. My insurance was canceled because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnother ad features a woman who believes Obamacare is waging a war on her: \u201cWe have five kids. . . . Our health insurance plan was canceled because of Obamacare. . . . This new plan is not affordable at all. My husband is working a lot more hours just to pay for these new increases. I\u2019m frustrated that government has caused this huge problem for our family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe,\u201d says Land, her Michigan chauvinism undiminished by this city\u2019s collapse, \u201care the state that created the middle class.\u201d High wages for autoworkers \u2014 higher than the companies could sustain \u2014 and employee discounts for cars enabled people to buy homes, then cottages and boats at nearby lakes. Now Obamacare \u2014 many Michiganders have had health plans canceled \u2014 is fueling middle-class insecurity.\n\nPeters opposes the Keystone XL pipeline and favors cap-and-trade climate legislation that Land says jeopardizes the revival of Michigan\u2019s manufacturing economy. Peters, a former state senator, has won three congressional elections. Land, having won statewide twice, is better known, and as secretary of state she concentrated on improving an experience most Americans dread \u2014 interacting with the department of motor vehicles.\n\nIn some recent polls she has a small lead in what may remain a close race. She has less to fear than Republicans used to have from Detroit\u2019s Democratic vote. The city\u2019s population has plunged from 1.8 million to 700,000, and today\u2019s Democratic mayor wields a much diminished political machine while an emergency manager is in place. Only 3 percent of Michiganders live in the Upper Peninsula, but in a close race they could provide the margin of victory for Land. The UP\u2019s conservatism can be distilled in six words: \u201cI\u2019m up here. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nLand represents Republicans\u2019 most effective response to Democrats\u2019 \u00adhyperventilating about the \u201cwar on women\u201d \u2014 female candidates. It will be amusing to see such rhetoric tried in Iowa, where Joni Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard who served in Iraq, is seeking the Republican Senate nomination. She says in an ad: \u201cI grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. So when I get to Washington, I\u2019ll know how to cut pork.\u201d She rides a Harley and in a recent Des Moines Register column she said, \u201cThose who know me well know that I carry a black purse everywhere I go. What many people don\u2019t know is what\u2019s inside: a Smith and Wesson 9 mm and my concealed carry permit.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats seem to prefer the sensibility of Fluke, a professional victim and virtuoso whiner. Michigan\u2019s electorate, which has produced today\u2019s Republican governor and legislature, may be ready, by electing a Republican senator for the third time in 42 years, to show what they think of \u201cwar on women\u201d hysterics as a substitute for thought.\n\nRead more from George F.
