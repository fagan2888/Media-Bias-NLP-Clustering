The earlier 5 p.m. debate featured seven candidates. And as with other political debates, the candidates\u2019 answers often veer from the questions, allowing several candidates to make constitutional points.\n\nIn transcripts provided after the event, the word \u201cConstitution\u201d was used seven times in the 9 p.m. event and six times in the 5 p.m. debate, but there were certainly other constitutional references.\n\nLink: Read The 9 P.M. Debate Transcript | The 5 P.M. Debate Transcript\n\nHere is a quick look at those constitutional references.\n\n1. The Fourth Amendment\n\nFox News host Megyn Kelly asked a direct question to Chris Christie about Rand Paul\u2019s opposition to the National Security Agency\u2019s data-collections policies, which Paul and other believe violate Fourth Amendment privacy provisions.\n\n\u201cDo you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the people\u2019s bulk collection of phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?\u201d Kelly asked Christie.\n\nThat led to a combative exchange between Christie and Paul about national security and the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\u201cI want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment is what we fought the revolution over,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of standing for the Bill of Rights and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nChristie countered with a comment that current surveillance measures with proper safeguards were needed to ensure national security.\n\n\u201cUse the Fourth Amendment. Get a warrant. Get a judge to sign a warrant,\u201d Paul responded.\n\n\u201cYou know senator, when you\u2019re sitting in a sub-committee just blowing hot-air about this, you can say things like that. When you\u2019re responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure that you use the system the way it\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d Christie retorted.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights,\u201d Paul replied, saying he was concerned about searches without warrants.\n\n2. Roe v. Wade\n\nMike Huckabee argued that the Fifth and 14th Amendments extended to the legal rights of unborn children at the point of conception, in a long-standing argument that goes back to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade.\n\nSpecifically, Chris Wallace asked Huckabee why we supported constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages and abortions.\n\n\u201cI think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother\u2019s womb is a person at the moment of conception,\u201d Huckabee said, adding that \u201cthe Supreme Court is not the supreme being.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio also clarified his stance on abortion laws and specifically his alleged comments supporting abortion-ban exceptions \u2013 which he disputed.\n\n\u201cWhat I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn the 5 p.m. debate, Rick Santorum got into specifics when asked about Rove v. Wade being \u201csettled law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not any more than Dred Scott was settled law to Abraham Lincoln, who, in his first inaugural address, said \u2018it won\u2019t stand.\u2019 And they went ahead and passed laws in direct contravention to a rogue Supreme Court. This is a rogue Supreme Court decision, just like Justice Roberts said. There is no constitutional basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\n3. Federalism and states\u2019 rights\n\nHuckabee talked about more control at a state level over programs and departments administered by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it\u2019s the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education,\u201d Huckabee told Bret Baier.\n\n4. Executive orders\n\nAt 9 p.m., Ted Cruz said his first act as president would be to reverse executive orders issued by President Obama.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nOn the 5 p.m. debate, the candidates were asked about their first day in office, and all said they would undo President Obama\u2019s executive orders.\n\n5. The First Amendment and Religious Liberty\n\nKelly asked Rand Paul about the Supreme Court\u2019s recent same-sex marriage and how that affects the religious liberty of individuals whose business decision could be influenced by their personal beliefs.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it\u2019s a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them,\u201d Paul said.\n\n6. The Supreme Court\n\nIn the 5 p.m. debate, Rick Santorum spoke about Roe v. Wade, and former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore called out the current Court in general.\n\n\u201cI believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law. Now, the challenge we\u2019re seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body,\u201d Gimore said. \u201cThey have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is \u2014 in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point \u2014 to appoint justices who would follow the law.\u201d\n\n7. Other topics\n\nIn general, there was widespread condemnation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, by most of the candidates who were asked about the issue, or found a way to work it into their responses. Immigration was also discussed at length, with several pointed comments from Donald Trump.\n\nJohn Kasich also said he would respect the Supreme Court\u2019s recent same-sex marriage decision despite his personal beliefs. \u201cI\u2019m an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThe court has ruled, and I said we\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\n10 famous political debate moments\n\nJon Stewart\u2019s departure is the end of an era in American satire\n\nConstitution Check: Who has the job of picking the candidates for the presidency?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Among the topics covered in Thursday\u2019s two GOP debates were several points about the Constitution.
