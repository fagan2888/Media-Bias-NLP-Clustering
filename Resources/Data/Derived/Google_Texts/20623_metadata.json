The vehicles were mainly transportation trucks, some of them carrying small- and large-caliber artillery systems, and at least one armored personnel carrier. One truck outside Donetsk was seen to be carrying troops.\n\nUkrainian officials said this week that they believe rebel forces have received substantial consignments of weaponry and manpower from Russia. Moscow denies such claims.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to establish the provenance of the vehicles seen Saturday. Separatists have always insisted they are armed with equipment captured from Ukrainian forces, but the sheer scale and quality of their armaments have strained the credibility of that claim.\n\nDespite a cease-fire being reached in September, Ukrainian and rebel troops engage on a regular basis, with some of the heaviest fighting focused on Donetsk airport.\n\nOne government paratrooper was killed Friday by a sniper at the airport, military authorities said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that Ukrainian positions came under artillery fire in several towns and villages east of Donetsk, including Debaltseve, which has begun to be increasingly encircled by rebel forces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "title": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "title": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/ukraine_rebels_seen_moving_large_military_convoys/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ukraine.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "title": "Ukraine rebels seen moving large military convoys", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ukraine.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nataliya Vasilyeva", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92a8\"", "article_summary": "It was not immediately possible to establish the provenance of the vehicles seen Saturday.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSNIZHNE, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Associated Press reporters saw more than 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move Saturday in rebel-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, indicating that intensified hostilities may lie ahead.\nOne truck outside Donetsk was seen to be carrying troops.\nUkrainian officials said this week that they believe rebel forces have received substantial consignments of weaponry and manpower from Russia.\nSeparatists have always insisted they are armed with equipment captured from Ukrainian forces, but the sheer scale and quality of their armaments have strained the credibility of that claim."}
