NOT SO FAST, CHRIS CHRISTIE\n\nThe take-no-prisoners governor \u2013 a moderate still loathed by some Republicans for his embrace of President Obama before last year\u2019s election, but solidly leading in N.J. polls \u2013 was polished, persuasive and mostly buttoned up as he made his case for staying on in Trenton after a first term in which he saw the state through both Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy.\n\nHe and challenger Barbara Buono, a 20-year Democratic state legislator virtually unknown outside of New Jersey, faced tough questions about the state's high unemployment rate of 8.5 percent (higher than the national rate of 7.3 percent); its sky-high property taxes (averaging $8,100 per year, highest in the nation); and the high cost of a college education \u2013 among other financial and economic issues.\n\nBut even with his emphasis on how hard he\u2019s worked for New Jersey and that pride in his work, it wasn\u2019t long before a question about his prospects for higher office was posed by moderator Kristine Johnson of CBS News. \u201cGovernor, are you going to run for president?\u201d\n\nRELATED: BOEHNER MAKES U-TURN AFTER CHRISTIE TONGUE LASHING\n\n\u201cWhat an unusual question \u2013 I didn\u2019t anticipate that,\u201d said Christie, 51, who last year was the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention and mentioned as a possible running mate for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney until Paul Ryan was chosen. \u201cMy mother told me a long time ago: Do the job that you have at the moment the best you possibly can and your future will take care of itself\u2026 After 2017, I\u2019ll be looking for another job anyway. So I am going to continue to do my job the best way I possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, Governor, you are asking the voters to commit four more years to you,\u201d the moderator cut in. \u201cWhy should they vote for you?\"\n\n\u201cBecause of what\u2019s happened for the past four years, and because they believe this type of leadership will continue in the next four,\u201d Christie answered.\n\nThat was just the opening for challenger Buono \u2013 a mother of six, including an openly gay daughter \u2013 to chastise Christie for letting national politics color his decisions as governor, including \u201csacrificing the safety of our children by vetoing common sense gun legislation just to cater to the NRA\u201d and for vetoing funding for Planned Parenthood, two issues important to voters in solidly blue-state New Jersey, which President Obama won by 17 points last November.\n\nBut Christie retorted: \u201cI can walk and chew gun at the same time\u2026 I can do this job and deal with my future.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates, in fact, got off some clever rejoinders during an evening largely focused on taxes, education and unemployment. Christie was on his game, comfortable in the spotlight, which Buono couldn't resist attacking him for: \u201cDon\u2019t let the glossy magazine covers and late-night wisecracks fool you,\" she said early on. \"No amount of YouTube videos or late-night shows will erase the fact that we have 400,000 people out of work.\u201d\n\nHere are other standout moments in Tuesday night\u2019s debate, attended by about 1,000 people:\n\nWHY SO BLUNT?\n\nChristie was asked about his use of less-than-delicate language (among other instances, last year he called a Democratic state lawmaker an \u201carrogant SOB\"). \u201cAre you sapping the dignity of the governor\u2019s office?\u201d the moderator asked.\n\nHe responded, \u201cWhat the people of New Jersey want is someone who looks them in the eye and tells them the truth... That\u2019s what leadership is about. Using direct and blunt language is something I\u2019ve done my whole life... I am who I am.\u201d\n\nSAYING \u2018I DO\u2019\n\n\u201cI believe the institution of marriage for 2,000 years is between a man and a woman\u2026. It should be decided by the 8.8 million people of New Jersey,\u201d said Christie, maintaining that any change should be made by public referendum, not through the state legislature or the Supreme Court.\n\nBuono fired back that same-sex marriage \u201cis a human right \u2013 it really should not be on the ballot.\u201d Christie replied, \u201cI trust the people of N.J. to make this judgment. I don\u2019t trust politicians with political agendas.\u201d\n\nPUBLIC WORKER BENEFITS\n\nA proponent of civil service reform, Christie said the state must \u201cend the abuse of sick pay throughout the state,\u201d a reference to the state\u2019s $1 billion in unused sick pay. Fixing this issue could \u201chelp change the property tax situation significantly.\u201d Buono responded, \u201cMillionaires should pay their fair share. I will never balance my budget off the backs of the middle class and working poor.\u201d Christie retorted, \u201cI know Sen. Buono would never balance her budget that way. I had to balance her budget.\u201d\n\nPLUG FOR BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n\u201cWe need consensus-building in Trenton and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for the last three and a half years,\u201d said Christie. \u201cSen. Buono wouldn\u2019t know about that because she hasn\u2019t been part of that.\u201d He also said, \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to get things done, compared to what\u2019s going on in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nDIGGING OUT OF THE DEFICIT HOLE\n\n\u201cWe were at the bottom of the barrel, with a $13 million deficit,\u201d said Christie about the state's fiscal condition when he first took office. \u201cWe have dug out of quite the hole. We\u2019ve worked hard and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done, cut business taxes\u2026 The N.J. comeback has begun.\u201d Buono, though, slammed Christie more than once for his \u201cRomney-style, trickle down economics\u201d and giving what she said were unnecessary and overly generous tax credits to business.\n\nANY REGRETS?\n\nChristie asked Buono about how she\u2019s voted 154 times to raise taxes on New Jerseyans. \u201cIs there one of them that you regret?\u201d She never answered that directly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Chris Christie may be the incumbent Republican governor of New Jersey and a rising national figure, but he still had a lot to prove Tuesday night at William Paterson University during the first of two N.J. gubernatorial debates.
