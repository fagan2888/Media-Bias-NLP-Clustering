A recent published report suggests that number is slipping.\n\n/ Download\n\nThe report says U-Haul has helped 2.4 percent more people move out of Houston than into the city so far this year. But Patrick Jankowski with the Greater Houston Partnership is skeptical that Houston is losing people.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Census Bureau data that was just released two or three weeks ago, it showed that actually in the period ending in July 2015, we actually had 98,000 more people move here than moved out. But there\u2019s also a component called Net International Migration. Last year, we actually had 37,500 people move here from overseas. Think about it: If I\u2019m moving here from France, I\u2019m not renting a U-Haul!\u201d Jankowski said.\n\nJankowski said the problem with the U-Haul indicator is that it\u2019s just a headline number. It\u2019d be nice to have additional data on where people are moving.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re moving out of Houston? Jankowski asked. \u201cAre they moving out of Houston to Fort Bend? Are they moving out of Houston to Pasadena? That\u2019s not shown up in the numbers. It\u2019s a nice indicator, but it\u2019s not something that I would make a hard financial decision on or a hard business decision on.\u201d\n\nJankowski said beyond job fluctuations, there\u2019s natural growth in Houston each year when births and deaths are factored in \u2014 and there are more births than deaths.\n\nAs for the effect of cheaper oil on Houston, as important as the energy industry is, maybe it no longer determines the future of Houston\u2019s economy.\n\nJankowski compares it to the way an engine works \u2014 especially the part that keeps it from running too fast.\n\n\u201cWhere the governor opens up and lets the motor turn very fast, the governor clamps down and has the motor turn slower. That may be what oil prices do for Houston,\u201d Jankowski said. \u201cWhen oil prices are high, Houston grows very fast. When oil prices are low, we grow slower, but we still grow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "In recent oil boom years, Houston made headlines for the number of people moving to the city.
