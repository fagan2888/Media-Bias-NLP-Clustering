Nudity of a sexual nature is still prohibited, but breastfeeding, mastectomy scars, and artistic representations are now fair game.\n\n\u201cInstagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs,\u201d the photo sharing company explains in its Guidelines. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.\u201d\n\nAs American culture gets further enmeshed in social media, the companies that control which posts are acceptable and which are indecent must confront a far wider scope of content. For one, mastectomy rates have been climbing for the past several years, regardless of whether women need the surgery or not.\n\nThis is in part a self-fulfilling loop, as more women are inclined to make the leap if someone close to them has already done so. It\u2019s also a product of celebrity endorsement. In 2013, Angelina Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy because she carried the BRCA1 gene, which increases a woman\u2019s risk for breast cancer. Not all women who carry the gene need to undergo such aggressive surgery, however, leading to the oft-cited \u201cAngelina Jolie Effect.\u201d\n\nSocial tides are also shifting. Once denounced as an indecent public act, breastfeeding is creeping back into mainstream acceptance, both at work and in daily life. However, many still equate the act with other bodily processes, ones that are hardly appropriate for public discourse, and so they relegate breastfeeding to the confines of home life. Instagram\u2019s policies appear to agree with the former camp. Taking breastfeeding out of the company of \u201csexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks,\u201d and categorizes it instead as a normal part of human living.\n\nIf people still object to the photos, Instagram offers a suggestion. \u201cYou may find content you don\u2019t like, but doesn\u2019t violate the community guidelines. If that happens, you can unfollow or block the person who posted it, and if there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "instagram, now, allows, breastfeeding, mastectomy, photos, community, guidelines", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A month after Facebook changed its guidelines, Instagram has expanded its own rules to accommodate women.", "title": "Instagram Now Lets Mothers Post Breastfeeding Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/instagram-now-allows-breastfeeding-mastectomy-photos-community-guidelines-330040", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/breastfeeding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A month after Facebook changed its guidelines, Instagram has expanded its own rules to accommodate women.", "title": "Instagram Now Lets Mothers Post Breastfeeding Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/instagram-now-allows-breastfeeding-mastectomy-photos-community-guidelines-330040", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/breastfeeding.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/breastfeeding.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-20T16:23:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T16:23:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A month after Facebook changed its guidelines, Instagram has expanded its own rules to accommodate women."}, "article_summary": "On the heels of Facebook\u2019s March decision to let users post photos of breastfeeding and sculptures depicting nudity, Instagram has amended its own Community Guidelines.\nNudity of a sexual nature is still prohibited, but breastfeeding, mastectomy scars, and artistic representations are now fair game.\n\u201cYou may find content you don\u2019t like, but doesn\u2019t violate the community guidelines.\n\u201cInstagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs,\u201d the photo sharing company explains in its Guidelines.\nOnce denounced as an indecent public act, breastfeeding is creeping back into mainstream acceptance, both at work and in daily life."}
