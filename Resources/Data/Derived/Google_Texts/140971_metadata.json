Syria (ISIS) forces from seizing the predominantly Kurdish town situated seven miles from the border with Turkey.The U.S. announced on Sunday that it dropped arms and other supplies to Kurds trying to defend the city from the terror group.McCain and Graham qualified their praise, saying \u201cthis tactical adjustment should not be confused for an effective strategy, which is still lacking.\u201dThey pointed out that ISIS forces are \u201cadvancing\u201d in Anbar province, Iraq, as well as near the capital city of Baghdad.\u201cWe continue to urge the administration to quickly adopt a comprehensive strategy and avoid the perils of gradual escalation \u2014 in Kobani and in the broader fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria,\u201d the pair said. \u201cThis will only lead to an unnecessary loss of life and reduce our chances of success, as we have learned in other conflicts.\"They repeated their calls for deploying U.S. special forces and military advisers on the ground to direct the air campaign, providing additional assistance to moderate Syrian forces and establishing no-fly zones in Syria.\u201cRather than preemptively ruling out steps such as these for policy reasons, the president should take them now as appropriate to change the momentum on the ground against both ISIS and the Assad regime and to create conditions for a political transition and an end of the conflict in Syria,\u201d they argued. \u201cThat is ultimately what it will take to destroy ISIS and keep America safe, and we cannot afford to delay any longer.\u201d", "article_metadata":
