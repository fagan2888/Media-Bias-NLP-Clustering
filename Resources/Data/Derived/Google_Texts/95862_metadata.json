Getty Images\n\nHouse Republicans on Friday filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration alleging that the way in which the White House implemented its health-care law violates the Constitution.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. and drafted by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, escalates a brewing battle between GOP lawmakers and the Obama administration over separation of powers. Here\u2019s a quick overview of its legal arguments.\n\nThe lawsuit essentially makes two claims.\n\nOne concerns the White House\u2019s decision to delay enforcement of a requirement under the Affordable Care Act that employers offer health coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nThe Treasury Department in February said employers with 50 to 99 full-time workers won\u2019t have to comply with the mandate until 2016. Under the original 2010 health law, they had to offer coverage or pay a penalty beginning in 2014.\n\nBy delaying the mandate, the GOP argues, the Obama administration violated a procedural part of the Constitution (Article I, section 7, clause 2) known as the \u201cpresentment clause\u201d that defines the legislative powers of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not permit the Executive Branch to enact laws, or to amend or repeal duly enacted laws, including by adopting rules or taking other unilateral actions that have such an effect,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe other focus of the lawsuit was less widely discussed by Republicans.\n\nIt deals with a component of the health law, known as an \u201coffset program,\u201d that authorizes the government to pay back insurance companies for the discounts they are required to offer low-income enrollees.\n\nIn January, CMS started paying health plans based on enrollment data submitted by insurers. (The transfers totaled about $4 billion in fiscal year 2014.) The House lawsuit alleges that while the offset program was authorized by the law, Congress never appropriated money to pay for it.\n\nThe money coming out of the Treasury, the complaint says, violates a section of the Constitution that gives Congress the power of the purse, one of the most important sources of leverage over the executive branch.\n\n\u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,\u201d states Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution.\n\nThe White House on Friday didn\u2019t respond to the specific allegations made in the complaint but attacked the lawsuit as a frivolous distraction.\n\n\u201cInstead of passing legislation to help expand the middle class and grow the economy, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars pursuing a lawsuit that is without any sound legal basis,\u201d White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said.\n\nAs Law Blog has noted, the biggest obstacle for Mr. Boehner is getting a court to actually hear the complaint, involving a concept known as standing.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "House Republicans on Friday filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration alleging that the way in which the White House implemented its health-care law violates the Constitution.
