Incense, potpourri, synthetic marijuana, most commonly known as spice, has gotten a lot of attention over the last several years. In Lauderdale County, drug task force agents say it’s a growing trend they are trying to combat.

“It’s developed as a safe, legal and all natural alternative to marijuana, but scientific studies and peoples adverse reactions have proven otherwise,” East MS Drug Task Force Agent Jesse Fairchild says.

“We’re having a lot of problems with our youth with how easy it is for them to get their hands on it.”

Fairchild says there are many types of spice and it’s easy for people to obtain.

“Because you can go in a buy it in a number of stores here in town. There seems to be some confusion among store owners on what’s legal and what’s not legal to sell,” Fairchild says.

Many forms of spice are illegal due to the compound chemicals used to mimic the effects of marijuana. Spice is classified as a schedule one drug and possession of It is treated the same as marijuana based on the amounts and intent.

“The problem with spice is that it’s not regulated at all. You never know what you’re going to get with it. You could smoke some one time and be perfectly fine and the next time you’ll have an adverse reaction,” Fairchild says.
