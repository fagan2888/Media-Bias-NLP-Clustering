Whether you support or hate the Second Amendment, everyone wants something done,\u201d Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cWe now have carry laws across the country \u2014 not all great laws. But the doomsday prediction \u2014 that more guns are going to be the end of the world as we know it, more people will be shooting firearms and doing crazy things \u2014 simply hasn\u2019t materialized. Law-abiding people have the right to their own protection,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nFor the first time in more than two decades, more Americans say that protecting gun rights is more important than controlling gun ownership by a margin of 52 percent to 46 percent, according to a Pew Research poll.\n\nThis finding comes after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Connecticut and some other high-profile rampages that the White House used to argue for a full-court press for gun control despite statistically lower crime rates overall.\n\nStill, the majority of Americans don\u2019t feel safe, and that perception has only grown during President Obama\u2019s term of office, according to the polling.\n\n\u201cIn short, we are at a moment when most Americans believe crime rates are rising and when most believe gun ownership \u2014 not gun control \u2014 makes people safer,\u201d Pew wrote in an April 17 report.\n\nSupport for gun control has had the sharpest decline among whites who see crime on the rise: Just 37 percent of those who now say crime is rising say they favor stricter gun control, compared with 78 percent who said the same in 1990, the Pew report said.\n\nPew\u2019s poll also shows support for the NRA is increasing \u2014 the gun rights lobby had its second-largest national convention last month, and its membership has reached 5 million.\n\nThe NRA proved its muscle in the 2014 election cycle, helping to rally a decisive victory for gun rights supporters, especially in hotly contested races like the U.S. House seat in Arizona once held by shooting victim and gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords.\n\nThere are more than 100 million gun owners in America who identify with different political parties, but all of whom feel their freedom is under attack, Mr. Cox said.\n\n\u201cWhat gun control groups fail to realize is gun owners aren\u2019t just a loyal voting bloc they\u2019re a very savvy one, and they don\u2019t like to be lied to,\u201d said Mr. Cox. \u201cThere\u2019s this realization \u2014 gun owners know their rights are under attack \u2014 but there\u2019s a bigger issue out there: that people are feeling suffocated, whether its businesses being stifled from regulation, Obamacare or being told how much soda we can drink. There\u2019s been an overreach into our personal freedom. It\u2019s a serious issue, and people are taking notice.\u201d\n\nThe NRA was successful in more than 90 percent of the races in which it played, demonstrating that it can run television ads and support candidates in urban districts without collateral damage, Mr. Cox said.\n\nAlthough Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS), a gun control group founded by Mrs. Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, poured $2 million in trying to re-elect her former district director, Ron Barber, to her former Arizona congressional seat, NRA-backed candidate Martha McSally won the race in a runoff in what was one of the most hotly contested races of the election cycle.\n\nThe NRA rallied grass-roots support for Mrs. McSally\u2019s campaign and ran direct mail on Second Amendment rights. NRA internal exit poll data from that race shows 37 percent of Mrs. McSally\u2019s votes came from people who said they were in direct opposition to Mr. Barber and Mr. Obama\u2019s gun control policies. And toward the end of the race, ARS \u2014 fearing backlash \u2014 pulled its gun control television spots from the air.\n\n\u201cOn the ground during the campaign, it definitely felt like those anti-Second Amendment ads certainty didn\u2019t hurt us and did more to gin up Second Amendment supporters than anything,\u201d said Patrick Ptak, communications director for Rep. McSally.\n\nARS declined comment to The Times.\n\nThat support for the Second Amendment was an advantage that held equally true in Colorado in 2014.\n\nExit polling showed that 51 percent of those who voted in the Senate race there said they supported the goals and objectives of the NRA. Thirty-eight percent said they voted for Republican and NRA-backed Cory Gardner over Mark Udall \u201cto show opposition to the Obama-Mark Udall gun-control agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith these results we are able to demonstratively show what we\u2019ve said all along \u2014 that the NRA, come election season, is not a niche group or niche message, it\u2019s not 4 [percent] or 5 percent of the electorate, it goes to 40 percent to 60 percent of all voters,\u201d Mr. Cox said.\n\nStill, gun control groups are also optimistic.\n\nMichael Bloomberg donated $50 million of his personal fortune to get his group Everytown for Gun Safety combating the NRA last year. And Giffords-affiliated gun control groups raised and spent about $27 million in the midterm cycle trying to influence elections, according to federal elections data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThat compares to the $28 million the NRA decided to spend on 2014 elections, according to the same data set.\n\n\u201cIn candidate races, more than 85 percent of our endorsed candidates won election,\u201d said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Everytown in an email statement to The Times. \u201cIn governor races in states that passed background check legislation since Newtown, candidates who support gun safety were victorious.\u201d\n\nOne clear victory for Everytown was in Washington state, where the background check ballot initiative passed with 60 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cOur supporters took the fight to keep our children safe from gun violence to a new grass-roots level \u2014 and the election results show that while the gun lobby can bully politicians, they can\u2019t bully the American people at the voting booth,\u201d Ms. Soto Lamb said.\n\nThe NRA is disappointed in losing that ballot initiative but simply couldn\u2019t match the resources Everytown poured into the state\u2019s ballot initiative, Mr. Cox said.\n\n\u201cThat was a unique state being led by billionaires being able to raise $12 [million] to $15 million to mislead people on the facts,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cWe were outspent overwhelmingly. Our money comes from $5 and $10 dollar donations from our members.\u201d\n\nAccording to Washington state federal election disclosures, the NRA spent $485,000 in Washington. In an October 2014 press release, Everytown said it spent more than $4 million to support the state\u2019s ballot initiative, with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pitching in another $1 million.\n\nNow the NRA is headed into its next battle, a presidential cycle in which voter turnout and the stakes are much higher.\n\n\u201c[The] 2016 [election] is going to be much different. It\u2019s a national election year [and] we know it\u2019s going to be challenging and expensive,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to improve. We have the best grass-roots organization in the country and continue to build it out. Take the presidential race aside, our No. 1 priority is to protect our friends against attack, No. 2 is to defeat our opponents, and No. 3 is to go after open seat opportunities.\n\n\u201cNext year more of our friends will be under attack. It\u2019s going to be a challenging election cycle,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face the most ruthless and dishonest but disciplined presidential campaign in Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s a reality that anyone who cares about freedom needs to focus on and be prepared.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Rifle Association is planning a major voter-outreach program for the 2016 presidential election, buoyed by its success in targeted elections last year and hoping to capitalize on Americans' growing belief that gun ownership will make them safer as fear of crime rises, its chief lobbyist says.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The National Rifle Association is planning a major voter-outreach program for the 2016 presidential election, buoyed by its success in targeted elections last year and hoping to capitalize on Americans\u2019 growing belief that gun ownership will make them safer as fear of crime rises, its chief lobbyist says.", "title": "NRA plots 2016 strategy as gun rights support grows", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/17/nra-plots-2016-strategy-as-gun-rights-support-grow/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/5_172015_nra8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/5_172015_nra8201.jpg", "description": "The National Rifle Association is planning a major voter-outreach program for the 2016 presidential election, buoyed by its success in targeted elections last year and hoping to capitalize on American", "card": "summary", "title": "NRA plots 2016 strategy as gun rights support grows"}, "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Chris Cox, National Rifle Association, Gabrielle Giffords"}, "article_summary": "And toward the end of the race, ARS \u2014 fearing backlash \u2014 pulled its gun control television spots from the air.\nPew\u2019s poll also shows support for the NRA is increasing \u2014 the gun rights lobby had its second-largest national convention last month, and its membership has reached 5 million.\n\u201cIn short, we are at a moment when most Americans believe crime rates are rising and when most believe gun ownership \u2014 not gun control \u2014 makes people safer,\u201d Pew wrote in an April 17 report.\nFor the first time in more than two decades, more Americans say that protecting gun rights is more important than controlling gun ownership by a margin of 52 percent to 46 percent, according to a Pew Research poll.\n\u201cWhat gun control groups fail to realize is gun owners aren\u2019t just a loyal voting bloc they\u2019re a very savvy one, and they don\u2019t like to be lied to,\u201d said Mr. Cox."}
