But Davutoglu said Turkey was still negotiating and he had held a meeting with a U.S. company a day earlier.\n\n\"The Chinese company was the first because they offered us joint production. Joint production was important for us,\" he said.\n\nRival offers from Franco-Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S.-listed Raytheon Co RTN.N, the maker of Patriot missiles, were also in the running he said.\n\n\"If the other two companies give us the assurance of joint production in Turkey and the transfer of technology, of course we wish to have this with NATO allies.\"\n\nNATO's top military commander urged Turkey last November to buy a missile defense system that is compatible with other NATO systems.\n\n\"Everyone knows how difficult it is if you want to buy something from the United States, there is a long process of getting permission. If those companies are offering us joint production it is negotiable,\" Davutoglu added.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Hudson and Adrian Croft; Editing by Rosalind Russell)", "article_metadata":
