Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nAlastair \u201cAl\u201d Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nIn selecting Mr. Fitzpayne, Ms. Burwell tapped a well-connected administration aide who has worked on some of the most high-stakes fiscal battles in recent years but has relatively little health care experience.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew called Mr. Fitzpayne \u201can indispensible member\u201d of Treasury\u2019s top brass and said he \u201cplayed a critical role in moving forward some of our biggest policy priorities.\u201d\n\nMr. Fitzpayne joined Treasury in January 2009 as deputy chief of staff, and later became assistant secretary for legislative affairs. That essentially made Mr. Fitzpayne the Treasury Department\u2019s top liaison to Congress, where he often had to interact with congressional aides and lawmakers over a range of contentious issues, from the debt ceiling to tax proposals.\n\nHe often plays a behind-the-scenes role, seen seated behind Mr. Lew or other top officials at congressional hearings. His profile could elevate, however, at HHS, particularly if Republicans win control of the Senate in next week\u2019s elections. Some Republicans are expected to try and advance numerous health care proposals, potentially even a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, Ms. Burwell is still working on implementing key parts of the health care law and Mr. Fitzpayne would be involved in both administrative and political decisions.\n\nPerhaps benefiting him in his new role, Mr. Fitzpayne has worked extensively with the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee, panels that he would likely be interacting with often in his new role.\n\nHe is expected to join HHS sometime in November.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Alastair \"Al\" Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.", "title": "Burwell Picks Treasury Aide Fitzpayne for HHS Chief of Staff", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/29/burwell-picks-treasury-aide-fitzpayne-for-hhs-chief-of-staff/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FH123_Fitzpa_P_20141029214449.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Burwell Picks Treasury Aide Fitzpayne for HHS Chief of Staff", "description": "Alastair \"Al\" Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Damian Paletta", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Alastair \"Al\" Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-30T01:49:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/29/burwell-picks-treasury-aide-fitzpayne-for-hhs-chief-of-staff/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-50231", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Alastair \"Al\" Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.", "title": "Burwell Picks Treasury Aide Fitzpayne for HHS Chief of Staff", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/29/burwell-picks-treasury-aide-fitzpayne-for-hhs-chief-of-staff/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FH123_Fitzpa_P_20141029214449.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-50231", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-30T01:56:25-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Some Republicans are expected to try and advance numerous health care proposals, potentially even a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew speaks with Alastair Fitzpayne in June.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Burwell is still working on implementing key parts of the health care law and Mr. Fitzpayne would be involved in both administrative and political decisions.\nIn selecting Mr. Fitzpayne, Ms. Burwell tapped a well-connected administration aide who has worked on some of the most high-stakes fiscal battles in recent years but has relatively little health care experience.\nAgence France-Presse/Getty ImagesAlastair \u201cAl\u201d Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell."}
