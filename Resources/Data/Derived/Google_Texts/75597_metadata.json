Kirsten Gillibrand said Tuesday the federal government should continue to fund Planned Parenthood, revealing she had not watched the covert videos showing top officials from the group discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nGillibrand told The Blaze she had no intention of watching the series of videos.\n\n\u201cI think what Planned Parenthood does around the country is provide health care for millions of women who have no access to health care at all. And, only a very small part of their budget goes to abortion services,\u201d she said. \u201c97 percent of their budget is focused on basic health care.\u201d\n\nGillibrand is referring to Planned Parenthood\u2019s claim that abortions make up 3 percent of its services, a claim the Washington Post called \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\nHer comments come amid a congressional battle over whether taxpayers should continue to fund the more than $500 million the organization receives annually.\n\nFederal law bars Planned Parenthood from using federal grants for abortion services, but Republicans argue the Center for Medical Progress videos show problematic actions and have pushed to end taxpayer funding for the organization.\n\nPlanned Parenthood maintains the videos are \u201cheavily edited,\u201d denying the group has violated legal or medical standards.\n\nDemocrats have sided with the group, fighting against Republican efforts to strip federal grants.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood, wants to defund health care for women across the United States,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cIf proponents of the videos believe laws have been broken, well then criminal justice should investigate.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the Center for Medical Progress to determine whether the group obtained the undercover footage legally. Congressional Republicans have vowed to probe Planned Parenthood officials further following the August recess.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But admits she hasn't seen the undercover videos.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "But admits she hasn't seen the undercover videos.", "title": "Democratic Senator Defends Planned Parenthood Funding", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150812_GillibrandPP_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1L6AaRN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "But admits she hasn't seen the undercover videos.", "title": "Democratic Senator Defends Planned Parenthood Funding", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150812_GillibrandPP_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-12T17:40:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kirsten Gillibrand, Planned Parenthood, Center For Medical Progress, Department of Justice"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think what Planned Parenthood does around the country is provide health care for millions of women who have no access to health care at all.\nCongressional Republicans have vowed to probe Planned Parenthood officials further following the August recess.\n\u201cAnyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood, wants to defund health care for women across the United States,\u201d Gillibrand said.\nPlanned Parenthood maintains the videos are \u201cheavily edited,\u201d denying the group has violated legal or medical standards.\nFederal law bars Planned Parenthood from using federal grants for abortion services, but Republicans argue the Center for Medical Progress videos show problematic actions and have pushed to end taxpayer funding for the organization."}
