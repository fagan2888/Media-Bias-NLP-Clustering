That\u2019s three times as expensive as in Orlando, the cheapest place to rent a car.\n\nWhile it makes sense that New York City tops the priciest list, for all the obvious cost-of-living and tourist destination issues, the inclusion of Detroit and Baltimore is somewhat surprising given their less popular status among travelers\u2019 choices for U.S. destinations.\n\nTo compile its list, Cheap Car Rental looked at average daily rental rates for 50 popular U.S. destinations, based on results from travel search website Kayak during the past 12 months. For each city, the main airport was chosen as the pick-up and drop-off location.\n\nRelated: Google Preps Self-Driving Cars for City Traffic\n\nHere are the priciest cities to rent a car and their average daily rental fare:\n\n1- New York City, $76\n\n2- Detroit, $69\n\n3- Memphis, $67\n\n4- Baltimore, $65\n\n5- New Orleans, $63\n\nSunny tourist destinations are the cheapest destinations:\n\n1- Orlando, $25\n\n2- Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale (tied), $26\n\n3- Las Vegas, $27\n\n4- San Diego, $28\n\n5- Los Angeles, $29\n\nA myriad of apps can help you find the cheapest car rental options throughout the U.S., including Expedia\u2019s CarRental.com, which released its app a few years ago, and Sixt, Kayak and IzziRentaCar.

Think of it as the Airbnb of car rental.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to pay big bucks for your rental car anyway, you might as well make it an upscale, luxurious experience. With Silvercar, you book a car \u2013 always an Audi A4 \u2013 through your smartphone and pick it up and drop it off at a certain location, the same way Zipcar works. The service is currently available in Austin, Dallas, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New York City ranked as the most expensive city in America to rent a car, but there are ways to keep your car rental fares to a minimum.", "title": "5 Most Expensive Cities to Rent a Car", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/14/5-Most-Expensive-Cities-Rent-Car", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05142014_Car_Rental_Keys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/14/5-Most-Expensive-Cities-Rent-Car", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05142014_Car_Rental_Keys.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New York City ranked as the most expensive city in America to rent a car, but there are ways to keep your car rental fares to a minimum.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But in the event you do, be prepared to pay dearly for the privilege: New York City ranked as the most expensive city in America to rent a car, according to a new survey from Cheap Car Rental.\nThat\u2019s three times as expensive as in Orlando, the cheapest place to rent a car.\nAll the big rental car companies also offer their own apps to facilitate booking.\nIf you\u2019re going to pay big bucks for your rental car anyway, you might as well make it an upscale, luxurious experience.\nRelated: How to Drive Down the Cost of Rental CarsOn average, travelers who rented a car in the Big Apple over the past year paid $76 per day for the cheapest car available."}
