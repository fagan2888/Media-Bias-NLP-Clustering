As one of the outlets that said, repeatedly, not to believe that Trump was running until he filed his paperwork with the FEC, we at Salon figured it was only fair that we cover his address to the Maryland Republican Party\u2019s annual Red, White, and Blue Dinner after he made it official.\n\nThe dinner was at the very beautiful, very classy airport Marriott in Linthicum, Maryland, just outside of Baltimore. Trump\u2019s own press release announcing the speech noted that there would be \u201ca record setting crowd\u201d in attendance to hear him speak. Trump has a tendency to inflate crowd sizes, but this was actually true. The event quickly sold out after Trump was announced and the Maryland GOP had to add tables at the last minute to fit everyone in.\n\nBut what were they hoping to see? A celebrity entertainer from the teevee, or a candidate whom they could see themselves supporting for political office?\n\nBecause not many Republican voters could see themselves supporting Donald Trump for political office. We know this because the most recent NBC national poll asked Republican voters directly if they could see themselves supporting Donald Trump for office. A full 66% of Republican voters said that they could not see themselves supporting Trump, 11 percentage points higher than the second-worst candidate, Chris Christie, the butt of many jokes about whose presidential campaign is the most dead-on-arrival. Even the Suffolk University poll of New Hampshire voters released yesterday, which put Trump in second place with 11% trailing only Jeb Bush\u2019s 14%, showed how difficult it\u2019s going to be for Trump to build much more support than that. The poll found Trump\u2019s favorability rating underwater, 37 percent to 49 percent. He was the only candidate with a net-unfavorable rating, so there\u2019s not much room for him to grow.\n\nOh my God, though, this Suffolk poll. As soon as the numbers came out yesterday, the Trump campaign determined that Suffolk was basically the finest, most precise, most brilliant pollster in the history of pollsters. Trump\u2019s team suggested to the assembled press last night that they might want to ask about this singular poll from the singular Suffolk University during his pre-speech press availability. About a dozen or so reporters came to cover the event \u2014 mostly local Baltimore news outlets, plus one stupid Salon scribe who foolishly decided to drive northbound on 295 during rush hour to cover a Republican party dinner at the BWI Marriott. An apocalyptic thunderstorm was rolling through the region, as it has every night this summer, and thunder boomed from outside the \u201cApprentice\u201d\u2013esque boardroom from which Trump was holding his press conference. Several reporters\u2019 phones erupted with emergency alerts in the midst of Trump\u2019s Q&A session.\n\n\u201cI heard that, I just heard that news,\u201d Trump said when the Suffolk news was brought up. \u201cWe\u2019re number two in Suffolk, which is a great poll.\u201d After briefly trashing Jeb Bush on Common Core, immigration, and Iraq, he returned to his effusive praise of Suffolk University\u2019s polling operation. \u201cI saw that, that we\u2019re the top two in New Hampshire. That\u2019s a great poll, by the way. They say that\u2019s the best of all the New Hampshire polls, so I\u2019m greatly honored by the result.\u201d\n\nI asked him about that other part of the poll, that showed his favorability ratings in the toilet. Or at least, I began asking him about it, before he waved me off: \u201cOkay, I know the answer to that before you ask the question.\u201d What he said, however, was not so much an answer as a spiel of various thoughts with poor tense alignment. \u201cWe did very well in the Suffolk poll,\u201d he reiterated, \u201cbut the second part of that question was, nobody thinks I was running! In fact I filed yesterday. Everyone was saying, \u2018He\u2019ll never file, he\u2019ll never file, well, now he filed.\u2019 My numbers are much, much better than people ever thought, the company is a phenomenal company, now they\u2019re saying \u2018Wow, it\u2019s a really fantastic company.\u2019 But as you know, they all said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019ll never file.\u2019 So a lot of the numbers that you see are because people didn\u2019t think I was running. So now that I\u2019m running, the numbers are very good.\u201d\n\nNone of this helped explain how he would win over the many, many Republican voters who are familiar with Donald Trump and have determined that they could never see themselves supporting his bid for political office. Oh well! He had to be whisked away to deliver a brief keynote address to the Maryland Republican Party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The entertainer is finally running a certified presidential campaign.
