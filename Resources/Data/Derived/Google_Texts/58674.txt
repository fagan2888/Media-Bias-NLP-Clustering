Those who didn't feel like cooking for Christmas, a local restaurant became an option.

Boar's Head Restaurant and Tavern on Front Beach Road hosted its third annual Christmas dinner buffet. The restaurant received more than 900 reservations for the buffet , and they tried to accommodate any walk-in customers.

Boar's head is family owned and operated, and has been open in Panama City Beach since 1978. From appetizers to dessert, everything Boar's Head serves is made from scratch. A lot of their dishes come from family recipes.

"If I am going to have homemade stuffing, this, that, and the other, I am going to have homemade desserts to go with it," said Boar's Head owner Barry Ross. "It's been very well received by our customers. We have a lot of them that have come back for every buffet that we have done, and they like and appreciate that we are sticking to those traditional recipes."

Boar's Head is now taking reservations for their New Year's Day buffet event.
