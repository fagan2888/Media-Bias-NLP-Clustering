But states and cities are already poised to make demands, said John D. Colombo, a professor of tax law at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nIn a case that is being closely watched, Pittsburgh this year filed suit challenging the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s tax-exempt status, saying that the medical center should pay some payroll taxes and more property taxes, estimated to total about $20 million annually.\n\n\u201cIts commitment to charity is dwarfed by its preoccupation with profits,\u201d E. J. Strassburger, the city\u2019s lead lawyer on the case, wrote in a letter to the city solicitor. He said that the hospital failed most, if not all, of Pennsylvania\u2019s criteria for a tax-exempt charity, and that its annual report described it as a \u201c$10 billion global health enterprise,\u201d with excess operating revenue of nearly $1 billion and reserves of more than $3 billion. The institution paid 20 executives more than $1 million annually, he said. Despite a charity policy, the hospital made little effort to take care of poor people except in emergencies, he asserted, spending only about 2 percent of its net patient revenues on charity care.\n\nThe hospital does not dispute that figure but says it is being misconstrued. It acknowledges spending about $87 million \u2014 about 2 percent \u2014 in donated care for patients who qualify for financial assistance. But it says that it effectively donates about another $150 million when accounting for Medicaid shortfalls and patients who did not pay bills, and that it contributes to the city in other ways, like financing college scholarships for public school students. The medical center \u2014 which has countersued \u2014 says that the city is abusing tax laws in singling it out since it is following rules for nonprofits.\n\nBut many experts argue that most hospitals today do not deserve their tax-exempt status.\n\n\u201cThe standard nonprofit hospital doesn\u2019t act like a charity any more than Microsoft does \u2014 they also give some stuff away for free,\u201d Professor Colombo said. \u201cHospitals\u2019 primary purpose is to deliver high quality health care for a fee, and they\u2019re good at that. But don\u2019t try to tell me that\u2019s charity. They price like a business. They make acquisitions like a business. They are businesses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe exact value of tax benefits is difficult to estimate for any particular hospital, but the benefits include exemptions from federal and state taxes, local property taxes and sales taxes, said Simone Singh, a professor of health management at the University of Michigan.\n\nMany tax experts say that, at the very least, more stringent reporting standards are needed to ensure that tax-exempt hospitals fulfill their mandate.\n\nUnder current practices, they say, hospitals can overstate the value of the charity care they provide by subtracting the fees they collect from their estimated costs, which are highly subjective. If a hospital forgives a $3,000 bill for three stitches for a poor patient, how much of that should be counted as charity if the charges are greatly inflated?\n\nSome patients who are hard pressed to pay today\u2019s high charges found that hospitals can be aggressive in bill collection. When David DiCola, 61, went to Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence, R.I., for treatment of a finger infection, the bill was about $1,500. Uninsured, he offered the hospital $500; it refused his offer and sent it to a collection agency, he said.\n\nAfter Oliver Nisch, 49, of San Francisco, was hit by a car that ran a red light last year, he spent about 12 hours in the emergency room at San Francisco General Hospital. When the driver\u2019s insurance took a long time to pay, the hospital began billing him for $37,000, an amount he said he could not pay; his health insurance policy has a deductible of $10,000. The hospital, he said, sent him a reduced bill of $26,000 and \u201cwent after me like crazy.\u201d\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine study found that religious hospitals provided no more benefit to their communities than nonreligious ones, but that major teaching hospitals provided \u201csomewhat more\u201d \u2014 though that tended to come in the form of hard-to-quantify services, rather than direct patient care.\n\nFor example, on its 2011 tax form, Johns Hopkins Hospital said it spent about 11 percent of revenues on charity care and community benefit, but only about 2 percent was on free or discounted treatment. More than half was spent on educating health care professionals; it did not take any credit for treating Medicaid patients or research.\n\nBy contrast, the Cleveland Clinic said that nearly 14 percent of its revenue was spent on activities that would qualify. But two-thirds of that was for professional education and research, and it did claim credit for its so-called Medicaid shortfall.\n\n\u201cThere are many gray areas,\u201d Dr. Young said. \u201cIs there manipulation? Absolutely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131216200548, "twitter": {"description": "Cities still reeling from the recession are challenging the billions of dollars in tax breaks granted to the nation\u2019s nonprofit hospitals.", "title": "Benefits Questioned in Tax Breaks for Nonprofit Hospitals", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/benefits-questioned-in-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002606557"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "nytrosenthal", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/us/CHARITY/CHARITY-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/benefits-questioned-in-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002606557", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/benefits-questioned-in-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Benefits Questioned In Tax Breaks For Hospitals", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 16, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Internal Revenue Service", "keywords": "Tax Credits  Deductions and Exemptions,Hospitals,Nonprofit Organizations,Internal Revenue Service,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care", "news_keywords": "Hospital", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Elisabeth Rosenthal", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/us/CHARITY/CHARITY-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Cities still reeling from the recession are challenging the billions of dollars in tax breaks granted to the nation\u2019s nonprofit hospitals.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/us/CHARITY/CHARITY-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Cities still reeling from the recession are challenging the billions of dollars in tax breaks granted to the nation\u2019s nonprofit hospitals.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 16, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/elisabeth_rosenthal/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2013-12-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "17charity", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140718033255, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/us/benefits-questioned-in-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/us/CHARITY/CHARITY-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Cities still reeling from the recession are challenging the billions of dollars in tax breaks granted to the nation\u2019s nonprofit hospitals.", "title": "Benefits Questioned in Tax Breaks for Nonprofit Hospitals"}, "pdate": 20131216, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002606557, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Benefits Questioned in Tax Breaks for Nonprofit Hospitals", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTax-exempt hospitals devote the money they would pay in tax to the health of the community,\u201d she said.\nMany tax experts say that, at the very least, more stringent reporting standards are needed to ensure that tax-exempt hospitals fulfill their mandate.\n\u201cHospitals\u2019 primary purpose is to deliver high quality health care for a fee, and they\u2019re good at that.\nMore than half was spent on educating health care professionals; it did not take any credit for treating Medicaid patients or research.\nSome patients who are hard pressed to pay today\u2019s high charges found that hospitals can be aggressive in bill collection."}
