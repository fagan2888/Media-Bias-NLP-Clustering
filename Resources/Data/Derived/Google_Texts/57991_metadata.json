The Coast Guard launched a Jayhawk helicopter out of Air Station Sitka and the Coast Guard Cutter Liberty was diverted from patrol to the area. Alaska State Troopers and Juneau Mountain Rescue were also involved in the search.\n\nThe four survivors were taken to area hospitals with \"significant injuries.\" Alaska State Troopers identified the pilot as 45-year-old Fariah Patterson of Birmingham, Ala. The passengers were Humberto Herrera, 57, and his wife, Sandra, 60, both of Juneau; Jose Vasquez, 15, of Puerto Rico; and Ernestine Hanlon-Able, 64 of Hoonah.\n\nTwo were listed in stable condition, one in serious and the fourth in critical condition.\n\nThe crash put Hoonah residents on edge because they depend on air travel to the area.\n\n\"We rely on air travel so much being from an island out here that it concerns us whenever we hear of plane crashes anywhere. This is very close to home and the whole town is curious and anxious to know more,\" Hoonah mayor Ken Skaflestad said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pilot of a small plane died after the aircraft slammed into an Alaskan hillside Friday.
