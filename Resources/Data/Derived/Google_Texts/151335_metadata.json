Thankfully, we live in an age where premature babies are not nearly as much at risk as they would\u2019ve been even 20 years ago. After the preemie twins were born on Jan. 4, proud parents Anthea and Glen couldn\u2019t help but notice the unshakeable bond they developed as evidenced by the pair holding hands shortly after delivery.\n\n\u201cBoth my angels holding hands again as if they were born to,\u201d Jackson-Rushford wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cAmazing sight!\u201d\n\nIn the video above, you can see Glen holding Kristiana and Kristian against his bare chest. This technique, dubbed \u201cKangaroo Care,\u201d promotes skin-to-skin contact, which in turn stabilizes temperature, heart rate, and breathing. Kangaroo care is often recommended as a method parents can use to prevent some of the physical and mental complications that are often associated with premature births.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, premature births are down compared to the past, but still remain a major public health concern. One out of every 10 babies in the U.S. is born prematurely \u2014 at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier. Children born prematurely run the risk of suffering from long-term health problems as they age, including sleep apnea, heart and metabolism problems, and autism.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "video, premature, twins, holding, each, others, hands, guaranteed, warm, your, heart", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "These premature twins were videotaped holding each other's hands a couple of hours after they were delivered.", "title": "Watching These Preemie Twins Hold Hands Will Warm Your Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/video-premature-twins-holding-each-others-hands-guaranteed-warm-your-heart-370274", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/01/20/video-premature-twins-holding-each-others-hands-guaranteed-warm-your-heart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These premature twins were videotaped holding each other's hands a couple of hours after they were delivered.", "title": "Watching These Preemie Twins Hold Hands Will Warm Your Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/video-premature-twins-holding-each-others-hands-guaranteed-warm-your-heart-370274", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/01/20/video-premature-twins-holding-each-others-hands-guaranteed-warm-your-heart.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/20/video-premature-twins-holding-each-others-hands-guaranteed-warm-your-heart.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-20T16:27:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-20T16:27:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "These premature twins were videotaped holding each other's hands a couple of hours after they were delivered."}, "article_summary": "\u201cAmazing sight!\u201dIn the video above, you can see Glen holding Kristiana and Kristian against his bare chest.\nOne out of every 10 babies in the U.S. is born prematurely \u2014 at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier.\nChildren born prematurely run the risk of suffering from long-term health problems as they age, including sleep apnea, heart and metabolism problems, and autism.\n\u201cBoth my angels holding hands again as if they were born to,\u201d Jackson-Rushford wrote on her Facebook page.\nThankfully, we live in an age where premature babies are not nearly as much at risk as they would\u2019ve been even 20 years ago."}
