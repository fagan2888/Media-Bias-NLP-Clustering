In the run-up to the passage in 2002 of the McCain-Feingold Act, which tightened the nation’s campaign contribution restrictions, Senator John McCain predicted, "There will be a period of time of relatively clean elections — I emphasize relative — and then we will find some smart people who find smart ways around it."

Mr. McCain proved prescient. Twelve years later, a series of workarounds and court rulings have allowed more cash than ever to flood the political system. In that period, the top dozen individual donors spent at least $396 million in federal elections — about 1.5 percent of the entire $28 billion spent across the country — and an additional $271 million in state elections. And those amounts understate the donors’ total contributions: They don’t, for example, include money given to political nonprofit groups, which are not required to disclose their donors. This is why the billionaire Koch brothers don’t appear on the list.

After McCain-Feingold, donors began to direct large checks to so-called 527 groups that could accept unlimited funds from individuals to spend on voter initiatives and advertising as long as they didn’t directly advocate for a candidate. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that political groups could also accept unlimited money from corporations and unions; "super PACs," which are able to advocate for votes, effectively replaced federal 527s. Meanwhile, four of the top 12 donors got there in part through aggressive spending on ballot initiatives in California.

In some cases, the bulk of a donor’s money went toward a losing cause: a failed initiative or a candidate who fell short. But in others, the largess could have tipped the scales of an election. When asked in 2012 whether he regretted spending so much on a voter measure, Tom Steyer replied: "W"hat was it they say in ‘The Untouchables’? Don’t take a knife to a gunfight."
