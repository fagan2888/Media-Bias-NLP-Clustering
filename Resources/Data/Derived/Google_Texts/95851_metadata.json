He tweaked his hamstring early in the Broncos\u2019 39-36 victory last week against Miami.\n\nWith Talib out, rookie Bradley Roby joined Chris Harris as the Broncos\u2019 starting corners. Tony Carter, a veteran who was inactive the previous three games, jumped into the No. 3 cornerback role, with Harris moving inside to the nickel spot.\n\nOmar Bolden was the Broncos\u2019 No. 4 and final cornerback.\n\nJ.T. update. Julius Thomas\u2018 left ankle did not come around this week as hoped. The tight end, who had a league-most 12 touchdown receptions through the first nine games, did not dress for a second consecutive game Sunday against the Chiefs.\n\nVirgil Green, a superior blocker, was the Broncos\u2019 starting tight end for a second consecutive week. Jacob Tamme also received playing time at the \u201coff\u201d or receiving tight end position.\n\nKickoff issues. Connor Barth made his place-kicking debut for the Broncos. He made his two short field goals of 22 and 24 yards in the first half, but his kickoffs were a problem.\n\nNone got close to the end zone, much less for a touchback as the Chiefs got out past their 30-yard line on all four first-half kickoff returns.\n\nSanders saluted. Before Emmanuel Sanders became one of the league\u2019s most explosive receivers, before he pushed for his first Pro Bowl berth, he was a Pittsburgh Steeler competing with Antonio Brown to get a uniform.\n\n\u201cTwo dogs, one bone,\u201d Sanders said of coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s weekly advice to them.\n\nHines Ward remembers Sanders, who remained a key third-down weapon Sunday, for his attention to detail. The NBC broadcaster and former Steelers star talked with Sanders on the field before Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cWhat I always appreciated about him is how hard he worked. He would come to me and ask to do drills after practice,\u201d Ward said of workouts that have continued in Denver. \u201cHe just needed an opportunity. The thing I stressed to him is to learn all the positions. You can play in this league a long time if you can play all the receiver positions and run all the routes, not just on the outside.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Bolden continues to gain traction on special teams. He recovered a third-quarter fumble after Britton Colquitt\u2018s short punt ricocheted off Marcus Cooper. \u2026 Broncos guard Ben Garland, a former Air Force star, mocked the 20-degree weather, wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts in early pregame warm-ups. \u2026 Broncos defensive tackle Marvin Austin, inactive last week, was back on the game-day roster Sunday against Jamaal Charles and the run-heavy Chiefs. \u2026 Offensive lineman Chris Clark, who started at right tackle in Denver\u2019s first five games, was inactive for a second consecutive game. \u2026 Paul Cornick was Denver\u2019s \u201cswing\u201d backup at offensive tackle, behind starters Ryan Clady and Louis Vasquez.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aqib Talib, Julius Thomas remain sidelined against Chiefs with injuries", "title": "Aqib Talib, Julius Thomas remain sidelined against Chiefs with injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/30/aqib-talib-julius-thomas-remain-sidelined-against-chiefs-with-injuries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B4_SP01FBNBROBRIEFSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B4_SP01FBNBROBRIEFSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-01T01:08:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:07:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1056\"", "article_summary": "Jacob Tamme also received playing time at the \u201coff\u201d or receiving tight end position.\nVirgil Green, a superior blocker, was the Broncos\u2019 starting tight end for a second consecutive week.\n\u2026 Broncos defensive tackle Marvin Austin, inactive last week, was back on the game-day roster Sunday against Jamaal Charles and the run-heavy Chiefs.\nTalib maintained his dubious streak of never playing all 16 games in any of his seven NFL seasons.\nThe tight end, who had a league-most 12 touchdown receptions through the first nine games, did not dress for a second consecutive game Sunday against the Chiefs."}
