The super rich. And now we can add another pelt to Pope Francis' collection: Internet trolls.\n\nIn statement released on Thursday, the Pope said the Internet and social media are making people across the world \"increasingly interdependent.\"\n\n\"The Internet, in particular, offers immense possibilities for encounter and solidarity,\" Francis said. \"This is something truly good, a gift from God.\"\n\nAt the same time, though, all those tweets and texts and comment streams can cause people to \"lose our bearings,\" said the 77-year-old pontiff.\n\n\"The speed with which information is communicated exceeds our capacity for reflection and judgement, and this does not make for more balanced and proper forms of self-expression,\" Francis said.\n\n\"The variety of opinions being aired can be seen as helpful,\" he continued, \"but it also enables people to barricade themselves behind sources of information which only confirm their own wishes and ideas, or political and economic interests.\"\n\nThere's a tinge of irony to the Pope's comments, considering that his own soaring popularity can be partially traced to the Internet and social media. According to a study released in November, Francis was the most talked about person online last year.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis won the Internet. Literally.\n\nWhether consciously or not, the Pope has become an unlikely poster boy for how stories spread in the modern world.\n\nPhotos and videos of him washing the feet of Muslim inmates, embracing a severely disfigured man and giving his pal a lift on the Popemobile have gone viral, with hundreds of thousands sharing the images.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis' greatest hits of 2013\n\n\"Goodness always tends to spread,\" Francis said in his apostolic exhortation, \"The Joy of the Gospel,\" a line that could have been uttered in the boardrooms of savvy online outlets like Upworthy and BuzzFeed.\n\nBut the Pope's theory of communication seems to derive from a more ancient source: his namesake, St. Francis of Assisi.\n\n\"Preach the Gospel all the time. Use words when necessary,\" the 13th century friar is often quoted as saying. (Some call the quote apocryphal.)\n\nRather than \"bombarding people with religious messages,\" the Pope urged Catholics on Thursday to listen patiently and engage their interlocutors' doubts and questions.\n\n\"Let our communication be a balm which relieves pain and a fine wine which gladdens hearts,\" Francis said.\n\nThe Pope also warned against spending too much time online, saying the \"desire for digital connectivity\" can sometimes isolate people from their friends, family and neighbors.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to be passers-by on the digital highways, simply 'connected'; connections need to grow into true encounters,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot live apart, closed in on ourselves. We need to love and to be loved. We need tenderness. Media strategies do not ensure beauty, goodness and truth in communication.\"\n\nDrawbacks aside, the Pope did not argue that people should reject social media, which he said can foster unity and \"help us feel closer to each other.\"\n\nInstead he argued that advances in bits and bytes shouldn't distract from the fact that digital communication is, at root, about people connecting with each other.\n\n\"What is it, then, that helps us, in the digital environment, to grow in humanity and mutual understanding?\" the Pope asked.\n\n\"We need, for example, to recover a certain sense of deliberateness and calm. This calls for time and the ability to be silent and to listen. We need also to be patient if we want to understand those who are different from us.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) Careerist clergy.
