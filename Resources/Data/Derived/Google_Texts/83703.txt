Little Browynn Birdsong died without a whimper of self-pity, spending the final moments of his too-short life comforting his grieving family.

The Salina Journal reports that the Marquette, Kansas, 2-year-old died Thursday at his home after a six-month battle with a rare form of brain cancer. His parents and four siblings were at his side.

Browynn's father, Dustin Birdsong, says that when someone in the family would start to break down, Browynn would reach out, offer a pat on the back and say, "I love you."

Browynn underwent two major surgeries and several treatments, some experimental, but the tumor was too aggressive.

Three public funeral events are planned, including a celebration of Browynn's life at 11 a.m. Tuesday in the gymnasium of Marquette Elementary School.
