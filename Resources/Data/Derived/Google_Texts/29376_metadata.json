(CBS4)\u2013 Colorado Congressman Ken Buck has thrown his support behind fellow Republican Ted Cruz for president.\n\nBuck, a Republican representing Northern Colorado, announced his endorsement on Wednesday. He will also serve as the Colorado chairman for Cruz\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cWe need a strong, conservative leader in the White House,\u201d said Buck in a statement. \u201cTed Cruz is that leader. He has consistently and passionately fought hard against the Washington establishment in order to restore the power back to the American people. We need Ted in 2016 in order to help restore America back to the principles that made this country exceptional.\u201d\n\nIn turn, Cruz offered some supporting words in his choice of Buck to lead his campaign in Colorado.\n\n\u201cKen has been a champion for conservative principles during his time in Congress,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cHe has stood up and fought against Obama\u2019s lawlessness, worked to protect life and marriage and to repeal Obamacare. Ken is a tireless leader and has served the people of Colorado well. I am thrilled to have his support and look forward to working together to bring conservatives together to win the White House in 2016.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado Congressman Ken Buck has thrown his support behind fellow Republican Ted Cruz for president.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/01/20/rep-ken-buck-endorses-ted-cruz-for-president/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ted_cruz1.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ted_cruz1.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Colorado Congressman Ken Buck has thrown his support behind fellow Republican Ted Cruz for president.", "title": "Rep.
