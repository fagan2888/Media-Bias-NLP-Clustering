Our clients will be able to identify at-risk populations, which will lead to timelier and more personalized clinical interventions. This can reduce costs and improve care.\u201d\n\nMidas+ serves over 2,200 healthcare provider facilities and is the market leader in workflow solutions, quality, regulatory management and actionable insights that improve patient care.\n\nHCI\u2019s software-as-a-service platform centralizes proprietary, healthcare and community data to help hospitals and other health organizations manage population health. By tapping data derived from clinical visits, healthcare claims, and community-level assessments, healthcare providers and others can better understand community demographics, risk factors and disease distribution. HCI supports more than 250 hospitals, public health organizations and community health and employer coalitions across 36 states and covers over 100 million lives across the United States.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes that this data is the largest determinant of population health and can be used to improve overall health status and reduce chronic conditions1.\n\nHCI\u2019s data and insight will be integrated with Midas+\u2019s JuvoTM Care Performance analytics platform, creating the largest repository for insight on factors that impact population health. It will also provide socioeconomic and environmental context for individual clinical care information. This combination creates a comprehensive view of patient care and puts evidence-based actionable recommendations into the hands of providers, with the aim of producing better healthcare outcomes.\n\nHCI\u2019s current clients include 75 public health departments at the city, county and state level.\n\n\u201cHealth organizations are under pressure to more actively engage patients and the communities they serve,\u201d said Lanning. \u201cHCI offers valuable insight on specific populations so health organizations can tailor community programs to efficiently meet the demands of today\u2019s healthcare challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity-level insight is a critical component of population health management,\u201d said Deryk Van Brunt, DrPH, president and CEO, Healthy Communities Institute. \u201cBy joining Xerox, HCI and our clients will benefit from the global company\u2019s powerful brand and its advanced analytics across the entire healthcare ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Healthy Communities Institute management team and its employees will remain with the company.\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nClick to Tweet\n\nAbout Xerox\n\nXerox is a global business services, technology and document management company helping organizations transform the way they manage their business processes and information.
