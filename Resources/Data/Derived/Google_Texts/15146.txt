Samantha Flynn has been touched by tragedy much more than your average 21-year-old.

"I called my mom, wanting her to come get me and she didn't answer," Samantha Flynn recalled. "So then I called my big sister and she was like, 'Well something happened.'"

Samantha Flynn was 13 years old when her mother, Beverly Flynn, was killed in Omaha’s Von Maur shooting.

"She was crazy. She was loving. She stood up for what is right. She didn't let people get her down," Samantha Flynn said of her mother.

This weekend marked the eighth year since the deadly shooting that killed eight people.

Just a few years after the shooting that took her mother’s life, Samantha Flynn was a junior at Millard South High School when a student shot and killed the assistant principal.

The tragedies, according to Samantha Flynn, have given her a new purpose.

"I just, through the whole thing, I just remember the comfort from (the officers)," Samantha Flynn said, remembering the day her mother was killed. "I was just this little girl and they were just doing their job, but they still made me feel safe, protected, comforted. One just came up and gave me a hug."

That embrace left a lasting memory and is now motivating Samantha Flynn to get a degree in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Her goal is to become an Omaha police officer.





She already has an idea what she might say to a family facing devastating news.

"Don't give up, because it will get better," Samantha Flynn said. "It's totally about giving back and being there for the community who was there for me, who is still there for me. I owe my life to this community."

Samantha Flynn said she will graduate in the spring of 2017. At the ceremony, she said, her mother's presence will be felt as she walks across the stage.
