Shares of Laboratory Corporation of America took a dive after hours, dropping more than 6% in recent action to $92.69, after the medical diagnostics company forecast 2014 earnings that fell more than a dollar per share short of analyst estimates, with Obamacare one of the key uncertainties heading into the new year.

Informally known as LabCorp /quotes/zigman/258903/delayed /quotes/nls/lh LH , the company said its 2013 earnings are on target for a range of $6.90 to $7.05 a share, within the $7.02 projection from analysts polled by FactSet.

But next year the picture is bleaker, the company said in a press release, with a “challenging operating environment” hitting earnings throughout 2014. The FactSet forecast called for earnings of $7.56 a share, but the company sees that figure at $6.50 a share.

LabCorp sees higher deductible and co-pay plans, insurance reimbursement issues and uncertainties centered around President Obama’s health-care overhaul cutting into use of its services.

“We continue to operate in a very difficult environment,” LabCorp Chairman and Chief Executive David P. King said in prepared remarks.
