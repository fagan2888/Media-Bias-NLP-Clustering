But to many academics it is taboo to even consider outsourcing the faculty.\n\nNot in Michigan. In recent years, a handful of community colleges in that state have outsourced the recruitment and hiring of adjunct instructors \u2013 who make up the overwhelming majority of the community college teaching force \u2013 to an educational staffing company. Just last week, the faculty union at a sixth institution, Jackson College, signed a collective bargaining agreement allowing EDUStaff to take over adjunct hiring and payroll duties.\n\nThe union isn\u2019t necessarily happy about the agreement, though. Alana Tuckey is associate professor of mathematics and statistics at Jackson College and president of its National Education Association-affiliated faculty association, which primarily represents full-time faculty member. She said both adjuncts -- who are not part of the union -- and full-time faculty members are \u201cconcerned\u201d about what EDUStaff hiring means for the faculty and how it will affect \u201cinstruction, students and professional relationships.\u201d\n\nJackson's faculty and administration have worked hard for the past few years to form stronger connections between adjunct instructors and the college, Tuckey said, so \u201cthere is great concern among all faculty that privatization [of adjunct employment] will cause a rift to occur.\u201d\n\nTuckey said that just how involved EDUStaff will be in the adjunct hiring process remains to be seen, as it depends on the company's final contract with the college. The level of \u201cuncertainty\u201d about privatization makes it hard to know just how things will play out, starting in September, she said.\n\nIn 2009, Kirtland Community College, a relatively small college in rural Michigan, floated the idea of using EDUStaff to hire and pay some of its adjunct instructors. The Grand Rapids-based company focused mainly on staffing substitutes and permanent contract employees for K-12 schools, but Kirtland saw opportunity at the college level.\n\nThe idea, in part, was to skirt Michigan\u2019s comparatively high mandatory employer contribution (then nearly 17 percent of payroll, and now even greater) to the state\u2019s retirement fund; private employers, such as EDUStaff, don\u2019t have to contribute to the fund \u2013 even if their employees are working at public colleges. (The state also requires a smaller percentage contribution from individual employees of public institutions.) Kirtland said that many adjuncts don\u2019t stay around long enough or work enough hours to ever draw from the retirement fund anyway, but the plan proved controversial and was temporarily put on hold.\n\nIn the meantime, four other colleges privatized their adjunct hiring processes with EDUStaff. North Central Michigan College began using EDUStaff to employ its part-time faculty members \u2013 who make up 84 percent of the faculty and teach about 60 percent of courses \u2013 two years ago. Carol Laenen, a college spokeswoman, said ending retirement contributions saved the college at least $250,000 in the first year.\n\nWhen North Central Michigan needs a new adjunct faculty member but doesn\u2019t know of a candidate, Laenen said, an administrator composes a job description and sends it to EDUStaff to advertise the position. EDUStaff collects r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from applicants and sends them to the college\u2019s director of adjuncts and the hiring dean. They interview candidates and select one to refer back to EDUStaff for \u201conboarding\u201d and processing. North Central handles orientation, and EDUStaff continues to serve as the payroll provider.\n\nKirtland recently signed on to EDUStaff, as well. Sarah Madonna, a spokeswoman for the college, said she couldn\u2019t yet comment on how the agreement with EDUStaff worked, since Kirtland is \u201conly just beginning to use EDUStaff as a personnel solution for our adjunct staffing needs.\u201d\n\nBeyond acting as a payroll provider, EDUStaff offers recruitment, screening and hiring of instructors for schools and colleges -- a constant process, given the short-term nature of most adjunct faculty contracts.\n\nClark Galloway, president of EDUStaff, said it plays an important role in helping colleges find qualified instructors.\n\n\u201cAs it is becoming more difficult to find qualified candidates willing to teach certain classes, these colleges reached out to us to assist in managing and building their adjunct services,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAs we also perform all of the payroll and [Affordable Care Act] responsibilities as well, this has been a \u2018value added\u2019 service for our community colleges and their continued need to find and retain qualified adjunct professors in today\u2019s employment market.\u201d\n\nAt Jackson, Cynthia Allen, vice president of administration and human resources, said EDUStaff is recruiting new applicants from a broader pool than the college can attract on its own, but with final approval on teaching qualifications still coming from department chairs. The service also offers online training for sexual harassment and other work place issues, does criminal background checks on new employees and provides information on an optional 401K plan.\n\n\u201cEduStaff certainly does help from an administrative standpoint, as we have over 600 adjuncts on record,\u201d Allen said via email. \u201cAs well, many of our adjuncts are working for the money and don\u2019t work enough hours to get vested in the retirement system. These individuals would love more pay and can now put money in their own 401K.\"\n\nEven if EDUStaff is taking off in Michigan, adjunct advocates and experts say the faculty outsourcing trend raises lots of concerns about the future of shared governance and other matters.\n\nAdrianna Kezar, a professor of higher education at the University of Southern California who studies faculty trends as director of the Delphi Project on the Changing Faculty and Student Success, said she\u2019s heard of instructor outsourcing, but didn\u2019t know how widespread it had become.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the larger trend toward outsourcing student services such as residence hall operations, she said, but is much more problematic in that it \u201cmoves away from educational values being forefront in whatever the area is.\"\n\nIn other words, Kezar said, it \u201cleads to educational values now being left out of hiring teachers. The core function and mission of the institution being outsourced is fairly ludicrous.\u201d Institutions need to be more \u201cembedded\u201d in faculty hiring, not more distant from it, she said.\n\nKezar added: \u201cWhy aren't we outsourcing administrators and staff if this is such a good idea?\u201d\n\nMaria Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, a national adjunct advocacy organization, said \"the problem with this kind of administrative decision is that it's really not just about keeping costs down, it\u2019s part of the corporatization of higher ed.\u201d\n\nMaisto called the outsourcing of adjunct labor \u201can attempt to undermine the governance and pedagogical rights and responsibilities of faculty,\u201d and a step in the wrong direction -- even at a time when some administrators and accreditors are showing a growing interest in the changing faculty.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf I were a student or the parent of a student considering attending these colleges, I would consider this a sign that the institution is probably not really committed to quality higher education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/21/colleges-assign-adjunct-hiring-third-party", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Michigan colleges are assigning the hiring and payment of adjuncts to a third-party company.
