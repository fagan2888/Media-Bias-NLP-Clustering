Dec. 31 is the deadline for those with retirement plans to take their annual required minimum distribution, or RMD, from their accounts.\n\nAlso known as minimum required distribution, or MRD, this is the mandatory minimum yearly withdrawal that you must make from your traditional IRA and defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s or 403(b)s, starting in the year you turn 701/2.\n\nThe IRS requires this because it wants its money after years of deferred taxes on the funds.\n\n\u201cIn exchange for this tax deferral, you are required to take the money out and pay tax on it during your retirement years,\u201d said Tom Murphy, certified financial planner at Murphy & Sylvest in Dallas.\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the money out by the deadline, you\u2019ll suffer dearly for it. The IRS penalty is 50 percent of the amount that you should have withdrawn.\n\n\u201cIf you had a $10,000 MRD and you failed to take that $10,000, the IRS would be looking for a $5,000 penalty,\u201d said Maura Cassidy, director of retirement at Fidelity Investments.\n\nSimply put, the RMD requirement applies to any retirement account in which you\u2019ve contributed tax-deferred money or had tax-deferred earnings.\n\nIt does not apply to Roth IRAs during the owner\u2019s lifetime but does after the account owner\u2019s death.\n\nBeyond that, the rules regarding RMDs are complicated, so it\u2019s a good idea to consult a financial adviser.\n\nHow it\u2019s calculated\n\nGenerally, an RMD is calculated for each retirement account by dividing the account\u2019s balance on the previous Dec. 31 by a life expectancy factor that the IRS publishes in various tables.\n\n\u201cFor example, if you are 71 years old and your IRA balance was $100,000 on Dec. 31, 2013, you divide that amount by 26.5, making your 2014 RMD $3,773.58, which must be taken out of the account by Dec. 31, 2014,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe IRS tables are designed to force all the money out of the retirement plans over your life expectancy.\u201d\n\nYour spouse\u2019s age also is important when calculating your RMD, and it affects which IRS table you need to use.\n\nIf your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your retirement plan and he or she is more than 10 years younger than you, you use the Joint and Last Survivor Table to calculate your RMD.\n\n\u201cIf your spouse is more than 10 years younger than you, then the amount that you have to take out is less,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThe idea is that IRA is covering for two lives and it\u2019s a longer life expectancy. They allow you to stretch it out longer because of the younger spouse.\u201d\n\nIf your spouse isn\u2019t the only beneficiary or isn\u2019t more than 10 years younger than you, you use the Uniform Lifetime Table.\n\nKnow the rules\n\nIf this is your first time taking an RMD, you don\u2019t have to worry about the Dec. 31 deadline because you have until April 1 to withdraw the money.\n\nBut don\u2019t dilly-dally.\n\n\u201cWe caution people: If they do delay it, they\u2019ll have to take two next year,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to take the 2014 MRD by April 1, and then they\u2019d have to take their 2015 MRD by Dec. 31.\u201d\n\nAnd that could spell trouble come tax time because \u201cyou would have to pay taxes on both distributions in one year,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nAlso, taking two RMDs in the same year could push you into a higher tax bracket.\n\n\u201cTherefore, most people take their first distribution in the year they turn 701/2 and do not postpone it to the next year,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHave the cash ready\n\n\u201cIf you have any holdings in the account that you need to liquidate in order to have the MRD distributed, I would definitely recommend taking that action now because it can take several days to have the holdings settle and be able to come out of the account,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come up on the last few days of the year without having the right amount ready to distribute.\u201d\n\nMultiple accounts\n\nSo what if you have more than one type of retirement plan?\n\nThis is common. You may have several IRAs and 401(k)s, and the rules for each are different.\n\n\u201cIf all your plans are IRAs, you may take your RMD out of one plan, out of all of them or any combination,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nIn other words, the RMDs for your IRAs must be calculated separately, but the total can be taken out of one of the IRAs or any combination of the accounts.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have two IRAs and the RMD for each is $5,000. You can take it all from one account, or take a portion from each IRA as long as the total adds up to $10,000.\n\nThe rules are different for 401(k)s: An RMD must be taken separately from each of them.\n\nSo in the previous example, you would have to take the entire $5,000 from the 401(k) for which the RMD is calculated.\n\n\u201cFor a 401(k), it\u2019s more plan-specific,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cWe always recommend people talk to the plan provider if they have any questions.\u201d\n\nStill working?\n\n\u201cIf you are over 701/2 and still working, you are not required to take distributions from an employer-sponsored plan unless you own 5 percent or more of the company,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou are, however, required to take RMDs from any IRAs.\u201d\n\nThere are benefits to delaying withdrawal of the money.\n\n\u201cIf you are working and are younger than 701/2, then most of the time you will want to defer taking Social Security and should not take retirement plan distributions, allowing the money to compound,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nFollow Pamela Yip on Twitter at @pamelayip.\n\nHave a financial question?
