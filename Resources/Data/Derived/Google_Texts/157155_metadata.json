She saw many parts of the health care industry, from hospice care to cancer research centers.\n\nShe spent the afternoon at the Harper Cancer Research Institute on Notre Dame\u2019s campus. Walorski credits the working partnership between Notre Dame and Indiana University, private and public schools, for making such advancements in breast cancer and colon cancer research.\n\nWalorski was given a briefing by research staff explaining the different projects currently in progress and how important funding is to their studies. She was also able to see labs and talk to scientists about their goal. She also asked the researchers what they needed from Congress to continue their work.\n\nWalorski told Washington Bureau reporter Alex Miller that she has work to do when she heads back to Washington after Labor Day. Congress is scheduled to return from recess September 8th.\n\n\"Doing right for the sake of right, for me, is going back and really continuing to fight for funding for research on these diseases. We have got to get cures going in this country, and it's been so long since we\u2019ve put research dollars in,\u201d she said.\n\nWalorski recently co-sponsored legislation with Michigan Congressman Fred Upton called 21st Century Cures. The bill worked to expedite the development of new drugs and devices to combat cancer.\n\nThe Congresswoman also made a point to discuss the Affordable Care Act. She said the research done in South Bend has given her a renewed sense of optimism that the health care industry can still make advancements, even with little funding. Walorski says she wants to focus on the baby-boomers who make up such a large population in South Bend.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congresswoman Jackie Walorski made her rounds at her district\u2019s health care facilities Wednesday morning.
