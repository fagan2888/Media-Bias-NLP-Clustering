His 5-year-old brother Ghalib and mother Rehan also died, along with other refugees on the same trip. From Reuters:\n\nThe two boats, carrying a total of 23 people, had set off separately from the Akyarlar area of the Bodrum peninsula, a senior Turkish naval official said. The confirmed dead included five children and one woman. Seven people were rescued and two reached the shore in life jackets. The official said hopes were fading of saving the two people still missing.\n\nKurdi's background may explain why his life had such a tragic ending. He was from the north Syrian town of Kobani, which had been the scene of heavy hostility between the ISIS and Kurdish regional forces in recent months, reports Reuters. Such violence has forced tens of thousands of Syrians to seek asylum in Europe.\n\nThe disturbing pictures of Kurdi lying face down in the sand will now and forever be a scarring image of the Syrian crisis, yet sadly his story is far from being an anomaly.\n\nSo far this year, more than 2,500 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean, the UNHCR said.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration has determined that about 350,000 migrants have tried to make similar trips since January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A disturbing image from the Syrian refugee crisis. .05/26/2016 5:20:40AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A disturbing image from the Syrian refugee crisis.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Syrian Toddler's Lifeless Body Found on Turkish Beach Shocks World", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/03/syrian-toddlers-lifeless-body-found-on-beach-shocks-world-n2047503", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/245/8d524c42-3309-4418-98de-5a1c38f4e4a9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A disturbing image from the Syrian refugee crisis.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Syrian Toddler's Lifeless Body Found on Turkish Beach Shocks World", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/03/syrian-toddlers-lifeless-body-found-on-beach-shocks-world-n2047503", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/245/8d524c42-3309-4418-98de-5a1c38f4e4a9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Syrian Toddler's Lifeless Body Found on Turkish Beach Shocks World, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce589\"", "article_summary": "The Syrian refugee crisis now has a horrifying image to its name: a young toddler whose body was found washed ashore a Mediterranean beach.\nSo far this year, more than 2,500 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean, the UNHCR said.\nThe International Organization for Migration has determined that about 350,000 migrants have tried to make similar trips since January.\nHis 5-year-old brother Ghalib and mother Rehan also died, along with other refugees on the same trip.\nThe disturbing pictures of Kurdi lying face down in the sand will now and forever be a scarring image of the Syrian crisis, yet sadly his story is far from being an anomaly."}
