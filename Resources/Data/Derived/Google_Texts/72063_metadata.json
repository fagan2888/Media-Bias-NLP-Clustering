David Vitter (R-La.) and House GOP leaders that would cut health subsidies for congressional and senior executive branch officials, according to sources familiar with the discussion at a private White House meeting. \u2026 Obama brought up the issue of the so-called Vitter language unprompted, according to one of the sources. The president and congressional Democrats also discussed how to set caps for discretionary spending for next year given the possibility that a short-term spending bill could fund the government for only a few months, and their shared perception of a need to come up with a larger budgeting plan to avoid governing, as Obama often says, \u201cfrom crisis to crisis,\u201d the sources said.\n\nJohn Boehner just isn\u2019t getting it. He can\u2019t keep caving to the tea partiers in caucus by devising legislation that is never going to be passed by the Senate, and signed by the president. This is the second time today that the White House has to tell House Republican no to changes on the ACA. The original House debt ceiling idea was immediately rejected by Senate Democrats and the White House because it too demanded changes to Obamacare.\n\nHouse Republicans continue to inaccurately assume that they can take this crisis down to the deadline, and force Democrats to choose between cutting and gutting the ACA or default. This strategy didn\u2019t work on the government shutdown. It hasn\u2019t worked on the debt ceiling, and it won\u2019t work as the country approaches a default.\n\nSpeaker Boehner has to decide whether he is going to follow the Ted Cruz lemmings in his caucus off the cliff and into a default. There seems to be a great deal of fascination with the fact that Boehner can\u2019t get enough votes for his own debt ceiling bill, but the reality is that the Speaker could end this drama right now if he wanted to.\n\nIf Boehner sincerely wants to avoid a default, all he has to do is pass a clean CR and debt ceiling extension. Unforunately, Rep. Boehner is more interested in saving his speakership than saving the country. The president isn\u2019t going to budge until Boehner does things the right way. Once and for all, President Obama is not going to pay House Republicans a ransom.\n\nEvery second that Boehner wastes on the impossible is another step towards a Republican caused default.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama isn't budging an inch on the ACA, as the White House has threatened to veto any House Republican debt ceiling bill that contains the Vitter Amendment.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama isn't budging an inch on the ACA, as the White House has threatened to veto any House Republican debt ceiling bill that contains the Vitter Amendment.", "title": "Obama Promises to Veto House Republican Debt Ceiling Bill If It Contains Vitter Amendment", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/15/obama-promises-veto-house-republican-debt-ceiling-bill-vitter-amendment.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/point-obama-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-15T18:22:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Debt Ceiling,obama veto vitter amendment,vitter amendment,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-15T18:22:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T18:22:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Debt Ceiling, obama veto vitter amendment, vitter amendment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe248e\"", "article_summary": "President Obama isn\u2019t budging an inch on the ACA, as the White House has threatened to veto any House Republican debt ceiling bill that contains the Vitter Amendment.\nThe original House debt ceiling idea was immediately rejected by Senate Democrats and the White House because it too demanded changes to Obamacare.\nThis is the second time today that the White House has to tell House Republican no to changes on the ACA.\nand House GOP leaders that would cut health subsidies for congressional and senior executive branch officials, according to sources familiar with the discussion at a private White House meeting.\nIt hasn\u2019t worked on the debt ceiling, and it won\u2019t work as the country approaches a default."}
