New video footage confirms what we have come to expect from Republican Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida: that he has some radically regressive views of voting rights laws.

Speaking at the Berean Baptist Church in Ocala, Florida, during his 2012 campaign, Mr. Yoho expressed his fondness for limiting voting to property owners, the new video reveals.

“I’ve had some radical ideas about voting and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,” Mr. Yoho says.

The first-term congressman’s campaign comments echo those made by Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips who said in 2010 that returning to 19th century voting laws “makes a lot of sense.”
