The Senate versus the House. Republicans opposed to Democrats. And, of course, the most intense battle, Republicans against Republicans.\n\nI grew up with the \u201cSpy vs. Spy\u201d comics from \u201cMad\u201d magazine. Week after week a white-clad spy would deliver some sort of lethal device (think exploding toilets) to a black-suited spy. The scenarios were always outlandish, and neither character ever really won. It\u2019s that way in D.C. now, except most of spies in combat are wearing Republican Red.\n\nThe spy-vs.-spy battle is alive and well on Twitter where there\u2019s a #dontblink campaign to convince those \u201csquishes\u201d (Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019 label for Republicans who lack conservative backbone) to support the filibuster. It\u2019s not going to happen, but it does increase the possibility of a government shutdown simply because Congress is running out of time to meet the October 1 deadline. (The Senate has rules about how much time is allowed for discussion after members vote to end debate.) That means any vote for a temporary budget to fund the government cannot occur until the end of the week, Friday or Saturday. Then it will go back to the House. Perhaps with changes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will send a \u201cclean\u201d resolution to the House, hoping that body will pass it without changes just to keep the doors open. But they probably won\u2019t. Then the process will start again \u2014 with the government officially closed. (On Tuesday, Senator Reid announced the measure will only fund the government until Nov. 15, leaving open the possibility of a regular-order budget.)\n\nThis is as goofy as \u201cSpy vs. Spy.\u201d And just like the comic strip, there\u2019s no real winner in sight. The games just go on and on.\n\nThere is a bigger problem for Indian Country, however. Actually two issues. First, any \u201cresolution\u201d of this crisis is temporary. The same debate will surface again over the debt limit in a couple of weeks and then again when this continuing resolution expires. The House bill only pays for government operations until December 15. So, even if the Senate\u2019s shorter version passes, the whole mess will repeat.\n\nThe second issue is that neither the House nor the Senate is ready to remove the sequester from the spending bill. That means that the budget will continue to shrink for the federal government \u2014 and tribes, schools, clinics, any agency that relies on appropriations.\n\nIdeally the House would have sent over its budget bill \u2014 and then the Senate would have added dollars to key programs, such as those that benefit Indian Country, and negotiations would have begun. But the focus on the Affordable Care Act has made time the enemy. To avoid a shutdown, the Senate\u2019s leadership is trying to send back to the House a bill that might quickly pass.\n\nAmerican Association of School Administrators.

That means the sequestration cuts in 2014 will total $109 billion, evenly split between Defense Department and non-defense programs. \u201cCongress should not ignore the significant funding gaps in critical public services on the non-defense side of the discretionary budget,\u201d say the report\u2019s authors, Joel Friedman, Richard Kogan and Sharon Parrott. \u201cCongress should replace sequestration with a sound package of balanced deficit-reduction measures that take effect as the economy strengthens.\u201d\n\nBut debate is not even occurring; the entire conversation is about the Affordable Care Act and what it will take for Congress to keep the doors open.\n\nThis past spring, the National Congress of American Indians said the U.S. Congress should find a way to hold Indian Country harmless from this round of budget cuts. \u201cThe sequester cuts pose particular hardship for Indian Country and the surrounding communities who rely on tribes as employers, where the recession struck especially hard,\u201d said the report, A Call to Honor the Promises To Tribal Nations in the Federal Budget. \u201cTribal leaders urge Congress to protect the federal funding that fulfills the trust responsibility to tribes in the face of difficult choices.\u201d\n\nThe list of programs affected by the sequester are in every corner of Indian Country, on reservations, in Alaska villages and in urban centers. It ranges from health-care delivery to education at all levels, representing a basic federal investment in the future (and in fulfilling solemn promises).\n\nBut the sequester isn\u2019t even being debated. Congress is too busy playing \u201cSpy vs. Spy.\u201d\n\nMark Trahant is the 20th Atwood Chair at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
