Just a little over one-third (36%) view immigrants as strengthening the nation via hard work and their talents.\n\nA far larger (43%) proportion of GOP voters say they would be more likely to support a presidential candidate who wants to deport all illegal immigrations than the percentage (30%) who would be less likely to support a candidate that adopted this stance.\n\nMore than two-thirds (68%) of those polled want a fence along the entire length of the US-Mexico border.
