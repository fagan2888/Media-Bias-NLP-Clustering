As a result, it says, the public has been deprived of the opportunity to comment on the rates.\n\nMissouri is one of the few states whose insurance departments have no authority to review health insurance rates for the individual market. Some states require health plans to justify rate increases; others require rate filings but may or may not exercise their authority to push rates down.\n\nIn Kansas, rate filings are required but the state so far has not been willing to identify the insurers for 2015 or their rates. KCUR filed a request for the information in June but was told by the insurance department that a request had been made that they be kept confidential.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, authorizes HHS to review proposed rate increases of 10 percent or more if HHS decides that a state does not have an effective rate review process. As of April, it was responsible for rate reviews in the individual markets of Missouri, Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.\n\nThe idea behind the authorization is to allow the public to submit comments on proposed rate increases. The council\u2019s lawsuit, however, says that HHS declined its requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the rate filing information.\n\n\u201cOne of the purposes of the Affordable Care Act is to ensure that all rates are reviewed and all rate filings \u2013 that is, the justification for rates that insurers submit to the insurance department or to HHS if the state insurance department isn\u2019t regulating rates \u2013 that those justifications be public,\u201d Jay Angoff, a former Missouri insurance commissioner and the attorney representing the Consumers Council of Missouri, said in a conference call.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason it\u2019s so important for those justifications to be public is that the ACA\u2026 and the (regulation) that HHS has put out contemplates the public will be able to comment on rate justifications and, if necessary, take issue with them.\u201d\n\nAsked if the department had a response to the lawsuit, Ben Wakana, an HHS spokesman, said in an email, \u201cWe are readying the rate change information. The department is committed to providing consumers accurate information so they can make informed decisions, and therefore, before the beginning of Open Enrollment, the agency will publish final insurance rates for all 50 states.\u201d\n\nAngoff said that because the Missouri insurance department has no power to approve or disapprove rates \u2013 insurers don\u2019t even have to file rates with the department -- the federal government under the ACA has the authority to disclose that information.\n\n\u201cHHS has not made any of this public,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t made the justifications for the rates public, it hasn\u2019t made the rates themselves public and it hasn\u2019t even made the identities of the carriers who are going to be selling in 2015 public. And that violates the Affordable Care Act, the statute itself.\u201d\n\nJoan Bray, the executive director of Consumers Council of Missouri, said that HHS had not been cooperative \u201cin helping Missourians get the information that we believe we need before open enrollment comes on Nov. 15.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt goes against all our sensibilities that other citizens of the United States, other residents who qualify for health care can know this in other states, but Missourians can\u2019t,\u201d she said in the conference call. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that we become full citizens under the health care law and get the same information.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated to include the response of the Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A Missouri consumers group has sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over its alleged failure to disclose health insurance rates insurers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/suit-seeks-force-feds-disclose-missouri-health-insurance-rates", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/201512/450px_fullcolorKCUR.png", "type": "article", "description": "A Missouri consumers group has sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over its alleged failure to disclose health insurance rates insurers", "title": "Suit Seeks To Force Feds To Disclose Missouri Health Insurance Rates"}, "story_id": 353045937, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@danmargolies"}, "author": "Dan Margolies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Suit Seeks To Force Feds To Disclose Missouri Health Insurance Rates"}, "nid": 62705, "datePublished": "2014-10-01", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 783, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Missouri is one of the few states whose insurance departments have no authority to review health insurance rates for the individual market.\nA Missouri consumers group has sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over its alleged failure to disclose health insurance rates insurers propose to charge in Missouri in 2015.\nAn HHS regulation requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an arm of HHS, to set up a procedure to enable the public to comment on proposed health insurance rates.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t made the justifications for the rates public, it hasn\u2019t made the rates themselves public and it hasn\u2019t even made the identities of the carriers who are going to be selling in 2015 public.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really important that we become full citizens under the health care law and get the same information.\u201dThis story was updated to include the response of the Department of Health and Human Services."}
