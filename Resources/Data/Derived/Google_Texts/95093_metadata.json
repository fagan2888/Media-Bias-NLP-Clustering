He said, 'We've never had a lawyer working in public health service, and you guys would be a great team,' \" the doctor recalls. \" 'I want you to call this guy, and I want you to call that guy '\"\n\n\"This guy\" turned out to be the current U.S. surgeon general. \"That guy\" was the reigning director of the National Institute of Health. And suddenly the Sadler twins, both fresh out of college, had a highly coveted first-floor office in Building One of the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nAt the NIH, they researched the laws in every state governing human bodies, including medical examiner laws, unclaimed body laws, body donation laws.\n\n\"Every state had different laws, because it's an area of state concern as set up by the Constitution,\" Sadler said. \"You don't want 50 different state laws when you're trying to transport human tissue across state lines.\"\n\nThe brothers were summoned to become chief consultants to a national group of lawyers, the Commission on Uniformed State Laws (now called the Uniformed Law Commission), to create a model law that would streamline all the state laws.\n\n\"So here we are, 26 years old, presenting this law to the commissioners and then, the following week, to the American Bar Association,\" Sadler said. \"What was amazing about the Uniformed Act was that because of the timing (human corneas were already being transplanted, and the first-ever heart transplant had just been performed), it passed every state in three years. No uniformed law had ever done that well.\"\n\nThe Sadlers, who now were being invited to speak at international conferences, were then recruited by the director of the NIH and the assistant secretary of health to examine fledgling programs at Duke and Colorado universities that were developing physicians assistants. The program, in part, helped military corpsmen with battlefield experience make an easier transition to civilian medical care.\n\n\"At the time, if you were a military corpsman, we said, 'Thank you for your service you can become an orderly, if you like, at $8 an hour or whatever they were being paid,\" said Sadler, whose new home base became Yale University. \"The initial military program that Duke started \u2014 which we followed at Yale \u2014 was designed as a mini-medical school where you could receive basic training in some of the sciences.\"\n\nIn 1972, the Sadlers were part of a conference at Duke that became the genesis of national education programs and accreditation for physicians assistants. The first exams were given in December 1973.\n\nAs the first president of the Association of Physicians Assistants Program (now the Physicians Assistant Education Association), Sadler presided over 16 accredited programs. Over the ensuing 42 years, the number of programs has grown to 189, producing about 7,000 graduates a year.\n\nDuring his time at Yale, the Sadlers also were asked to look at emergency medicine systems in America.\n\n\"It was a bunch of stuff that, in retrospect, seem so obvious, but emergency medicine in the U.S. was a disastrous situation at the time. The National Research Council said you had a better chance of surviving a serious injury on the battlefield in Vietnam than a bad accident on a U.S. highway,\" he said.\n\nAmbulances of the day were merely station wagons that could transport a gurney, but with no room for medical professionals or equipment. In Connecticut, where the Sadlers were based, there were 179 different ambulance companies, including one that doubled as a funeral company, rushing patients to the ER for treatment, and then taking them out the back door, to the funeral parlor, if treatment failed. Training for emergency medical technicians was nonexistent.\n\nThe Sadlers were recruited to join the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, where they co-chaired an advisory committee on emergency medical systems, which was instrumental in a reformed system that led to trained EMTs who rode in well-equipped, van-like ambulances.\n\nThey also helped develop and implement the system that became 911, enabling the public to summon emergency help without picking up a phone book to locate the nearest ambulance service.\n\n\"And we looked at the physicians who worked in emergency departments who, at the time, were mostly semi-retired doctors who didn't want to do a practice anymore,\" Sadler said. \"They were generally good people \u2014 former surgeons, former interns, former family doctors \u2014 but there was nobody who was trained across the board in emergency medicine. So we recommended certification courses for emergency doctors and nurses.\"\n\nThe Sadlers co-authored a book that, with the help of five major foundations, spread the word about their work to 8,000 people, including every U.S. congressman, public health school dean, medical school dean and state health director, and a lot of federal health officials.\n\n\"In 1975 we added an epilogue to the book that focused on the fact that physicians assistants are essentially the equivalent of new medical technology,\" he said.\n\nPhysicians assistant and nurse practitioner are annually listed by \"Forbes\" and \"Money\" magazines among the most valuable master's degrees to hold for those entering the workforce, he said. The demand will increase dramatically, he said, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides health care to many people who previously had none.\n\nIn 2009, Sadler joined the board of directors for the Physicians Assistant Society, serving as president in 2012 and 2013. Because of those volunteer duties, he has cut back his schedule at the Urgent Care Center in Salinas to about 10 hours a week.\n\nHe also is serving as an adviser for the physicians assistant program under development at CSUMB.\n\nDennis Taylor can be reached at 726-4371.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CARMEL &GT;&GT; In a few years \u2014 2019 is the target date \u2014 CSU Monterey Bay expects to launch a new master's degree program that will produce medical professionals known as physicians assistants \u2014 people who are trained to handle", "title": "Carmel doctor helped revolutionize medical treatment", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/ZZ/20141011/NEWS/141019674", "image": {"width": "192px", "identifier": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016", "height": "192px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Carmel doctor helped revolutionize medical treatment"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "CARMEL &GT;&GT; In a few years \u2014 2019 is the target date \u2014 CSU Monterey Bay expects to launch a new master's degree program that will produce medical professionals known as physicians assistants \u2014 people who are trained to handle", "title": "Carmel doctor helped revolutionize medical treatment", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/ZZ/20141011/NEWS/141019674", "image": {"src": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": ",  news, Monterey  news, CA  news, US  news, world  news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": ",  news, Monterey  news, CA  news, US  news, world  news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f49\"", "article_summary": "\"You don't want 50 different state laws when you're trying to transport human tissue across state lines.\"\nAt the NIH, they researched the laws in every state governing human bodies, including medical examiner laws, unclaimed body laws, body donation laws.\nTraining for emergency medical technicians was nonexistent.\nAs the first president of the Association of Physicians Assistants Program (now the Physicians Assistant Education Association), Sadler presided over 16 accredited programs.\n\"In 1975 we added an epilogue to the book that focused on the fact that physicians assistants are essentially the equivalent of new medical technology,\" he said."}
