The Powerball jackpot has hit a record-setting $1.5 billion -- and that means big profits for the 44 states participating in the lottery.

For Maryland, lottery profits are the fourth-largest contributor to its general fund, which largely supports public education. In fact, the majority of the states earmark the profits from lottery revenue for education, both K-12 public schools and public colleges and universities.

Other programs benefit as well. In Colorado, lottery money funds outdoor, wildlife and conservation programs, while Pennsylvania dedicates its profits to services for older residents. In Iowa, New Jersey and Texas, Powerball money supports veteran services. And in Kansas, North Dakota, Louisiana and Washington, money from the lottery funds programs for gambling addicts.
