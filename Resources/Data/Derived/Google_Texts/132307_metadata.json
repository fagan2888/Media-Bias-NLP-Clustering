Scott Walker, a possible 2016 presidential contender, and 43 percent weren\u2019t familiar with the name of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Less than 10 percent of people didn\u2019t recognize the name of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who\u2019s also eyeing the 2016 presidential race. And only 1 percent of Americans didn\u2019t know or were unsure about Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. (The pollsters did not ask what rock those people had been living under.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first survey to show that Americans are unaware of the first woman to head the Federal Reserve. A Pew Research Center News IQ survey from October 2014, for example, found that just 24 percent could correctly identify Yellen when asked to pick the Fed chair from a list of four names. Another 17 percent chose Alan Greenspan, who left the position in 2006, while 11 percent guessed Supreme Court Justices John Roberts or Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nRelated: Will Fed Rate Hikes Cost You in Higher Taxes?\u200b\u200b\n\n\u201cOf the 12 multiple-choice questions asked on the survey, only two proved harder than identifying the Fed chair: knowing the share of Americans at or below the poverty line and the activity on which the U.S. government spends the most money,\u201d Pew reported last year.\n\nYellen might find some small consolation \u2014 if she cares at all \u2014 in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll\u2019s finding that 10 percent of those surveyed had a somewhat or very positive view of Yellen while just 4 percent were somewhat or very negative about her. But odds are she has more important matters on her mind.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "She may be the most powerful woman in the country \u2014 arguably, in the world \u2014 but most", "title": "70% of Americans Don\u2019t Know the Woman Pulling Their Purse Strings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/Most-Powerful-Woman-World-Americans-Have-No-Clue-Who-She", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-16T223936Z_1_CBRE98F1QY900_RTROPTP_2_USA-FED-YELLEN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/Most-Powerful-Woman-World-Americans-Have-No-Clue-Who-She", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-09-16T223936Z_1_CBRE98F1QY900_RTROPTP_2_USA-FED-YELLEN.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "She may be the most powerful woman in the country \u2014 arguably, in the world \u2014 but most", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "She may be the most powerful woman in the country \u2014 arguably, in the world \u2014 but most Americans don\u2019t know who Fed Chair Janet Yellen is.\nAnd only 1 percent of Americans didn\u2019t know or were unsure about Barack Obama, George W.
