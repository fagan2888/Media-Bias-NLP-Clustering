According to Andrew Murphy, PhD, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, this research showed for the first time that \u201cNLRP1 is the key to IL-18 production, explaining how it acts to reduce obesity.\u201d\u201cOur long-term goal would be to develop a small molecule that activates the pathway to produce IL-18. In people who are obese, this would help the body to switch on this system and burn existing fat stores,\u201d said Murphy.Although these results are promising, the researchers cautioned that any therapy involving NLRP1 and IL-18 would have to be closely monitored to avoid potential side effects. This research showed that activation of NLRP1 \u201ccould be exacerbated by some diets, and identified that there is a fine balance between increasing the cell\u2019s fat burning abilities and causing harm,\u201d said Masters.Potential treatment would likely be safer \u201cif given in small doses over a long period of time, which is less likely to have potentially negative consequences,\u201d he said.The study results were reported in the article \u201cIL-18 Production from the NLRP1 Inflammasome Prevents Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome,\u201d published in Cell Metabolism In the study, mice that lacked NLRP1 (and thus IL-18) experienced \u201cspontaneous obesity due to intrinsic lipid accumulation,\u201d which was exacerbated by a high-fat or high-protein diet.
