What are their management strategies? And what do they do for fun? Executive Suite seeks answers to the behind-the-scenes questions.\n\nKeith Wandell\n\nCEO of Harley-Davidson Inc.\n\nCEO since: May 2009\n\nAge: 63\n\nYou were Harley-Davidson\u2019s first CEO to come from outside the company. Did you face skeptics?\n\nI don\u2019t know how to quantify it, but there was a significant amount of concern from our employees and our dealers. \u201cWhat can this person possibly know?\u201d \u2014 that type of thing.\n\nWhat were people\u2019s concerns about?\n\nFirst of all, I think there were some misconceptions about my background, thinking that my background had been largely in automotive. [That] really wasn\u2019t true, even though I did have some experience [there]. The automotive industry is a hyper competitive industry [and] there is a different sort of mentality to how the car companies look at the supply base: It\u2019s a more slice and burn kind of mentality. All those things culminated in a concern around \u201cThis guy is going to turn us into an auto-like company.\u201d\n\nHow did you earn employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 trust?\n\nReally by just listening and engaging them [and] recognizing the long, rich heritage of the company. That\u2019s important to all of our employees and all of our dealers \u2013 Harley-Davidson and what it stands for. So using that as sort of a backdrop, [saying] \u201cGuess what? We\u2019re not going change the formula for Coke here and mess it up, but the future\u2019s going to be different than the last 110 years.\u201d\n\nHow did you get up to speed on the company, coming from the outside?\n\nI don\u2019t sit in my office and wait for people to come see me. I walk around and talk to people. I walk into a meeting and ask, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I invited to this meeting?\u201d and sit down and start to participate.\n\nDid you ride motorcycles before taking this job?\n\nWhen I was younger.\n\nNow do you ride?\n\nOh yeah.\n\nHow often?\n\nMy first couple of years [at Harley] I rode a lot. I\u2019ve ridden the Sturgis [South Dakota motorcycle rally] three times. I\u2019ve ridden from Beijing to the Great Wall. I\u2019ve ridden from downtown Tokyo to Mt. Fuji. I\u2019ve ridden in the Hamburg rally. I\u2019ve ridden in the San Tropez rally in France. I would go home at night and just take my bike out in the summer and ride for a half hour, an hour, whatever. But then I had a surgery last year on my neck and lost the use of my right arm for a while.\n\nAs CEO, do you feel pressure to walk the walk \u2014 or ride the bike \u2014 so to speak?\n\nAt first I did, sort of. About three months after I was with the company, my wife said to me, \u201cDid they hire you to ride motorcycles or run the company?\u201d Because that\u2019s really a big priority in our company. We call it, \u201cWe ride with you.\u201d We ride with our customers. We listen to our customers because we\u2019re out there with them riding with them. We have this program where all of our executive management is required to attend like two rallies a year so that we\u2019re out there with our dealers, with our customers, listening to their feedback.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like for you at a big rally, riding with all these people who are on the product that you make?\n\nAssociated Press Thousands of of Harley-Davidson lovers met in Rome to celebrate the motorcycle company\u2019s 110th anniversary.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unbelievable. You see thousands of people. We were just in Rome for the 110th [anniversary of the company] and you see these thousands and thousands of bikes, right? And they\u2019ve got flags from Russia, from Czechoslovakia, from Saudi Arabia, from Italy, France, Germany. I mean it\u2019s just absolutely incredible. They all come together and it\u2019s just this sort of sense of camaraderie.\n\nYour cell phone ring tone is a motorcycle revving. Are there any other ways in which the company has become integrated into parts of your life?\n\nI have five children, three of whom are female. All three of them, they wear nothing but Harley gear. I mean, everywhere we go, they\u2019ve got their Harley stuff on.\n\nHow often do you wear Harley gear?\n\nEvery day. I wear jeans to work, Harley shirt. Everybody was worried I was going to wear a suit and tie to work and try to change the culture that way. I [couldn\u2019t] care less if I ever wore a tie again.\n\nOn the weekends do you wear Harley gear as well?\n\nOh yeah. Most of the time. I have a Harley golf bag.\n\nThe company\u2019s 110th anniversary is upon us. Where do you think the company will be in another 110 years? Flying motorcycles? Alternative fuel?\n\nI wish I knew.\n\nDo you anticipate huge changes or do you think we\u2019ll still be able to recognize Harleys?\n\nOh, you\u2019ll be able to recognize Harleys.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Harley-Davidson's first outside CEO on earning trust and riding bikes.", "title": "Harley-Davidson CEO: Getting Up to Speed", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2013/09/05/harley-davidson-ceo-getting-up-to-speed/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU416_0905ha_E_20130905150728.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Careers", "article.headline": "Harley-Davidson CEO: Getting Up to Speed", "description": "Harley-Davidson's first outside CEO on earning trust and riding bikes.", "article_section": "Careers", "author": "Rachel Feintzeig", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "At Work Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "At Work", "article.summary": "Harley-Davidson's first outside CEO on earning trust and riding bikes.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-05T19:54:54-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2013/09/05/harley-davidson-ceo-getting-up-to-speed/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-ATWORKB-1223", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Careers", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Harley-Davidson's first outside CEO on earning trust and riding bikes.", "title": "Harley-Davidson CEO: Getting Up to Speed", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2013/09/05/harley-davidson-ceo-getting-up-to-speed/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "At Work", "article.id": "BL-ATWORKB-1223", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-06T04:35:21-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0107\"", "article_summary": "Keith WandellCEO of Harley-Davidson Inc.CEO since: May 2009Age: 63You were Harley-Davidson\u2019s first CEO to come from outside the company.\nAs CEO, do you feel pressure to walk the walk \u2014 or ride the bike \u2014 so to speak?\nOn the weekends do you wear Harley gear as well?\nI\u2019ve ridden from Beijing to the Great Wall.\nI\u2019ve ridden from downtown Tokyo to Mt."}
