But it\u2019s more serious than that. It\u2019s the title of a new report from Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) tagging more than $1 billion of what he deems \u201cwasteful\u201d government spending \u2014 mostly in the Pentagon\u2019s sprawling defense budget.\n\nThe questionable expenditures of taxpayer dollars, including $50,000 for a study looking at whether elephants could be used to sniff out bombs, were highlighted just days after the Senate approved a Republican budget blueprint that increases defense spending and cuts $5 trillion from domestic programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nRelated: Government Waste Gets a New Warrior\n\nThe report by McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, takes its cue from former Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s infamous \u201cWastebook,\u201d which put a spotlight on government projects and programs of dubious value.\n\n\"Government spending is spiraling out of control,\" McCain writes in the report. \"The national debt recently exceeded $18 trillion, while our $486 billion deficit is projected to reach $1 trillion over the next decade. Washington's repeat fiscal offenses are leading us down a dangerous path \u2014 sending hard-earned American tax dollars to mismanaged and wasteful programs.\"\n\nThe report cites a new study from the Congressional Budget Office that found the federal government is spending $294 billion on programs no longer authorized to receive federal funding.\n\nAmong the agencies receiving unauthorized funds were the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nRelated: Coburn\u2019s Wastebook Highlights $25 Billion Taxpayer Loss\n\nThe report also blasts studies like the one by the Army to determine whether elephants could be used to detect bombs.\n\n\"While finding new ways to enhance our bomb detection methods is important, it is unlikely that African elephants could feasibly be used on the battlefield given their large size and sensitive status as \u2018threatened\u2019 under the Endangered Species Act,\" the report says.\n\nThe other programs can be found here.\n\nBefore Coburn retired, he released his \u201cWastebook\u201d report every year for the last five years, usually finding around $30 billion of \u201cwasteful programs.\u201d McCain said he\u2019ll be rolling new reports out throughout the year \u2014specifically focusing on the Pentagon.\n\nRep. Steve Russell, (R-OK) has also taken up Coburn\u2019s waste-warrior cudgel. He released his own waste report earlier this year. Russell\u2019s \u201cWaste Watch\u201d targets 10 different programs costing $117 million. Like McCain\u2019s report, Russell\u2019s primarily targets the Pentagon, which is often scrutinized for how it spends its money.\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t appear to be too worried about it, though, since it just approved more money for defense.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/Bomb-Sniffing-Elephants-Among-1-Billion-America-s-Most-Wasted", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05082015_Bomb-Sniffing-Elephant.jpg", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "Bomb-Sniffing Elephants Among $1 Billion in \u2018America\u2019s Most Wasted\u2019"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/Bomb-Sniffing-Elephants-Among-1-Billion-America-s-Most-Wasted", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05082015_Bomb-Sniffing-Elephant.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Washington's repeat fiscal offenses are leading us down a dangerous path \u2014 sending hard-earned American tax dollars to mismanaged and wasteful programs.\"\nHe released his own waste report earlier this year.\n\"The national debt recently exceeded $18 trillion, while our $486 billion deficit is projected to reach $1 trillion over the next decade.\nRelated: Coburn\u2019s Wastebook Highlights $25 Billion Taxpayer LossThe report also blasts studies like the one by the Army to determine whether elephants could be used to detect bombs.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wasted\u201d sounds like a YouTube video from Spring Break."}
