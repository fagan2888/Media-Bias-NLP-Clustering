Anderson.\n\n\u201cHell no, I wouldn\u2019t fit in one of those things. I\u2019d look like Fred Flintstone,\u201d said gigantic former New York Giants defensive end Gary Jeter, 59, who wasn\u2019t participating in the go-cart races, but was one of the football legends on hand for the event.\n\nAsked if he thought racing on the track was better or worse than driving around the area, Jeter said, \u201cDriving around town is probably worse than this. Driving around town you don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d\n\nAbout the Super Bowl, Jeter said, \u201cI hope it\u2019s a good game. It\u2019s going to be a cold venue. New York and New Jersey have put their best foot forward.\u201d\n\nBut Jeter, who is now manager of business development at Motivated Security Services in Somerville, added: \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed that the epicenter seems to be in New York and not New Jersey.\u201d\n\nThe defensive end who also played for the Rams said there should have been more high-profile events in New Jersey in the run-up to tomorrow\u2019s big game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford.\n\nThe roster of racers on the teams included athletes and special guests from the media and entertainment and local personalities. The event benefited health and wellness initiatives of the NY/NJ Chapter of the NFL Alumni Association.\n\nWayne Mogel, founder of Sports Legends Classics, said the event was originally to be a reception with lavish VIP treatment for guests that included legendary athletes.\n\n\u201cBut with New York and New Jersey being the backdrop this year, we felt it was necessary to present a slightly different format that would showcase the region a little differently than the norm for a hospitality event, while helping the charity,\u201d said Mogel in a statement.\n\nWoods, 47, played for the Bengals and played in his team\u2019s 20-16 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIII. Anderson, 57, led the Giants to a victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV, which is most remembered for Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood\u2019s last-second missed field goal.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Ex-NFL players who are no strangers to \"Super\" events race go karts at Jersey City's Pole Position Raceway", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ex-NFL players who are no strangers to \\\"Super\\\" events race go karts at Jersey City\\u0027s Pole Position Raceway \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/ex-nfl_players_who_are_no_stra.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/01/14189366-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12108681\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-01T08:00:31Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/01/14189366-small.jpg", "description": "Sports legends streaked around Pole Position Raceway in Jersey City Thursday night in a pre-Super Bowl event in which two of the five teams racing were captained by former football players, Ickey Woods and Super Bowl XXV MVP O.J.
