RIDGELAND, Miss. (AP) Authorities say four women have been arrested as part of an alleged prostitution ring.

The Clarion-Ledger reports the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation announced the arrests on Friday and each was charged with one count of prostitution.

The arrested women are Anjeni' Qyanik Moore, 34, of Norfolk, Virginia; Heaven Leigh Nix, 23, of Memphis, Tennessee; Joneka Santrice Burns, 24, of Jackson; and Candace Renee Stewart, 30, of Byhalia of Mississippi

The arrests were made Thursday night and Friday morning in a sting operation.

Strain says all four women are wanted on other charges from other jurisdictions.

They were taken into custody at the Madison County Jail.
