The most costly plans are in the Upper Peninsula, where options are limited. Residents of the Grand Rapids area enjoy the best rates.\n\nA few months into a critical phase of its rollout, the Affordable Care Act is on track to meet or exceed forecasts on two fronts in Michigan, enrolling residents in the individual marketplace, and expanding Medicaid. If experts are right, it could cut the uninsured in Michigan in half by 2019.\n\nBut on a third front \u2013 the insurance market competition \u2013 it might need a checkup.\n\nThe final piece of health care reform \u2013 employer-mandated insurance \u2013 won\u2019t begin until 2015.\n\nCompetition among insurers was to be a key force to keep rates down. It seems to have worked in many urban counties, but in more than two dozen other Michigan counties there are three insurers or fewer competing in the individual marketplace.\n\nDelta County in the Upper Peninsula has just one. Ten other UP counties have only two.\n\nRates in these rural counties are among the highest in the state, according to analysis by the Ann Arbor-based Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation (CHRT), a nonprofit partnership between the University of Michigan and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.\n\nThe least expensive basic plan for a 40-year-old couple with two children costs $761 in Delta County, compared with $462 a month for a comparable plan in Kent County, $560 in Washtenaw County and $566 in Ingham County. While Delta County offered just five insurance plans with one insurer, Kent County had four insurers and 33 plans, Ingham County five insurers and 39 plans and Washtenaw County five insurers and 40 plans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s natural to look at the number of insurers that are operating in a county and expect that competition is causing some of these low prices,\u201d said Joshua Fangmeier, a CHRT health policy analyst.\n\nFangmeier said insurers in many rural counties like Delta don\u2019t offer health maintenance organization plans \u2013 with more limited health provider options \u2013 that typically offer the cheapest premium. It is also true that residents of rural counties had higher premium rates before the Affordable Care Act was implemented, in part because these counties lack large health care provider networks that can provide economy of scale for service.\n\nBut overall, given its stumbling start, Fangmeier noted that marketplace enrollment fared much better than many expected.\n\nBefore enrollment in the individual market opened Oct. 1, experts forecast up to 190,000 residents would sign up by the close of enrollment on March 31. The actual total: 272,539.\n\nIt was projected another 320,000 people would enroll in 2014 in Healthy Michigan Plan, expansion of Medicaid for low-income residents making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, about $16,000 for an individual. As of May 27, nearly 270,000 signed up since enrollment commenced April 1. Officials believe it will meet or exceed projections (see accompanying story) and approach 500,000 within a few years.\n\nCHRT projected enrollment of 127,000 in the individual marketplace by March 31, while federal calculations put it at 161,000 and the Urban Institute projected 189,000.\n\nThose numbers seemed hopelessly optimistic in the early weeks, when the federal website for enrollment was plagued by error messages and frequent crashes. Just over 1,300 signed up for a plan in Michigan in the first month. Five months later, a late surge pushed enrollment past 270,000.\n\nNational enrollment topped 8 million, a million more than projected. The Rand Corporation estimated that one third of those who signed up for insurance under the marketplace were previously uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe do tend to underestimate how much people value health insurance,\u201d Fangmeier said.\n\nNearly 90 percent of those who enrolled in Michigan\u2019s individual marketplace received tax credits to do so, according to federal figures.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act offers tax credits for premiums for those making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $46,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four. Subsidies are highest on the low end of the income scale and phase out near the top.\n\nMarketplace plans offer coverage options ranging from basic to comprehensive, called Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Plans must offer coverage that includes emergency services, hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care and birth control, mental health and substance abuse treatment and others.\n\nIn one example cited by the Congressional Research Service, an individual with an income of $17,235 would have a monthly premium of $201 for a low-cost Silver Plan, of which $143 would be paid by tax credit.\n\nIn 2013, CHRT projected that health care reform would more than cut the number of uninsured in Michigan in half, from 1.1 million in 2011 \u2013 before implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to just over 500,000 by 2019.\n\nBased on marketplace and Medicaid expansion numbers, another analyst believes that number may be too conservative.\n\n\u201cIt may be even lower than that in 2019,\u201d said Leah Hatch-Vallier, health policy analyst for CHRT.\n\nUnhealthy competition\n\nResidents of rural Michigan are stuck with higher premiums \u2013 and fewer insurers \u2013 under the Affordable Care Act. The costliest plans are in the Upper Peninsula, while the Grand Rapids area has the best rates.\n\nAge In Michigan, 272,539 signed up for the individual insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act as of close of enrollment March 31.Here are the demographics of those who signed up: Under 18 6 percent\n\n18-25 11 percent\n\n26-34 18 percent\n\n35-44 16 percent\n\n45-54 22 percent\n\n55-64 27 percent Gender 54 percent women\n\n46 percent men Received tax credits to purchase 87 percent Source: United States Department of Health and Human Services Medicaid expansion More than 269,000 people signed up in Michigan for expanded Medicaid as of May 27.

They would especially include young adults who previously may have had a bare-bones health insurance policy with high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. Where they might have paid $60 a month for a such a policy, they now might see premiums three times that high.\n\n\u201cThey would be the, quote unquote, loser,\u201d Hatch-Vallier said.\n\nBut because the Affordable Care Act mandates that marketplace insurance cover essential benefits like emergency services, hospitalization and preventative care and caps out-of-pocket expenses at $6,350 for an individual plan, that individual would also receive more coverage.\n\nThe other major component of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 employer mandates \u2013 do not kick in until next year. Employers with more than 100 full-time employees will need to insure workers by 2015. Businesses with 50 to 100 employees will have to do so by 2016.\n\nNews accounts reported some employers were shifting employees to part-time status so they wouldn\u2019t have to offer health insurance. But a February analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office found no evidence for this nationally.\n\nThe ACA remains a volatile issue in the U.S. Senate race between former GOP Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land and Democratic U.S. Rep. Gary Peters. Land has called for its repeal while Peters voted for it. The conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity has poured more than $5 million into ads attacking Peters for supporting it. Peters has hit back at Land with ads that claim she would take away preventive medical coverage for women.\n\nHatch-Vallier expects that the law may be tweaked in the years to come, perhaps by extending the threshold at which employers have to offer coverage from 30 hours a week to 40. Other changes are possible as well.\n\nBut for better or worse, she believes too many have signed up to turn back the clock.\n\n\u201cI do think it is here to stay.\u201d\n\n\n\nTed Roelofs worked for the Grand Rapids Press for 30 years, where he covered everything from politics to social services to military affairs.
