NEELTJE JANS, Netherlands (AP) — This year more than ever, security is a top priority for Tour de France organizers.

In the wake of the terror attacks that have shaken France this year, the level of alertness has been raised and the Tour de France, which draws millions of spectators over three weeks, is being given extra security by French authorities.

“We are liaising with them and additional measures have been taken,” said Tour director Chrtistian Prudhomme. “I can’t obviously reveal the whole scheme.”

At the start of Sunday’s second stage in Utrecht, Netherlands, fans invited to the Village Depart — the place where VIPs, sponsors and journalists gather before the start — had their bags checked by security officials. Barriers were also separating the spectators from the riders and their team buses.
