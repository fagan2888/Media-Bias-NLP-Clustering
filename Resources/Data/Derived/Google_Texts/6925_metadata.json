Obama insists the treaty would give the U.S. a competitive edge over China.\n\nRelated: U.S. Lawmakers Present Fast-Track Trade Bill\n\nThe Chinese economy has jangled some nerves in Washington and on Wall Street, at times for different reasons. For example, global stock markets took a tumble on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.54 percent or nearly 280 points \u2014 to 17,826 \u2014 in part because of investors\u2019 fears about new policies introduced by regulators in China to slow a strong market rally there. Chinese stocks are up more than 50 percent this year, even as the Chinese economy has been cooling, posting its slowest official growth rate since 2009.\n\nWhile Wall Street worries about a brewing Chinese market bubble and moderating economic growth, political leaders in Washington and economists in the halls of financial institutions such as the World Bank have expressed concerns over the implications of China\u2019s rise to economic superpower status. Former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was in Washington last week to promote a new book on China, noted that China has become \u201cas much a source of concern as a source of awe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find ourselves increasingly at cross purposes with an ever more competitive China as it flexes its newfound muscles in world markets and in bitter territorial disputes with its neighbors, while it seeks to challenge the U.S.-led order in Asia,\u201d Paulson wrote in the preface to his book, Dealing With China: An Insider Unmasks the New Economic Superpower.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the Global Economic Recovery Could Stall Out\n\nAt the World Bank-International Monetary Fund spring meeting this weekend, China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was an urgent topic of conversation. The bank, designed to pump at least $100 billion into the construction of badly needed railways, roads and pipelines in underdeveloped areas of Asia, will directly compete with the U.S.-controlled World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is dominated by Japan. The U.S. refused to join, but 46 other countries, including Britain, Germany, Australia and South Korea, signed on as founding members.\n\nThe combination of China\u2019s direct challenge to U.S. economic influence abroad and bitter partisanship in Congress over Obama\u2019s trade and foreign policy initiatives have led some experts to question whether the U.S. is retreating from global economic leadership just when it\u2019s most needed, as The New York Times reported on Friday.\n\nYet Paulson, who led the Bush administration and Wall Street through some of the most harrowing months of the 2008 financial crisis, seems far more sanguine about the U.S. continuing to play the preeminent leadership role in global economics.\n\nDuring a conversation with former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History Thursday evening, he argued that while China remains a formidable economic rival to the U.S., its $10 trillion economy has \u201crun out of steam and has to be rebooted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Democrats Enraged Over Closely Guarded Trade Deal\n\nIn occasionally searing pronouncements on the state of China\u2019s financial health, the one-time CEO of Goldman Sachs asserted that China needs to shift away from excessive dependence on exports and inefficient government investment in infrastructure that are driving up the country\u2019s debt.\n\nInstead, he said, the Chinese leadership needs a new \u201cgrowth model\u201d that would move the country\u2019s economy towards increased domestic consumption and a greater emphasis on service industries and high-end manufacturing. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous task, complicated by the fact that much of the economy remains under the thumb of central planners, even after years of reform,\u201d Paulson contends.\n\nThe former Treasury secretary has extensive first-hand knowledge of China gleaned from over 100 visits to the country and nearly a quarter century of dealings with Chinese officials on commercial matters and affairs of state.\n\n\u201cEntrenched interests are resisting further changes,\u201d he wrote in his book. \u201cMeantime, years of not-so-benign neglect have left the environment a near disaster that has sparked growing restiveness among China\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nRelated: Geithner Book Settles Scores, Defends Policies\n\nStill, for all their problems, China remains \u201ca formidable competitor,\u201d Paulson said \u2013 and certainly one that has the Obama administration on edge.\n\nWhile at Goldman Sachs, Paulson negotiated early deals with China \u2014 including the biggest private equity investment the firm had ever made, a $2.6 billion investment in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to USA Today. As Treasury Secretary, he helped create the Strategic Economic Dialogue to promote high-level consultation between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe key to me was to be yourself\u201d and to fully comprehend the Chinese motivations and political and economic needs in order to work toward a compromise, Paulson said Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot like your dealings with Congress,\u201d Paulson joked with Geithner, who appeared to wince just thinking about his frequent jousting with Republican lawmakers during his tenure as Treasury Secretary in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013.\n\nLater, when Paulson noted that Chinese are \u201cperplexed by our political system,\u201d even as they share many common goals with the U.S., Geithner quickly added, \u201cWe\u2019re perplexed.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama left little doubt last week that he views China as a serious threat to", "title": "Paulson Says China Must \u2018Reboot\u2019 Its Staggering Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/19/Paulson-Says-China-Must-Reboot-It-s-Staggering-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04182015_China_Yuan_Money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/19/Paulson-Says-China-Must-Reboot-It-s-Staggering-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04182015_China_Yuan_Money.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "President Obama left little doubt last week that he views China as a serious threat to", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers Present Fast-Track Trade BillThe Chinese economy has jangled some nerves in Washington and on Wall Street, at times for different reasons.\nChinese stocks are up more than 50 percent this year, even as the Chinese economy has been cooling, posting its slowest official growth rate since 2009.\nPresident Obama left little doubt last week that he views China as a serious threat to U.S. economic dominance overseas.\nAs Treasury Secretary, he helped create the Strategic Economic Dialogue to promote high-level consultation between the two countries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an enormous task, complicated by the fact that much of the economy remains under the thumb of central planners, even after years of reform,\u201d Paulson contends."}
