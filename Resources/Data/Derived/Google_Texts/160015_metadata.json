It was among 53 clinics across the state awarded \u201cStrengthening the Safety Net\u201d grants by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan last week.\n\n\u201cSafety net clinics provide access to care for tens of thousands of uninsured Michigan residents in need of medical treatment and without these clinics, patients would delay and even forego care at great cost to themselves, their families and the health care system,\u201d said Kim Kratz, BCBSM senior health care analyst. \u201cBlue Cross understands the need for free clinics isn\u2019t going away and our partnerships help many in the state gain access to much needed care and, in some cases, life-saving services.\u201d\n\nThe grants are worth $15,000 each, money free clinics say is still needed after expanded Medicaid and individual market coverage ushered in by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSaltman said that there is still a strong demand for the free and need-based services his clinic provides. Some people still haven\u2019t signed up for Medicaid. Some still can\u2019t afford the premiums on the federal health care exchange. People in the country illegally aren\u2019t eligible for the exchange or Medicaid services. His clinic is still packed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start getting a little more outspoken about the need to get support from other organizations,\u201d Saltman said.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Oasis of Hope Executive Director Barb Grinwis is also Vice President of the Free Clinics of Michigan Association. As far as a potential impact on funding, it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s on her radar.\n\n\u201cNot currently but I believe that we hear it from people, \u2018well why would [we] have to give you money because there are no uninsured left.\u2019 And that\u2019s the general perception of the public \u2026 as a result we have to work harder for the dollars that we get,\u201d Grinwis said.\n\nShe said across the state there\u2019s been a slight drop in the number of clients free clinics serve, but expects that to be temporary.\n\nOne issue her clinic has struggled with is clients being afraid that going to a free clinic means they\u2019ll be reported for not having insurance, subjecting them to a fine under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe want people know that we\u2019re here and we\u2019re not judgmental and they won\u2019t get reported,\u201d Grinwis said.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capital/Lansing business reporter for MLive.
