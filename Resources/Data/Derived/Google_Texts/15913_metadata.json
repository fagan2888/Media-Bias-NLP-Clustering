We cannot ignore the patient cost burden of cancer care any longer.\u201d\n\nTheir study linked Western Washington Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program records with federal bankruptcy records in the same region. They found an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.79 for mortality among patients with cancer who \ufb01led for bankruptcy compared with those who did not file.\n\nThe investigators used propensity score matching to account for differences in several demographic and clinical factors between patients who did or did not \ufb01le for bankruptcy. They examined the relationship between bankruptcy \ufb01ling and survival among patients with cancer using Cox proportional hazards models.\n\nThe idea for the study arose after Dr Ramsey analyzed the results of a previous study, which found that patients with cancer go bankrupt at 2.5 times the rate of the general population.2\n\nDr Ramsey and colleagues found that between 1995 and 2009, 231 596 individuals were diagnosed with cancer and that 4728 patients with cancer \ufb01led for bankruptcy. HRs varied by cancer type, with the highest HR for patients with colorectal, prostate, and thyroid cancers. When they excluded patients with distant-stage disease from the models, researchers found no significant differences.\n\n\u201cWe don't know if it is getting worse or better,\u201d Ramsey said. On the one hand, the Affordable Care Act has given millions of people access to health insurance, which presumably will reduce their likelihood of going bankrupt in the event of a severe illness like cancer. On the other, the cost of cancer care is rising so fast.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Financial Toxicity More Likely in Younger, Nonwhite Women Cancer Survivors\n\nOncologists are seeing a growing number of patients who are undergoing \u201cfinancial toxicity,\u201d in which patients are under such severe \ufb01nancial distress from cancer care that they refuse treatment or do not comply with recommended therapies.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,cancertherapyadvisor.com,chemotherapyadvisor.com,clinicaladvisor.com,empr.com,mycme.com,oncologynurseadvisor.com,psychiatryadvisor.com,renalandurologynews.com", "news_keywords": "Bone Cancer, Brain Cancer, Breast Cancer, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Endocrine Cancer, Gastrointestinal Cancer, General Oncology, Gynecologic Cancer, Head And Neck Cancer, Hematologic Cancers, Lung Cancer, Lymphoma, Male Reproductive Cancers, Multiple Myeloma, Pancreatic Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Skin Cancer, Urologic Cancers", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "Cancer Therapy Advisor", "description": "Extreme \ufb01nancial distress appeared to in\ufb02uence survival after cancer diagnosis and may be taking a greater toll on patients than previously recognized.", "title": "Financial Insolvency May Be a Risk Factor for Early Mortality Among Patients With Cancer", "url": "http://www.cancertherapyadvisor.com/general-oncology/cancer-patient-financial-insolvency-risk-factor-early-mortality/article/473155/", "image": "http://media.chemotherapyadvisor.com/images/2016/02/10/financialinsolvencytreatment_917271_917272.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media.chemotherapyadvisor.com/images/2016/02/10/financialinsolvencytreatment_917271_917272.jpg"}, "title": "Financial Insolvency May Be a Risk Factor for Early Mortality Among Patients With Cancer", "description": "Extreme \ufb01nancial distress appeared to in\ufb02uence survival after cancer diagnosis and may be taking a greater toll on patients than previously recognized.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CancerTherAdvsr"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=587577694", "fb": {"app_id": 384307355013443}, "article": {"section": "General Oncology", "tag": "Urologic Cancers", "published_time": "2016-02-10T09:00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T11:42:57"}, "msvalidate.01": "1EBAD585CD1400AF57A0E16F3A19B4E3", "google-site-verification": "44ZDMWtYdt2P3WmcSwkf49lSAsp6XFIm2_f77bM61lc", "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Extreme \ufb01nancial distress appeared to in\ufb02uence survival after cancer diagnosis and may be taking a greater toll on patients than previously recognized."}, "article_summary": "Extreme \ufb01nancial distress appeared to in\ufb02uence survival after cancer diagnosis and may be taking a greater toll on patients than previously recognized.\nThey examined the relationship between bankruptcy \ufb01ling and survival among patients with cancer using Cox proportional hazards models.\nThey found an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.79 for mortality among patients with cancer who \ufb01led for bankruptcy compared with those who did not file.\nOn the other, the cost of cancer care is rising so fast.\u201dRELATED: Financial Toxicity More Likely in Younger, Nonwhite Women Cancer SurvivorsOncologists are seeing a growing number of patients who are undergoing \u201cfinancial toxicity,\u201d in which patients are under such severe \ufb01nancial distress from cancer care that they refuse treatment or do not comply with recommended therapies.\nHRs varied by cancer type, with the highest HR for patients with colorectal, prostate, and thyroid cancers."}
