Since they were born prematurely, as is common for quintuplets (which rarely survive past birth), they were placed on breathing machines. They are currently being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit, and doctors believe they'll be able to breathe on their own soon. \u201cOverall, they\u2019ve done remarkably well,\u201d Dr. Vijay Nama, director of neonatology at the Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, said at a news conference, according to Fox News. \u201cThey\u2019re premature and they\u2019re quintuplets, but they\u2019ve done pretty good.\u201d\n\nSeals, 33, experienced morning sickness for 14 weeks before going on bed rest after Christmas break. She was then admitted to Baylor in January. After the experience of birthing her children, Seals says she\u2019s doing well and is ready to hold her babies. \u201cI\u2019m doing good, I feel good, definitely sore but overall better than I was expecting,\u201d Seals told NBCDFW.\n\nA fertility specialist at Baylor, Dr. Anil Pinto, said that one of the medications Seals was taking actually increases the risk of having multiple twins by six or seven percent. Another medication she was also taking increased that risk by 15 percent \u2014 but most of those are often twins, and rarely more than that.\n\nThe couple shared the names and weights of their babies, in the order they were born:\n\nMia Danielle Seals (girl), 2 lbs., 10 oz.\n\nTessa Suzanne Seals (girl), 2 lbs., 14 oz.\n\nBrant Lee Seals (boy), 3 lbs., 6 oz.\n\nGracie Lou Seals (girl), 2 lbs., 7 oz.\n\nRayleigh Ann Seals (girl), 2 lbs., 8 oz.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "quintuplets, michelle seals, twins, texas woman", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas couple now has the joy of raising quintuplets, born prematurely but doing well regardless.", "title": "Five Bundles Of Joy: Texas Woman Gives Birth To Premature Quintuplets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-woman-gives-birth-premature-quintuplets-babies-placed-breathing-machines-and-doing-remarkably", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/twins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas couple now has the joy of raising quintuplets, born prematurely but doing well regardless.", "title": "Five Bundles Of Joy: Texas Woman Gives Birth To Premature Quintuplets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-woman-gives-birth-premature-quintuplets-babies-placed-breathing-machines-and-doing-remarkably", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/twins.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/twins.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-21T11:41:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T11:41:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas couple now has the joy of raising quintuplets, born prematurely but doing well regardless."}, "article_summary": "It turns out that the first-grade teacher from Texas was having quintuplets, or five babies born at the same time.\nThe risk of having quintuplets, or five multiple twins, is increased by certain types of medications.\nSince they were born prematurely, as is common for quintuplets (which rarely survive past birth), they were placed on breathing machines.\nMichelle Seals first thought she would be having twins, until several follow-up doctor visits revealed two more babies \u2014 then two more after that.\nThe couple shared the names and weights of their babies, in the order they were born:Mia Danielle Seals (girl), 2 lbs., 10 oz."}
