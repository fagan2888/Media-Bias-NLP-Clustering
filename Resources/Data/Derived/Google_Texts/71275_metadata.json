David Morales, executive vice president and chief strategy officer, said the organization tries \"very aggressively\" to meet with doctors and non-physician providers each month to show them how they perform on key metrics.\n\nBoston's Beth Israel Deaconess Care Organization President and CEO Christina Severin. suggested that ACOs take a hard look as to whether physician leaders would better lead the organization or whether health coach or care navigator leaders may be more appropriate. She believes an approach that \"de-medicalizes\" issues, can help engage clnicians as well as patients.\n\nPatient engagement is also a critical component to an ACO's success because it can lead to improved, care quality and compliance, and will also strengthen retention and loyalty for patients and employees alike, panelists said.\n\nSteward has made great strides in both patient retention and engagement of the racially diverse, multilingual patient population of Eastern Massachusetts. Since joining Medicare's Pioneer program, Morales said, the agency has helped the organization develop an \"operational chassis\"--an infrastructure through which the system coordinates care for Medicare, commercial and Medicaid patients. This is vital to Steward's goal of being a \"payer-agnostic\" provider, he said.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe financial highs and lows of Pioneer ACOs\n\nCommunity partnerships, health navigators crucial to engage patients\n\n5 ethical issues medical schools must address with future docs\n\n3 ways providers can drive patient engagement\n\nHow providers can engage, empower patients\n\nHospitals step up assessment, treatment of patients' emotional needs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Implementing an accountable care organization is nearly impossible without high-quality clinical engagement, according to a panel of healthcare leaders at Friday's sixth annual National ACO Summit in the District of Columbia.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Implementing an accountable care organization is nearly impossible without high-quality clinical engagement, according to a panel of healthcare leaders at Friday's sixth annual National ACO Summit in the District of Columbia.", "title": "Clinical, patient engagement key to ACO success", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/clinical-patient-engagement-key-aco-success/2015-06-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),Beth Israel Deaconess Care Organization,Brookings Institute,Care Delivery,clinical leadership,clinician leadership,Cultural Competency,HR & Workforce Management,National ACO Summit,non-physician providers,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,Physician Leadership,Pioneer ACO,quality metrics,staff engagement,Steward Health Care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "article_summary": "Implementing an accountable care organization is nearly impossible without high-quality clinical engagement, according to a panel of healthcare leaders at Friday's sixth annual National ACO Summit in the District of Columbia.\nSteward has made great strides in both patient retention and engagement of the racially diverse, multilingual patient population of Eastern Massachusetts.\nBoston's Beth Israel Deaconess Care Organization President and CEO Christina Severin.\nThe Pioneer ACO at Steward Health Care in Massachusetts--one of the top performers in the program its first year--fosters clinical engagement by aligning incentives and goals throughout the staff, rather than just among physicians.\nPatient engagement is also a critical component to an ACO's success because it can lead to improved, care quality and compliance, and will also strengthen retention and loyalty for patients and employees alike, panelists said."}
