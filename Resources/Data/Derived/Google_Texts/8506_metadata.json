There are a number of reasons 2017 will have higher rate increases than the last few years. But we believe in California we won't see the significant headwinds many other states are experiencing.\"Lee added that two federal programs that have helped insurers offset costly medical claims and cover sick patients in general have expired this year, which would affect premium rates throughout the country. He also cited ever-increasing medical costs (particularly expensive specialty drugs) as another factor in the possible increase of premium rates next year.CNN reported that the health exchange\u2019s projection mirrors a trend sweeping the country as insurers reconsider their pricing and strategies under the ACA.\"[8%] is not a troubling rate increase,\" said health care consultant Robert Laszewski. \"California is coming back toward the average. A bunch of states would die for just an 8% increase in 2017.\"Laszewski shared that he is more worried about the federal exchange\u2019s slowing enrollment growth. He underscored that California has one of the healthiest risk pools in America, which helped the state keep its lower-than-average-rate increases the past two years. While the exchange sees hundreds of thousands of new enrollees each year, many have also left the exchange for job-based coverage, Medicare, or Medicaid.New signups are important to maintain a diverse mix of enrollees, spreading insurance costs fairly between healthy and sick policyholders.The federal health insurance exchange is expecting more low-income policyholders from Medicaid to switch to their side following gradual increases to California\u2019s minimum wage of $15 an hour. By 2020, Covered California anticipates an enrollment figure of 1.52 million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/west-news/possible-8-hike-for-aca-premiums-in-california-next-year-32041.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/istock-graph-increase-growth-upward-highest.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The state\u2019s health insurance exchange declared the estimated rate increase preliminary, calling 2017 \u201can adjustment year\u201d", "title": "Possible 8% hike for ACA premiums in California next year"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state\u2019s health insurance exchange declared the estimated rate increase preliminary, calling 2017 \u201can adjustment year\u201d", "title": "Possible 8% hike for ACA premiums in California next year", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/west-news/possible-8-hike-for-aca-premiums-in-california-next-year-32041.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/istock-graph-increase-growth-upward-highest.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The state\u2019s health insurance exchange declared the estimated rate increase preliminary, calling 2017 \u201can adjustment year\u201d", "author": "Lyle Adriano"}, "article_summary": "There are a number of reasons 2017 will have higher rate increases than the last few years.\n\"[8%] is not a troubling rate increase,\" said health care consultant Robert Laszewski.\nHe underscored that California has one of the healthiest risk pools in America, which helped the state keep its lower-than-average-rate increases the past two years.\nBut we believe in California we won't see the significant headwinds many other states are experiencing.\n\"We shouldn't put too much focus on this 8% number when we will know the reality in two months,\" said Lee."}
