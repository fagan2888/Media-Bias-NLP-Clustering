Here's how to avoid frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nOminously named a polar vortex (seen in purple), the Midwest and East Coast will be seeing negative degree temperatures throughout this week. Here's how to avoid frostbite and hypothermia. Weather.gov\n\nThe ominous-sounding polar vortex has already swept down on much of the Northern Plains and the Midwest, bringing temperatures to their lowest in 20 years. But it\u2019s not just the Midwest that will be experiencing the below-freezing temperatures; the vortex is expected to hit the East Coast as early as Monday night, bringing with it the risk of frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nTemperatures in Chicago dropped to a record 16 degrees below zero on Monday, while Minneapolis saw temperatures reaching 18 below \u2014 not including a wind chill, which brought that down to 40 below. The case was, and will be, similar in nearly 24 other states spanning from the Southeast to the Northeast, as a front of cold air normally seen only in the arctic pushes through, CNN reported. \u201cThe big story was the wind chill factors,\u201d Jim Keeney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Center\u2019s regional headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., told The L.A. Times.\n\nSo what exactly is this polar vortex? According to AccuWeather, it\u2019s a large pocket of (usually) the coldest air in the northern hemisphere, moving as high-speed winds in a counterclockwise direction \u2014 it\u2019s known as a low-pressure system. It normally stays northwest of The U.S., near Siberia and the Arctic sea, but will occasionally move around during the winter. In this case, however, a large high-pressure system along the eastern Pacific is pushing further north than usual \u2014 it typically reaches Alaska \u2014 moving into the North Pole and pushing the vortex further south than usual. \u201cThe high pressure system, paired with the extensive snow cover over southern Canada and northern United States, is allowing the air to stay very cold,\u201d Brett Anderson, a meteorologist with AccuWeather, said.\n\nThe cold weather, which is expected to last a few days, can be especially damaging to anyone who is outdoors. \u201cIt takes only minutes for exposed skin to become frostbitten if the temperature falls below 20 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind is blowing at 20 miles per hour or more,\u201d Taizoon Baxamusa, MD, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, said prior to another cold spell in 2009. Exposure to cold temperatures can put a person at risk for hypothermia and frostbite, both of which are life-threatening. Here are some tips for spotting both conditions and for avoiding them altogether.\n\nHypothermia\n\nHypothermia is a dangerously low body temperature \u2014 typically below 95 degrees Fahrenheit. It can result in the loss of the ability to think and move, with some people even experiencing it unknowingly. Symptoms include drowsiness, weakness and loss of coordination, pale and cold skin, confusion, and uncontrollable shivering, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nFrostbite\n\nPeople with hypothermia are also likely to have frostbite as well. Initially characterized by a pins-and-needles feeling, followed by numbness, it also occurs when skin and body tissues are exposed to cold temperatures for an extended period of time. Other symptoms include hard skin and a lack of sensation. In more severe cases a person may experience blisters, gangrene, and damage to tendons, muscles, nerves, and bone.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe best way to prevent sickness from the cold is to stay inside as much as possible. But upon going outside, the New York City Office of Emergency Management suggests:\n\n\u00b7 Wear a hat, hood, or scarf, as most heat is lost through the head.\n\n\u00b7 Wear layers, as they provide better insulation and warmth.\n\n\u00b7 Keep fingertips, earlobes, and noses covered if you go outside.\n\n\u00b7 Keep clothing dry; if a layer becomes wet, remove it.\n\nTreatment\n\nAccording to the NIH, a person with hypothermia should be taken to a warm room where they can heat up. If one isn\u2019t available, they should be moved away from wind, and the person administering first aid should try to use their own body heat. Using warm compresses on the neck, chest wall, and groin, as well as giving them warm, sweetened, non-alcoholic beverages \u2014 only if they are able to drink \u2014 can also help.\n\nWhen it comes to frostbite, it\u2019s very important not to use direct heat, such as a radiator or campfire, or to rub or massage the frostbitten areas. Instead, the person\u2019s affected areas should be soaked in warm (never hot) water. Warm clothes can also be placed on affected areas. Additionally, the thawed areas should not be moved. For both hypothermia and frostbite, it\u2019s essential that a person doesn\u2019t smoke or drink alcohol, as both can affect blood circulation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "polar vortex 2014, cold, weather, wind, chill, east coast, midwest, frostbite, frostnip, hypothermia, arctic, air", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ominously named a polar vortex, the Midwest and East Coast will be seeing negative degree temperatures throughout this week.
