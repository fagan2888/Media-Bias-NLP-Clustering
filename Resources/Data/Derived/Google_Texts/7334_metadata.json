We are not a crime! Come on, why you are doing this?\u201d\n\nA man approached her and yelled, \u201cShut up and go away!\u201d He told CNN that he did not like gay people and they were causing problems in Turkey, and then stressed that the country is Muslim and, to him, being Muslim and gay were in conflict.\n\nThe clashes with police came after Friday\u2019s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage, which LGBTI activists in Turkey celebrated.\n\nGay, trans and intersex people in Turkey say they aren\u2019t at the stage where they could imagine that kind of equality in their country.\n\n\u201cWe are at the stage of \u2018Please don\u2019t kill us,'\u201d said Sevval Kilic, a transgender activist who helped organize the pride parade. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss equal marriage or employment rights or whatever. We are just demanding our basic human rights.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s clashes won\u2019t set that goal back, Kilic said. \u201cIt will make us stronger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Istanbul (CNN) -\u00a0Although the gay pride parade has happened in peace for at least 13 years in Istanbul, on Sunday the parade was interrupted by police who fired pepper spray and rubber pellets at thousands when they arrived to march.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334634343", "og": {"site_name": "WHNT.com", "description": "Istanbul (CNN) \u2013\u00a0Although the gay pride parade has happened in peace for at least 13 years in Istanbul, on Sunday the parade was interrupted by police who fired pepper spray and rubber pellet\u2026", "title": "Turkish police fire pepper spray and rubber pellets to break up gay pride parade", "url": "http://whnt.com/2015/06/28/turkish-police-fire-pepper-spray-and-rubber-pellets-to-break-up-gay-pride-parade/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://localtvwhnt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/gay_marriage.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://localtvwhnt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/gay_marriage.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@whnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@whnt"}, "keywords": "news,", "p": {"domain_verify": "ef3232fc915138f86f550fcf7ba418f7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 490541240988881, "pages": 25248416044}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WHNT.com", "google-site-verification": "5W_w6evqq-t5n8MjIEDIy9yiwsUlE6sEBrENj9Y9TbE", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/whntnews19", "published_time": "2015-06-28T18:39:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T18:39:49+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/whntnews19"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whnt.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a82c1e583fe9c7ee4cd32b8f26473338?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Turkish police fire pepper spray and rubber pellets to break up gay pride paradeIstanbul (CNN) \u2013 Although the gay pride parade has happened in peace for at least 13 years in Istanbul, on Sunday the parade was interrupted by police who fired pepper spray and rubber pellets at thousands when they arrived to march.\nOne video shows a gay pride attendee being swept off his feet with the force of a water cannon.\n\u201cWe are at the stage of \u2018Please don\u2019t kill us,'\u201d said Sevval Kilic, a transgender activist who helped organize the pride parade.\nOrganizers of the march released a statement saying the Istanbul governorship was not allowing the procession, citing the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\u201cThis is happening after the elections because they realize the power of the LGBTI movement,\u201d said transgender activist Ruzgar Buski."}
