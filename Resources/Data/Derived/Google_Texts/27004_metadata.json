Many are working people who only earn about $15,000 per year, Dr. Hayhurst noted.\n\nThe clinic is a walk-in clinic and operated the second and fourth Thursdays of the month, but the schedule varies with holidays in November and December \u2014 operating the second and third Thursdays. Dr. Hayhurst and Phillips hope to add additional days.\n\nDan would be a typical patient of the Multi-County Medical Outreach Clinic. Dan worked construction, and one day in 2009 after working in the hot sun for an entire day on a roof, his body broke down. After being unemployed, he started a masonry business and got back on his feet financially, but he didn\u2019t have any insurance. After noticing shortness of breath, he was diagnosed with the respiratory illness COPD.\n\n\u201cI came in here, because it is a free health clinic,\u201d Dan told Today\u2019s Catholic. A series of tests discovered he had other health issues as well.\n\n\u201cThey got me all checked out,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThey were all on me about quit smoking cigarettes too.\u201d\n\nPhillips was able to enroll Dan into a smoking cessation program at Columbia City\u2019s Parkview campus. But it was difficult. Still, Dr. Hayhurst and another clinic volunteer doctor, Dr. Terry Frederick, kept encouraging Dan to quit smoking.\n\nThe good news is Dan has quit smoking since July. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you people, I would be dead today,\u201d Dan related. \u201cSo I love these guys. They are excellent people.\u201d\n\nThe clinic served as a stepping stone medical alternative for Dan, who now qualifies for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe clinic makes wellness education a focal issue and offers information sessions on diabetes, obesity, women\u2019s health issues and smoking cessation.\n\nOther community organizations and businesses assist the patients. Walgreens provides free flu shots. A representative from Brightpoint offers counseling if a patient is in danger of losing his home.\n\nOne of the clinic\u2019s founders, the late Patricia Ruah, has a fund in her honor called the Patricia Ruah Patients\u2019 Assistance Fund, which through grants, provides funds for patients who may not be able to afford medical attention.\n\nPhillips noted that even though they are a small church, her home parish of St. Mary of the Angels at Big Long Lake offers one week\u2019s tithe twice a year to the Patients\u2019 Assistance Fund.\n\nPhillips\u2019 motto is \u201cGive it back and pay it forward,\u201d a motto echoed by other clinic volunteers who receive much from the clinic as well.\n\nFor years, volunteer Gary Terrell has functioned as office manager, scheduler and a former clinic board member. He estimates there are about 40 volunteers of which about 18 or 19 regularly volunteer at the clinic.\n\nVolunteer Shirley Rucks, a parishioner of St. Paul of the Cross Church in Columbia City, checks patients in and files office work. After retiring from a successful career with General Motors, Rucks said, \u201cI felt it was my need to give back to those in need.\u201d\n\nSarah Mossburg, a nurse who works surgery at Parkview Whitley Hospital and also a clinic board member, told Today\u2019s Catholic, \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite thing I do. You feel the appreciation the people have for the services we are offering them.\u201d\n\nMossburg often hears from patients that they would like the clinic to be open more days, and they would also like a dental clinic. \u201cWe have this need, and we really want to be able to meet that,\u201d Mossburg said.\n\nPhillips said, \u201cIf there is a group of Catholic doctors or nurse practitioners or any type of medical professionals that could give us four hours every three to six months, it would be amazing to have them come here and just deliver the care to the patients.\u201d\n\nDoctors and nurse practitioners that wish to volunteer should contact Dr. Hayhurst at 260-433-0057. Other medical professionals interested in volunteering should call Phillips at 260-564-1946.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's Catholic is a Catholic news service dedicated to presenting important news, articles and information to the parishioners of the Fort Wayne / South Bend diocese.", "generator": "WordPress 3.4.1", "robots": "all,follow,index", "revisit-after": "20 days", "owner": "The Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne & South Bend, Indiana", "distribution": "global", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 The Diocese of Fort Wayne - South Bend - http://www.diocesefwsb.org", "verify-v1": "JIDbvuWpt15+kQvSbGUcL9X5BYs/P4cOPukDTkPxxro="}, "article_summary": "\u201cI came in here, because it is a free health clinic,\u201d Dan told Today\u2019s Catholic.\nStill, Dr. Hayhurst and another clinic volunteer doctor, Dr. Terry Frederick, kept encouraging Dan to quit smoking.\nBy Tim JohnsonCOLUMBIA CITY \u2014 The Multi-County Medical Outreach Clinic in Columbia City needs a few more volunteers \u2014 doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses and office support staff.\nMany are working people who only earn about $15,000 per year, Dr. Hayhurst noted.\nSome patients, Phillips said, don\u2019t have an income."}
