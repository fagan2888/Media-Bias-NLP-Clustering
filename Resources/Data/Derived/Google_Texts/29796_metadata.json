Some business owners \u2014 having seen some long-time businesses forced out by higher rents already \u2014 are expressing fears that the upgrades, known as the Streetscape Project, could force them to relocate too.\n\n\u201cIt is going to make it a very desirable place for a lot of big-name businesses that small businesses can\u2019t compete with in terms of rent,\u201d said Jessica Roth, owner of European Cobblery \u2014 which has been at its current location, 410 S. California Ave., since 1982. Her great-grandfather first opened the shop at a different location on California Avenue in 1940.\n\n\n\nView Larger Map\n\nThe future of California Avenue is being debated as the City Council tinkers with a comprehensive plan to guide future development. Some council members say California Avenue has room to grow and want to see it as bustling as nearby University Avenue.\n\nBut many native Palo Altans worry that the street could lose its distinctive characteristics and that long-standing, independent businesses will be replaced by chain stores.\n\nCity Council Member Greg Schmid explained the clash of views: \u201cOne is that California Avenue should be a local shopping center with one or two-story buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other is that it should be more of an \u2018office-based downtown.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn April 2012, a group of California Avenue business owners took out a full-page advertisement in the Palo Alto Daily News to oppose the Streetscape Project.\n\n\u201cWe fought it tooth and tail,\u201d European Cobblery\u2019s Roth said. \u201cWe like California Avenue the way it is.\u201d\n\nSome businesses have already felt the transformation to a more upscale strip.\n\nCho\u2019s tiny dim sum restaurant at 213 S. California Ave. is slated to close on March 23 after more than three decades. The owners, Cho and Daisy Yu, received a 60-day eviction notice on Jan. 16. The landlord declined to renew the lease, saying she is renovating the property. One resident circulated an online petitionto keep the restaurant open that has amassed more than 2,000 signatures.\n\nOther long-standing businesses have already left because of changes on the strip.\n\nBill Burruss, 68, opened his used bookstore, \u201cKnow Knew Books,\u201d on California Avenue in 1988. After 25 years on California Avenue, Burruss moved the store to Los Altos last October, after he says his lease expired and rent increased by $2,000 per month to $7,600.\n\n\u201cThe difference between 1988 and now is substantial,\u201d Burruss said. \u201cI think the community isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d\n\nBurruss pointed to the decrease in retailers and increase in restaurants. \u201cIt went from a place that had a steady flow of local people throughout the day to a more time-oriented area \u2014 lunch and dinner,\u201d Burruss said.\n\nArthur Keller, a member of the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission, expressed sympathy for the local businesses\u2019 concerns but said he couldn\u2019t guarantee they wouldn\u2019t be forced out amid future development.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have rent control for commercial stores,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can make sure local businesses are not priced out, but what we can do is at least make sure that they don\u2019t have to compete with chain stores that are more deep-pocketed than the local businesses can be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business,California Ave.,California Avenue,chain stores,commercial rent,development,local business,Palo Alto,Palo Alto Streetscape Project,priced out,Streetscape Project,Thomas Johnson,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia,Politics & Gov", "description": "Palo Alto\u2019s \u201csecond downtown\u201d will soon experience a makeover, with a major renovation project that includes expanding sidewalks and reducing traffic lanes.
