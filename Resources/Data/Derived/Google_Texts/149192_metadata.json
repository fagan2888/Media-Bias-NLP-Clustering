During a hearing with a Senate panel in June, the veteran diplomat said it might be \u201ctime to begin exploring the possibility of lifting the ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think dropping of the embargo would represent a significant change in the relationship in a variety of important respects,\u201d says Jonathan London, a professor and Vietnamese scholar at Hong Kong\u2019s City University, and the author of Politics in Contemporary Vietnam: Party, State, and Authority Relations.\n\n\u201cNot only would Vietnam be able to acquire arms and equipment, which it sorely needs particularly with respect to maritime capabilities, but it would also imply opportunities to deepen military-to-military ties between the countries and I think arguably that\u2019s at least as significant as the ability to acquire arms.\u201d\n\nThe warming of ties between Hanoi and Washington follows an exceptionally rocky period in relations between Vietnam and Beijing.\n\nIn May, Vietnam\u2019s smoldering distrust of its northern neighbor erupted after a billion-dollar drilling platform belonging to a Chinese state-owned company dropped anchor in the middle of fiercely contested waters near the disputed Paracel archipelago in the South China Sea.\n\nThe presence of the drilling unit set off riots across Vietnam and led to months of maritime clashes as Vietnamese cutters tangled with Chinese coast guard vessels, until the rig was withdrawn from the contentious site in July.\n\nDespite increased tensions with Beijing, experts say Vietnam\u2019s leadership remains pragmatic and unlikely to abruptly give up its relationship with China for the sake of closer ties with Washington.\n\n\u201cVietnam is a long way from joining any alliance with the U.S. \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even participate in the CARAT [Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training] naval cooperation exercises with the U.S. that almost every other ASEAN country does,\u201d Bill Hayton, author of The South China Sea: The Struggle for the Power in Asia, tells TIME.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is hedging its bets and warning China to moderate its actions in the South China Sea, particularly.\u201d\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session at the Asia Society, Foreign Minister Minh brushed off the suggestion by the society\u2019s moderator that the potential sale of U.S. hardware to Vietnam would irritate Beijing.\n\n\u201cIf we do not buy weapons from the United States, we will still buy weapons from other countries,\u201d said Minh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh says the ban should be lifted now that relations with the U.S. have been normalized", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh called the ban on the sale of weapons to Vietnam \"abnormal.\"", "title": "Vietnam Wants End to U.S. Arms Embargo", "url": "http://time.com/3428729/us-vietnam-china-arms-embargo/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/ap849349439479.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/ap849349439479.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh called the ban on the sale of weapons to Vietnam \"abnormal.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Vietnam Wants End to U.S. Arms Embargo"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "vietnam, us, washington, hanoi, beijing, china, south china sea, weapons embargo, asia society", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Vietnam, US, Washington, Hanoi, Beijing, China, South China Sea, Weapons Embargo, Asia Society, U.N.
