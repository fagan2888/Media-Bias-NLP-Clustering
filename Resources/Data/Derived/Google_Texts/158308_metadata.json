Paul LePage\u2019s administration spent nearly $53,000 on private lawyers in its failed attempt to remove thousands of low-income young adults from the state\u2019s Medicaid program after being told by Maine\u2019s attorney general that he couldn\u2019t win the case, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Republican governor went to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals after the federal government denied his request to end Medicaid coverage for about 6,000 19- and 20-year olds. He was forced to seek outside counsel after Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat, declined to represent the state.\n\nMills refused to represent the administration because the case had \u201clittle legal merit\u201d and \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a good use of time and money,\u201d she said in an interview this month. She even joined the federal government in fighting LePage\u2019s effort in court.\n\nBut she allowed the governor to hire outside counsel because of the earnestness of his position and because she said it\u2019s not her \u201caim to prevent the governor, as the chief executive, from pursuing public policy in initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe Maine Department of Health and Human Services paid $51,918 to Portland law firm Roach, Hewitt, Ruprecht, Sanchez & Bischoff from June to December, according to documents provided to the AP through a Freedom of Access Act request. An additional $751 was paid to the firm through LePage\u2019s office before the money was transferred to DHHS, documents from his office show.\n\nAll payments came from the governor\u2019s contingency fund, which he can, for the most part, use at his discretion.\n\nA federal appeals court in November sided with the federal government in rejecting LePage\u2019s request. The court agreed that Maine can\u2019t roll back coverage for 19- and 20-year-olds because the Affordable Care Act requires states to maintain their level of coverage for children until 2019.\n\nJack Comart, litigation director for Maine Equal Justice Partners, which opposed the governor\u2019s move, said the private lawyer representing the administration \u201cmade the best out of a bad case.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the court found no merit in their arguments,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was not a good use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nDHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew defended the expense, saying the administration pursued the case because it believes the tax dollars spent to cover the young adults should instead go to help the elderly and disabled.\n\nMaine shouldn\u2019t be \u201cstuck with a program subject to the whims of Washington D.C,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nState officials have estimated that cutting coverage for the 19-and-20 year-olds would save the state nearly $4 million a year.\n\nMayhew criticized Mills for actively opposing \u201cher own state,\u201d which she said drove up the administration\u2019s legal bills by thousands of dollars. Mills dismissed that idea and said none of the actions her office took increased the administration\u2019s fees or involvement in the case.\n\nA spokeswoman for LePage did not respond to a request for comment from the AP.\n\nLePage has suggested that the legal fight might not be over, telling the Maine Public Broadcasting Network that he hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case. A spokesman for Maine DHHS said it\u2019s not prepared to discuss plans for future litigation.\n\nComart said it\u2019s unlikely that the Supreme Court would consider the case because there is no disagreement between courts to be settled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov.
