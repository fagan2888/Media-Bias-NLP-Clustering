The young woman suffered significant injuries, including trauma to the head, face, jaw, and teeth. She also sustained concussion, migraine headaches, cognitive and memory function problems, closed head injuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD.)\n\nThe allegation of police brutality involves Colorado Springs Police Officer Tyler Walker and 18-year-old Alexis Akers.\n\nAccording to a report by Colorado Springs Independent, Officer Walker and Alexis crossed paths when officers were dispatched to a disturbance involving a gun at Acker\u2019s apartment on the night of Nov. 21, 2013.\n\nPolice officers found no probable cause, but they did find Alexis Acker intoxicated and her boyfriend, 19-year-old Tyrin Tanks.\n\nAccording to Officer Walker\u2019s report, Acker was \u201cintoxicated and verbally uncooperative with police,\u201d and became \u201cphysically combative\u201d when officers arrested Tanks who had an outstanding warrant.\n\nAcker allegedly kicked at police officers, until they pinned her down on a sofa. They arrested Acker on multiple charges, including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. Police note that Alexis continued to resist while she was being walked to a police cruiser.\n\nPolice Officer Walker was 29 years old, 6-foot-3, and about 210 pounds at that time. In his report, Walker says he \u201ceasily\u201d got physical control of Acker, noting that she was 5-foot-4 height and weighed about 110 pounds.\n\nOfficer Walker said in his report that he drove Acker to Memorial Hospital to get a medical clearance before taking her to jail \u201cdue to her intoxication level and combative nature.\u201d\n\nThe police officer wrote in his report what happened as he drove Acker to the hospital.\n\n\u201c[Acker] remained verbally aggressive, continually yelling obscenities towards police and my personal life. She yelled statements such as, \u2018I hope you and your wife can never have any children because you\u2019re a stupid f**king cop.'\u201d\n\nWhen Officer Walker and Acker arrived at the hospital, he told Acker to sit down. When she refused, he \u201cpushed her down into the chair.\u201d Walker\u2019s report claims the teen immediately kicked him \u201cin the groin area.\u201d\n\nPolice Officer Anthony Carey, who was called to the hospital later, wrote in his report that Walker \u201cescorted Ms. Acker to the floor.\u201d\n\nOpposing Views\u2019 coverage cites Sgt. Mary Walsh, who, though not present during the hospital incident involving alleged police brutality, claimed that Walker \u201crolled (Acker) out of the chair to the floor.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Office Walker stated he felt \u201cimmediate pain\u201d and \u201cforcefully threw Ms. Acker face down on the ground,\u201d while he held her in a pinned position.\n\nWalker wrote the following in his report.\n\n\u201cIt was then evident that I had caused her injury and knocked out her front tooth while throwing her on to the hard linoleum hospital floor, while her hands [were] still handcuffed behind her back.\u201d\n\nOfficer Walker added, \u201cAfter my adrenalin wore off,\u201d he started to feel pain in his left knee, an injury he suffered by throwing Acker down, so he filed a Preliminary Accident Form and a Response to Aggression Form.\n\nAlexis Acker\u2019s criminal defense attorney, Cindy Hyatt, expressed her skepticism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way she kicked him that hard in the balls. He wouldn\u2019t be standing. He\u2019d be hunched over. This is a very violent attack on someone who is in handcuffs, who is partially restrained and tiny, and there\u2019s just no need for it.\u201d\n\nHyatt added more on why they accuse Officer Walker of police brutality.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have something like this, whether it happens 100 times, 10 times, or one time. It\u2019s unacceptable. It cannot be tolerated. As a patrol officer in particular, that\u2019s part of the job, dealing with that without planting someone\u2019s face in the floor.\u201d\n\nCivil attorney Shimon Kohn now represents Alexis Acker in her upcoming $500,000 lawsuit involving alleged police brutality.\n\n[Featured image via YouTube]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police brutality allegations were prompted when a police officer slammed a teenager's face onto a hospital floor.
