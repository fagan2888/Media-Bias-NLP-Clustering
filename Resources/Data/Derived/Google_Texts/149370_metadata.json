Ben Sasse, R-Nebr., said while standing outside the memorial for the San Bernardino mass shooting.\n\nWe are most certainly, though, at war with militant Islam. We are at war with the violent Islam. We are at war with jihadi Islam. We are not at war with all Muslims. We\u2019re not at war with Muslim families in Dearborn, Mich. who want the American dream for their kids. But we are at war with those who believe that they will kill in the name of religion.\n\nIn the three-minute, 50-second video, Sasse suggested that in his address, Obama was not being honest with the country \u201cabout those who try to kill us.\u201d He said:\n\nPresident Obama said tonight he\u2019s worried about a backlash against American Muslims. I am, too. And you know what the best way to combat that is? With the truth, by being clear about who we are and what we stand for and by being clear about those who would try to kill us because we believe in freedom.\n\nThe San Bernardino shooting killed 14 and injured another 35. It was the largest terrorist attack in the country since Sept. 11, 2001. The attack followed the downing of a Russian airliner and a terrorist attack in Paris that killed 130.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hours after President Obama addressed the nation, a Republican senator issued a video rebuttal, arguing \u201cwe should tell the truth about the enemy we face.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hours after President Obama addressed the nation, a Republican senator issued a video rebuttal, arguing \u201cwe should tell the truth about the enemy we face.\u201d", "title": "\u2018We Are Most Certainly \u2026 at War With Militant Islam\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Sasse-151207.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T15:30:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NSgI06"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hours after President Obama addressed the nation, a Republican senator issued a video rebuttal, arguing \u201cwe should tell the truth about the enemy we face.\u201d", "title": "\u2018We Are Most Certainly \u2026 at War With Militant Islam\u201d", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Sasse-151207.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-07T17:49:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T15:30:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "terrorism, terror attacks, islam, muslim, president obama, american muslims, ben sasse, sasse"}, "article_summary": "We are most certainly, though, at war with militant Islam.\nThe attack followed the downing of a Russian airliner and a terrorist attack in Paris that killed 130.\nIt was the largest terrorist attack in the country since Sept. 11, 2001.\nWe are at war with the violent Islam.\nWe are at war with jihadi Islam."}
