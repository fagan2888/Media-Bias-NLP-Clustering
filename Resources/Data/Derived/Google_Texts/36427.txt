LONG BRANCH On Sunday the city streets will be filled with the sights, sounds and flavors of the annual Columbus Day parade.

Now in its 68th year, the parade hasn't missed a year since it was started in 1946.

"It's not an Italian parade, it's more like a parade for the city. It's a multicultural city, and the parade will be multicultural," said Joseph Mercadante, who for the past 10 years has been the parade's chairman and organizer.

The parade will kick off at 1 p.m. The route will begin at Long Branch Middle School and proceed up Bath Avenue, turn right on Broadway, then head southeast down Morris Avenue and back to Long Branch Middle School.

The grandstand will be at the middle school and performances will take place there at the conclusion of the parade.

Leading the parade will be this year's grand marshal, Assemblywoman Mary Pat Angelini, R-Ocean.

Local high school bands from Long Branch, Shore Regional, Monmouth Regional and Ocean Township will give performances. Mercadante said other festival bands include a broom string band, a brass band, a barbershop quartet and an Italian festival band.
