The explosion of sectors including big data, mobile apps and cyber security means there's plenty of roles out there \u2013 but many require developer skills.\n\nRelated: College Grads May See Brighter Hiring Outlook\n\nGiven this demand, it is little surprise that companies have sprung up to teach people how to code. One such company is London-based Makers Academy. Its 12-week, full-time program - which costs \u00a38,000 ($13,585) \u2013 is designed for professionals looking for a change of career into a more technical role. Courses like this, which aim to train students to a level where they could get an entry-level development job, are known as coding boot camps.\n\n\"I was working as a developer myself and recruiters kept approaching me for jobs. It didn't take long for me to realize there was a great demand for skilled developers \u2013 but a lack of supply,\" Evgeny Shadchnev, co-founder and CEO of Makers Academy, told CNBC.\n\n\"We seized the opportunity. If your goal is to get a job as a software developer, we will get you there much faster than university.\"\n\nAnd it's not just tech-savvy youngsters that are interested in developing, with Makers Academy's Shadchnev saying many of its students are frustrated professionals looking for a career change. The U.S. Department of Labor expects the employment of software developers to grow 22 percent between 2012 and 2022, compared to an average growth across all occupations of 11 percent.\n\nRelated: How the Right Corporate Culture Can Guarantee Success\n\nAnd according to the Graduate Management Admission Council's (GMAC) 2014 report, employers in both the U.S. and Europe rank technical and quantitative skills \u2013 which include coding \u2013 as the third most important selection criteria when it comes to recruitment.\n\nIn fact, some boot camps are so convinced their students will get good jobs that a number are betting their fees on it. App Academy in San Francisco and New York, for instance, only charges its students after they get a job as a developer, after which it charges 18 percent of their starting salary. Seattle's Code Fellows, meanwhile, gives students a full refund (of the up-to-$5,000 fees) if they don't get a job within nine months of graduating.\n\nTeach Yourself\n\nNot everyone is prepared to shell out thousands for coding courses, however. London-based Jules Coleman, co-founder of cleaner-booking website Hassle, taught herself. \"We wanted to start a company, but were from a much more corporate background, where making a PowerPoint presentation was as technical as it got,\" she told CNBC.\n\nColeman bought a hardback copy of Michael Hartl's tutorial on the web development framework \"Ruby on Rails\" from the local book shop, and built the company's first website.\n\nRelated: How Men and Women Differ in the Workplace\n\n\"I taught myself over the weekends and in the evenings,\" she said. \"I was very naive as to how difficult it would be, but you don't start by building Facebook \u2013 you start with baby steps.\"\n\nColeman stressed that to address the skills shortage that she encountered when Hassle first hired developers, coding bootcamps weren't enough. \"The next generation shouldn't be doing these bridging courses \u2013 they need to be programming from the outset,\" she said.\n\nGet 'Em Young\n\nThere is a growing drive to get children coding from an early age, and in England, coding will become a mandatory part of the school curriculum later this year.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, Google launched Made with Code in June, and pledged a whopping $50 billion to inspire young girls to program in an effort to close the tech gender gap.\n\n\"If kids don't learn how to code there's a danger of a serious digital divide,\" warned Krishna Vedati, CEO of Tynker, a programming course aimed at children. \"As the world evolves, if you don't know the basis of how the technology works, you'll get frustrated by it, and might get left behind.\"\n\nVedati developed Tynker after realizing his children were surrounded by technology, but didn't know how to make it. The result is an online or app-based coding course which is presented like a game for children.\n\nThat it's currently being used in over 10,000 schools across the U.S. demonstrates the push from both schools and parents for children to get up to speed when it comes to programming. \"We learned woodwork \u2013 our kids don't need to learn that. They're learning 3D printing instead,\" he said. \"Programming isn't a fad. This is here to stay.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\n\n\nRead more at CNBC:\n\nAddressing the Skills Gap\n\nJobs skills gap: The basics become a problem\n\nFlunking mathematics?
