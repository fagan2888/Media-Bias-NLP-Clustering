Administrative law judges have scheduled hearings in April in three of the cases, according to online dockets.\n\nAll four clinics are associated with physician James Pendergraft, who performs abortions. Pendergraft was arrested in South Carolina in October for what the state described in the administrative complaints as \"drug related offenses.\"\n\nThe Agency for Health Care Administration delivered the complaints to the clinics on Jan. 19 and 20. The complaints did not give details of Pendergraft's arrest, and an AHCA spokeswoman said the arrest records were confidential.\n\nHowever, the complaints state that Pendergraft can no longer pass a Level 2 background check due to the arrest, so he no longer qualifies for his \"ownership interest\" in the clinics.\n\nThe complaints also said the clinics are responsible for ensuring that \"vulnerable persons\" are not exposed to employees who are unable to pass a Level 2 background check.\n\n\"According to the respondent's license files, James Pendergraft owns more than 5 percent of the respondent and is the financial officer of the respondent,\" each complaint said. \"As an owner and controlling interest of the respondent, Mr. Pendergraft was required at all times to maintain a satisfactory Level 2 background screening result. With his arrest and pending criminal charges, Mr. Pendergraft is disqualified and is no longer in compliance with Florida law.\"\n\nAn attorney for the clinics, Frederick T. Lowe of Tampa, responded Feb. 1 to the complaints, denying that Pendergraft \"owns and/or controls 5 percent or more\" of the clinics.\n\nReached by telephone, Lowe said Thursday he could not discuss the case without his client's permission.\n\n\"It looks like we're going to settle it,\" he said.\n\nThe Agency for Health Care Administration also has been embroiled in recent months in legal battles with other abortion clinics over allegations that the clinics performed second-trimester abortions without having proper licenses. Four challenges filed by clinics remain pending in the Division of Administrative Hearings, while another case was settled.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Four Florida abortion clinics --- two in Orlando and one each in Ocala and Fort Lauderdale --- face the potential loss of their licenses following the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/abortion-clinics-face-licensure-loss-after-doctors-arrest", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201308/stock_gavel_and_stethoscope_legal_lawsuits.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Four Florida abortion clinics --- two in Orlando and one each in Ocala and Fort Lauderdale --- face the potential loss of their licenses following the", "title": "Abortion Clinics Face Licensure Loss After Doctor's Arrest"}, "wordCount": 481, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Margie Menzel of the News Service of Florida", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Abortion Clinics Face Licensure Loss After Doctor&#039;s Arrest"}, "nid": 13681, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "story_id": 467370669, "keywords": "Abortion, abortion clinic, Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, AHCA", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3b36\"", "article_summary": "The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed administrative complaints last month against EPOC Clinic LLC in Orlando, Orlando Women's Center LLC, Ocala Women's Center LLC and Fort Lauderdale Women's Center LLC.\nThe complaints did not give details of Pendergraft's arrest, and an AHCA spokeswoman said the arrest records were confidential.\nPendergraft was arrested in South Carolina in October for what the state described in the administrative complaints as \"drug related offenses.\"\nFour Florida abortion clinics --- two in Orlando and one each in Ocala and Fort Lauderdale --- face the potential loss of their licenses following the arrest of a physician the state says has an \"ownership interest\" in them.\nThe clinics are challenging the agency, with cases filed last week in the state Division of Administrative Hearings."}
