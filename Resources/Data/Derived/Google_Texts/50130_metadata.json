Chris Hondros/Getty Images\n\nHiring was surprisingly weak in January for the second straight month, likely renewing concern that the U.S. economy might be slowing after a strong finish last year. Employers added 113,000 jobs, the government said Friday, far less than the average monthly gain of 194,000 last year. This follows December's tepid increase of just 75,000. Job gains have averaged only 154,000 the past three months, down from 201,000 in the preceding three months. \"This is a weak jobs report, and this is two months in a row we've had really tepid jobs growth in the United States,\" said former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Seth Harris. \"It's an indication that for working families, the economy is not recovering fast enough and, sadly, the economy may be even slowing down.\"\n\nThe report also showed that slightly more Americans began looking for work in January. The labor force participation rate \u2014 which measures how many adults are working or actively looking for work \u2014 held steady, going up slightly to 63 percent, from 62.8 percent in December. As a result, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent. That's the lowest rate since October 2008. However, Kevin Kerr, CEO of the trading firm Kerr Trading International, issued a word of caution, saying the jobs report does not necessarily tell the whole story of the U.S. economy. \"These reports, when they come out, they really don't factor in a lot of things \u2014 how many people have been out of work or stopped looking altogether,\" Kerr told Al Jazeera's Del Walters on Friday. \"And so, oftentimes, we look at these numbers with kind of a blind eye and wonder if they\u2019re accurate or not.\"\n\nWhat will the Fed do?\n\nRetailers cut 12,900 jobs, the most in 18 months, and government shed 29,000 jobs, mostly in education and the Postal Service. Average hourly earnings rose 5 cents to $24.21, the report said. Average hourly pay has increased 1.9 percent in the past year, slightly ahead of the 1.5 percent inflation rate. Sluggish job growth for a second straight month may reflect what investors and economists have begun to fear: that the U.S. job market is weakening again. The second straight month of weak hiring \u2014 marked by declines in retail, utilities, government, and education and health employment \u2014 could also be a problem for the Federal Reserve, which is tapering its monthly bond-purchasing stimulus program. The unemployment rate is now nearing the 6.5 percent level that Fed officials have said would trigger discussions over when to raise benchmark interest rates from near zero. But policymakers have made it clear that rates will not rise anytime soon even if the unemployment threshold is breached. \"There's a lot of uncertainty for investors right now, and I think there's more downside for the market because of that uncertainty,\" Kerr told Al Jazeera.\n\nWeak but not all bleak", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fewer jobs added than last year\u2019s monthly average, but jobless rate drops to 6.6 percent", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/7/us-employers-add113kjobswhileunemploymentratedipsto66percent.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/7/us-employers-add113kjobswhileunemploymentratedipsto66percent/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "Fewer jobs added than last year\u2019s monthly average, but jobless rate drops to 6.6 percent", "title": "US January jobs report disappoints"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/7/us-employers-add113kjobswhileunemploymentratedipsto66percent/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "description": "Fewer jobs added than last year\u2019s monthly average, but jobless rate drops to 6.6 percent", "card": "summary", "title": "US January jobs report disappoints"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "U.S., Economy, Jobs & Unemployment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbeef\"", "article_summary": "\"This is a weak jobs report, and this is two months in a row we've had really tepid jobs growth in the United States,\" said former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Seth Harris.\nRetailers cut 12,900 jobs, the most in 18 months, and government shed 29,000 jobs, mostly in education and the Postal Service.\nHowever, Kevin Kerr, CEO of the trading firm Kerr Trading International, issued a word of caution, saying the jobs report does not necessarily tell the whole story of the U.S. economy.\nEmployers added 113,000 jobs, the government said Friday, far less than the average monthly gain of 194,000 last year.\nAs a result, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent."}
