That, in itself shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Notwithstanding Republican claims to the contrary, the level of spending cuts that would be necessary to balance the government\u2019s books, even over 10 years, would be politically unbearable absent a minor miracle of economic growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising is that, according the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, a balanced budget isn\u2019t even a long-term goal anymore, if it ever was in the first place.\n\nRelated: GOP, Business Groups, Blast Obama\u2019s Budget\n\nCEA Chairman Jason Furman fielded questions from reporters after the administration\u2019s budget proposal was issued on Monday. He took reporters back to 2008 when the primary focus of the president\u2019s economic team was to restore economic growth.\n\n\u201cIn 2008 in the transition\u2026the whole original economic team was trying to figure out what the right fiscal goal was going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd economically, the decision was the right fiscal goal was to make sure the debt was falling as a share of the economy, which would require the deficit to be below about 3 percent of GDP. That\u2019s a goal we achieved in 2014.\u201d\n\nEarly in the Great Recession, many otherwise fiscally conservative voices were supportive of substantial deficit spending to help pull the economy out of the doldrums. Most, however, wouldn\u2019t have agreed that running a deficit continually was an acceptable economic plan.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Tax-the-Rich Budget Called \u2018Envy Economics\u2019\n\nOn Monday, though, Furman said that merely keeping the deficit under three percent of GDP is the extent of the administration\u2019s fiscal goals for the next decade and, apparently, beyond.\n\nFurman said, \u201cThat\u2019s a goal we need to take additional steps on taxes, on healthcare, on immigration, to make sure we continue to meet\u2026over the next decade and beyond. [I]t\u2019s one that\u2019s very consistent with what economics would tell you that you need to do to be in a sustainable and strong position to grow economically.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who was on the same panel as Furman, jumped and pointed out, \u201cThe 3 percent target was also the one advocated by the minor deities that served on the Simpson-Bowles Commission,\u201d referring to a bipartisan group chaired by former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, White House Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget plan does indeed aim to keep the federal deficit at a level below 3 percent over ten years, and the federal debt, while it will continue to increase in dollar terms, will decline as a share of GDP, from about 75 percent now to 73 percent. After that, it will flatten out \u2013 according to the numbers presented by the White House.\n\nRelated: Obama Would Slash Overseas War Budget by 21 Percent\n\nSome deficit hawks bemoaned the president\u2019s decision to propose discretionary spending over and above the caps set by the controversial \u201csequester\u201d put in place as part of the 2011 budget compromise. But Shaun Donovan, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget made the case that growing the economy is more important than worrying about spending levels, pointing out that the real money isn\u2019t in the discretionary portion of the budget anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to where our challenges are in the long term on the fiscal side,\u201d he said. \u201cDiscretionary spending\u2026is at a very low level relative to GDP. In fact over our budget window it continues to grow smaller as a share of GDP because it is not growing as fast as GDP. So it is not the fiscal challenge to be focused on. In fact, if anything, the reverse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to grow our economy,\u201d Donovan said, it will require investing in the kinds of domestic programs, including education and childcare tax credits that the president proposed.\n\nThe administration\u2019s plan was met with consternation by budget watchdogs, who believe that with the U.S. economy picking up steam, now is the time to address the growing federal debt.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon\u2019s \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 F-35 Gets Another $10.6 Billion\n\n\u201cWith debt levels at a post-war record high and the economic recovery finally starting to take hold, we needed the President to use this opportunity to begin tackling the drivers of our growing debt,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nFocusing on short- and medium-term growth instead of long-term debt reduction, she warned, is a dangerous tradeoff. \u201cIn the end, failing to address the drivers of the debt will ultimately undermine the President\u2019s other priorities. The focus on promoting investment today will do little good if our massive debt is choking the investments of tomorrow. And the desire to strengthen middle-class families can\u2019t be fulfilled if Social Security and Medicare remain on a path to insolvency with huge across-the-board cuts looming in the future.\u201d\n\nRobert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, pointed out that while the president\u2019s budget might hold up on paper, it has no chance in Congress.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Budget \u2013 Good News for ISIS, Bad News for Taxpayers\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s budget sets the stage for a vigorous debate on the right mix of spending and tax policies needed to put the nation\u2019s finances on a sustainable path,\u201d he said. \u201cIts heavy reliance on higher revenues to pay for new spending demonstrates one way to keep the debt from rising as a share of the economy, but it is certain to be rejected by the new Republican Congress.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the budget, even if fully enacted, would do little more than hold the debt near its currently high level because policies that could be used for sustained deficit reduction, particularly in the out years, are used to pay for new initiatives instead.\u201d\n\nCitizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz didn\u2019t spare the metaphors in his angry comments about the budget proposal. \u201cThe President claims he has no intention of \u2018trimming his sails\u2019 in regard to any of his budget plans,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the ship of state has been fiscally off course for years and the President\u2019s FY 2016 budget will steer it into a massive, dangerous wave of red ink.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Discussing the president\u2019s budget proposal on Monday, a top White House adviser made it clear that as far as the Obama administration is concerned, the goal should be to limit the federal deficit, not to eliminate it.", "title": "In the Obama White House, It\u2019s Deficits as Far as the Eye Can See", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Obama-White-House-It-s-Deficits-Far-Eye-Can-See", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11022012_obama_frown_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Obama-White-House-It-s-Deficits-Far-Eye-Can-See", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11022012_obama_frown_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Discussing the president\u2019s budget proposal on Monday, a top White House adviser made it clear that as far as the Obama administration is concerned, the goal should be to limit the federal deficit, not to eliminate it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He took reporters back to 2008 when the primary focus of the president\u2019s economic team was to restore economic growth.\nThe Obama administration appears to have resigned itself to a federal government that runs deficits in perpetuity, something that has deficit hawks in despair as they read the president\u2019s budget proposal for Fiscal 2016.\nAfter that, it will flatten out \u2013 according to the numbers presented by the White House.\nWhat\u2019s surprising is that, according the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, a balanced budget isn\u2019t even a long-term goal anymore, if it ever was in the first place.\nThe budget proposed by the president yesterday fails to balance the budget over its 10-year window."}
