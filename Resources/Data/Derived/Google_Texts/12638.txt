Rick Santorum, or Ol’ Frothy if you are using Joe Veix’s handy Presidential Name Swamp browser extension, is a long shot for the 2016 Republican nomination.

Just how much of a long shot? Well, just one voter showed up to the former Pennsylvania senator’s Iowa campaign stop on Monday. Omens can’t get any more foreboding than that, can they?

According to POLITICO, the lone voter showed up to the 2 p.m. campaign stop in a diner in Hamlin, Iowa, a community with a population of about 300. CNN dubbed this stop part of his “empty diner strategy.” Damn, that’s cold.

That one voter was Peggy Toft, who also happens to chair the Audubon County Republican Party. However, after spending 10 minutes of one-on-one time with Santorum, and presumably sharing onion rings with the presidential hopeful, Toft wouldn’t fully commit to supporting him in the caucus, although she does remark that she is leaning that way.

“I feel like I have to get all of the facts,” Toft said.

It’s worth pointing out that Toft does already agree with Santorum’s conservative views on family values, the Affordable Care Act, and his opposition to gay marriage.

However, it sounds like Santorum doesn’t see almost nonexistent turnout as a setback.

“People don’t understand. One guy in there said, ‘I’ll speak for you at the caucus,’” Santorum said. “That’s maybe eight votes that you wouldn’t otherwise get. Eight votes can make a big difference, as I know.”

You keep telling yourself that, bub.

I mean, in Santorum’s defense, an empty campaign stop isn’t the most embarrassing thing you’ll find when you Google the guy.
