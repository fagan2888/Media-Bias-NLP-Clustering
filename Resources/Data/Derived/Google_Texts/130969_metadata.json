And they looked to Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to silence the partisan bickering in hopes of reform.\n\nScott hosted and Senate Chaplain Barry Black moderated a panel featuring Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Sens. Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.), Roland Burris (D-Ill.) and William \u201cMo\u201d Cowan (D-Mass.) at the Library of Congress for an event called \u201cHonoring Our Past, Celebrating Our Future: Discussing Personal Journeys and a Nation\u2019s Progress with America\u2019s Black Senators.\u201d Kicking off the event with a \u201cnonpartisan \u2018Amen,'\u201d the group of accomplished senators and trailblazers discussed the crucial need for young Americans to challenge themselves and their boundaries to achieve success. But among the jokes, ribbing between colleagues, and anecdotes, the trio of former senators called on their successors, specifically Scott, to put aside party politics and work to find common ground.\n\n\u201cThese issues that we face are critical to the world and to have the kind of gridlock and stand-off and partisanship that I\u2019ve seen as an observer from the outside just does a great disservice to our country,\u201d Braun, who served as Ambassador to New Zealand until 2001, said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who needs to start the conversation or whether we need to just wrap it up. But the fact of the matter is that this kind of partisanship that we\u2019ve seen does a disservice to the legacy of the Senate, to the importance of the institution and to our whole country.\u201d\n\nThe 113th Congress is the first to include two African-American senators \u2014 Booker and Scott \u2014 serving simultaneously. Yet despite the progress their presence represents, the upper and lower chambers\u2019 label as the \u201cthe do-nothing Congress\u201d has overshadowed the merits of its members.\n\nAnd while Booker and Scott disagree on policy issues such as Obamacare, the minimum wage and immigration reform, the senators and their predecessors agreed that compromise was needed to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I wanted to bring us together was so we can share with the world \u2026 that all things are absolutely, positively, unequivocally possible in the United States of America,\u201d Scott said.\n\nThe South Carolina senator, who was appointed by Gov. Nikki Haley in 2012, was the only Republican on the panel. Flanked by a duo of Democrats on either side, Scott said a life of public service is not met without challenges.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s difficult being a member of the Senate sometimes,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe seem to have made it more difficult than it should be.\u201d\n\nBut speaking to journalists after the event, the South Carolina Republican said he and Booker have plans to cross the partisan divide and tackle education, sentencing guidelines and tax reform in the near future.\n\nThe panel agreed that it would take the leadership of Scott and Booker to guide Congress to serve the American people well.\n\n\u201cGeorge Washington, in his farewell address, pointed to the danger of what he called factions. And, quite frankly, I think that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019re looking at now: Factions. Because to say one\u2019s a Democrat, one\u2019s Republican, almost doesn\u2019t describe anything anymore. What kind of Republican? What kind of Democrat? Where are you from?\u201d Braun said. \u201cAll of these things have us breaking down into little pods of people. And those little pods may serve their own interest, but they do not serve the interest of the American people.\u201d\n\nCowan, who left the Senate in 2013, noted that while the Senate has its flaws and partisan bickering, the body\u2019s problems can still be fixed by those who are elected to serve in it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I left the floor of the Senate, I said that there was nothing wrong with the Senate that can\u2019t be fixed by what\u2019s right with the Senate \u2026 the people in the body are fully empowered to make the Senate and the Congress at large work as effectively as the American people need it to be, as long and only if they\u2019re willing to do so,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "With partisan gridlock casting a shadow on the United States Congress' upper chamber, a panel of African-American senators both past and present called for an end to the standstill at a Tuesday event marking Black History Month.
