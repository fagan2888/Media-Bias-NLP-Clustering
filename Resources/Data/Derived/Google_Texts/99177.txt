Story highlights Jeb Bush said he believes his energy proposal could create 1 million jobs and enhance the country's national security

The former Florida governor also called for more local control of natural resources

Pittsburgh (CNN) Jeb Bush praised capitalism in pushing his energy proposal on Tuesday, which he said could create 1 million jobs and enhance the country's national security by loosening regulations and lifting the ban on crude oil exports.

The former Florida governor, making his case at an oil and natural gas company in western Pennsylvania, also called for more local control of natural resources. The quickest boost to the economy, he argued, would be approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.

"As president, I would approve the XL pipeline, for crying out loud. That is the lowest hanging fruit," he said to applause from employees at Rice Energy, Inc., in Canonsburg.

It's a position that's part of his regular stump speech and puts him in line with many in his party, but it's squarely in opposition to who he describes as "radical environmentalists."

Opponents of the project cite environmental concerns and worries about the impact on tribal communities near the pipeline, but proponents, like Bush, say that the finished project would create thousands of jobs and contribute to economic output.
