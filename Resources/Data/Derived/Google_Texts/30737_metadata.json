She said the yacht will be docked in front of the Hyatt in Downtown Jersey City, where one of the Super Bowl teams will be staying.\n\n\u201cWithout this boat, it would have been impossible,\u201d Cerria said. \u201cTheir criteria was so specific regarding the space and height they needed, there was only one boat.\u201d\n\nHaving the perfect venue \u2014 with a perfect view of the New York skyline \u2014 was half the battle, Cerria said. The other half is knowing the right people.\n\nHer company has a strong relationship with the Westin in Downtown Jersey City, which will host the other Super Bowl participant. She was referred by officials there to the NFL and the rest, she hopes, will be Super Bowl history.\n\n\u201cRelationships are really important in this business,\u201d she said. \u201cI advertise, I market, I network, and that\u2019s all well and good, but I think that the relationships that we have are really what make our company what it is and what really drives business to us.\n\n\u201cWord of mouth, people trust it.\u201d\n\nCerria became an even bigger NFL fan when the San Francisco 49ers, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots \u2014 three of the four teams vying for a spot in the big game \u2014 contacted her about potentially hosting their private parties aboard one of the yachts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been so excited about the Super Bowl in all my life,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cAnd now I feel as if I\u2019m invested to see which team\u2019s going to win and how their party\u2019s going to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Joseph R.
