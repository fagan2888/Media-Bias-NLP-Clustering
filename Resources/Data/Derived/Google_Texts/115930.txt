Army veteran John Miller got a heartfelt delivery this week from D.C., after his father’s American flag was stolen from the front porch of his Oregon home.

U.S. Rep. Greg Walden sent Mr. Miller a brand new American flag and a certificate showing that very flag had flown over the U.S. Capitol, a local ABC affiliate reported.

“I am so very grateful,” Mr. Miller said of the gift. “I almost couldn’t believe it at first.”

The vet told the news station in March that a thief had stolen the flag that he had displayed proudly for decades at the front of his home. He later posted an ad in the “Lost and Found” section of Craigslist asking for anyone who had have any information on the theft to contact him.

Mr. Walden heard the story and contacted the ABC affiliate to arrange for a replacement flag to be delivered to Mr. Miller’s home this week.

“I was so offended when I learned about this that I called up Mr. Miller and offered to fly a flag over the U.S. Capitol in his honor and send it to him to replace the one that was stolen,” the Oregon Republican told the station. “We need to send a strong message: you don’t mess with our veterans and you don’t mess with our flag.”
