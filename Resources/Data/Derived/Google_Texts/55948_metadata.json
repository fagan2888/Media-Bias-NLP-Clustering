Since then, the GOP has shifted South. And modern New Hampshire Republicans are far more socially progressive than their fellow Republican kin across the country.\n\n\n\nAs the national GOP brand has evolved, what\u2019s the role of the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary in 2016?\n\n\n\nA Different Emphasis Elsewhere\n\n\n\nWhen Republican candidates are not in New Hampshire, they often fervently show off their conservative credentials.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was the solicitor general of Texas, I was proud to defend the Ten Commandments monument on the state capitol grounds,\u201d Ted Cruz told a crowd last month at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush, usually more religiously tepid, was just as eager.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe should not push aside those that do believe in traditional marriage. I, for one, believe it\u2019s important,\u201d he told the same Washington conference.\n\n\n\nAnd his fellow Floridian presidential candidate, Marco Rubio, expressed a similar message. \u201cYou cannot have strong families with a government that strong-arms parents and our faith,\u201d he told the conference, to applause.\n\n\n\nBut catch Cruz, Bush or Rubio in New Hampshire, and they\u2019re likely to talk about the economy, ISIS and Obamacare.\n\n\n\nWhen Republican presidential candidates swing through New Hampshire, social issues are on the back burner.\n\n\n\nTake Carly Fiorina. In Iowa, she seems to be trying to make abortion a major campaign issue. But at a recent campaign stop in New Hampshire, she only mentioned abortion when a voter directly asked her about it.\n\n\n\nThat voter was Andrea Alexander, and she says a candidate\u2019s abortion position is a litmus test for many of her friends. \u201cThe Republicans have to nail that,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIf you\u2019re anti-Roe v. Wade, goodbye.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlexander personally disagrees with Fiorina\u2019s opposition to abortion rights, but she says she\u2019ll still vote for Fiorina. \u201cShe\u2019s my new Mitt Romney,\u201d Alexander said, laughing. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s about the economy, stupid.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nHow New Hampshire Republicans Differ\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans here aren\u2019t going to be upset if a candidate has a position on either gay marriage or abortion that is out of step with theirs. They just don\u2019t want to hear them talk about it,\u201d said University of New Hampshire political scientist Andy Smith. \u201cThey\u2019re more than happy to have the candidate hold whatever position they feel is important, but just don\u2019t try to get me to change my mind and make me vote for you because of that position.\u201d\n\n\n\nPolls suggest New Hampshire is one of the least religious states in the country, second only to Vermont. And nearly half of Republican primary voters approve of same-sex marriage, another poll found. They\u2019re also more supportive of abortion rights than the country as a whole.\n\n\n\nSmith says the discrepancy between New Hampshire Republican values and national Republican values creates tension, and so GOP candidates steer clear of social issues on the New Hampshire campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\u201cGreat example of that: Ben Carson was here. And Carson got his political start largely being involved in evangelical groups \u2026 very popular among social conservative groups within the Republican Party,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cHe came and talked [here] and didn\u2019t talk once about abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy talk about [abortion]?\u201d asked Dough Scamman rhetorically. \u201cIt\u2019s the law and it\u2019s a done deal, and it\u2019s not gonna get repealed.\u201d Scamman is a veteran state lawmaker, sort of like GOP royalty in the Granite State.\n\n\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire is a place that looks at people, how do we think they\u2019re gonna govern, not so much how they\u2019re going to tell us how we live our lives,\u201d said Scamman, who considers himself middle-of-the-road, but still a staunch Republican. He continued to explain that New Hampshire voters do not want to hear people preach at them. \u201cI think people want to know that the president is going to be able to lead this country in reducing expenditures, balancing the budget, and being fiscally responsible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn Outlier \u2014 But One With Predictive Power\n\n\n\nSmith, the UNH political scientist, points out that for a good chunk of the 20th century, New England \u2014 and New Hampshire, in particular \u2014 was Republican territory.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not that the voters in New Hampshire have changed, it\u2019s really that the Republican Party has changed \u2014 a lot,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans in other parts of the country tend to think of New Hampshire as an outlier, he added. But, if it is an outlier, it\u2019s an outlier with a strangely predictive power.\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically if you win New Hampshire as a Republican, you win the nomination,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\n\nThat pattern seems counter-intuitive. The national party has shifted away from New England, but New Hampshire still seems to have an outsized impact on picking the GOP nominee.\n\n\n\nSmith explains the apparent contradiction this way: \u201cBecause it\u2019s early in the process and because it has high turnout, after New Hampshire, the moderate wing of the party is winnowed down to one candidate typically.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then, Smith says, by the time the primary cycle moves to South Carolina, the GOP battle has shrunk to that one moderate, mainstream Republican and a few social conservatives.\n\n\n\nChris Galdieri, a politics professor at St. Anselm\u2019s College in Manchester, has another theory. He says the New Hampshire primary remains important because it\u2019s not just about New Hampshire \u2014 it\u2019s a microcosm of a general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of Republicans are going to be paying attention to not just who says the right things, but who do I think has the best chance of getting elected,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAnd, Galdieri says the money and the power brokers tend to pay attention too, aligning themselves with the winner of the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\n\nHe says New Hampshire\u2019s elevated role is sort of an accident of history. But the accident means that even in 2016, the old-fashioned New Hampshire strain of GOP politics carries more weight than you would expect in the modern Republican Party.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The 2016 presidential election is a big birthday for the New Hampshire primary, as\u00a0it turns 100.The state\u2019s first presidential primary was held in 1916,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/though-republican-base-has-shifted-south-nh-primary-keeps-role", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201507/427075853.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The 2016 presidential election is a big birthday for the New Hampshire primary, as\u00a0it turns 100.The state\u2019s first presidential primary was held in 1916,", "title": "Though The Republican Base Has Shifted South, N.H.
