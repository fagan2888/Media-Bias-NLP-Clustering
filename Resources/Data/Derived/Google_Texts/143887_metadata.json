Beginning life as a Web series, the show about inept Denver high school teachers was picked by Amazon as a top viewers\u2019 choice in 2012 to be continued as a series. Then it was declared dead when Amazon passed on it in 2014.\n\nNow, because the girlfriend of a programming executive happened to see it on Amazon, it is not only resurrected but in production for a basic cable network where it will be prominently featured as the network\u2019s debut scripted project.\n\nAdam Cayton-Holland, Ben Roy and Andrew Orvedahl are currently shooting the last of 10 episodes in their series about the dysfunctional teaching staff. Cayton-Holland plays a haughty Spanish teacher, Orvedahl is the clueless gym teacher and the much-inked Roy is a punk-rock history teacher. They write, star in and have executive producer credits on the project, supported by experienced crew, including a veteran of \u201cArrested Development,\u201d and a real budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life,\u201d Cayton-Holland said during a break in shooting on a recent afternoon. In February, as truTV\u2019s first scripted series, \u201cThose Who Can\u2019t\u201d will signal the direction of the new tru (as the former crime-and-court channel will call itself), in a rebrand backed by Turner\u2019s corporate promotional muscle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nuts to be thrown in, in charge,\u201d Cayton-Holland said. It\u2019s an unusual responsibility for Hollywood newcomers. For now, \u201cwe\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with incredible people.\u201d\n\nSarah Michelle Geller will have a guest role. Peter Stormare (\u201cFargo,\u201d \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d), Michael Madsen (\u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d), Susie Essman (\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d) and Denver pal T.J. Miller (\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d) also have parts. Tracey Baird (\u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d) and Krysia Plonka (\u201cMind of Mencia\u201d) of Thank You, Brain! Productions are executive producers. Dean Lorey (\u201cArrested Development\u201d) is the showrunner, a fact that cast and crew utter with some reverence.\n\nOn a recent weekday, a fight was underway on the set in a darkened hallway of empty Van Nuys High School, standing in for the fictional Reed Smoot school in Denver. The team was shooting Episode 8, a highly stylized horror movie spoof, with Bobcat Goldthwait directing and Gaelle Cohen, stunt coordinator for \u201cZoolander 2,\u201d choreographing the slapfest.\n\nThe guys\u2019 headlamps and Orvedahl\u2019s light-up sneaker soles pierce the dark. Take after take, they slap, shout, take hits, slap, fall back and repeat.\n\n\u201cSomeone just tell me that this is a dream!\u201d Cayton-Holland shouts, again and again, in character as Loren Payton. They trade slaps to wake whoever might be dreaming.\n\nWatching on monitors in a science classroom, executive producers Baird and Plonka crack up.\n\n\u201cThey are incredibly professional,\u201d Plonka said. \u201cThey respect the process and appreciate the opportunity they\u2019ve been given. It\u2019s great the network took a chance on some relatively unknown names. Talent aside, they are incredibly nice guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may be a Colorado thing,\u201d Cayton-Holland said. \u201cWe\u2019re not boastful. You roll up your sleeves and go to work.\u201d \u2026 \u201cCut to 10 years from now,\u201d he jokes, \u201cand we\u2019re all a\u2013holes.\u201d\n\nColorado references are sprinkled into the scripts, including Broncos jokes and talk of skiing, Stapleton and local companies that granted clearances such as Illegal Pete\u2019s and Trve brewing. Grawlix stickers dot the lockers. So far, there\u2019s only one legal weed joke, to avoid the obvious.\n\nA crash course\n\nBetween takes, the guys discuss the Rockies\u2019 trade to the Blue Jays and their fatigue due to the scene\u2019s repeated sprints and freakouts.\n\n\u201cI hesitate to call myself an actor,\u201d Cayton-Holland said. \u201cIt has been a crash course, all day, every day.\u201d Leading to this moment, \u201cwe\u2019ve been making these sketches for five years, all DIY, we\u2019re self-taught.\u201d The goal is to produce a series on par with \u201cThe League\u201d or \u201cBroad City,\u201d two popular and similarly, modestly budgeted, youngish, hippish series.\n\nAll are eager to get back to stand-up when shooting is complete. \u201cIt uses different muscles, scratches the same itch,\u201d Cayton-Holland said. \u201cIf stand-up comedy is cruising down a highway, (television) is stop and start,\u201d requiring endless repetition, reverse angles and more.\n\nThe tedium of making a TV show is unavoidable. The line they hear most often from the producers: \u201cThat was perfect! Do it again.\u201d\n\nWhile Cayton-Holland\u2019s character, Payton, is a ringleader, Roy describes his character, Billy Shoemaker, in a scene in which he\u2019s wearing a pink lace tank top that shows off his tattoos, as \u201cthe Klinger of this show.\u201d Orvedahl paints his eager-to-please character, Coach Fairbell, as \u201ca human golden retriever.\u201d\n\nOut of character, together as The Grawlix, they were just named to Variety\u2019s \u201c10 Comics to Watch.\u201d\n\nPart of Turner\n\nProduction has been ongoing for five months. While writing hours are fairly fixed \u2014 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. \u2014 shooting runs 12 hours and the executive producers tweak, edit and text ideas at all hours.\n\nIn the writing room, Cayton-Holland tends to shine. According to Roy, \u201che\u2019s probably the smartest of all of us.\u201d\n\nIf Cayton-Holland is the analytic one, Orvedahl is the idea person. Roy, who is big and loud in his stand-up, said: \u201cOnscreen, I\u2019m trying to learn how to tone it down a bit.\u201d He\u2019s finding acting \u201cway harder\u201d than stand-up. \u201cLike, what do I do with my arms?\u201d\n\nOrvedahl, heading for a lunch break in gold light-up sneakers, said it doesn\u2019t feel like acting just yet, more like playing with friends. \u201cI\u2019m super-proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe guys are still amazed to have a budget that allows them to write things such as \u201cDoor with window\u201d where one doesn\u2019t exist, and a door with a window magically appears on set.\n\nAt the upfronts in New York, where networks hope to entice advertisers with new shows, they were part of Turner\u2019s truTV presentation.\n\n\u201cWe got a feel for the giant company,\u201d Orvedahl said. Because they\u2019re all part of Turner, \u201cAnderson Cooper (of CNN) and Conan O\u2019Brien (of TBS) were right there!\u201d He was admittedly star-struck. This year, the Denver guys were represented in a clip. Next year, if all goes well, they\u2019ll be on stage.\n\nTempered expectations\n\n\u201cHaving it pulled out from under us (by Amazon) gave us perspective,\u201d Cayton-Holland said. \u201cYou learn to temper expectations.\u201d But there\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re on their way.\n\nRatings decisions will be merciful at the start. \u201cThe network understands we\u2019re their first scripted show,\u201d Orvedahl said. \u201cOn Comedy Central, the expectations would be brutal.\u201d\n\nAnd will the impressive lineup of guests behind and in front of the camera continue?\n\nCayton-Holland offers a measured response: \u201cYou can only call in so many favors if the show sucks.\u201d\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ostrow: On set with Denver\u2019s Grawlix comedy trio shooting \u201cThose Who Can\u2019t\u201d", "title": "Ostrow: On set with Denver\u2019s Grawlix comedy trio shooting \u201cThose Who Can\u2019t\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/20/ostrow-on-set-with-denvers-grawlix-comedy-trio-shooting-those-who-cant/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150820__20150823_E1_AE23TVGRAWLIXp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150820__20150823_E1_AE23TVGRAWLIXp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-20T17:54:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T10:30:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThose Who Can\u2019t,\u201d a pilot by the Denver comedy trio Grawlix, was a longshot in the first place.\nWatching on monitors in a science classroom, executive producers Baird and Plonka crack up.\nProductions are executive producers.\nAdam Cayton-Holland, Ben Roy and Andrew Orvedahl are currently shooting the last of 10 episodes in their series about the dysfunctional teaching staff.\nWhile writing hours are fairly fixed \u2014 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. \u2014 shooting runs 12 hours and the executive producers tweak, edit and text ideas at all hours."}
