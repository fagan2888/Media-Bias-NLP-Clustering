Power 2015 Member Health Plan StudySM released today.\n\nNow in its ninth year, the study measures satisfaction among members of 134 health plans in 18 regions throughout the United States by examining six key factors: coverage and benefits; provider choice; information and communication; claims processing; cost; and customer service. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.\n\nOverall member satisfaction averages 679, which is a 10 point improvement from 2014. The increase in satisfaction is driven by improved performance across all factors, most notably in information and communication (+17 points), which is primarily a result of efforts among many of the health plans to retool their approach by refining messaging, adjusting message frequency and upgrading their website. Satisfaction in the customer service factor has increased by 11 points, driven partially by matching communication methods to member preferences, such as mobile and text. Cost satisfaction increases by 13 points while fewer members indicate having experienced an increase in their monthly premium, as well as a decline in overall out-of-pocket expenses for individuals and families.\n\n\"Health plans have come a long way since last year as the focus has shifted toward better serving member needs and building trust. However, there is still a lot of work to do,\" said Rick Johnson, senior director of the healthcare practice at J.D. Power. \"Health plans need to take a more customer-centric approach and keep their members engaged through regular communications about programs and services available through their plan. When members perceive their plan as a trusted health partner, there is a positive impact on loyalty and advocacy.\"\n\nAccording to the study, overall satisfaction is significantly higher among the 19 percent of members who strongly agree their health plan is a trusted partner in managing their health. Among members who say they \"strongly agree\" that their health plan is a trusted partner, satisfaction increases by 201 points.\n\nKEY FINDINGS\n\nMembers who say they \"strongly agree\" that their health plan is a trusted advisor are less likely to switch health plan providers.\n\nWithin information and communication, satisfaction ratings have improved from 2014 in the factor's four attributes: ease of understanding your plan's benefits and services (6.4 vs. 6.2, respectively, on a 10-point scale); frequency of communications (6.3 vs. 6.1, respectively); usefulness of information (6.4 vs. 6.2, respectively); and variety of communications (6.3 vs. 6.1, respectively).\n\nSimilarly, satisfaction ratings have also improved year over year in the attributes within the cost factor: premiums (5.9 vs. 5.7, respectively); deductible amount (5.8 vs. 5.7, respectively); co-pays for prescription medication (6.4 vs. 6.2, respectively); and co-pays for doctor visits (6.3 vs. 6.2, respectively).\n\nOverall member satisfaction is 108 points higher among members who have contacted their plan via mobile app at least once in the past 12 months than among those who haven't. While members under 40 years old contact their plan via text and mobile app at a significantly higher rate than older members, the telephone is still the most frequently used contact method across all age cohorts.\n\nStudy Rankings\n\nSatisfaction is highest among health plan members in the California (695), Northwest (693), Illinois\u2013Indiana (689), Michigan (688) and Mountain (686) regions. Satisfaction is lowest among members in the New England (664) and the Southwest and Minnesota\u2013Wisconsin regions at a tie (665).\n\nWEST\n\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan (778) ranks highest among health plans in the California region for an eighth consecutive year.
