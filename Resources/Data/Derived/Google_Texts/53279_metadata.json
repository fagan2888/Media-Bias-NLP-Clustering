Regulators would have more authority over such facilities, which would include sites with multiple wells or storage tanks.\n\nThe Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates drilling, drew up the proposals and will hold hearings on them Monday and Tuesday in Denver.\n\nThe rules were designed to address conflicts that arise when Colorado\u2019s growing cities and oilfields expand into each other. Residents complain of around-the-clock noise and lights from nearby drilling rigs, and they worry about spills and air pollution.\n\nBut only 13 drilling and storage sites approved over the past two years \u2014 0.8 percent of the total \u2014 were in areas that would be covered by the new rules, the commission\u2019s cost-benefit analysis said. And one of those facilities wouldn\u2019t be considered a large site and wouldn\u2019t be subject to the regulations.\n\nProponents of tighter regulations said that was too little, but energy companies said the proposals are too restrictive. Todd Hartman, a spokesman for the oil and gas commission, said the agency wouldn\u2019t comment.\n\n\u201cAs written, the draft rules are nearly meaningless,\u201d said Matt Sura, who served on Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s oil and gas task force, which recommended the two rules, among others. Sura is an attorney who represents landowners and local governments in negotiations with energy companies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to cram this narrow reading to benefit the industry,\u201d Sura said Friday.\n\nTask force member Bernie Buescher also said the commission\u2019s language was too narrow for the rule he proposed: letting regulators require energy companies to minimize the disruption that big facilities cause to communities.\n\nThe commission\u2019s language would apply only to facilities in \u201curban mitigation areas,\u201d generally within about 1,000 feet of developed areas. Buescher said it should be broader.\n\n\u201cIt was my intention that the recommendation apply regardless of whether the proposed location was within an urban mitigation area,\u201d Buescher, a former Colorado secretary of state, said in a written comment to the commission.\n\nEnergy companies and their supporters argue that underground oil and gas are property and the owners have a right to extract it. They say Colorado already has some of the strictest regulations in the nation.\n\nThe Colorado Petroleum Council said the proposed new rules would apply to too many facilities and asked the commission to change its definition of a large operation.\n\nThe commission\u2019s definition is based on the total depth of all the wells and the total capacity of all the tanks proposed for the site. In a written comment, the Petroleum Council suggested the definition be based on the total number of wells and tanks, regardless of depth or capacity.\n\nOthers objected to a provision that would allow regulators to limit the length of time a drilling rig could operate at a multi-well site in an urban mitigation area. Bill Barrett Corp., in another written statement, called the rigs \u201ctemporary aesthetic disturbances\u201d that don\u2019t pose a significant threat to people or the environment.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will vote on the proposals.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nOil and Gas Conservation Commission cost-benefit analysis: http://tinyurl.com/q3ohnbh\n\nWritten comments to the commission on proposed rules: http://tinyurl.com/pu5h7mf\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.
