A new study has found migraine headaches may double the risk of Bell's Palsy, a nervous system condition that causes facial paralysis.

Dr. Stewart Tepper did not take part in the study but treats migraine at Cleveland Clinic. He said, "Migraine doesn't cause Bell's Palsy, or vice-versa. It tells you that there is an association."

Researchers at National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan studied more than 137,000 people. They were put into one of two groups: one with migraine and one without.

They found that people with migraine were twice as likely to develop Bell's Palsy even after researchers accounted for other factors.

The study's authors say more research is needed to determine the direct connection, but Dr. Tepper says if you have either of these conditions talk to your doctor. "These associations alert the care provider to keep an eye open. So, somebody who has Bell's Palsy you keep an eye open for migraine, somebody with migraine you keep an eye open for Bell's Palsy," he said.

Complete findings for the study titled "Increased Risk of Bell's Palsy in Patients with Migraine" can be found in the online issue of "Neurology."
