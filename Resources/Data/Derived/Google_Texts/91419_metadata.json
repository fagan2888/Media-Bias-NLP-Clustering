The site is historically significant given that it was originally used by Khoi pastoralists for cattle grazing before colonial occupation in 1652. Khoisan activists believe the site is part of their ancestral Gorinaqua Kraal. Tania Kleinhans-Cedras, co-founder of the Institute for the Restoration of the Aborigine of South Africa (IRASA), who was one of the leaders of the occupation said that \u201chistorical record shows that the land belongs to the Khoisan.\u201d Kleinhans-Cedras hesitates to describe the activists action as an occupation, preferring instead to describe their action as act of restoration.\n\nHowever, not all in the Khoisan community support Kleinhans and followers claim to the land by occupation.\n\nIn a statement released by the Gorinhaiqua Council, Kleinhans-Cedras and supporters of the Oude Molen land occupation were denounced for not adhering to Khoisan principals.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \"The Gorinhaiqua Cultural Council herewith makes public its condemnation and distaste of actions undertaken by Tania Kleinhans-Cedras and a small group under her influence, who have embarked on a willful takeover of the main hall at Oude Molen. This is just one of many publicity seeking actions of Kleinhans-Cedras, who is part of a small Non-Governmental Organization called IRASA. This organization has recently been visible inside the Khoi and San resurgence, and is not grounded in any customary or indigenous protocol.\u201d\n\nChief Garu Zenzile, Khoisan, of the Gorinhaiqua said the activists \u201cdon\u2019t understand Khoi principals.\u201d\n\nZenzile continued: \u201c We are not interested in having skirmishes with government. That would be counter-productive. We need to engage with government \u2026 Oude Molen has to be properly inaugurated \u2026 you can\u2019t just run rampage.\u201d\n\nIn response, Kleinhans-Cedras said: \u201cZenzile is being shortsighted \u2026 the press release is based on untruths. You cannot say the kraal belongs to you, it belongs to all.\u201d\n\nKleinhans-Cedras added that the activists occupation of the Oude Molen Eco village is \u201cbased on indigenous rights of the kraal \u2026 we are not interested in political processes.\u201d\n\nShe accused Zenzile and his followers of creating fragmentation amongst the Khoisan community and that they are not advocating unity.\u201d\n\nThis disagreement is set against the backdrop of a high court battle between Kleinhans-Cedras and followers on one side and the provincial government on the other. The Western Cape High court granted an interim order that the group should vacate the land shortly after the occupation; but the matter is not yet settled and returns to court on August 18. Both parties in the dispute must show why an interim order must not be made which stops the activists from occupying the land.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent occupation of land in Cape Town, South Africa by Khoisan activists has ruptured a fault line within the indigenous community.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/22/feuding-cape-town-indigenous-community-split-over-land-occupation-155423", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/oude_molen_eco_village.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Feuding in Cape Town: Indigenous Community Split Over Land Occupation"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-22T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Feuding in Cape Town: Indigenous Community Split Over Land Occupation"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/22/feuding-cape-town-indigenous-community-split-over-land-occupation-155423", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Khoisan Activists, Indigenous South Africans, Indigenous Peoples, Land Occupation, Gorinaqua Kraal, Tania Kleinhans-Cedras, Khoi, Institute for the Restoration of the Aborigine of South Africa, IRASA, Chief Garu Zenzile", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Feuding in Cape Town: Indigenous Community Split Over Land Occupation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09e3\"", "article_summary": "Khoisan activists occupied the main hall of the Oude Molen Eco Village situated in Pinelands, an area just outside the main city center of Cape Town.\nIn a statement released by the Gorinhaiqua Council, Kleinhans-Cedras and supporters of the Oude Molen land occupation were denounced for not adhering to Khoisan principals.\nHowever, not all in the Khoisan community support Kleinhans and followers claim to the land by occupation.\nThe recent occupation of a piece of land in the city of Cape Town in South Africa by Khoisan activists has appeared to rupture a fault line in the local community of indigenous people after it emerged that the occupation was not supported by all in the community.\nKhoisan activists believe the site is part of their ancestral Gorinaqua Kraal."}
