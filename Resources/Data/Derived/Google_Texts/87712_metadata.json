Mike Huckabee said Monday he\u2019s not exactly pleased with getting bumped from the main stage of Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate but that \u201crules are rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s obviously not something I\u2019m excited about,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI feel like sometimes we let national polls drive [who] gets to participate in the debate, and national polls don\u2019t mean a whole lot at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they did, we would have President [Rudy] Giuliani back in 2008 and President Herman Cain in 2012, based on where the races were at this particular point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut look, rules are rules. You agree to play by [them] \u2014 you don\u2019t have to like them.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, after qualifying for the main stage of the first three debates, will participate in the undercard debate Tuesday in Milwaukee with former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal after failing to meet polling requirements for the main stage.\n\nMr. Huckabee said a lot of the problem is candidates don\u2019t get an adequate amount of time in the debates, saying he was on the \u201cvery low end\u201d in the previous three debates.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really hard to get your message out there when you\u2019re not able to talk about why we [need] to protect Social Security, why Medicare is important to seniors, why we need to make big changes to the tax plan \u2014 things that we ought to be talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd instead, I get questions like, \u2018Do you think Donald Trump has the moral character to be president?\u2019 And that\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAsked later on the program, Mr. Huckabee said he does believe Mr. Trump has the moral character to be president.\n\n\u201cI look at his family. I look at the relationship he has with his kids,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s always a barometer of what kind of a person one is. And if you have adult children who [have] turned out well, who are responsible, respectful, who are successful in their own right and who love their father, you have to say, \u2018you know, the guy\u2019s done something right.\u2019 \u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.
