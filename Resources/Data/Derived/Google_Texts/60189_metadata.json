Fellin, (R), 2016, chairman of the Sarasota County Planning Commission, elected in 2012\n\nThe people's court, the movement claims, would operate outside and independent of the regular grand jury system, which is a function of either the State Attorney's Office or the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nSo far, efforts to establish people's courts in every Florida county have failed, in no small part because of the baggage associated with the sovereign citizen movement and its supporters.\n\nSovereign citizens believe that the federal government has no authority to levy taxes or impose laws upon them. Some refuse to pay taxes, use license plates, driver's licenses or Social Security numbers. Others have renounced their American citizenship.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League says sovereign citizens are known for three types of activities: creating fake, quasi-governmental groups like common law grand juries; \u201cpaper terrorism,\u201d filing multimillion-dollar frivolous liens against public officials and judges; and violence \u2014 killing police officers and federal agents. The FBI considers sovereign citizen extremists to be domestic terrorists. Terry Nichols, the man who helped Timothy McVeigh plan the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, is perhaps the most infamous person to claim the title.\n\nNow there is some evidence that the movement is trying to get a foothold in Southwest Florida.\n\nAt the May 13 meeting of Sarasota County's Charter Review Board, Rodger Dowdell, a Bradenton resident with ties to the national sovereign citizen movement, gave a lengthy presentation and proposed amending the county charter to include a people's common law grand jury.\n\nSarasota County's Charter Review Board \u2014 the only one in Florida whose members are elected rather than appointed \u2014 usually proposes minor changes to the county charter like eliminating contradictions and inconsistencies, though issues can be more significant, such as qualifications for county administrators, disclosures for county-initiated rezonings and debt limitations. Proposed changes must then be approved by a voter referendum.\n\nBoard member Steven Fields moved to create a special committee to study Dowdell's proposed amendment. The board voted 4-4 on Field's motion, which failed because of the tie. One member was absent.\n\n\u201cIf someone brings an idea that we can do, that's something we should take a look at,\u201d Fields told the Herald-Tribune. \u201cI've seen the federal government grabbing more rights away from people. They bribe states into federal control. The Charter Review Board should not be acting like the County Commission and protecting the status quo. And I don't think (the people's common law grand jury) has anything to do with sovereign citizens.\u201d\n\nDowdell had brought around 50 vocal supporters to the meeting \u2014 a fact not lost on the eight members of the Charter Review Board or its chairwoman.\n\n\u201cI just thought they mobilized a group of people and that I'd like to learn more about it before making a decision. I felt it was appropriate for them to be heard,\u201d said Donna Barcomb, a physical therapist who chairs the Charter Review Board. \u201cI just felt like they had put time into it. I felt it was appropriate to hear them out a little more. In theory, it sounded like a good idea. I felt like they needed to be able to demonstrate how to apply the concept more directly.\u201d\n\nBut the board's close vote created consternation among county officials, who say it is evidence that Sarasota's Charter Review Board is out of control, and trying to usurp power from other elected bodies.\n\n\u201cWe have a minority group of citizens who are using the Charter Review Board to try to go around individual elected officials who were elected by a majority,\u201d Sarasota County Commissioner Christine Robinson said. \u201cThe Charter Review Board frequently flies under the radar, but this board has the ability to try to place legislative policy in our charter and circumvent the elected County Commission. The Charter Review Board should be a charter caretaker, protecting the document's integrity. The charter is our county constitution.\u201d\n\nThose who have tracked the movement for years were surprised that the measure got so close to being considered.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign citizen movement is one of the extremist groups that has a high degree of criminal activity because, theoretically, they believe they can break any law, and they're able to rationalize breaking any law,\u201d said Mark Pitcavage, Director of Fact-Finding for the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism and intolerance.\n\nTypically, Pitcavage said, local governments give \u201cshort shrift\u201d to sovereign citizen notions.\n\n\u201cUsually, we find one selectman or a councilman who is a sovereign citizen and gets on a board, but as soon as they start spouting ideas they get rejected,\u201d Pitcavage said. \u201cBut Dowdell is affiliated with several Tea Parties. If this is done under Tea Party auspices, quite possibly, they might not understand that the whole common law grand jury is tied up with the sovereign citizen movement. They might not realize that.\u201d\n\nSovereign lite,\n\nDowdell declined to say whether he is a sovereign citizen. He took issue with the term itself.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign citizen label is an oxymoron,\u201d Dowdell told the Herald-Tribune. \u201c'Sovereign' means the highest ranking in the state. 'Citizen' means subject. To be the highest ranking subject makes no sense.\u201d\n\nDowdell pulls from history when explaining the people's common law grand jury \u2014 from the Magna Carta, the Roman Empire, colonial times and a higher power.\n\n\u201cGrand jury powers come from God,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two main types of law: civil law, which came out of Rome, and common law, which came to us from England. Common law says we must look to God or nature and make our laws compatible with God and nature \u2014 natural law.\u201d\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Dowdell said, when there were no standing police departments and judges rode horseback throughout their circuits, groups of 25 citizens would assemble to indict someone for wrongdoing. The same system is viable today, he said, even though we have a modern criminal justice system.\n\nIf people's common law grand juries were reconvened, not even the president or the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn their findings, Dowdell said.\n\n\u201cA people's common law grand jury can, without any probable cause, go into any nook or cranny of government \u2014 local, state or federal \u2014 research anything that's going on and root out corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to government to recognize the contract we call the constitution, and start obeying the law. It's very simple.\u201d\n\nDowdell is a state coordinator for the New York-based National Liberty Alliance, which has a bold disclaimer on its website: \u201cWE ARE NOT PART OF THE SOVEREIGN CITIZENS MOVEMENT. We do not endorse or entertain the fiction such as bills of exchange, redeeming and/or discharging through trust accounts; nor do we involve ourselves with contracts, commercial liens and the exchanging of an oath of office for a value. We do not encourage or teach people to write declarations, drive without driver's licenses, revoke their voter's application, revoke their birth certificate or their Social Security numbers. The power of the Grand Jury is to write true bills of indictment, true bills of presentments and true bills of information.\u201d\n\nDespite the disclaimer, Pitcavage says the Anti-Defamation League considers the National Liberty Alliance one of the country's largest sovereign citizen organizations.\n\n\u201cI did some preliminary looking into Mr. Dowdell,\u201d Pitcavage said. \u201cI would not describe him as a hardcore sovereign citizen, the way I would describe many National Liberty Alliance activists. He seems to have come to the movement only relatively recently, and I am not sure that he has embraced all of its beliefs, as opposed to just some of them. He still seems to have a foot in mainstream conservative thought.\n\n\u201cHe certainly has embraced at least some sovereign citizen beliefs. But he still frames many of his arguments in terms of mainstream political issues such as Obamacare or Common Core, and he doesn't make any explicit references to conspiracies infiltrating and subverting the original government. Whether he will continue further down the path into full sovereign citizen beliefs or stay where he is, I can't speculate.\u201d\n\nBased upon an examination of Dowdell's actions and writings, Pitcavage considers him a \u201csovereign lite\u201d compared with other NLA activists.\n\n\u201cThis may be how he was able to appeal to the Charter Review Board folks, because he wasn't spouting any of the wilder sovereign citizen theories,\u201d Pitcavage said, adding that Dowdell is identified with the Greater Orlando Tea Party and other groups.\n\n\u201cMaybe he was able to reach out and get a sympathetic ear.\u201d\n\nOther counties\n\nDowdell claims that there is an active people's common law grand jury operating in Manatee County, but he offered no proof.\n\n\u201cI can't talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is secret. In order to keep innocents who may be investigated from being damaged, whatever a grand jury does is secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly he would know,\u201d said Angelina Colonnesso, Manatee County's Ad-Interim Clerk of Court. \u201cThey're not affiliated with the court system at all.\u201d\n\nColonnesso has seen sovereign citizens attempt to file multimillion-dollar fraudulent liens against judges and other officials.\n\n\u201cWe forward them to the Sheriff's Office because they're a criminal act,\u201d she said. \u201cAs clerk, we process paperwork from the court system. If it's not affiliated with a real case, there's no mechanism set up to recognize that. Things have quieted down here lately. The real problem is in Dixie County.\u201d\n\nDana Johnson, Dixie County's clerk of the court, says she receives correspondence from sovereign citizens every day.\n\n\u201cI'm getting harassing emails and threatening faxes saying they're going to arrest me,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis one says they want info on bonds and oaths. There are further demands. I'm concerned about my safety. The local sheriff has alerted (the Florida Department of Law Enforcement) and the FBI. Anytime they come up on our public agenda we have security with us at all times.\u201d\n\nOne Dixie County resident, Terry Trussell, has been charged with 14 counts of impersonating court officials, Johnson said. The criminal case is pending.\n\n\u201cOnce Trussell got selected to serve on a legitimate grand jury, it became the perfect storm,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that point, he's taken it on his own authority to create a sovereign citizen board of common law grand jurors. I am constantly scared.\u201d\n\nDixie County Sheriff Dewey Hatcher, who has just 15 deputies to patrol 700 square miles, says he has known Trussell all his life, but only recently met Dowdell.\n\n\u201cHe's one of their 'administrative investigators' for their people's grand jury,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cHe came into it when Trussell had 'indictments.'\u201d\n\nThe sheriff has not arrested anyone.\n\n\u201cThey asked if I would help with their indictments. I said any order has to be signed by a judge \u2014 whether it's a warrant or whatever \u2014 it's got to be a legal court document,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cThey 'indicted' everyone from the governor and (Attorney General) Pam Bondi on down to the president of our school board, and they said the school board attorney should be fired.\u201d\n\nUnknown connections\n\nBarcomb, the Sarasota County Charter Review Board chairwoman, said she had no knowledge of the link between common law grand juries and the sovereign citizen movement, or that the FBI considers some of their extremist members to be domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThat's the antithesis of what I'm all about,\u201d Barcomb said. \u201cI don't think board knew anything about that concept. It was a group of individuals who presented a concept to the board. That's what the Charter Review Board does \u2014 not leaning one way or another. Frequently, the board will look at something and determine if it's appropriate or in the best interests of the county. For the most part, and I include myself in this, we're completely ignorant about the concepts.\u201d\n\nBoard member Anthony Sawyer, a former legal aid attorney and a retired prosecutor from Ohio, voted against further study of the people's common law grand jury proposal.\n\n\u201cThey may mean well, but I don't agree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cCharitably, it made no sense. The Charter Review Board cannot do anything in conflict with state law, and state law creates the grand juries in Florida. We couldn't pass it if we wanted to. They say the purpose of a people's common law grand jury is to indict public officials, but we already have a system for that. Go to the authorities, or ask FDLE to investigate, and people get indicted. I don't understand where they're coming from.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: I didn't think much of it, and I voted against it because it didn't make sense and we don't have the authority to do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has long been a goal of the so-called sovereign citizen movement to create a \u201cpeople's common law grand jury\u201d so everyday citizens can, on their own, indict government officials for corruption \u2014 without any official assistance or oversight.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-57448FD7-FE65-4CCB-A767-8721302F3704-pubSH"}, "og": {"site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "description": "It has long been a goal of the so-called sovereign citizen movement to create a \u201cpeople's common law grand jury\u201d so everyday citizens can, on their own, indict government officials for corruption \u2014 without any official assistance or oversight.", "title": "'People's  jury' idea gains traction", "url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20150906/ARTICLE/150909766", "image": "http://G52-SHweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&Date=20150906&Category=ARTICLE&ArtNo=150909766&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150906, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150909766-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "MANATEE COUNTY (FL),  ENGLEWOOD (CHARLOTTE COUNTY, FL),  ENGLEWOOD (SARASOTA COUNTY, FL),  EEK (AK),  MANOKOTAK (AK),  SKWENTNA (AK),  Social Issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2e37\"", "article_summary": "They say the purpose of a people's common law grand jury is to indict public officials, but we already have a system for that.\nIf people's common law grand juries were reconvened, not even the president or the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn their findings, Dowdell said.\n\u201cHe's one of their 'administrative investigators' for their people's grand jury,\u201d Hatcher said.\nI felt it was appropriate for them to be heard,\u201d said Donna Barcomb, a physical therapist who chairs the Charter Review Board.\n\u201cOnce Trussell got selected to serve on a legitimate grand jury, it became the perfect storm,\u201d she said."}
