A recently published Press Association analysis has shown a steep hike in the numbers of children from age group of 10 years and below needing removal of one or more teeth. The main reason behind tooth decay among children is increased consumption of sugary drinks and food items. Tooth decay could also be blamed on poor dental hygiene among kids.\n\nIn 2014-2015, more boys as compared to girls required tooth removal as inpatients. The time period recorded more than 14,000 cases of children aged five and under, who required teeth out.\n\nAs a whole, since 2011, there were 128,558 episodes of care for children aged 10 and below needing one or more teeth out.\n\nAccording to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) data, there were 14,445 cases in children aged 5 years and below in the time period from April 1, 2014 to March 31 last year.\n\nIn the children belonging to the age group six to 10, there were 19,336 cases. As a whole, in 2014/15, about 33,781 cases were reported. The numbers are up from 32,741 in 2013/14 and 31,275 in 2012/13. In 2011/12, there were 30,761 cases.\n\nDean of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, Professor Nigel Hunt, said, \u201cAn almost 10% (9.81%) increase in the number of children being admitted to hospital for tooth extraction due to decay over a four-year period is unacceptable. Not only is tooth decay distressing to children and parents, it has serious social and financial implications\u201d.\n\nProfessor Hunt added that the requirement for tooth extraction is still the number one reason why five to nine-year-old children are hospitalized.\n\nProfessor Hunt informed that the issue needs to be addressed urgently, mainly when it\u2019s known that 90% of tooth decay can be prevented.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the past four years, thousands of young children have had decayed teeth plucked out in England's hospitals.\nTooth decay could also be blamed on poor dental hygiene among kids.\nThe time period recorded more than 14,000 cases of children aged five and under, who required teeth out.\nThe main reason behind tooth decay among children is increased consumption of sugary drinks and food items.\nAs a whole, since 2011, there were 128,558 episodes of care for children aged 10 and below needing one or more teeth out."}
