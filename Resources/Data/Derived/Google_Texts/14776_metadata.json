Along with the Trade Promotion Authority Act, which gives the president the authority to negotiate trade agreements, the preferences act was the subject last month of a widely reported on-again, off-again national drama concerning whether Congress would back the president and pass the bills.\n\nLost in the hoopla, however, was any discussion of Section 806, a provision of the preferences act that had nothing at all to do with foreign trade or globalization, according to Michael Chittenden, a senior associate at Miller & Chevalier, a law firm.\n\nThe provision, which concerns penalties charged against businesses for failing to file correct information on tax returns and provide payee statements, has \u201cno connection to the substance of the bill, and I think that\u2019s why it surprised everyone,\u201d he says, noting that the provision is included to provide revenue to offset the costs incurred by other aspects of the law. \u201cIf you look at the title of the bill, it wouldn\u2019t tip you off at all that there was this provision in there regarding information reporting penalties.\u201d\n\nThe provision, however, could have stiff financial consequences for companies that, for example, misreport a name or a taxpayer identification number on a W-2 employee compensation form; a 1099 form reporting payments made to vendors, lawyers, doctors, and the like; or on the new reporting forms associated with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law socks businesses with penalties for both the information forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the copies provided to employees or vendors. The increased penalties can amount to \u201cseveral million dollars on an annual basis for a lot of big filers,\u201d according to Chittenden. \u201cSmall errors can result in comparatively large penalties. Any dollar amount that is wrong \u2013 even by a penny \u2013 can justify the imposition of a penalty.\u201d\n\nThe provision boosts the per-form penalty of $100 for an incorrect or unfiled return to $250 and hikes the maximum penalty for a filer from $1.5 million to $3 million \u2014 that\u2019s $6 million if you take into account incorrect copies provided to employees and vendors as well as the forms provided to the IRS.\n\nFor large filers, errors on fewer than 1% of all returns can result in a company\u2019s having to pay a maximum penalty of $6 million in a year, according to Chittenden, who reasons that by incurring a $500 penalty each for errors made on 12,000 IRS forms and copies an employer could easily reach the maximum penalty.\n\n\u201cLarge companies may file well in excess of one million information returns subject to penalties,\u201d including W-2s and 1099s, he explains. \u201cIf you assume that more than 1.2 million returns are filed, an error rate of 1% \u2026 would generate at least $6 million in potential penalties.\u201d\n\nFor some large companies that might not sound like lot of money. \u201cBut most finance people like not to spend an extra $6 million paying penalties to the IRS,\u201d the lawyer says.\n\nAnother factor adding to the risk is that the maximum annual penalty applies on a per-filer, rather than a per-company basis. And each of the subsidiaries of a parent company may be considered a filer. \u201cWithin one company that has a lot of corporations in it, you\u2019re not limited to just the $6 million. It could be many multiples of that if you have several entities within the firm that are filing,\u201d Chittenden says.\n\n\u201cYou could have a corporation that has 10 subsidiaries, with each subsidiary issuing returns for its employees and its vendors and for the health-care coverage it provides. Each one of those subsidiaries is potentially subject to up to $6 million in penalties, so that\u2019s now $60 million in potential penalties,\u201d he notes.\n\nOperation Match\n\n\n\nSo what are CFOs to do to protect their companies from having to pay whopping penalties next year? If their companies don\u2019t yet take part in the IRS Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) On-Line Matching program, finance chiefs should make sure they do so speedily, Chittenden recommends.\n\nThe IRS program is part of a suite of Internet-based services that enable companies to match payee information on a variety of 1099 forms against IRS records before filing the forms. The program allows filers to match payee name-TIN combinations with IRS records, thereby potentially reducing error rates and penalties. If filers find that the information doesn\u2019t match, they can ask for verification from the taxpayer and correct the information before filing, according to Chittenden.\n\nThere are two ways companies can check their information against the IRS database. Via interactive matching, filers can input up to 25 payee TIN-name combinations on screen. Using bulk matching, they can submit up to 100,000 payee TIN-name combinations to be matched with IRS records through the use of a text file submission.\n\nAnother precaution finance chiefs can take is to make sure tax departments are closely involved in gathering data for IRS filings. Typically, tax departments don\u2019t closely monitor IRS information reporting, which is generally handled by corporate payroll and purchasing departments, according to Chittenden. \u201cA lot of times what you see is the first time tax becomes involved is when they get the penalty notice from the IRS \u2013 or, perhaps, if there\u2019s an audit,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of returns that are required to be filed and the increasing penalties for errors make it more important than ever that the tax department is involved to insure that there are proper systems and controls in place to avoid errors,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn the event that there are errors, having the tax department involved and having proper systems and controls in place can help you get those errors abated for reasonable cause.\u201d\n\nImage by flickr user Calita Kabir, CC BY-2.0.
