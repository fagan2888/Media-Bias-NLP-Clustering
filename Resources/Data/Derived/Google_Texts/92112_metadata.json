John McAfee said the online component of Obamacare \u201cis a hacker\u2019s wet dream\u201d that will cause \u201cthe loss of income for the millions of Americans who are going to lose their identities.\u201d\n\nFor starters, McAfee said the way it is set up makes it possible for fake websites be set up to fool people to think they\u2019re signing up for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s seriously bad,\u201d McAfee said. \u201cSomebody made a grave error, not in designing the program but in simply implementing the web aspect of it. I mean, for example, anybody can put up a web page and claim to be a broker for this system. There is no central place where I can go and say, \u2018OK, here are all the legitimate brokers, the examiners for all of the states and pick and choose one.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, any hacker can put a website up, make it look extremely competitive, and because of the nature of the system \u2014 and this is health care, after all \u2014 they can ask you the most intimate questions, and you\u2019re freely going to answer them,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s my Social Security number? My birth date? What are my health issues?\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\n\nWatch the latest video at <a href=\u201dhttp://video.foxbusiness.com\u201d>video.foxbusiness.com</a>\n\nAccording to McAfee, there\u2019s not a quick fix \u2014 and as long as it set up this way, it could be a playground for computer hackers.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem: It\u2019s not something software can solve,\u201d McAfee continued. \u201cI mean, what idiot put this system out there and did not create a central depository? There should be one website, run by the government, you go to that website and then you can click on all of the agencies. This is insane. So, I will predict that the loss of income for the millions of Americans who are going to lose their identities \u2014 I mean, you can imagine some retired lady in Utah, who has $75,000 dollars in the bank, saving her whole life, having it wiped out in one day because she signed up for Obamacare. And believe me, this is going to happen millions of times. This is a hacker\u2019s wet dream. I mean I cannot believe that they did this.\u201d\n\n(h/t Real Clear Politics Video)\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "'I will predict that the loss of income for the millions of Americans who are going to lose their identities'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cCavuto\u201d on Wednesday, computer programmer and founder of McAfee, Inc.
