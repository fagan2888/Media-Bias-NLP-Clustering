Each agency\u2019s Twitter handle prefaces their number of followers.

A social media presence allows for stronger relationships between departments and the communities they serve and is also an invaluable investigative tool, according to local officials.\n\n\u201cIt humanizes departments,\u201d said Charleston County sheriff\u2019s Maj. Eric Watson. \u201cIn my opinion, it makes our department more personable with the community.\u201d\n\nHe said the Sheriff\u2019s Office began dabbling in social media about four years ago and now uses it all day, every day. He manages accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Periscope. Each platform, Watson said, reaches a different audience.\n\nThe department posts anything from road closures and fatal crashes to law enforcement events and pictures of individuals wanted for crimes to try to drum up tips. The investigative unit at the Sheriff\u2019s Office also uses social media to gather intelligence about cases.\n\n\u201cWe have close to 5,000 people on our Facebook, so you can get that information out to potentially 5,000 people,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt gets shared and the suspect sees his face floating around \u2014 we\u2019re more than likely going to get a hit.\u201d\n\nGood outweighs bad\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just helpful in catching suspects. In late August, an individual from another country reached out through the Sheriff\u2019s Office website to express concern about a friend on social media who posted suicidal thoughts.\n\nFrom there, deputies communicated with the individual through social media to identify the suicidal teen, who lives in Charleston County. When deputies located her, she confirmed she had made comments on social media that she didn\u2019t want to live and said she was bullied in school because of her looks, according to the incident report. The teen ultimately agreed to seek professional help after talking with deputies.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get her the help she needed,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat is the power of social media and clear evidence on how many people it reaches around the world. When social media is used for the right reasons, you will always have positive results, even when the world around you seems like a dark and lonely place.\u201d\n\nOf course, not everyone uses social media for good, but Charleston Police Detective Doug Galluccio said departments \u201chave to take the good with the bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only downfall is monitoring the derogatory things people post,\u201d he said.\n\nWatson agreed but said he makes sure to respond to every complaint made online and also interacts with individuals who ask questions or make comments warranting a response.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important because if you don\u2019t use it, they\u2019ll stop using it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Charleston Police Department has multiple Facebook pages, a Twitter, Instagram and YouTube account. Spokesman Charles Francis said social media is just another avenue to get accurate information to the public quickly and to promote the department in a positive way.\n\n\u201cPeople love it,\u201d he said.\n\nPosts in particular that garner a lot of \u201clikes\u201d or comments involve Tyreik Gadsden, the 5-year-old who was paralyzed by a gunshot outside his grandmother\u2019s house on Charleston\u2019s East Side, according to Francis. He recently visited with the Police Department for a welcome home party and a video of the event on Facebook was viewed more than 4,000 times.\n\n\u201c(Social media) let\u2019s us put out the positive things about us,\u201d Galluccio said. \u201cThat gets shared and that\u2019s the great thing.\u201d\n\nManaging social media\n\nOne of the first agencies in the area to start using social media is the Mount Pleasant Police Department, and its online presence has grown significantly over the years. The department has the seventh-highest number of Twitter followers in the nation among agencies its size, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Center for Social Media.\n\nInspector Chip Googe credits a chance encounter with a community member at a wreck five years ago for the push to go online. While responding to the wreck, Googe said he saw the individual \u201cfussing with his phone,\u201d and asked what he was doing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about social media at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started talking about Twitter and he put information out about the wreck, so I kind of took that info and ran with that.\u201d\n\nThe department now has more than 13,000 followers on Twitter, one of the more active platforms online, Googe said. The department also uses Facebook, Instagram, Vine, YouTube, Periscope and an app called Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhood communities.\n\nLike other departments, Googe said Mount Pleasant uses the online platforms to promote itself and events and to get important information to the public promptly. It\u2019s completely replaced an \u201cantiquated\u201d reverse 911 system, Googe said. Reverse 911 is when agencies notify residents of potential emergencies, such as school lockdowns or significant weather events.\n\n\u201cI think (social media has) made community relations stronger because they know we\u2019re trying to be transparent,\u201d Googe said. \u201cThey know they have access to us.\u201d\n\nHe handles a lot of the posts, but there are six other officers who help with Twitter and two who help with Facebook. Googe said social media done right is just about a full-time job\u2019s worth of work.\n\n\u201cIt is something that if you want to be successful at it, you can\u2019t just do it part time,\u201d he said.\n\nIt would be too much for one person, but Googe said it\u2019s important for departments to trust officers enough to spread out the responsibility and create policy.\n\nGooge and Watson encouraged all law enforcement to consider going online.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t online, you can miss a lot of vital information about what\u2019s going on in the community,\u201d Watson warned. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a norm; social media is here to stay, either you accept it or you don\u2019t, but we can\u2019t be afraid to use it.\u201d\n\nReach Melissa Boughton at 937-5594 or at Twitter.com/mboughtonPC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lowcountry law enforcement online: \u2018Social media is here to stay\u2019, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County Sheriff's Office,Charleston Police Department,Facebook,Hanahan police department,Instagram,Mount Pleasant Police Department,Periscope,social media,Twitter,Vine,YouTube", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "For law enforcement across the Lowcountry, social media has become a vital tool in 21st century crime fighting.", "title": "Lowcountry law enforcement online: \u2018Social media is here to stay\u2019", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150913/150919694/lowcountry-law-enforcement-online-x2018-social-media-is-here-to-stay-x2019", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919694/AR/0/AR-150919694.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919694/AR/0/AR-150919694.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For law enforcement across the Lowcountry, social media has become a vital tool in 21st century crime fighting.", "title": "Lowcountry law enforcement online: \u2018Social media is here to stay\u2019", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150913/PC16/150919694/AR/0/AR-150919694.jpg?201509132204", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150919694}}, "keywords": "Lowcountry law enforcement online: \u2018Social media is here to stay\u2019 , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County Sheriff's Office,Charleston Police Department,Facebook,Hanahan police department,Instagram,Mount Pleasant Police Department,Periscope,social media,Twitter,Vine,YouTube", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-13T22:04:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "For law enforcement across the Lowcountry, social media has become a vital tool in 21st century crime fighting."}, "article_summary": "For law enforcement across the Lowcountry, social media has become a vital tool in 21st century crime fighting.\n\u201cThat is the power of social media and clear evidence on how many people it reaches around the world.\nThe investigative unit at the Sheriff\u2019s Office also uses social media to gather intelligence about cases.\nLowcountry followers Below is the number of Twitter and Facebook followers each law enforcement agency in the Lowcountry had as of Sunday.\nFrom there, deputies communicated with the individual through social media to identify the suicidal teen, who lives in Charleston County."}
