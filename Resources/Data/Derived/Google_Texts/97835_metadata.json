That\u2019s a theme the drug industry is pushing in an emotional new ad campaign touting the power of pharmaceuticals to prolong lives.\n\nIt\u2019s a heartwarming message. But a growing number of health economists say it\u2019s also disingenuous.\n\nThey say it\u2019s high time to start putting a price on the time patients gain from taking a costly medication. And they\u2019re calling for a national conversation about whether that extra time is worth the cost, not just for the patient, but for society at large, which often bears part of the expense through government programs.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\n\u201cThe country \u2026 needs to be able to make these types of decisions with some type of input as to costs,\u201d said Dr. Howard Forman, a Yale University economist and practicing radiologist. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to just say life is priceless, but the reality is we are paying for it.\u201d\n\nIn practice, there\u2019s often little correlation between how much a drug costs and how well it works. The Food and Drug Administration has approved some pricey drugs based on clinical trials showing they extend life for just a matter of days. More than 70 new drugs targeting solid tumors were approved between 2002 and 2014 \u2014 with median improvement in survival of just 2.1 months.\n\nAnd the price of postponing death is growing. In 2013, one extra year of life for cancer patients cost $207,000, on average, nearly quadruple what it did in 1995, according to a study published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives.\n\nDrug makers typically justify the high prices by pointing to their enormous expenditures on research and development, and by explaining that their medications are often the only option for patients facing terrible diseases. They also factor in the size of the market; drugs for rare conditions often cost far more because the manufacturers can\u2019t make up their research costs with a high volume of sales.\n\nSign up for our Morning Rounds newsletter Email address\n\nMost drug companies have so far shied away from linking drug prices to the amount or quality of time the medications buy patients.\n\nBut they\u2019re under increasing pressure to change course.\n\nA team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center this month got a $4.7 million grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation to study payment structures that link a drug\u2019s price to its effectiveness. They\u2019ll build off their previous work, such as an interactive calculator launched online last summer to spur conversation about the \u201cright price\u201d for cancer drugs. (Users can assign different weights to factors like how long the drug is expected to prolong life, or what side effects it might cause.)\n\nAnd some drug makers are quietly starting to experiment with novel payment methods.\n\nNovartis, for instance, recently reached an agreement with the insurer Cigna over the cost of its heart drug Entresto. The more time patients have at home, rather than in the hospital, the more money Novartis gets for the medication.\n\nOther companies are negotiating with the big pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts over a system \u2014 to be rolled out this spring \u2014 that will adjust the price paid for a drug based on how well it treats different types of cancer. If a drug is more effective for prostate than for lung cancer, for instance, the company will get more money when it\u2019s given to prostate cancer patients.\n\nThe Biotechnology Innovation Organization, which represents biotech and pharmaceutical companies, this month issued a set of \u201cprinciples\u201d affirming its support for exploring such \u201cpay for performance\u201d models.\n\nBut on the very same day, BIO launched an online video that showed emotional footage of patients such as a baby strapped with medical devices, as a narrator asks what could be \u201cmore \u2026 priceless\u201d than time.\n\nKen Lisaius, BIO\u2019s senior vice president of communications, said he sees no contradiction between the two messages, noting that discussions about drug pricing take place between companies and insurers, not patients.\n\n\u201cFrom the patient perspective, time is precious, and it\u2019s often priceless,\u201d Lisaius said.\n\nHe later added in an email: \u201cIf there was a group of economists that wanted to band together and put out an ad that notes that what they feel is most important is putting a dollar amount on life \u2014 well, that would be their right \u2026 but I am not sure who outside of insurers would agree with them.\u201d\n\nExperts agree that Americans tend to have a cultural aversion to putting a price tag on a human life. The Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits the use of a common economic measure to value a healthy year of life in some analyses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a resistance to using those figures in this country because it seems like it\u2019s unseemly to put a price on life,\u201d said Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.\n\nThere are practical concerns, too: How effective a drug is depends in part on how faithfully patients take it. So pegging price to effectiveness requires drug makers to effectively gamble their profits on patients\u2019 ability to follow doctors\u2019 instructions. And it\u2019s well-known that even patients facing serious illnesses don\u2019t always take their pills consistently.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more technical challenge: How do you quantify the quality of life a patient gets from staving off disease for weeks or months or years?\n\nSome might place a premium on the ability to return to work, while others might value full mobility. Still others might deem it priceless simply to have a few more days in the company of family.\n\n\u201cMeasures of survival and progression-free disease are certainly very, very important,\u201d said Tom Hubbard, vice president of policy research at the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation, which counts pharma companies among its members. \u201cBut do we have a full set of measures relative to patient quality of life that can be applied right now? I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug companies face pressure to start setting drug prices based on the extra time patients get from taking their meds.
