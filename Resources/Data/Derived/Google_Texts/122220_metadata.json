I think that example is pretty clear,\" he responded, without elaborating.\n\nCarson hastened to add that he wasn't referring to Barack Obama. No siree. Someone else. But not Obama. Wink wink nudge nudge.\n\nIn any case, this provides a good opportunity to highlight Carson's views on political correctness. When Donald Trump talks about it, he's using it in the usual throwaway sense we're all familiar with. He wants to be able to talk about immigrants being rapists or women being shrill and ugly without everyone getting on his case. Others have in mind trigger warnings and other campus fads. But when Ben Carson talks about it, he means much, much more. It is the core of his worldview, so it's worth understanding what he means by it. Here is Amy Davidson:\n\nIn his most recent book, \u201cOne America,\u201d he writes that agents working against this country\u2019s greatness include the political-correctness police, who use \u201cfaux hypersensitivity\u201d to take power away from the majority of Americans....Political correctness, Carson says, is used to keep conservatives from invoking slavery or Nazism, both of which he cites freely. (\u201cObamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201d; \u201cWe live in a Gestapo age.\u201d) He wonders if Obama will cause the elections to be cancelled: \u201cHe\u2019s sitting there saying, \u2018These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.\u2019 \u201d Trump, the businessman, tells Americans how the financial system is rigged against them. Carson, the brain surgeon, tells them how they are being denied knowledge.\n\nThis explains why, at the New Hampshire event, he's talking about \"control of thought and control of speech\" for seemingly no reason. In fact, Carson believes that liberals are deliberately making it impossible for conservatives to talk about the truly important issues that are destroying America. Keeping everyone cowed and silent is the first step to tyranny, which is why he thinks incipient Hitlerism is something to be taken seriously. Here he is explaining this view last year, before he was running for president:\n\nPolitical correctness is antithetical to our founding principles of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Its most powerful tool is intimidation. If it is not vigorously opposed, its proponents win by default, because the victims adopt a \u201cgo along to get along\u201d attitude. Major allies in the imposition of PC are members of the media, some of whom thrive on controversy and others who are true ideologues. ....The American people must learn to identify and ignore political correctness if we are to escape the bitter ideological grenades that are destroying our unity and strength. Political correctness is impotent if we the people are fearless. Let us emphasize intelligent discussion of issues and leave the smear campaigns to those with no constructive ideas.\n\nCarson talks incessantly about political correctness, and he's been doing it for a long time. It is, he believes, the method by which the populace is kept too intimidated to object when liberal policies lead to moral decay and the eventual downfall of the country. You will hear him talk all the time about not being afraid to speak up, and when he does it's more than just a normal political stemwinder urging people to get involved and vote. He believes that political correctness today is the equivalent of brownshirt terrorism in 1933, and he believes that this is what brought Hitler to power in Germany. Whenever you hear Carson talk about either \"political correctness\" or \"mind control,\" this is what it means to him.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/10/heres-what-ben-carson-means-when-he-talks-about-political-correctness", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Here's what Ben Carson means when he talks about political correctness"}, "twitter": {"title": "Here's what Ben Carson means when he talks about political correctness", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/10/heres-what-ben-carson-means-when-he-talks-about-political-correctness", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2717\"", "article_summary": "Whenever you hear Carson talk about either \"political correctness\" or \"mind control,\" this is what it means to him.\nCarson talks incessantly about political correctness, and he's been doing it for a long time.\nBut when Ben Carson talks about it, he means much, much more.\nIn any case, this provides a good opportunity to highlight Carson's views on political correctness.\n....The American people must learn to identify and ignore political correctness if we are to escape the bitter ideological grenades that are destroying our unity and strength."}
