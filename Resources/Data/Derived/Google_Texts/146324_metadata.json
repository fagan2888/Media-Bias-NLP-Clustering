Twenty years ago, thirty corporations controlled 90 percent of US media. Today, it is a grand total of six mega-corporations\u2014Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, CBS, and Comcast. Besides accumulating their own profits, the media are daily trumpets for the rest of the corporate world\u2019s advertising.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked for a newspaper or magazine, you know the process of layout and design. The ads are laid out before anything else except the lead stories; the other news and feature stories are then fit between ads. \u201cWhat can we find to fill this hole?\u201d an editor will frequently shout, referring to a page where stories have not yet been designated to fill the space between the ads, thus leaving a \u201cnews hole.\u201d Media owners\u2019 profits do not come primarily from the money we spend to buy their publications, but from the ads inside them. While big advertisers don\u2019t directly select what news is published, publishers, editors, and news directors know what they like and will rarely risk their disapproval.\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish to expect objective reporting: not because journalists are bad people, but because of the economic structure of the organizations they work for,\u201d Arundhati Roy wrote in 2011. \u201cIn fact, what is surprising is that despite all this, occasionally there is some very good reporting. But overall we have silence, or a completely distorted picture.\u201d\n\nOnline news sources also rely on ads for their profits even more than their print-media cousins. So do the search engines and portal sites through which people gain access to them, such as Google and Yahoo!. But it\u2019s online media that have the potential for wider than ever public participation and exchange of views.\n\nA democratic, accessible-to-all media will move to center stage in a socialist USA. In some ways this democratization of the media is already happening on the Internet. But the government\u2019s ability to spy on and even turn off the Internet belies any real democracy. In a socialist democracy, working people will control the political process, the way in which they make a living, and collectively and individually, they will influence mass culture. The Internet will be a powerful and democratizing tool in this effort.\n\nYet the media business, for those who now own and run it, is more than just a money-making operation. The owners also promote their political agenda. Through selecting and disseminating news\u2014or presenting propaganda like \u201cthe recession is over\u201d or \u201cdrones almost always hit their targets\u201d\u2014the media moguls push the public to support that agenda, from their political candidates to their wars. In capitalist societies, what\u2019s reported as \u201cnews\u201d is selected, organized, and presented by an army of self-important publishers, editors, and writers who\u2014if they want to keep their jobs\u2014follow their corporate employers\u2019 political line. And what\u2019s not reported is often just as telling. In 2012, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting noted that less than one percent of news stories in eight major outlets covered poverty.\n\nIndeed, almost a century ago, Upton Sinclair, in \u201cThe Brass Check,\u201d defined journalism in the United States as \u201cthe day-to-day, between-elections propaganda, whereby the minds of the people are kept in a state of acquiescence, so that when the crisis of an election comes, they go to the polls and cast their ballots for either one of the two candidates of their exploiters.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nBut what will the media be like in a socialist USA? There is no blueprint, but in a society that has erased corporate control, the articles in newspapers and magazines and online will not be filler between ads for teeth whiteners and weight-loss pills. There won\u2019t be TV commercials for Coke, cars, or million-dollar condos. There will be no private corporations to create and sponsor the news.\n\nMost of us could probably manage to struggle through life without Coca-Cola and Colgate, but who, then, will pay for the news? Who will pay the salaries of reporters, camera people, technicians, announcers, maintenance staff, online journalists, professional bloggers, and videographers?\n\nIn a socialist society a portion of the media would be reserved for news disseminated by the democratically elected governing bodies, that is, working people elected by and for working people.\n\nBut state ownership is not the only way media can represent the interests of working people, to speak with or through their voices. In most cases, the media would be owned and operated by working-class organizations\u2014labor unions, neighborhood associations, and cultural centers.\n\nSo news (and views) in a socialist society will be brought to you by a plethora of noncommercial sponsors. The government media will report on and discuss, for example, the major government plans for production, how to improve education, and more. But other media\u2014newspapers, TV and radio stations, and Web sites sponsored by workers\u2019 organizations, cultural organizations, youth groups, sports teams, and neighborhood groups will report on issues specific to their interests.\n\nSocialist media will be multisponsored and multifaceted and reflect a range of opinions even when there are disagreements and arguments.\n\nBut what about the cost? Can workers\u2019 organizations such as labor unions, tenants\u2019 organizations, or citywide parent-teacher associations really afford to pay for daily and weekly newspapers, magazines, TV and radio newscasts, blogs, and online audio-and video-streaming techniques?\n\nIn most cases, workers could meet the cost of media-making with add-ons to union dues, but that may not always be needed. New technology has drastically cut the costs of producing media. Smaller, easier-to-use cameras, recorders, and other airwave technology, as well as the electronic publication of books, newsletters, and blogs, have brought media production within the reach of almost everyone.\n\nUnion dues today pay for the publication, including staff salaries, of many union newspapers. In a socialist society, where money is allocated based on assessed social need and not on projected profits, government will subsidize many salaries in social, economic, political, and educational areas. (Even under capitalism, the government funds public schools, although usually in a distorted manner through which schools in wealthier areas get the most money.) So salaries at the media operations of smaller unions will most likely be covered by government subsidies.\n\nThe organizational outreach of such workers\u2019 groups\u2014through their affiliates and friends across the country (and often around the world) will provide the circulation that is so critical\u2014and in capitalist society, so costly.\n\nBut what about bias? Can a newspaper or TV news program run by the autoworkers\u2019 union, for example, provide critical reports about that union\u2019s problems and weaknesses? When workers on one section of an auto assembly line feel that the line is moving too fast for safety\u2014perhaps it has already caused some minor injuries, and they believe a major accident is inevitable\u2014while union officials are publicly boasting about their plant\u2019s speed and \u201csocialist efficiency,\u201d will the union\u2019s TV program invite the complaining workers on the air to discuss their issues? Indeed, will \u201cAutoworkers News and Views\u201d on TV have a regular segment devoted to union members\u2019 criticisms?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bye, Rush!
