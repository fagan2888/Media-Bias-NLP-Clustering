If you want to know how he\u2019ll vote, watch ALEC and the Koch brothers \u2013 whatever they want, Luke will vote accordingly.\n\nMuch like Senator Dan Coats, if it\u2019s good for business, then it\u2019s good for Hoosiers. They\u2019re not alone. Recently, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce shared this with Michael Reschke at the Herald-Times, an Indiana reporter who spent no time researching the facts:\n\nInformation provided by the chamber shows Indiana falling from being one of the top 15 states for cheap electricity in 2005 to 27th today. The chamber blames federal regulations as the reason for the increasing prices and doesn\u2019t believe the benefit of the new regulations will outweigh the cost.\n\nThere are no benefits to breathing clean air? Has he read the World Banks assessment or IEA? Has he read the American Lung Association report? Has he read anything on climate change? Does he remember how our crops literally dried up in the fields two years ago, and then suffered to mature under cool weather last year? Have they read any of the studies linking Infant Mortality to mercury from carbon emissions where Indiana ranks 42nd in the country for dirty air?\n\nGenerally speaking, we\u2019d call these people ignorant (not knowing the facts), but these are smart people. They are just relying on corrupted sources. It\u2019s even more embarrassing for a newspaper reporter to simply share their opinion without spending any time researching the facts. We live in the Age of Information, so the only excuse is laziness.\n\nWe prefer to inform our readers, so let\u2019s analyze what Luke has to say and apply critical thinking skills.\n\nWe shared our articles with him \u2013 and this one \u2013 and this one \u2013 we then asked him to take a leadership role on environmental issues in Indiana, where we rank in the bottom quintile, or 42nd, as the dirtiest state in the union. The American Lung Society gave us a failing grade on air quality primarily because of our dependence on coal-producing energy. Indiana still relies on dirty coal for 85% of our energy needs, even though the EPA and other regulatory bodies around the world have told us for two decades we need to change this reliance because of its negative impact to our global environment.\n\nAs the Indiana Chamber representative mentioned, \u201cIndiana is falling from being one of the top 15 states for cheap electricity in 2005 to 27th today.\u201d So, even when we\u2019ve dumped all this toxic air on Hoosiers which makes us sick, we\u2019ve lost our competitive edge. As opposed to leveraging investments in clean alternative energy sources which will have a meaningful impact on the air we breath, create new jobs, and will bring down the future cost of energy, we should just do away with regulations, or loosen them?\n\nNow you know why republican thinking is bad for our health and our pocketbooks.\n\nRepublicans have worked diligently to obstruct attempts to force power companies to broaden their energy portfolios for over 20 years. We still rely on dirty coal and we still rank in the bottom ten most polluted states. So, even though you manage to keep your surrounding air free from toxins by not smoking or spraying chemicals in and around your home, we\u2019re getting sick because our republican lawmakers have allowed industry to spread toxic chemicals in the air we breath.\n\nLuke Messer opposes President Obama\u2019s EPA carbon emissions requirement. He prefers an \u201call the above\u201d approach toward energy policy. This stance means nothing. He lives in a state that is 85% dependent on coal \u2013 this doesn\u2019t even resemble an \u201call the above\u201d portfolio. It\u2019s typical conservative rhetoric to pacify ill-informed journalists with corporate owned media interests and is used as a \u201ctalking point\u201d with Fox news hosts \u2013 it\u2019s empty rhetoric.\n\nLet\u2019s look at his main objection from his letter:\n\nThese new EPA rules are bad for the economy and will not have the positive environmental impact for which they are being promised. According to an analysis by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the proposed regulation will put a quarter million Americans out of work and increase electricity costs by more than $289 billion. For the average Hoosier, these changes will mean a $200 a year reduction in expendable income.\n\nFirst off, he\u2019s a republican. We\u2019ve had republican leadership in the Governors mansion for nearly two decades. Our personal incomes are stuck in the 1990\u2019s. The BEA just released yesterday, that once again, Indiana is ranked in the bottom quintile, or ranked 42nd, for personal income growth. So, he doesn\u2019t give a shit about our personal income.\n\nSecondly, one of our articles referred to Dr. Jeffrey Sachs\u2019 (Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University) op/ed in the Huffington Post, titled, \u201cThe EPA is Right and the U.S. Chamber is Wrong\u201d. Dr. Sachs spelled out simple mathematics to prove the U.S. Chamber is wrong operationally with its analysis. He concludes:\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is wrong, both ethically and operationally. The Chamber\u2019s ethical position is that the U.S. does not have to care about the damages it causes to the rest of the world. This is a special kind of arrogance certainly not unknown in the US corporate sector. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about you,\u201d screams the Chamber to the rest of the world. We feel free to wreck your climate at our whim.\u201d\n\nNotice that our U.S. Congressman, Luke Messer, uses an analysis by the U.S. Chamber, to support his position on voting for public policy.\n\nDr. Sachs says not only is their math and economics wrong, their ideological beliefs are unethical. Meaning, it has no basis and should be rejected morally as well.\n\nApparently, Rep. Messer didn\u2019t read our articles as he indicated. If looked at closely, the entire republican platform is unethical in Indiana and nationally, so this is no surprise to us.\n\nIn all fairness, Rep. Messer did quote the International Energy Agency (IEA) in his response by writing:\n\n\u201cAccording to the International Energy Agency, the rest of the world will increase its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 6 times the amount by which U.S. emissions will be decreased (referring to India & China). It doesn\u2019t make sense to place ankle-weights on the U.S. economy with the burdensome costs of these regulations when they won\u2019t even have their desired impact.\u201d\n\nThis must be a talking point provided by Reince Preibus, Chairman of the Republican Party. We searched and this doesn\u2019t match the current dialogue coming from the IEA. We just received an article from ThinkProgress about a study done by the World Bank stating:\n\nAn important new World Bank report concludes that just a few key policies for cutting carbon pollution would boost the global economy. The study \u201cClimate-Smart Development: Adding Up the Benefits of Actions that Help Build Prosperity, End Poverty and Combat Climate Change,\u201d looks at the European Union plus Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and the U.S. This finding matches that of the recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report, \u201cEnergy Technology Perspectives.\u201d The IEA found that an aggressive effort to deploy renewable energy and energy efficiency (and energy storage) to keep global warming below the dangerous threshold of 2\u00b0C would be astoundingly cost-effective, \u201cresulting in net savings of $71 trillion\u201d by 2050.\n\nWhen you\u2019re a coal industry sellout, the only thing you can sell is propaganda to support your paid off stance. You can\u2019t tell people you\u2019re a hack auctioned off to the highest bidder because that won\u2019t get you votes. To steal a line from Dr. Sachs, \u201cHe is wrong operationally and morally.\u201d\n\nSo what else can Rep. Messer use to refute the facts and figures?\n\nFear mongering, or the \u201cace in the hole\u201d for the republican party platform. He tosses a good one:\n\n\u201cWe all want a clean environment, but this Administration refuses to balance the benefits of proposed environmental actions with their real-world costs. Making policy in such a vacu\u00fcm like this often results in bad policy that hurts the very people you are trying to help.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, the International Energy Agency (his own quoted resource), and one of the most influential economists and climate experts, Jeffrey Sachs, all disagree with him. And, they support it with facts, figures and a rather convincing moral argument. The IEA quote above states, \u201cWe\u2019ll save $71 trillion by 2050\u201d \u2013 this sounds like a \u201creal benefit\u201d!\n\nWhat organization does Representative Luke Messer base his primary belief on? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber\u2019s members are the ones polluting our environment. He takes his corporate propaganda and anti-government rhetoric on Fox News who peddles it to grossly undereducated and uninformed Hoosiers, who in return, pick him to serve in congress.\n\nPlato told us a very long time ago, \u201cThe price of citizen apathy is we\u2019ll be ruled by our inferiors.\u201d Well, Hoosiers, Representative Luke Messer is what we get for not educating ourselves on the subjects at hand, and for not using our critical thinking skills against the prepared propaganda these politicians peddle on Fox news.\n\nHis conclusion:\n\nI believe they (Hoosiers) know what\u2019s in their own best interests\u2014and that of their families\u2014better than any political leader in Washington D.C., a politically motivated interest group, or a global organization unconcerned with preserving the American way of life. My constituents have told me these EPA regulations should be scrapped. I agree with their assessment.\n\nThe Congressman himself uses sources for his opinion which have proven to be false, misleading and unethical. His primary source reference is the U.S. Chamber which is a \u201cpolitically motivated interest group\u201d \u2013 in fact, they are THE largest political lobbying group.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nThe Chamber is staffed with policy specialists, lobbyists and lawyers. Politically, the Chamber is generally considered to be a conservative organization. It usually supports Republican political candidates, though it has occasionally supported conservative Democrats. The Chamber is one of the largest lobbying groups in the U.S., spending more money than any other lobbying organization on a yearly basis.\n\nWe can only guess what Rep. Messer\u2019s idea is of \u201cthe American Way of Life\u201d. If we had to guess from his recent exchange with Muncie Voice \u2013 it means \u201cuninformed, unethical, yet arrogant\u201d \u2013 sound familiar?\n\n\u201cPatriotism \u2026 is a superstition artificially created and maintained through a network of lies and falsehoods; a superstition that robs man of his self-respect and dignity, and increases his arrogance and conceit.\u201d ~ Emma Goldman\n\nWe\u2019ll close with the advice Dr. Sachs gave the U.S. Chamber, since it most certainly fits as good advice for the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and Congressman Luke Messer:\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce is, alas, a shortsighted and often venal institution that lacks in basic ethical standards and in practical knowledge of international public policy. Instead of attacking the EPA, the US Chamber of Commerce should be working with other chambers of commerce around the world, and with the umbrella institution, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), to make sure that EPA-like rules are indeed adopted worldwide. My best guess is that many members of the US Chamber of Commerce do not agree with the Chamber\u2019s stance on the social cost of carbon. They should speak out to insist on approaches that are moral, evidence based, and in both the US and global interest.\n\nAuthors note: Merriam-Webster defines, \u201cVenal \u2013 willing to do dishonest things in return for money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Muncie, IN - Congressman Luke Messer was sent a letter pleading for him to be a leader in environment regulation, but he supports the corrupted US Chamber.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Muncie Voice", "description": "Muncie, IN - Congressman Luke Messer was sent a letter pleading for him to be a leader in environment regulation, but he supports the corrupted US Chamber.", "title": "Congressman Luke Messer Beliefs Based on Corrupt Sources - Muncie Voice", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.muncievoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Messer.jpg", "height": 515}, "updated_time": "2014-06-26T10:11:48-04:00", "url": "http://www.muncievoice.com/11379/congressman-luke-messer-beliefs-based-corrupt-sources/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "(Photo courtesy wabash blogs dot edu) MUNCIE, Indiana - Last week, we sent a letter to Congressman Luke Messer, who consistently sides with conservative propaganda in this state from the anti-Affordable Care Act through promoting Keystone XL Pipeline as a jobs program.
