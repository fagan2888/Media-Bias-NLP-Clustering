And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests.\u201d\n\nBy the President\u2019s own admission, his relationship with Silicon Valley \u201chas historically been very good. Many of these folks are my friends, and have been supporters, and we interact all the time.\u201d Obama\u2019s chief technology officer, Megan Smith, was a Google executive before accepting the White House job.\n\nHowever, top executives of Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook declined invitations to the President\u2019s cyber-security conference on Friday, sending lower-level officials instead. The four CEOs are part of a surveillance reform advocacy group, established following the NSA spy scandal.\n\nTop tech CEOs give Obama the cold shoulder at cybersecurity summit: President Barack Obama ceremoniously signe... http://t.co/CQdM93Mp9n \u2014 Silicon Angel (@SiliconAngel) February 13, 2015\n\nObama did note that certain European countries were \u201cvery sensitive\u201d to privacy issues, specifically mentioning Germany\u2019s \u201chistory with the Stasi,\u201d the East German secret police infamous for mass surveillance. German Chancellor Angela Merkel actually brought up the Stasi at a December 2013 meeting with Obama to protest the NSA surveillance of foreign leaders, including herself.\n\nAddressing a question about encryption and surveillance, Obama argued he remained a \u201cstrong believer in strong encryption\u201d, and remained as strong on civil liberties as ever, but qualified that by saying \u201cIt\u2019s just that I am sympathetic to law enforcement.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials have defended their regulatory efforts as driven by concerns over privacy, monopoly behavior, and tax avoidance. Calling Mr. Obama\u2019s comments \u201cout of line,\u201d the European Commission\u2019s spokesperson explained that the EU was seeking to enforce its regulations in a uniform manner across the 28-nation bloc. \u201cRegulations should make it easier for non-EU companies to access the single market,\u201d they told the Financial Times.\n\nMany US tech giants were using loopholes in national tax laws to avoid corporate taxes in the EU, via popular set-ups like the \u201cDouble Irish\u201d or the \u201cDutch Sandwich\u201d. Irish lawmakers finally closed the loophole last fall.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple, Facebook & Amazon multi-billion 'Double Irish' tax loophole closed\n\nAmerican tech companies have also used EU legislation to lobby against one another. Google has backed the browser antitrust case against Microsoft, while Microsoft has led a coalition lobbying against Google\u2019s search engine dominance.\n\nLast year, the European Court of Justice ruled that Google owed its European users the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d by scrubbing unwanted personal information at users\u2019 request.\n\nREAD MORE: Google ordered to drop links to irrelevant personal data in landmark EU court ruling\n\nObama\u2019s interview was part of a push for the proposed regulation of the internet as a public utility, better known as \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d, which is coming up for a vote in late February. The proposal is under fire by Republican critics, such as FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nAt a Republican tech conference last week, Cruz warned against trusting politicians who say \u201cif you like your internet, you can keep your internet\u201d, invoking the President\u2019s famous phrase about doctors used to promote the 2010 \u201cObamacare\u201d law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has criticized European efforts to regulate the internet, suggesting Brussels is unfairly targeting US tech companies, because their European rivals just \u201ccan\u2019t compete\u201d with Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "President Obama has criticized European efforts to regulate the internet, suggesting Brussels is unfairly targeting US tech companies, because their European rivals just \u201ccan\u2019t compete\u201d with Americans.", "title": "Europeans \u2018just can\u2019t compete\u2019 with US on internet \u2013 Obama", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/38/f2/b0/00/obama-1.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/233259-obama-eu-internet-control/", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimzied": "width", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama has criticized European efforts to regulate the internet, suggesting Brussels is unfairly targeting US tech companies, because their European rivals just \u201ccan\u2019t compete\u201d with Americans.", "creator": "@RT_com", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/38/f2/b0/00/obama-1.si.jpg", "title": "RT International", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "navigation": "tabbed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have owned the internet,\u201d Obama stated in an interview with the technology portal Re/Code, during his summit on cyber-security in Silicon Valley on Friday.\nPresident Obama has criticized European efforts to regulate the internet, suggesting Brussels is unfairly targeting US tech companies, because their European rivals just \u201ccan\u2019t compete\u201d with Americans.\n\u201cOur companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it in ways that they can\u2019t compete.\nREAD MORE: Apple, Facebook & Amazon multi-billion 'Double Irish' tax loophole closedAmerican tech companies have also used EU legislation to lobby against one another.\nThe proposal is under fire by Republican critics, such as FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai and Texas Senator Ted Cruz."}
