Burwell pick muddles Dem plans\n\nSenate Democrats planned to spend the spring ramping up their election-year message on income inequality \u2014 not relitigating Obamacare.\n\nChange of plans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRepublicans hope to turn Sylvia Mathews Burwell\u2019s nomination to run the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 announced by President Barack Obama on Friday \u2014 into a proxy war over Obamacare.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sebelius resignation: Obama says she will 'go down in history')\n\nThat leaves the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats veering back to the very issue that has become their biggest political liability heading into the midterms.\n\nFor now, at risk Democrats up for reelection this fall are proceeding with caution.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Mark Udall said the Colorado Democrat will examine Burwell\u2019s record and hearing testimony, \u201cas with any nominee,\u201d before making up his mind. Shripal Shah, a spokesman for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, said the New Hampshire Democrat \u201chas a tremendous amount of respect for Director Burwell, her experience, and her qualifications. She\u2019s looking forward to considering her nomination.\u201d\n\nAides to Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, John Walsh of Montana, Mark Warner of Virginia and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana all declined to respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n( PHOTOS: Kathleen Sebelius' life and career)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an even money proposition to be voting to replace [Kathleen] Sebelius,\u201d one senior Senate Democratic aide said. \u201cWhatever week or weeks the hearings or votes will take place, it\u2019s not the topic we would choose if we could choose any topic. But it\u2019s not bad a thing to be voting to replace Sebelius.\u201d\n\nBurwell\u2019s confirmation to replace Sebelius at HHS is nearly assured. With the historic rules changes on most executive and judicial branch nominations last November, Democrats need only 51 votes to confirm her, and the party controls 55 votes in the chamber.\n\nBut if Republicans are mostly united in opposing Burwell, the support of red-state Democrats will be crucial.\n\nDemocrats hope the 96-0 vote last April for Burwell as Office of Management and Budget director, her credentials and her respected reputation will smooth the path to her confirmation. And, importantly, some moderate Senate Democrats who aren\u2019t up for reelection are enthusiastically backing Burwell, which could give their colleagues cover to also support her.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin introduced Burwell \u2013 a fellow West Virginian \u2014 at both her confirmation hearings last spring, and stressed her \u201cbipartisan relationships\u201d in a statement praising her HHS nomination. He added that installing Burwell as HHS chief will ensure that \u201ccommonsense fixes\u201d to Obamacare will be enacted. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said she hoped the Senate \u201crallies around\u201d the nomination of Burwell, who Heitkamp said \u201cunderstands how to put good ideas to work to help families who need it.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sylvia Mathews Burwell\u2019s next marathon)\n\nSen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, called Burwell a \u201cbrilliant choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be confirmed easily,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure that at her confirmation hearings, there will be a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act. She\u2019s in a great position because she doesn\u2019t have any\u201d baggage.\n\nFor Republicans, last year\u2019s unanimous support for Burwell matters little in an environment where Obamacare \u2014 and how Burwell would continue the health care law\u2019s implementation \u2014 will be the chief focus. Republican senators are sure to question Burwell on whether she\u2019ll work with Congress on Obamacare tweaks, if the administration exceeded its executive authority with delays to deadlines in the law, and for more details on Obamacare\u2019s enrollment numbers, GOP aides said.\n\nThe Republican message, according to one senior aide: \u201cWe would argue that there is no person on earth capable of making this horrible law work.\u201d\n\nAlabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, said Burwell has a \u201ccomparatively thin resume\u201d to run an agency with the size and scope of Health and Human Services and indicated that he was unimpressed with her performance so far as budget director. And in an interview with Fox News on Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Burwell\u2019s confirmation \u201cpresents an ideal opportunity to examine the failures that are Obamacare.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Website fiasco will taint Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 legacy)\n\nStill, for now there is little concern among Democrats that she will ultimately be confirmed \u2014 even if they get few Republican backers. So far, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is the rare Republican signaling support, tweeting that Burwell is an \u201cexcellent choice\u201d for HHS.\n\nBurwell will undergo hearings in both the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, though the confirmation vote will be held in Finance. A committee aide said the panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), plans to schedule a hearing soon after it receives Burwell\u2019s nomination materials. A committee mark-up seems likely in early May.\n\nShe is likely to face a full floor confirmation vote in late May or early June, since the Senate isn\u2019t likely to shuffle its immediate schedule for her confirmation. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Friday he is anticipating a \u201cMay transition\u201d for Burwell to HHS.\n\nDemocrats say the political environment on Obamacare has largely changed with positive enrollment numbers, which could help ease Burwell\u2019s confirmation process. On Thursday, Sebelius \u2014 in her final Hill appearance before her resignation was made public \u2014 said more than 7.5 million people on Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe timing is also early enough this election year to avoid the heat of the campaign season, and one Democrat noted that fierce GOP opposition may backfire if they attack a female nominee in confirmation hearings. Another fact Democrats may raise is Burwell\u2019s leadership at the point agency during last fall\u2019s government shutdown triggered by a fight over defunding Obamacare \u2014 a political loser for Republicans.\n\n\u201cShe was unanimously confirmed last April to head the Office of Management and Budget, where she has proven to be an extremely effective leader who is able to work constructively with both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Friday. \u201cDirector Burwell deserves timely confirmation, and I hope my Republican colleagues will work with us to ensure we fill this important position without unnecessary obstruction and delay.\u201d\n\nLucy McCalmont contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans hope to turn her nomination into a proxy war over Obamacare.", "title": "Burwell pick muddles Dem plans", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/sylvia-mathews-burwell-democrats-obamacare-affordable-care-act-105641.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/04/11/140411_sylvia_burwell_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Obamacare,Democrats,Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans hope to turn her nomination into a proxy war over Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd968c\"", "article_summary": "Burwell pick muddles Dem plansSenate Democrats planned to spend the spring ramping up their election-year message on income inequality \u2014 not relitigating Obamacare.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that at her confirmation hearings, there will be a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd, importantly, some moderate Senate Democrats who aren\u2019t up for reelection are enthusiastically backing Burwell, which could give their colleagues cover to also support her.\nDemocrats say the political environment on Obamacare has largely changed with positive enrollment numbers, which could help ease Burwell\u2019s confirmation process.\nSo far, Sen.
