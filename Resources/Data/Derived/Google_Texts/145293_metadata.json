But awareness of the sprawling array of other government food programs is another eye opener.\n\nWIC, for example, the Women, Infants and Children Food and Nutrition Service, started small in 1968 to help poor and undernourished mothers-to-be. It now covers 53 percent of all infants in America at an annual cost of $8.8 billion, and involves 90 state agencies, 1,836 bureaus and 9,000 clinics.\n\nRelated: Puzzling Rise in Food Stamp Use as Economy Improves\n\nThis now staggering project is a gateway to many other government-funded entitlement programs, including SNAP. There are, of course, lots of rules and the catalogue of approved foods is mind-boggling. Under WIC, mothers to be can\u2019t buy white potatoes (insufficiently nutritious), imported cheeses or cheese spreads and only 9 types of domestic cheeses are approved. Canned beans are fine, but not if they include pork or frankfurters. Moms may buy a gallon of milk, but only in gallon containers, not two half-gallons.\n\nCompare that to SNAP, where a veritable buffet of junk food can be bought with taxpayer dollars, including Double Stuf Oreos, Breyers Cookies and Cream ice cream, Kit Kat Milk Chocolate and Snickers, Cheez-It snacks, a fountain of calorie laden sodas, including energy drinks like Monster, Red Bull and Rockstar, and of course, Starbuck\u2019s coffee.\n\nThe spread of free school lunches\u2014and now free breakfasts-- is another story. In 1969, some 2.9 million youngsters received free lunches daily. By 2012, there were 18.7 million free lunches, 68.2 percent of all school lunches. What about free food during summer? No problem thanks to the Seamless Summer Option. Now ALL children can eat free in communities where 50 percent of all children are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals\u2014that\u2019s about two-thirds of all schools with lunch programs. In large part, the 50 percent of lunches that go to apparently ineligible youngsters are given to avoid stigmatizing the eligible.\n\nRelated: Food Stamps\u2014Desperate Need or Double Dealing?\n\nChildren are eligible for free school lunches if their family income falls below 130 percent of the government\u2019s poverty level In 2012, the income cut-off for a household of three\u2014single mother, two children\u2014would be $24,817. Cash welfare payments are included as income but excluded are Section 8 housing subsidies, Medicare, so-called food stamps and government-paid entitlements.\n\nThe lesser-known school breakfast program now covers 12.9 million students and costs $3.3 billion a year. The USDA wants to expand it and is actively mobilizing parents and teachers to offer free breakfasts. A visit to the USDA Web site offers a step-by-step plan to expand free breakfasts.\n\nThese two programs comprise only a small portion of Washington\u2019s free food projects. What does this benevolence tell us about today\u2019s America? These programs are permanent and will undoubtedly expand in scope and bureaucracy regardless of which party controls the White House.\n\nFood service workers are already complaining about budget-busting paperwork regarding menus, portion size, and salt content, while trying to follow detailed rules on sanitation, total calories and the origins of foods. I predict that dietary fashion and medical issues will soon infuse these programs. We will have kosher food, halal food, vegan/vegetarian food and food to combat real and imagined allergies. Receiving free government food is being mainstreamed as a right no different from \u201cfree\u201d fire and police protection.\n\nRelated: Free Food at Walmart\u2014Debit Card Glitch Empties Shelves\n\nMeals are given as a legal right and as such far different from a parent\u2019s power to withhold a Twinkie until the broccoli is gone.\n\nYet the most serious of all the damage wrought by the government-supplied meals is how they outsource family responsibility and thereby eliminate the raison d\u2019etre of the family itself. Put bluntly, Washington is forcibly unemploying parents by pushing relentlessly to extend these programs.\n\nPublic schools in Washington already offer showers, beds and dinners for children whose parents \u201cforgot\u201d to pick them up after school. Ambitious school and union leaders now talk of making schools more \u201cfamily-like,\u201d and it\u2019s only a matter of time before schools add evening meals, nighttime snacks and weekend meals. These will undoubtedly begin as emergency measures, but, rest assured, they will be expanded so as not to stigmatize recipients.\n\nI think we are quickly moving to what Charles Murray calls the \u201ccustodial state\u201d in which the jobless poor survive as if they were on government-supplied life support. That this burgeoning dependency occurs at a time of economic growth is truly remarkable. The modern state\u2019s \u201cbenevolence\u201d is breeding ingrained dependency and \u201cinfantilizing\u201d millions of Americans. The food programs do it one mouthful at a time.\n\n\n\nRobert Weissberg is professor emeritus in political science at the University of Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Everyone is aware of SNAP (food stamps), the mother of all food handouts, where over 4", "title": "How Our Sprawling Nanny State Is Putting Parents Out of Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/11/18/How-Our-Sprawling-Nanny-State-Putting-Parents-Out-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062012_Food_Stamps_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/11/18/How-Our-Sprawling-Nanny-State-Putting-Parents-Out-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062012_Food_Stamps_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Everyone is aware of SNAP (food stamps), the mother of all food handouts, where over 4", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "We will have kosher food, halal food, vegan/vegetarian food and food to combat real and imagined allergies.\nBy 2012, there were 18.7 million free lunches, 68.2 percent of all school lunches.\nBut awareness of the sprawling array of other government food programs is another eye opener.\nWIC, for example, the Women, Infants and Children Food and Nutrition Service, started small in 1968 to help poor and undernourished mothers-to-be.\nThe spread of free school lunches\u2014and now free breakfasts-- is another story."}
