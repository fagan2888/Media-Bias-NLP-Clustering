A teenage girl recovering from a bone marrow transplant gets to break her long-stay in isolation at the AFC Championship game Sunday, thanks to a man who couldn’t make the game.

“I thought, I bet there is someone on this planet who needs the tickets more than I do,” said the man, who wants to remain anonymous.

The donor once belonged to a health club that supported Brent’s Place in Aurora, which provides living accommodations for pediatric patients and their families following bone marrow transplants. So he called to offer the tickets to a family that really loved the Broncos.

Immediately, the staff thought of Amanda, a 15-year-old Wellington girl who’s been in isolation since her transplant six months ago.

Once Amanda’s doctor have her the medical good-to-go, Brent’s Place arranged for her to meet the donor.

“She’s a huge fan,” family services manager Allen Browning said. “She came down with her toenails painted blue and orange, wearing her Broncos hat and jersey.”

Community engagement manager Rachel Wool said the teen was just thrilled by the gift — once she opened the envelope and confirmed the two tickets were real.

“No one is a bigger fan,” Wool said. “She’s been through so much. For six months, she and her mom have been away from everyone.”

The donor came away beaming.

“They think they’re so lucky. But I really feel like I’m the lucky one,” he said. “I feel so grateful that I was able to meet her. She’s got to be an incredibly strong person, and it’s a good chance for her to get outside. I was so happy it almost made me cry.”
