DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Austin Dillon once stood in victory lane at Daytona International Speedway celebrating a Dale Earnhardt win with his grandfather and wondering if he would ever make it back to commemorate his own achievement.

Richard Childress assured his grandson, “You’ll have the opportunity one day, and you’ll make it.”

Dillon proved his grandfather correct Saturday night by winning the Xfinity Series race at Daytona for Richard Childress Racing.

“It’s Daytona, man, I have so many family memories here and have been to a lot of victory lanes with RCR and a lot of crazy events have happened here,” Dillon said. “I’m just happy for my grandfather.”

Childress won 34 races at Daytona with Earnhardt, and Dillon admitted he wasn’t sure if he should believe his grandfather’s projection for his own future.

“When you are that young, you are just proud to be part of something like this,” he said.

Dillon won by avoiding a late accident, and then holding off the competition on a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish. He said it was his favorite win of his career.

Brian Scott dominated the race and led 84 of the 104 laps, but with four scheduled laps remaining, he tried to shoot up the track to block Elliott Sadler. Scott was never clear of Sadler and he ran into him, triggering a 12-car crash.
