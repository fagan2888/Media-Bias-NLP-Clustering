Researchers Kenneth A. Frank, Chandra Muller, and Anna S. Mueller found that classes have a tremendous impact on high-school students\u2019 social lives\u2014for better and for worse.\n\nI wanted friends in my classes for a whole variety of reasons. I wanted people to share notes and study with; people to poke me when I started to drift off during an especially dry lecture; people to gossip with about the cute guys in the row ahead of us. I also knew that the more classes I had with my friends, the more likely we were to stay friends. You don\u2019t have much control over your own time when you\u2019re in high school, so if you\u2019re not in class with your friends, it\u2019s becomes easy to go days without really seeing them.\n\nEvery year in late August, an envelope arrived from school with a document that would determine my fate for the next nine months: my schedule. I\u2019d scan the page to see if I\u2019d gotten any especially hard or mean teachers. I\u2019d check out when my free periods were. And then I\u2019d dash to the phone to call my friends to find out what their schedules looked like.\n\nThe study analyzed survey data from 3,000 students at 78 schools across the United States and found that classes have a greater impact on friendship formation than sports or other after-school activities.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is in the play,\u201d said Frank. \u201cThere are lots of kids who are not in an extracurricular activity. But every kid, every day, is in class for at least five hours\u2014in most cases six or seven.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that friendships tend to form in smaller, more unusual classes: in Latin class or band, for example, rather than gym or a geometry course that all students are required to take. Students enroll in these electives because of they\u2019re interested in the subject, which gives them common ground with the other students in the class.\n\n\u201cAt that point, we\u2019ve got kind of a little group, a little niche in the school,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a set of unusual common interests, so those are very potent potential friends.\u201d\n\nThe power of classes to influence friendships has enormous potential for good. Friendships formed in class can offer a refuge from the relentless status-jockeying that characterizes teenage social life: The study found that these friendships tend to have less rigid hierarchies than friendships formed in other ways. These friendships also can help students do better in school. Friends in the same classes are more likely to study together and encourage one another when tackling challenging material. This effect can be particularly useful in encouraging girls to pursue advanced math classes. The same researchers previously found that girls were more likely to pursue challenging math classes if girls in their other shared classes were currently taking high levels of math.\n\nBut it has a dark side too, of course. By high school, students are more likely to be placed in classes by ability. Students with good grades and high test scores get assigned AP and honors classes, while struggling students are stuck in regular or remedial courses. Because of the way friendship formation works, there\u2019s potential for teen social life to mirror and even exacerbate the achievement gap within a school. High-achievers hang out with other high-achievers and push each other to even higher achievement. Meanwhile, the struggling students cluster together, possibly compounding each others\u2019 weaker performance.\n\nAwareness, according to Frank, is the key to mitigating the negative effects of courses\u2019 impact on friendship\u2014and to encouraging the positive. Parents need to know that when their children are picking their classes, they\u2019re also picking their friends.\n\n\u201cThese friends are going to help you get through school, help you get jobs,\u201d said Frank.\n\nSchools themselves also need to be mindful of the power they have to shape students\u2019 social lives.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not just assigning kids to academic experiences\u2014they\u2019re assigning them to social experiences,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThey need to be very thoughtful about the social implications.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "High-schoolers&#39; social lives are profoundly shaped by the courses they take\u2014for better and for worse.", "author": "Eleanor Barkhorn", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "High-schoolers&#39; social lives are profoundly shaped by the courses they take\u2014for better and for worse.", "title": "Friendship Starts in Latin Class", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/Barkhorn_friendship_post-1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/friendship-starts-in-latin-class/281659/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5b0\"", "article_summary": "Schools themselves also need to be mindful of the power they have to shape students\u2019 social lives.\nI also knew that the more classes I had with my friends, the more likely we were to stay friends.\nBy high school, students are more likely to be placed in classes by ability.\nResearchers Kenneth A.
