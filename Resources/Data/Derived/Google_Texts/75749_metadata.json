(AP) - As the leader of a breast-feeding support group, Kathleen Raymond never tries to push new mothers in a certain direction.\n\nRaymond, 38, of Fairfield, sees herself as an educator or a guide through what can be a challenging process for many women.\n\n\u201cWhen we meet a woman, we don\u2019t have any specific goals in mind for her,\u201d said Raymond who, until recently, led a La Leche League group in Danbury and is starting a new chapter in Fairfield. \u201cWe want to know what her goals are, and the best way for her to meet them.\u201d\n\nWhen a new mom is learning to breast-feed, getting information and support is essential, Raymond said. And, a lot of times, women can\u2019t get that kind of support from their mothers or other female role models, she said, since they most likely raised their children in a culture where breast-feeding wasn\u2019t the norm.\n\nBut mother-to-mother support groups such as La Leche are becoming more common - and the rise of technology has made it easier for new moms to find a group that\u2019s right for them.\n\n\u201cI do see more women able to get support,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really helped more women to be successful at breast-feeding.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s burgeoning network of mother-to-mother support is a key contributor to the rising rate of breast-feeding in Connecticut, experts say.\n\nAccording to the 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 83.3 percent of babies born in Connecticut start their lives being breast-fed. Connecticut\u2019s rate exceeded the national average of 79.2 percent of babies \u201cever breast-fed.\u201d\n\nThe number of Connecticut babies \u201cever breast-fed\u201d has increased by 12.3 percent over the past five years, according to CDC data.\n\nHowever, many advocates and experts said too many women still stop breast-feeding too soon.\n\nThe 2014 report card ranks Connecticut higher than the national average for babies still being breast-fed at 6 months (51.4 percent versus 49.4 percent) and for 6-month-old babies nourished exclusively with breast milk (19.2 percent versus 18.8 percent).\n\n\u201cThe data is positive and is the result of the work of many programs,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Marinelli, a neonatologist and member of the Human Milk Research Center at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n\nExperts consider breast-feeding the best source of infant nutrition and immunologic protection. Breast-fed babies are less likely to become overweight and obese, while formula feeding is associated with increases in common childhood infections, such as diarrhea and ear infections. Formula-fed babies face higher risks for major chronic diseases and conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, asthma and obesity.\n\nBreast-feeding helps mothers and babies bond, and lowers the mother\u2019s risk of postpartum depression.\n\n\u201cWe know there is a strong connection between breast-feeding and lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer,\u201d said Michele Griswold, chairwoman of the Connecticut Breast-feeding Coalition. \u201cBreast-feeding is not just a children\u2019s issue. Breast-feeding is good for the mother\u2019s long-term health as well.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the money savings, too. Families can spend $1,200 to $1,500 on infant formula in the first year alone, according to the surgeon general\u2019s report.\n\n\u201c(Breast milk) is species-specific,\u201d said Michele Romano, registered nurse lactation consultant at Greenwich Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s human milk, made for your baby, and you don\u2019t have to purchase a product from a shelf.\u201d\n\nAnother major factor helping Connecticut boost its number of breast-fed babies is the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. Established by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is a global program that recognizes hospitals that realign care to promote breast-feeding.\n\nConnecticut ranks second in the nation for births at baby-friendly hospitals, Griswold said. In 2012, 31.1 percent of births in Connecticut occurred in baby-friendly hospitals, according to the state Department of Public Health. Nationally, the rate of baby-friendly hospital births is much lower \u2014 only 9.5 percent, Marinelli said.\n\nHartford Hospital earned its designation as Connecticut\u2019s first baby-friendly hospital in 2000. Since then, seven more hospitals and birthing centers, including St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Bridgeport and Griffin Hospital in Derby, joined the list.\n\nSt. Vincent\u2019s received the designation in 2010, said Caren Chiarelli, clinical nurse leader at St. Vincent\u2019s Family Birthing Center. She said the program is multi-faceted, encouraging skin-to-skin contact between mother and child and educating mothers about all their options when it comes to feeding their babies.\n\n\u201cIf she chooses not to breast-feed, that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s all about education,\u201d Chiarelli said. \u201cWe go through the whole education process with the mother before the baby is even born.\u201d\n\nAt Griffin Hospital, which has been baby-friendly since 2012, lactation consultant Michele McGuire said breast-feeding rates at the hospital have increased significantly since it became part of the initiative. Like Chiarelli, McGuire said the program\u2019s goal isn\u2019t to push moms into breast-feeding, but to arm them with information.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to help our patients who desire to breast-feed to be more successful at it,\u201d she said.\n\nNot all hospitals seek the designation.\n\nDanbury Hospital has \u201cvery high breast-feeding initiation rates,\u201d standards established by the World Health Organization and The Joint Commission Prenatal Core Measure Set for breast-feeding.\n\n\u201cAlthough we promote breast-feeding, and work hard to meet the goals and desires of women who wish to exclusively breast-feed, we felt it more important to support all mothers and fathers in their choice regarding how they wish to feed their infants,\u201d said Maryalice Cullen, director of patient care services, at Danbury Hospital.\n\nGreenwich Hospital also doesn\u2019t have a baby-friendly designation, and Romano agreed that doesn\u2019t mean the hospital is any less committed to supporting new mothers. Romano is also coordinator of Tender Beginnings, Greenwich\u2019s parent education program. The program offers a variety of services, including breast-feeding education classes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a mother-friendly hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cWe support the mother\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nConnecticut also outpaces many states in its ratio of professional lactation specialists, the 2014 CDC report card indicates.\n\nIn addition, two laws in Connecticut support breast-feeding. The first protects a mother\u2019s right to nurse in places of public accommodation, known as the \u201cbreast-feeding in public law,\u201d passed in 1997. The second, which took effect in 2001, mandates all Connecticut employers to allow a mother to \u201cexpress breast milk or breast-feed on site at her workplace during her meal or break period.\u201d\n\nAt least one lactation consultant also credited more support on the national level with encouraging more Connecticut moms to breast-feed. Under the Affordable Care Act, lactation services are fully covered, said Stephanie Cleary, an international board-certified lactation consultant in private practice in Greenwich. That makes a huge difference, she said.\n\n\u201cThe government is saying \u2018This is important. This is worth it,\u2019\u201d said Cleary, who serves clients in Greenwich, Stamford and other surrounding towns.\n\nBut, while more babies born in Connecticut are getting breast milk initially, the number of newborns receiving formula before they are two days old is also increasing, the CDC report shows. In five years, the rate swelled from 18.4 percent to 25.6 percent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a scary number \u2014 worries a lot of us,\u201d Marinelli said. \u201cWhat that means is babies are being supplemented with formula in the hospital. A lot of the time, mothers may not even know their babies got formula. A quarter of the babies whose mothers want to breast-feed them are still getting some sort of formula supplementation in the first two days of life.\u201d\n\nMarinelli said the uptick in newborns receiving formula before two days of age is an indication that some of Connecticut\u2019s 28 birthing centers are still not supporting mothers well enough to help them succeed at breast-feeding.\n\nStatistics also show three months after giving birth, more than half of breast-feeding mothers in Connecticut start using formula. By six months postpartum, nearly half give up on breast-feeding.\n\nGriswold added that one concern not highlighted by the CDC statistics is the disparity in breast-feeding rates by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Low-income and minority populations continue to face unique barriers to breast-feeding, she said.\n\nMarla Petrocelli, a board certified lactation consultant and leader of the Bridgeport La Leche League of Connecticut, said women with access to the state-sponsored supplemental nutrition plan for women, infants and children \u2014 also known as WIC \u2014 become dependent on the formula given out.\n\nThough breast-feeding is on the rise, it still isn\u2019t recognized as the norm for many. Stumbling blocks \u2014 from engorgement to embarrassment to societal and family pressures \u2014 hinder mothers from nursing their babies long-term. And breast-feeding isn\u2019t always easy. Techniques often need to be taught.\n\nThe top reason why women give up on breast-feeding or start supplementing with formula is going back to work, Griswold said.\n\nPetrocelli stressed that the breast-feeding doesn\u2019t have to stop once mothers go back to work\n\nThe most important thing is for new mothers to stay informed, either by attending free meetings at local groups like La Leche league, asking their pediatrician for resources or even looking online, Petrocelli said.\n\nRaymond echoed Petrocelli\u2019s thoughts. She said groups such as La Leche are essential in giving mothers the right tools to breast feed successfully.\n\n\u201cI think what we continue to do at La Leche League to just get the information out there,\u201d Raymond said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the leader of a breast-feeding support group, Kathleen Raymond never tries to push new mothers in a certain direction.", "Author": "AMANDA CUDA and MARIE K.
