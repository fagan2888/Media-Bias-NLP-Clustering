After spending Friday enjoying his 35th high school reunion at Thomas More Prep-Marian, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, M.D., was up early Saturday morning to join a town hall meeting with state representative Sue Boldra, R-Hays.

Colyer is a Hays native and a 1978 TMP graduate. He’s brought along his wife Ruth, and his parents, who now live in Kansas City, to enjoy the homecoming activities.

Colyer, a practicing physician who specializes in plastic surgery, was in Washington, D.C. earlier this week testifying about the challenges of implementing the Affordable Care Act at the state level.

“Although there are some positives,” Colyer told Hays residents gathered at the Rose Garden restaurant, “it’s not good for our citizens and it’s a big drag on businesses.”

“Forty-six percent of small business owners recently surveyed say they will not hire any new people because of ACA requirements,” said Colyer.

Colyer shared stories about how implementation of the so-called Obamacare has effected his own medical practice.

“We don’t control our own insurance rates any more. Kansans will face higher premiums to help subsidize states like California, New York and Massachusetts, ” he said.
