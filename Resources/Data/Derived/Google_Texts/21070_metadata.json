Henry Horton opened with prayer, followed by the pledges to the U. S. and Texas flags. Our guest, Pastor Stephan Broden from Fair Park Bible Fellowship Church in Dallas, Texas, is a businessman, political commentator, former professor and an activist for pro-life causes. He is a speaker for the Tea Party movement and advocates for a return to what he considers proper Constitutional principles in government and the Judeo-Christian values that he claims undergird the founding of the United States of America.\n\nPastor Broden gave an awesome presentation titled, \u201cThe Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrate\u201d, or \u201cWhat to do when the Federal government exceeds its Constitutional Limits.\u201d His presentation was filled with quotes from our founding fathers as well as the founders of communism to illustrate the chasm that exists between where we started and where are today.\n\nHe began by stating that we are going through a rapid change in our country that we must address. We should not be \u201cPC\u201d (politically correct), but rather \u201cBC\u201d (Biblically correct). If it does not line up with the Bible, it is not correct. Biblical correctness is a true guide for Constitutional Correctness. What was right is now wrong and what was wrong is now right, and we have experienced an incremental implementation of godless philosophy.\n\nOur morality has turned on its heels. We are in an \u201cism\u201d world: Socialism, Darwinism, Secularism and Communism. Joseph Stalin stated, \u201cIf we can undermine these three areas; Patriotism, morality and spiritual life, America will collapse within.\u201d It seems as if we are there. Pastor Broden gave disturbing information on abortion, which has from its inception by Margaret Sanger, targeted the black community. He listed the following unconstitutional decisions by the Supreme Court of the US (SCOTUS) as examples:\n\n1962 banning of prayer in schools; 1973 legalization of abortion; 2003 overturning of sodomy laws; 2014 ratifying obamacare; 2015 overturning US and state DOMA laws, legalizing same sex marriage.\n\nWe have allowed the government to break our Texas Constitution. For example, Governor Greg Abbott has said that SCOTUS is established law. However, the Constitution says that the Supreme Court interprets law, not make it. We need to hold Governor Abbott responsible for enforcing our DOMA law in Texas. Nullification is the Constitutional provision for not accepting federal overreach. Current examples of other states actions in defending their 10th Amendment rights are: Tennessee is aiming to nullify the same sex marriage ruling; Colorado has effectively nullified laws against illegal marijuana.\n\nPastor Broden has attempted to talk to our top elected officials and been stone-walled, so he has started a petition to show that the citizens of Texas want action. The petition can be accessed at ProtectLifeandMarriageTX.org\n\nFor additional quotes from Pastor Broden\u2019s presentation access our website, freestonecountyteaparty.org.\n\nAnn Gokey closed the meeting in prayer. Our May 16th meeting will show the movie, \u201cAgenda 2, Masters of Deceit.\u201d This movie is a \u201cmust see\u201d. God Bless America!
