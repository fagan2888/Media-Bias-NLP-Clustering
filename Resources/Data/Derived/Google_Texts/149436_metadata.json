Antibiotics do not change the course of the viral infection and antibiotics have potential risks,\" he said.\n\nDoctors and nurses also monitor the use and prescription of antibiotics, and also help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention track resistant bacteria cases, according to the article.\n\nSuch stewardship programs help raise awareness and foster proper handling and prescribing of antibiotics, according to a Harvard Gazette article about a panel on drug-resistant bacteria at the Forum at Harvard School of Public Health. Panelists suggested hospitals become involved in enhanced monitoring for drug-resistant infections in the community, as well as educating consumers about the dangers of drug resistance.\n\nThese measures follow the release of a 2013 CDC report, which noted that more than 2 million people get sick each year as a result of drug-resistant infections and roughly 23,000 people a year die from the illnesses. The report identified three urgent drug-resistant organism threats: Clostridium difficile, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and carbapenum-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nThe CDC recommended the healthcare industry fight antibiotic drug resistance by:\n\nOffering immunizations, infection control, screening, treatment, and education to prevent infections from occurring and prevent resistant bacteria from spreading;\n\nTracking resistant bacteria;\n\nImproving the use of antibiotics; and\n\nPromoting the development of new antibiotics and new diagnostic tests for resistant bacteria.\n\nEven the U.S. government is working to combat drug-resistant infections, according to UPI.com. Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the authority will support the development of Carbavance, an agent that can treat illnesses resisted to antibiotics, such as complicated urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nAlthough there is a decline in inappropriate use of antibiotics to treat acute respiratory tract infections in many outpatient settings, the number of adults still receiving those antibiotics in emergency departments is high, according to a study abstract published by the American Society for Microbiology, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the OKCFox.com article\n\n- check out the Harvard Gazette piece\n\n- read the UPI.com article\n\n- here's the CDC report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: ER shows no improvement in inappropriate antibiotic use for adults\n\nMedicare Part D coverage linked to increased use of antibiotics\n\n10 ways to eliminate wasteful medical tests and procedures\n\nUMMC saves $3M by monitoring unnecessary meds\n\nFewer tests, less antibiotics improve primary care", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals around the country are trying to reduce antibiotic resistance and stave off\u00a0drug-resistant superbugs\u00a0in patients through\u00a0antibiotic stewardship programs\u00a0and community education.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals around the country are trying to reduce antibiotic resistance and stave off\u00a0drug-resistant superbugs\u00a0in patients through\u00a0antibiotic stewardship programs\u00a0and community education.", "title": "Hospitals fight antibiotic resistance, superbugs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-fight-antibiotic-resistance-superbugs/2014-02-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "antibiotic stewardship programs,Care Delivery,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,drug-resistant infections,drug-resistant superbugs,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals around the country are trying to reduce antibiotic resistance and stave off drug-resistant superbugs in patients through antibiotic stewardship programs and community education.\nPanelists suggested hospitals become involved in enhanced monitoring for drug-resistant infections in the community, as well as educating consumers about the dangers of drug resistance.\nEven the U.S. government is working to combat drug-resistant infections, according to UPI.com.\nAntibiotics do not change the course of the viral infection and antibiotics have potential risks,\" he said.\nThese measures follow the release of a 2013 CDC report, which noted that more than 2 million people get sick each year as a result of drug-resistant infections and roughly 23,000 people a year die from the illnesses."}
