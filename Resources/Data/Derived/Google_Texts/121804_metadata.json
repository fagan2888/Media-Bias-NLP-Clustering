Being a new defense secretary in a new administration has its advantages over finishing Mr. Hagel\u2019s two years with a White House guard that did not like the current secretary\u2019s internal criticism of Syrian policy.\n\n\u201cWe are better served with her at the start of an administration,\u201d a military officer at the Pentagon said.\n\nMs. Flournoy and fellow Democratic Party loyalist Kurt Campbell rolled out their think tank in 2007. Who was there prominently to deliver the keynote address: Sen. Clinton, who went on to become secretary of state.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and Michelle Flournoy have spent a lot of time together in the White House Situation Room,\u201d said P.J. Crowley, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokesman at the State Department. \u201cThey know each other well and share a mutual admiration. Given her strategic mind, I believe she would be an outstanding secretary of defense.\u201d\n\nMs. Flournoy is back at the Center for a New American Security as its chief executive officer.\n\nShe initially returned to the center from the Pentagon in February 2012 as a member of the board of directors. That May, the center issued a tough-talking paper on the drawbacks of Mr. Obama\u2019s defense budget \u2014 a plan she helped write on the inside.\n\nMs. Flournoy had a more direct role in another study that took apart Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. Hagel\u2019s four-year military plans. The panel said Mr. Obama should retract the overriding theme that reduced the military\u2019s global capacity from being able to defeat two enemies nearly simultaneously to defeating one and denying the objectives of a second.\n\n\u201cThe international security environment has deteriorated since then,\u201d the report said in July. \u201cIn the current threat environment, America could plausibly be called upon to deter or fight in any number of regions in overlapping time frames.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speculation inside the Pentagon is that Michele Flournoy is waiting for a chance at the job from a President Hillary Rodham Clinton, with whom she has close ties.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Speculation inside the Pentagon is that Michele Flournoy is waiting for a chance at the job from a President Hillary Rodham Clinton, with whom she has close ties.", "title": "Michele Flournoy forgoes defense secretary bid, may wait for President Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/26/passing-muster-in-presidents-obamas-protective-inn/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/07/02/20090701-184024-pic-4750871.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/07/02/20090701-184024-pic-4750871.jpg", "description": "Speculation inside the Pentagon is that Michele Flournoy is waiting for a chance at the job from a President Hillary Rodham Clinton, with whom she has close ties.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Michele Flournoy forgoes defense secretary bid, may wait for President"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Michele Flournoy, Pentagon, Chuck Hagel, Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cd2\"", "article_summary": "Passing muster in President\u2019s Obama\u2019s protective inner circle could have been daunting for Michele Flournoy, whose ranking as defense secretary front-runner collapsed in 24 hours.\nMs. Flournoy let it be known soon after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced his resignation Monday that she did not want to be considered as his successor.\nMs. Flournoy had a more direct role in another study that took apart Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. Hagel\u2019s four-year military plans.\nThat May, the center issued a tough-talking paper on the drawbacks of Mr. Obama\u2019s defense budget \u2014 a plan she helped write on the inside.\n\u201cHillary Clinton and Michelle Flournoy have spent a lot of time together in the White House Situation Room,\u201d said P.J."}
