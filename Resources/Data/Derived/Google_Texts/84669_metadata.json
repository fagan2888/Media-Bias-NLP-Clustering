Once the divination is complete, the pundit goes on television or writes a newspaper column and informs America of how they feel.\n\nThere are masters of this craft, like Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, whose connection with \u201cAmerica\u201d is so finely tuned that she can sense the minutest vibrations in public sentiment and interpret them for her audience. When news broke that a man in Texas had been diagnosed with Ebola, Peggy Noonan opened her mind to the country and sensed what they were feeling. With the IRS scandal and the Secret Service failures, Noonan discovered, America just wasn\u2019t ready to trust the government when it said the Ebola situation was under control:\n\nEbola will not, all agreed, produce a full-fledged American epidemic. \u201cWe are stopping it in its tracks in this country,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. That may be true. But nobody thinks it because government doctors and professionals said it. Americans do not have confidence in what The Officials tell them anymore.\n\nThe skeptics among you might be quick to point out that Peggy Noonan, as a Republican and a conservative, is herself mistrustful of the Obama administration, so when she claims to be speaking for \u201cAmericans,\u201d couldn\u2019t it be that she\u2019s simply projecting her own opinions onto the American public writ large?\n\nWell, to all you logic-bound naysayers out there, if Noonan is wrong, then how do you explain the fact that so many other pundits arrived at the same exact conclusion?\n\nLike NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough:\n\nRight now, a lot of Americans are seeing what happened in Dallas and looking at your laundry list, what happened with the secret service, what happened with the IRS, what happened with the VA, what happened with ISIS being a JV team. So when anybody, any member of the government says, \u201cHey, just relax, everything\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Americans don\u2019t believe that.\n\nAnd National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier:\n\nTrust. There\u2019s that word again. How much faith can the public summon toward an administration that used incompetence as a defense in scandals involving the IRS, Benghazi, and Obamacare; that lied about its surveillance of Americans; and that just recently acknowledged dangerous misjudgments regarding the Secret Service and ISIS?\n\nAnd Fox News\u2019 Gretchen Carlson:\n\nWhat more and more people seem to be asking about Ebola now isn\u2019t that they are necessarily scared about actually getting the disease, but that they\u2019re scared the government agencies responsible with helping us if we do get sick might not be up to the task. So if Ebola becomes a bigger issue, the question still remains: will we be safe?\n\nIs it just a coincidence that all these seasoned observers of public opinion came up with the same argument for why the American people obviously don\u2019t trust the government to stop the spread of Ebola? I mean, when four pundits are in such close agreement on an issue, it feels stupid to even question the truth of it.\n\nBut, in the spirit of science, we\u2019ll put it to the test. Four pundits, all claiming that the IRS scandal and Benghazi and Obamacare and whatever have eroded public faith in \u201cthe government\u201d so much that they just can\u2019t bring themselves to trust public health officials when they say that Ebola is under control. Let\u2019s go to the public opinion polls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What happens when your Hot Take has no evidence to back it up?
