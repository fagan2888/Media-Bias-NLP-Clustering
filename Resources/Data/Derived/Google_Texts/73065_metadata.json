He had an MRI in New York on Tuesday.\n\nYankees manager Joe Girardi admitted he\u2019s concerned about Tanaka\u2019s prognosis.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always worried when you have a guy go back for an elbow MRI,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a big loss. Anytime you lose a starting pitcher, they\u2019re hard to replace. And what he\u2019s done for us, the innings and the wins and the quality of starts, it\u2019s hard to replace.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees, who have also lost pitchers CC Sabathia, Michael Pineda and Ivan Nova to injuries, are 45-44 and trail first-place Baltimore by four games in the AL East entering Wednesday.\n\nTanaka allowed five runs and 10 hits \u2014 both career highs \u2014 in 6 2-3 innings in a 5-3 loss to the Indians on Tuesday night. The All-Star is 12-4 with a 2.51 ERA in 18 starts, but has lost three of his past four outings.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying how important he\u2019s been for us,\u201d Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said. \u201cHe\u2019s been our go-to guy.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees signed Tanaka, 25, to a seven-year contract in January after he had a standout career in Japan.\n\nTanaka began the season 11-1 with a 1.99 ERA, but hasn\u2019t been as effective in his past four starts, going 1-3 with a 4.25 ERA.\n\nHe\u2019s allowed eight home runs in his past five starts, including two on Tuesday, a two-run shot in the sixth to Nick Swisher that put Cleveland ahead and a solo blast by Michael Brantley in the seventh.\n\nGirardi didn\u2019t notice any sign that something was bothering Tanaka during the game.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything that led us to believe there was anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told the trainers that he just felt some soreness so we felt it was best to send him back and have an MRI. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s complained (of it).\u201d\n\nGirardi said Christopher Ahmad, the team\u2019s head physician, is in Seattle for a conference and hasn\u2019t seen the pitcher.\n\nTanaka\u2019s past two starts came on four days\u2019 rest, the regular amount for major league pitchers. He pitched once a week in Japan.\n\nTanaka has anchored a shaky Yankees rotation. Sabathia may need season-ending knee surgery, and Nova had Tommy John surgery and won\u2019t pitch again until next season.\n\nThe Yankees are 13-5 in games Tanaka has started. He has recorded 135 strikeouts and walked 19 in 129 1-3 innings. Tanaka has allowed 111 hits and opponents are batting .231 against him. He has given up 15 home runs.\n\n\u201cYou just hope and pray that we get good news and it\u2019s something minor,\u201d outfielder Brett Gardner said. \u201cI worry about anybody, but he\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nTanaka was scheduled to start Sunday against Baltimore, the final game before the All-Star break. Girardi said no decision has been made on who will take Tanaka\u2019s spot.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Yankees\u2019 Masahiro Tanaka on DL with elbow inflammation", "title": "Yankees\u2019 Masahiro Tanaka on DL with elbow inflammation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/09/yankees-masahiro-tanaka-on-dl-with-elbow-inflammation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140709_032705_tanaka.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140709_032705_tanaka.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-09T15:20:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:38:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf33c\"", "article_summary": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The New York Yankees\u2019 battered rotation may have suffered the most crucial loss of all.\nRookie sensation Masahiro Tanaka, who leads the majors with 12 wins, has been placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow inflammation.\nTanaka allowed five runs and 10 hits \u2014 both career highs \u2014 in 6 2-3 innings in a 5-3 loss to the Indians on Tuesday night.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been our go-to guy.\u201dThe Yankees signed Tanaka, 25, to a seven-year contract in January after he had a standout career in Japan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always worried when you have a guy go back for an elbow MRI,\u201d he said."}
