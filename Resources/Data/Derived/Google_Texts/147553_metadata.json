That Section prohibits employers from interfering with the exercise of employees\u2019 rights to organize under Section 7 of the NLRA.\n\nThe Advice Memorandum, which addresses U.S. Security Associates, Inc.\u2019s Personal Blogging and Social Networking Policy, was issued back in 2012, but only recently became publicly available. The Memorandum includes the following findings regarding the at-issue policy:\n\nThe provision requiring that employees that have identified their employer in a social media post also include a disclaimer stating that the post is the employee\u2019s only, and does \u201cnot necessarily reflect the views of [the] employer,\u201d was lawful. The Memorandum explains that the employer \u201chas a legitimate interest in protecting itself against unauthorized postings purportedly on its behalf,\u201d and the requirement \u201cwould not unduly burden employees in the exercise of their Section 7 right to discuss working conditions.\u201d\n\nThe provision prohibiting employees from disclosing \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d information about the employer was unlawful. The Memorandum noted that reading that provision together with the employer\u2019s definition of personnel records and other employee information as \u201cconfidential\u201d rendered the provision unlawfully overbroad. As the Memorandum explained, the broad language of the provision could be interpreted as unlawfully restricting the discussion of information concerning working conditions with co-workers and/or outside parties, such as labor organizers.\n\nThe provision requiring that employees obtain written approval before posting a link to the employer\u2019s website was unlawful. According to the Memorandum, employees subject to this provision \u201cwill be hindered in exercising their [section] 7 rights if, when discussing their work-related concerns and complaints on social media, they cannot refer third parties to the [e]mployer\u2019s website to support, and garner support for, their position.\u201d And, any work rule that requires employees to secure permission from their employer to engage in Section 7 activities is unlawful.\n\nThe provision prohibiting employee posts that are \u201cembarrassing to another person, the [e]mployer, or customers\u201d was unlawful because \u201c[e]mployees would reasonably construe this rule to bar them from discussing work-related complaints, particularly those involving their managers.\u201d As the Memorandum noted, such a provision is similar to those the NLRB previously has found unlawful because they prohibited negative conversations about co-workers or managers or derogatory attacks on co-workers.\n\nFor similar reasons\u2014that it would reasonably be construed by employees as prohibiting discussion of working conditions and sharing information with co-workers about the terms and conditions of employment\u2014the provision prohibiting employees from posting material on social media that \u201cviolates the privacy of another\u201d was unlawful.\n\nThe provision mandating that employees express themselves on social media in a \u201crespectful manner\u201d was lawful where, in the context of the employer\u2019s other policies defining \u201cbeing respectful\u201d in a specific manner, it would not be construed as curbing employee activity associated with the exercise of Section 7 rights.\n\nAs the Memorandum makes clear, employers have to carefully craft their employee social media policies to avoid NLRB scrutiny. Employers are advised to carefully review and analyze this Memorandum, and consult with their counsel, when implementing an employee social media policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recently released Advice Memorandum, the NLRB Office of the General Counsel provided some further guidance on how provisions of an employee social media policy could run afoul of Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "In a recently released&amp;nbsp;Advice Memorandum, the NLRB Office of the General Counsel provided some further guidance on how provisions of an employee social media policy could run afoul of Section 8(a", "title": "Newly Released NLRB Advice Memorandum Finds Several Provisions of Employer\u2019s Social Media Policy Unlawful", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/newly-released-nlrb-advice-memorandum-finds-several-provisions-employer-s-social-med", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1131/Social%20Media%20Circular%20Icons_0.jpg?itok=AlbtRY2M", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Technology, Social Media, NLRB, Labor, Employment, Advice Memorandum, Unlawful, Overbroad, Confidential, Sensitive, Disclaimer, Written Approval, Working Conditions, Policy", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Technology, Social Media, NLRB, Labor, Employment, Advice Memorandum, Unlawful, Overbroad, Confidential, Sensitive, Disclaimer, Written Approval, Working Conditions, Policy"}, "article_summary": "As the Memorandum makes clear, employers have to carefully craft their employee social media policies to avoid NLRB scrutiny.\nEmployers are advised to carefully review and analyze this Memorandum, and consult with their counsel, when implementing an employee social media policy.\nFriday, December 5, 2014In a recently released Advice Memorandum, the NLRB Office of the General Counsel provided some further guidance on how provisions of an employee social media policy could run afoul of Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA.\nThe provision requiring that employees obtain written approval before posting a link to the employer\u2019s website was unlawful.\nThat Section prohibits employers from interfering with the exercise of employees\u2019 rights to organize under Section 7 of the NLRA."}
