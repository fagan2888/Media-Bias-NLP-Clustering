We heard the message you sent in November \u2014 loud and clear. And now we\u2019re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cWe see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they\u2019ll be able to leave to their children. Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can achieve if we work together. Let\u2019s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let\u2019s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages, and jobs right here, at home. Let\u2019s simplify America\u2019s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let\u2019s iron out loopholes to lower rates \u2014 and create jobs, not pay for more government spending. The President has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We\u2019re calling on him now to cooperate to pass them.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cWe've been reminded of terrorism\u2019s reach both at home and abroad; most recently in France and Nigeria, but also in places like Canada and Australia. Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief. ... The forces of violence and oppression don\u2019t care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cCongress is back to work on your behalf, ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again. We know America faces big challenges. But history has shown there\u2019s nothing our nation, and our people, can\u2019t accomplish.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
