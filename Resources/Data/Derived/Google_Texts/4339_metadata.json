So barring any changes to the ACA, the city will begin paying a 40-percent tax on every dollar of premiums exceeding those thresholds, beginning in 2018.\n\nEarly projections peg the cost at around $700,000, according to Finance Director Steve Hubka, although city officials believe that the provision may be repealed or the thresholds adjusted upward.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether some of the city\u2019s health insurance plans will be taxed, he said.\n\nOmaha\u2019s finance director, Stephen Curtiss, said city officials are still analyzing whether its plans will trigger the tax and haven\u2019t come to any conclusions yet. The state of Nebraska isn\u2019t sure yet, either.\n\nWhile much of the focus on the Cadillac tax has been on the impact on private employers, public institutions such as cities, states, and schools will pay the piper in huge numbers.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is expected to generate $80 billion over 10 years and could translate into $76 billion in local taxes over that decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPublic plans are generally quite bountiful\u2014with taxpayers picking up much of the tab\u2014the result of years of negotiations by unions. Last year, government plans cost nearly 18 percent more than non-public plans, and public employees paid 45 percent less than non-public employees, according to a survey by United Benefit Advisors.\n\nCities and states faced with the tax may reduce employees\u2019 benefits, pass the cost of the tax onto taxpayers, or try to get their employees to pick up more of the costs, with higher deductibles and co-pays. Indeed, Hubka said some of Lincoln\u2019s plans have already changed, saving money, during recent labor negotiations, and more changes will likely be on the table in upcoming negotiations.\n\nBut Nebraska cities are constrained by state law in what they can do to change benefits, because public employees\u2019 health care contributions must be comparable to an array of other cities. The Nebraska Supreme Court has said cities cannot change benefit levels (such as co-pays and deductibles) outside negotiations with unions.\n\n\u201cSo we have limitations on what we can do to control our costs of the benefits provided and thus our ability to avoid the excise tax as the law is now written,\u201d Hubka said.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A so-called Cadillac tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act could cost Lincoln taxpayers about $700,000 annually.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A so-called Cadillac tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act could cost Lincoln taxpayers about $700,000 annually.", "title": "Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax' Could Cost Taxpayers in One City $700K a Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cadilllac-tax-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Le0BVZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A so-called Cadillac tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act could cost Lincoln taxpayers about $700,000 annually.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cadilllac-tax-.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax' Could Cost Taxpayers in One City $700K a Year", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-16T17:58:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cadillac tax,obamacare,nebraska"}, "article_summary": "A so-called Cadillac tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act could cost Lincoln taxpayers about $700,000 annually.\nPublic plans are generally quite bountiful\u2014with taxpayers picking up much of the tab\u2014the result of years of negotiations by unions.\nLast year, government plans cost nearly 18 percent more than non-public plans, and public employees paid 45 percent less than non-public employees, according to a survey by United Benefit Advisors.\nObamacare defines \u201ctoo generous\u201d as any health insurance plan with premiums over $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families.\nBut Nebraska cities are constrained by state law in what they can do to change benefits, because public employees\u2019 health care contributions must be comparable to an array of other cities."}
