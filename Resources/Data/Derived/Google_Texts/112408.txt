Whether you’re an avid boater or simply enjoy sailing a few weekends a year, purchasing a home in one of the country’s top regions for boaters might be for you.



The Miami area was chosen as the best boating spot by real estate website Redfin, which this week put out a list of the 10 best cities for those with a passion for boats. Colder cities like Minneapolis and Providence, Rhode Island, also made the cut.

An estimated 89 million Americans go boating each year, according to Discover Boating, a trade association website. Although the boating season is a lot shorter in Minneapolis than in Florida, the percentage of people who own a boat in Minnesota - not called the land of a thousand lakes for nothing - is three times that of Florida.

One of the most important things to consider when purchasing a waterfront home is the cost of real estate. The median sale price in these areas ranges from $260,000 in Tampa to $639,000 in Long Island, but there are other factors to take into account as well.

Look closely at the cost of purchasing a boat, maintaining it and storing it. Keep in mind, too, that even if you don’t own a boat, you can always join a boat club and simply pay a monthly fee.

“There are a few things to keep in mind before buying a waterfront home,” said Cyndy Stewart, a Redfin real estate agent in Austin, another city that made the list, in the report. “Most properties will require flood insurance, which increases overall monthly costs.”

She noted that if you want to build a private dock, you’ll need a permit. You should also research how much the water ebbs and flows. “If the water level has been declining due to the drought and overuse, your home might not be on the waterfront in 10 years,” Stewart added.
