CLEVELAND - Ohio state and local lawmakers didn't have much guidance to give their constituents Tuesday when asked about the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.

"In the short run, there's been a lot of confusion in terms of rollout of the program," said Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald encouraged county residents to call the Department of Job and Family Services for any questions regarding the federal government's program.

The first phase of Obamacare is set to be available to the public Tuesday, Oct. 1. That's when the program's health insurance marketplace will go live. Individuals can then shop for health insurance, much like they shop for hotels and airfare on the web. They can compare plans, costs and buy the type of insurance they need.

"Our health department will take the lead," said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson when asked about how Cleveland residents can get answers about the new program. But Jackson admitted that the city's health department will likely pass people with Obamacare questions off onto a local health care agency.

Without satisfactory answers from the city or county, NewsChannel5 asked Ohio Gov. John Kasich how his office is helping residents. His response:

"They can call over to the Department of Insurance and get their questions answered," Kasich said.
