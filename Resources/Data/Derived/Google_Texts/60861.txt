Crystal Collins lost her cousin to suicide last year.

"It changes your life. You kind of have to figure out how to live after that," said Crystal Collins, Organizer.

Collins loss sparked her to organize the first 'out of the darkness' community walk at McKenzie Park in Panama City Saturday morning.

The walk was sponsored by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

A group hoping to shed light on a problem that devastates thousands each year.

The event brought more than 50 people.

Some were there to remember a loved one, others like turquoise trotter was there to remind everyone you can overcome this.

"Only way that we can live, if we tell the truth," said Turquoise Trotter, Panama City Resident and finally she did something about it this year.

"Once I started to tell the truth, that's when I really noticed changes started to happen."

According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the suicide rate among U.S. military members rose in 2012, with an average of one suicide per day.

A person dies by suicide every 13.7 minutes, claiming more than 38,000 lives each year.

"If they are not recognizing their need for help. or willing to help, we can help family and friends know what to do," said Linda Janosik, Life Management Center of Northwest Florida.
