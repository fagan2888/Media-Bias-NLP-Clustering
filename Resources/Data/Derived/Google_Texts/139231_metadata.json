And that limit, the poll reveals, may be far less than the amount of money required to make those programs happen.\n\nThe new poll was conducted by the research firm Morning Consult and the online news publication Vox.com and was published on the Vox site Thursday. The poll shows that about two of every three Sanders supporters are not willing to pay significantly more in taxes to cover the broad new policy changes in his \u201crevolution,\u201d taxes that Sanders himself says will be essential to his new programs.\n\nMost Bernie Sanders supporters aren\u2019t willing to pay for his revolution \u2013 Vox https://t.co/FduagiRX0g \u2014 Geoffrey Peterson (@GeoffDPeterson) April 15, 2016\n\nRead the Vox.com report on the new poll at this link.\n\nSanders proposes a system of \u201csingle payer\u201d health insurance, a system in which all health insurance claims are handled by a single government agency, not by private insurance companies.\n\n\u201cAll you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card,\u201d says the Sanders campaign website, describing his \u201cMedicare For All\u201d proposal. \u201cBernie\u2019s plan means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.\u201d\n\nThe results of the new poll appear in line with an Associated Press poll taken in February that showed 39 percent of all Americans are in favor of a single-payer plan in principle, but only 28 percent favor single-payer if the plan meant they had to pay any new taxes at all.\n\nSanders also says that his plan would save the average middle-class family $5,000 per year in health costs and would save businesses $9,400 per employee on average.\n\nBernie Sanders has said that taxes will need to be raised on all Americans to pay for his single-payer plan and other policy proposals, although he says that most of those increases would be borne by the highest earners, as he explained to CNN interviewer Chris Cuomo in the following video interview.\n\nBut the new poll found that among respondents who identified themselves as Bernie Sanders supporters, 34 percent \u2014 approximately one out of three \u2014 said they would not be willing to shell out more than $500 per year in new taxes to pay for the single payer system.\n\nAnd two out of three Bernie Sanders supporters, 66 percent, said they are not willing to pay more than $1,000 per year in new taxes to bring about universal health coverage. In fact, 9 percent of Sanders supporters, almost one of every 10, said they are not willing to pay anything at all in new taxes to make the Bernie Sanders universal health coverage plan a reality.\n\nBut according to Sanders\u2019 own estimate, the single-payer health care system would require $1.38 trillion per year in new government spending. An independent estimate put the cost up to $1.1 trillion higher than Sanders\u2019 own estimate, or nearly $2.5 trillion per year.\n\nSanders plans to raise taxes on every income-earning American by 2.2 percent. He says that hike would raise taxes on a family of four earning $50,000 by $466 in the current year, including the standard deduction available to all taxpayers, according to claims made on his website.\n\nHis plan would also raise earnings taxes on employers by 6.2 percent, taxes that would drive down employee wages because companies would inevitably pass the new cost on to their employees, according to a report by the independent Tax Policy Center.\n\nSanders would also raise marginal tax rates for earners bringing in at least $250,000 per year.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sanders\u2019 opponent in the Democratic race says she wants to build on the current Affordable Care Act to move toward universal coverage. But Clinton has not proposed a sweeping, single-payer plan, instead proposing a series of modifications to the ACA, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d which she says would expand coverage and bring down insurance premiums.\n\nMORE INQUISITR BERNIE SANDERS COVERAGE:\n\nWho Will Win New York Primary?

Among Clinton supporters, 67 percent are unwilling to pay more than $1,000 in new taxes for single-payer health coverage.\n\nOn the question of free college tuition, the results of the Vox/Morning Consult poll were similar. Among Bernie Sanders supporters, 64 percent were unwilling to pay more than $1,000 per year in new taxes to fund that element of his \u201crevolution,\u201d with 14 percent \u2014 one of every seven \u2014 saying they wanted to pay nothing at all for free college tuition.\n\n[Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even Bernie Sanders supporters fail to support his \"political revolution\" if it means that they must pay more in taxes to make it happen, a new study shows.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Even Bernie Sanders supporters fail to support his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d if it means that they must pay more in taxes to make it happen, a new study shows.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Supporters Poll: Revolution Support Drops As Taxes Rise, Many Sanders Voters Unwilling To Pay", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2999011/bernie-sanders-supporters/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-Sanders-Supporters-Revolution-Taxes-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-15T15:14:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T16:28:20+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-Sanders-Supporters-Revolution-Taxes-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-04-15T15:14:10+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bernie sanders supporters,2016 presidential election,bernie sanders,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-Sanders-Supporters-Revolution-Taxes-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Even Bernie Sanders supporters fail to support his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d if it means that they must pay more in taxes to make it happen, a new study shows."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Among Clinton supporters, 67 percent are unwilling to pay more than $1,000 in new taxes for single-payer health coverage.\nMost Bernie Sanders supporters aren\u2019t willing to pay for his revolution \u2013 Vox https://t.co/FduagiRX0g \u2014 Geoffrey Peterson (@GeoffDPeterson) April 15, 2016Read the Vox.com report on the new poll at this link.\nBut according to Sanders\u2019 own estimate, the single-payer health care system would require $1.38 trillion per year in new government spending.\nMORE INQUISITR BERNIE SANDERS COVERAGE:Who Will Win New York Primary?\nPolls Show Bernie Sanders Lags Behind ClintonBernie Bomb!"}
