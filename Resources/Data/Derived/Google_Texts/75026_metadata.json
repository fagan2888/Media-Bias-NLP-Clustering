The U.S. Justice Department announced a civil rights investigation on Dec. 8, and Democratic Rep. La Shawn Ford has filed a bill in the Illinois legislature that would allow a mayoral recall election.\n\nClearly, the mayor\u2019s dismissal of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy on Dec. 1 did not quell the outrage.\n\nLaquan McDonald was fatally shot with 16 bullets recorded on a police dashcam video that city officials kept under wraps for more than a year before a judge ordered its release last month. Anyone tempted to dismiss the ongoing protests as \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d agitprop should take a few minutes to watch it on YouTube.\n\nPolice had arrived in response to a report that a man was breaking into vehicles and had a knife. At some point, Laquan used a knife to puncture a patrol car\u2019s tire. As he walked away, another police car pulled up, and out jumped Officer Jason van Dyke, who six seconds later fired the first of two shots that took Laquan down. Then, as indicated by puffs of smoke in the cold air, he fired 14 more shots into Laquan as he lay in the street. PCP, a drug that causes erratic behavior, was detected in Laquan\u2019s bloodstream.\n\nOn Nov. 24, 13 months after the shooting, prosecutors, who had received the video within a day, charged Officer van Dyke, who had been on paid desk duty, with first-degree murder. Six official murder counts were filed last Wednesday.\n\nFacing a sea of outrage, Mayor Emanuel canceled plans to attend the climate change summit in Paris and instead spent time in the South Side of Chicago, trying to calm the storm, which has even had an economic impact. Fearful that protests would turn violent, Christmas shoppers have been avoiding the downtown, reportedly costing Magnificent Mile merchants 50 percent of expected receipts.\n\nAt a ceremony Wednesday in which he gave a speech on behalf of My Brother\u2019s Keeper, a program endorsed by President Obama that aims to keep young black men out of trouble, Mr. Emanuel was treated to protesters\u2019 chants of \u201c16 shots!\u201d\n\nSome critics contend the video was suppressed until after Mr. Emanuel was safely re-elected in an April run-off. Whatever, the fact that it took a year for the video to surface and for charges to be filed speaks volumes about what happens in a city controlled by a single party.\n\nChicago, which birthed Mr. Obama\u2019s community organizing and his political career, has had one-party Democratic rule for decades, along with a richly deserved reputation for graft and a corrupt voting process.\n\nMr. Emanuel, 56, epitomizes Chicago machine politics, in which rules are broken and people threatened or pampered.\n\nIn 1991, after years as a top Democratic fundraiser, he joined the presidential campaign of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, helping him compile a massive war chest that helped Clinton overcome the Gennifer Flowers \u201cbimbo eruption\u201d scandal and cruise to the nomination.\n\nAt a dinner party in Little Rock for senior staff after the election, \u201cas about a score of them sat around a picnic table mushily declaring their love for one another, Mr. Emanuel picked up a knife and called out the names of different politicians who had *expletive deleted * us.\u2019 After each name, Mr. Emanuel would cry out, \u2018Dead man!\u2019\u2014 and stab the knife into the table,\u201d according to Chicago Tribune reporter Naftali Bendavid. The \u201cvictims\u201d included Democrats who had committed the cardinal sin of supporting other candidates in the primaries.\n\nIn another well documented incident, \u201cRahmbo\u201d as he was known before his current moniker of \u201cthe Godfather,\u201d sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering results.\n\nAlthough the media dubbed him a \u201ccentrist,\u201d his voting record as an Illinois congressman from 2003 to 2008 was clearly on the far left. The American Conservative Union gave him an overall 13 out of 100 and an outright 0 rating in 2007, while the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 96 percent overall rating.\n\nThe National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and the Human Rights Campaign each gave Mr. Emanuel a 100 percent rating, while the National Right to Life Committee gave him a zero.\n\nFrom January 2009 to October 2010, as Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Mr. Emanuel operated according to his own famous admonition that, \u201cYou don\u2019t ever want a crisis to go to waste. It\u2019s an opportunity to do things that you would otherwise avoid.\u201d\n\nEver wonder why we lurch from one \u201ccrisis\u201d to another during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency? If there isn\u2019t one happening, they create it. America\u2019s \u201chealth care crisis\u201d helped force Obamacare down America\u2019s throat. Terrorist incidents have been turned into a \u201cgun crisis.\u201d At the border, where thousands of \u201cunaccompanied minors\u201d are again pouring into the country, the crisis is a direct response to the administration\u2019s dangling the magnet of amnesty.\n\nAs the author of various crises, Mr. Emanuel is up to his ears in one that may be his undoing. Or maybe he\u2019ll magically use it to his advantage. He\u2019s good at this sort of thing.\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a Washington Times contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Clintons and their cronies have an amazing track record for surviving scandal, but it's being tested mightily in Chicago.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Clintons and their cronies have an amazing track record for surviving scandal, but it\u2019s being tested mightily in Chicago.", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Rahm Emanuel facing insurrection in Chicago", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/20/robert-knight-rahm-emanuel-facing-insurrection-in-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/12202015_b3-knight8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/12202015_b3-knight8201.jpg", "description": "The Clintons and their cronies have an amazing track record for surviving scandal, but it's being tested mightily in Chicago.", "card": "summary", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Rahm Emanuel facing insurrection in Chicago"}, "Author": "Robert Knight", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Rahm Emanuel"}, "article_summary": "As the author of various crises, Mr. Emanuel is up to his ears in one that may be his undoing.\nMr. Emanuel, 56, epitomizes Chicago machine politics, in which rules are broken and people threatened or pampered.\nThe National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and the Human Rights Campaign each gave Mr. Emanuel a 100 percent rating, while the National Right to Life Committee gave him a zero.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel, a longtime Clinton ally, is facing an insurrection over his handling of a white police officer\u2019s shooting of a 17-year-old black youth on Oct. 20, 2014.\nIt\u2019s an opportunity to do things that you would otherwise avoid.\u201dEver wonder why we lurch from one \u201ccrisis\u201d to another during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency?"}
