His wife could see it, too.\n\n\"She realized somewhere there was something ... I was lacking confidence,\" he said. \"It's just who I am.\"\n\nBruno Ammann checks the balance wheel of a pocket watch in the workshop at his home in Lyons. Last year, (Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nHe fondly recalled times spent with his father, tinkering with various \"basket cases\" of unique and vintage timepieces.\n\nAnd that's when Ammann added a \"semi\" to his retired state.\n\nThe longtime watch repairman added a 300-square-foot, Rolex-approved professional workshop to his house in Lyons and quietly resumed business.\n\nOn a recent weekday, Ammann was beaming as he stood in the home-based workshop that was filled with a combination of his father's old workbenches and tools, new cabinets and equipment and a calming soundtrack of ticks and tocks.\n\nHe's come full circle, in a way.\n\nAmmann remembered when he was a boy and popping into the garage as his father meticulously worked on a watch. The 11-year-old Ammann, intrigued by the precision and the mechanisms, developed a fascination that would never falter.\n\n\"It feels like I'm that kid again,\" he said.\n\nThe home-based workshop allows Ammann to feed that passion at a calmer pace than the six-day-a-week retail world would afford. Here, he can pop in after an excursion, crank up the opera music and solve problem watches.\n\nThe commute isn't too shabby, either.\n\n\"I don't need a lot of business, just enough to keep me here 20 to 25 hours a week,\" he said.\n\nWhile Ammann hopes to keep his work part-time and a one-man operation contacted only via phone and his watchbruno@msn.com email, it hasn't taken long for the word of mouth to spread.\n\nIn addition to retaining a couple of accounts from upstate New York, several of Swiss Chalet's longtime locals brought their business and that of others to Ammann.\n\nIt was a coworker of David Hixson's who pointed the Longmont resident in Ammann's direction. Hixson's gold-cased Hamilton pocket watch \u2014 a railroad-grade timepiece passed down from his grandfather \u2014 had landed in a state of disrepair.\n\nHixson, 49, who before was hesitant to place the family heirloom into just any pair of hands, spoke highly of how Ammann quickly diagnosed the problems, provided some details about the history of similar pocket watches and brought the piece back to life.\n\nTo have the memento in working order was touching, Hixson said, noting the inscription on the back of the watch.\n\nCarved on the back were Howard William Bergner's initials. Resting above the \"W\" was an \"A\" for Bergner's wife, Anabel.\n\n\"It's just kind of cool to think about the people and history,\" Hixson said.\n\nAlicia Wallace: 303-473-1332, wallacea@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/dc_alicia", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26840370/winding-back-up-swiss-chalet-watch-repairman-resumes", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace \n  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26840370:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-02T11:30:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Last year, Bruno Ammann wound down the operations of Swiss Chalet Timepieces, a watch repair shop his father opened 41 years earlier in downtown Boulder.", "title": "Winding back up: Swiss Chalet watch repairman resumes work in Lyons", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26840370/winding-back-up-swiss-chalet-watch-repairman-resumes", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__03DCAWATw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2014-11-03T10:50:28-0700", "endDate": "2024-10-31T18:32:16-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia WallaceCamera", "pubDate": "2014-11-01T18:46:03-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-02T11:30:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Winding back up: Swiss Chalet watch repairman resumes work in Lyons", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__03DCAWATw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Last year, Bruno Ammann wound down the operations of Swiss Chalet Timepieces, a watch repair shop his father opened 41 years earlier in downtown Boulder.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26840370/winding-back-up-swiss-chalet-watch-repairman-resumes", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Last year, Bruno Ammann wound down the operations of Swiss Chalet Timepieces, a watch repair shop his father opened 41 years earlier in downtown Boulder.", "title": "Winding back up: Swiss Chalet watch repairman resumes work in Lyons"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__03DCAWATw~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e34\"", "article_summary": "Hixson's gold-cased Hamilton pocket watch \u2014 a railroad-grade timepiece passed down from his grandfather \u2014 had landed in a state of disrepair.\nBruno Ammann checks the balance wheel of a pocket watch in the workshop at his home in Lyons.\nLYONS \u2014 Last year, Bruno Ammann wound down the operations of Swiss Chalet Timepieces, a watch repair shop his father opened 41 years earlier in downtown Boulder.\nThe longtime watch repairman added a 300-square-foot, Rolex-approved professional workshop to his house in Lyons and quietly resumed business.\nAmmann remembered when he was a boy and popping into the garage as his father meticulously worked on a watch."}
