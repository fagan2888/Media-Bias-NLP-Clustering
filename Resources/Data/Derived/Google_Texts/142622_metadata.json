One of the major companies planning to work in the region is Encana, which is aiming to drill 45 to 50 exploratory wells, spokesperson Doug Hock told the Durango Herald. He added that company plus WPX Energy and Logos Resources plan to invest heavily over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe key, those who want to curtail the gas rush say, is to step carefully so as to avoid decimating or damaging sacred sites, or impeding the view of the starry night skies for which Chaco is famous.\n\nRELATED: Video: Summer Solstice Ushered in at Ancient Sites\n\nRead the Durango Herald\u2019s report Wells Creep Toward Chaco: Advocates Fight for Better Planning Near Ancient Sites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The renowned Native astronomical and sacred site of Chaco Canyon and its environs may be in danger from encroaching fracking wells, environmental groups fear.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/14/fracking-operations-creep-ever-closer-ancient-astronomical-wonder-chaco-canyon-157354", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/06/LO-RES-AST-Photo-Chaco-Canyon-and-Sun.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Fracking Operations Creep Ever Closer to Ancient Astronomical Wonder Chaco Canyon"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-14T15:30-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/14/fracking-operations-creep-ever-closer-ancient-astronomical-wonder-chaco-canyon-157354", "dc": {"title": "Fracking Operations Creep Ever Closer to Ancient Astronomical Wonder Chaco Canyon"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Fracking Operations Creep Ever Closer to Ancient Astronomical Wonder Chaco Canyon"}, "article_summary": "The renowned Native astronomical and sacred site of Chaco Canyon and its environs may be in danger from encroaching fracking wells, environmental groups fear.\nRELATED: Video: Summer Solstice Ushered in at Ancient SitesRead the Durango Herald\u2019s report Wells Creep Toward Chaco: Advocates Fight for Better Planning Near Ancient Sites.\nOne of the major companies planning to work in the region is Encana, which is aiming to drill 45 to 50 exploratory wells, spokesperson Doug Hock told the Durango Herald.\n\u201cThey are not thinking about the spirituality of those lands,\u201d said Jemez Pueblo governor Joshua Madalena to the Durango Herald in New Mexico, referring to the companies that are conducting hydraulic fracturing in the area.\nHe added that company plus WPX Energy and Logos Resources plan to invest heavily over the next 12 to 18 months."}
