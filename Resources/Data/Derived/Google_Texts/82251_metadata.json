One, believed to have been carved in the mid-sixth century BC, proclaimed: \u201cNikasitimos was here mounting Timiona (\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f36\u03c6\u03b5 \u03a4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1). \u201cWe know that in ancient Greece sexual desire between men was not a taboo,\u201d added Dr. [Andreas] Vlachopoulos, who returned to the far-flung island last week to resume work with a team of topographers, photographers, conservationists and students. \u201cBut this graffiti \u2026 is not just among the earliest ever discovered. By using the verb in the past continuous [tense], it clearly says that these two men were making love over a long period of time, emphasizing the sexual act in a way that is highly unusual in erotic artwork. \u201d \u2026Two penises engraved into limestone beneath the name of Dion, and dating to the fifth century BC, were also discovered at lower heights of the cape. \u201cThey would seem to allude to similar behaviour on the part of Dion,\u201d said Vlachopoulos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The inscription documents an ongoing sexual relationship between two men in ancient Greece", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The inscription documents an ongoing sexual relationship between two men in ancient Greece", "title": "Archaeologist uncovers the world\u2019s earliest erotic graffiti", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/archaeologist_uncovers_the_worlds_earliest_erotic_graffiti/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_657298361.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The inscription documents an ongoing sexual relationship between two men in ancient Greece", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_657298361.jpg", "title": "Archaeologist uncovers the world\u2019s earliest erotic graffiti", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Archaeologist uncovers the world\u2019s earliest erotic graffiti", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ancient Greece, Archaeology, homosexuality, ruins, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde84c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Ancient Greece, Archaeology, homosexuality, ruins, Sex, Innovation News, Life NewsEtchings inscribed in the ruins of an ancient Greek city may the earliest on record to \u201ctriumphantly\u201d document a sexual relationship, the Guardian reports.\n\u201cBut this graffiti \u2026 is not just among the earliest ever discovered.\n\u201cThey would seem to allude to similar behaviour on the part of Dion,\u201d said Vlachopoulos.\nDiscovered on the Greek island of Astypalaia, researchers say the graffiti can provide new insights into both the sexual lives and impressive literacy of the island\u2019s inhabitants at a time predating even the construction of the Acropolis in Athens.\nOne, believed to have been carved in the mid-sixth century BC, proclaimed: \u201cNikasitimos was here mounting Timiona (\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f36\u03c6\u03b5 \u03a4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1)."}
