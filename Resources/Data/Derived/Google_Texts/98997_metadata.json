He didn\u2019t call it that \u2014 he called it the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan \u2014 but the broad outlines of his proposal look awfully familiar.\n\nThe plan included a mandate that employers provide coverage to all full-time employees. It would have created a federal program called Assisted Health Insurance to provide coverage to everyone not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or an employer plan. And it would have included a panel of physicians that would control medical costs by \u201creducing needless hospitalization.\u201d\n\nThe leading Republicans on the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees supported Nixon\u2019s 1974 plan, which the New York Times said was \u201cvastly more liberal than the one he introduced in 1971\u201d that would have provided less comprehensive indigent care. Congress failed to act on the 1974 proposal \u2014 not because of Watergate but because the House Ways and Means Committee could not settle on one of three competing versions of the plan.\n\nNixon did, however, sign a long list of other progressive legislation, including the laws that created the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He expanded the reach of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He put two justices on the Supreme Court who would later vote with the majority on Roe v. Wade.\n\nEvan Thomas, a former reporter and editor at Newsweek, has written books about Bobby Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower and Teddy Roosevelt. His latest, the biography \u201cBeing Nixon: A Man Divided,\u201d is just out in paperback. Thomas sat down with Salon to talk about Nixon in the 1960s and whether he would recognize the Republican Party of 2016. (Short answer: No.)\n\nHow factional was the Republican primary in 1960?\n\nThe primaries barely existed in 1960, and Nixon was essentially the designated heir that year.\n\nBack then a candidate only entered the primary in a handful of states, right?\n\nThat\u2019s right. Kennedy only entered the primaries in five or six states. Until 1968, the bosses ran the show. After 1968 blew up in Chicago, the parties gave up some of that control.\n\nWhat was the demographic profile of Republican voters in 1960?\n\nIn 1960, there were Main Street Republicans like Bob Dole. There were Northeast moderate to liberal Republicans who were conservative on fiscal issues but liberal on social issues like John Lindsay and Bill Scranton. And that was basically it.\n\nThe John Birch Society types were still Democrats at that time.\n\nThe far right was such a small group. It mushroomed by 1964 with Barry Goldwater, but it was much smaller in 1960. Nixon hated the Birchers; they were way too far to the right for him.\n\nThe election in 1960 was very close, so Richard Nixon winning that year would not necessarily have represented a conservative mandate.\n\nNo. Nixon was a populist and played to people\u2019s fears, and he could sound conservative when he tried to appeal to southern Democrats. But he was more often moderate in the tradition of Northeast moderates and believed the government had some responsibilities. If you look at his first term as president after the 1968 election, he signed a lot of legislation. Part of that was Democrats on Capitol Hill, but he believed that government had to govern. He passed as much social welfare legislation as Lyndon Johnson. He would get drummed out of the party today as a liberal.\n\nSo would Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnd so would Reagan. The Republican Party have gone far to the right.\n\nBetween the 1960 election and the 1964 election, you have the Kennedy assassination, the March on Washington, and the police actions in Birmingham. Did those things provoke conservatives toward Barry Goldwater?\n\nThe anger on the right was always puzzling to East Coast establishment people like my parents. Where is the anger coming from? I think it came from where populism always comes from. When parts of the country feel disaffected and left behind and feel like the liberal elites are in charge, it makes many people angry. There was a feeling of gradual government creep from the New Deal through World War II, through the Eisenhower years, and through Kennedy. When the cities and the campuses started blowing up, conservatives really got angry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to \"Being Nixon: A Man Divided\" author Evan Thomas about Donald Trump, populism and bipartisan drinking", "title": "Richard Nixon would be \u201cdrummed out\u201d of GOP today as a liberal: \u201cHe passed as much social welfare legislation as Lyndon Johnson\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to \"Being Nixon: A Man Divided\" author Evan Thomas about Donald Trump, populism and bipartisan drinking", "title": "Richard Nixon would be \u201cdrummed out\u201d of GOP today as a liberal: \u201cHe passed as much social welfare legislation as Lyndon Johnson\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/04/richard_nixon_would_be_drummed_out_of_gop_today_as_a_liberal_he_passed_as_much_social_welfare_legislation_as_lyndon_johnson/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump_nixon4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to \"Being Nixon: A Man Divided\" author Evan Thomas about Donald Trump, populism and bipartisan drinking", "title": "Richard Nixon would be \u201cdrummed out\u201d of GOP today as a liberal: \u201cHe passed as much social welfare legislation as Lyndon Johnson\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump_nixon4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Porch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Books, Donald Trump, evan thomas, Politics, Richard Nixon", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, Books, Donald Trump, evan thomas, Politics, Richard Nixon, Elections News, Entertainment News, Politics NewsIn February 1974, months before he resigned from office amid the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon proposed Obamacare.\nThe election in 1960 was very close, so Richard Nixon winning that year would not necessarily have represented a conservative mandate.\nBetween the 1960 election and the 1964 election, you have the Kennedy assassination, the March on Washington, and the police actions in Birmingham.\nThere were Northeast moderate to liberal Republicans who were conservative on fiscal issues but liberal on social issues like John Lindsay and Bill Scranton.\nThomas sat down with Salon to talk about Nixon in the 1960s and whether he would recognize the Republican Party of 2016."}
