Deasy didn\u2019t just step on toes, he stomped on them.\n\nAnd some of those toes needed a good stomping starting with the UTLA, United Teachers Los Angeles, the union that represents the district\u2019s 26,000 K-12 instructors, the single biggest obstacle to reform in a district desperate for reform.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to Deasy\u2019s many failures in a second, but first his triumphs.\n\nUnder John Deasy graduation rates are up, and up significantly.\n\nDropout rates have plunged. Standardized test scores are up as well as English language proficiency.\n\nDeasy had the guts to take on the institutional stasis at LAUSD that accepted failure and mediocrity as long as the checks cleared. He fired incompetent teachers. He pushed hard for a teacher evaluation system open to the public and he touched the third rail of public education, teacher tenure. John Deasy actively campaigned (and lost) for LAUSD school board members who would support his program of reforms. Is it any surprise the long knives came out?\n\nJohn Deasy not only got in people\u2019s faces, he seemed to relish doing so. That was a big mistake. Maybe in New York or Philadelphia you can stab people in the front, but in Los Angeles we still prefer the phony civility of kiss, kiss, \u201clet\u2019s do lunch\u201d followed by a quiet, fatal knife in the back.\n\nDeasy finally met his match in a school board empowered by union money and a new UTLA boss, Alex Caputo-Pearl whose raison d\u2019etre was Deasy\u2019s head on a platter.\n\nThe simple truth is a lot of folks just don\u2019t like John Deasy and, frankly, he\u2019s an easy guy not to like.\n\nEven Deasy\u2019s supporters acknowledge he can be prickly, humorless, stubborn and thin-skinned. To be superintendent of LAUSD, you need rhino-like hide.\n\nIt\u2019s more than ironic that the man whose signature initiative, the distribution of 600,000-plus iPads and laptop computers to every student in the LAUSD system should ultimately be taken down by a computer glitch.\n\nThe much-ballyhooed MiSiS program (My Integrated Student Information System) rivals the HealthCare.gov rollout for Obamacare for IT \u201chall of shame\u201d honors. Thousands of Jefferson High School students are still wandering around campus without scheduled classes resulting in a blistering condemnation from Judge George Hernandez who said, \u201cThere is no evidence of any organized effort to help those students.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there is the iPad issue itself.\n\nThe seeds of the iPad debacle were planted in Sacramento when the state Legislature decided to mandate all standardized tests in California be available only in digital format. This places low-income kids at a huge disadvantage. If you\u2019ve never used a computer or tablet, the SATs aren\u2019t the time to learn.\n\nOf course, everyone knows how to use a pencil, but there\u2019s no money to be made from the pencil lobby. Enter Apple and Pearson.\n\nDeasy spearheaded the push to spend a billion dollars of construction bond money to purchase 600,000-plus iPads with special \u201ceducational\u201d software created by Pearson. Despite objections from nearly every quarter, Deasy bulldozed this through, playing the social justice and civil rights card and brushing off questions about his connections to Apple and his former top assistant\u2019s past employment with a division of software developer, Pearson.\n\nAdd to this the in-classroom breakfast program disaster, the national scandal of Miramonte Elementary School and multiple other sexual abuse allegations and the normal broken bones and hurt feelings that come with trying to administer a system with 655,494 students speaking 93 different languages spread across 1,124 schools with a $6.78 billion budget and every conceivable social vice and virtue walking through the door.\n\nSo the LAUSD is done with Deasy and now we go back to the past with Ramon C. Cortines, his third bite at the apple.\n\nFormer UTLA President A.J. Duffy described Cortines as \u201cthe only one in the city with the ability and background to take up the post where everyone will support him.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s true, it\u2019s a sad commentary on Los Angeles. The fate of our schools rests in the hands of 82-year-old Ramon Cortines?\n\nDoug McIntyre\u2019s column appears Sunday and Wednesday.
