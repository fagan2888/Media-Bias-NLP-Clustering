The other is to play a different game entirely, focusing on facts, policies, and the duties of executive leadership, rather than a cult of personality. By acting more presidential than Trump, GOP hopefuls have a chance to angle the whole contest back toward substance and away from antics.\n\n\n\nTo an extent, this shift was visible in both of the Thursday debates (even the one in the afternoon not featuring Trump on stage), where candidates put policy first--with a little bit of personality thrown in. After all, at this point (more than a year to go before the election), name-recognition is the leading factor driving poll numbers, so candidates can hardly be expected not to make any play for bombast and self-promotion.\n\n\n\nThe most notable exception was healthcare, where Republicans to a name pronounced the doom of Obamacare upon their first days in office, should any of them be elected. This might qualify as substantive policy prescriptions, were it actually supported by the alternative legislation Republicans claim they will invoke as part of their \"repeal and replace\" approach to Obama's signature law.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nInstead, as hospitals and clinics across the country grapple with the twin challenges of implementing electronic healthcare records and ICD-10, the new language of medical claims, they must also do their best to accommodate the demands of the Affordable Care Act while hedging against it all being for nothing once a Republican president enters office and declares the whole law null and void.\n\n\n\nAll evidence suggests that, along with across the board negation of the ACA , Republicans plan to replace the law with something entirely new, yet strikingly similar, retaining the more popular, less-controversial features of Obamacare like prohibiting denial of coverage for preexisting conditions, allowing dependents up to age 25 to stay on their parents' plans, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 | 2", "article_metadata": {"description": "Article: How Trump Saved Democracy - Is it possible that Trump's antics will actually push American politics back toward reason by candidates looking to seem reasonable by contrast?", "og": {"site_name": "OpEdNews", "description": "Is it possible that Trump's antics will actually push American politics back toward reason by candidates looking to seem reasonable by contrast?", "title": "How Trump Saved Democracy", "url": "http://www.opednews.com/articles/How-Trump-Saved-Democracy-by-Edgar-Wilson-Cult_Debate_Democracy_Healthcare-150812-574.html", "image": "http://www.opednews.com/populum/uploadnic/trump_2016-png_501405_20150812-828.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.opednews.com/populum/uploadnic/trump_2016-png_501405_20150812-828.png", "title": "How Trump Saved Democracy", "description": "Is it possible that Trump's antics will actually push American politics back toward reason by candidates looking to seem reasonable by contrast?", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}, "alexaVerifyID": "eJle_K-GHlRlbmiTJcbI1Q4RnRg", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "keywords": "Cult,Debate,Democracy,Healthcare,Obamacare,Politics,President,Republican"}, "article_summary": "By acting more presidential than Trump, GOP hopefuls have a chance to angle the whole contest back toward substance and away from antics.\nThere are two possible approaches to dealing with a candidate like Trump: one is to play his game, and ride the celebrity train throughout the primary process.\nThe other is to play a different game entirely, focusing on facts, policies, and the duties of executive leadership, rather than a cult of personality.\nTo an extent, this shift was visible in both of the Thursday debates (even the one in the afternoon not featuring Trump on stage), where candidates put policy first--with a little bit of personality thrown in.\nThe best possible outcome of the Republican primaries would be its transformation into a contest of ideas--policy, not personality--that produces a nominee focused on doing the work of the presidency."}
