He\u2019s the former CEO of Cloud View Technologies in Mary Esther. Now, he makes his debut in politics, wanting to represent Florida\u2019s 1st House District in Washington.\n\nThies is running as an independent and against what he considers to be out-of-control spending, along with polarization and gridlock on Capitol Hill. He contends Democrats and Republicans vote along party lines 90% of the time. As proof, he points to Obamacare and the 50-plus failed attempts to repeal it.\n\n\u201cAre we putting party lines before Americans?\u201d said Thies. \u201cI find it very, very problematic that we have to go into Congress and make symbolic gestures that mean nothing at the end of the day, and not make any sort of incremental change. Why can\u2019t we do that now?\u201d\n\nThies, whose mother came from Cuba to the U.S. in the 1960s, says when it comes to protecting U.S. borders, the existing procedures in vetting immigrants needs beefing up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s partisan politics; it really seems like it is,\u201d Thies said. \u201cThat we can\u2019t come to some sort of agreement to have some sort of structured immigration process. We definitely need a vetting process.\u201d\n\nShould Thies be elected to the House, he says he\u2019ll not make a career out of Washington, planning to sign a pledge that limits his time there. It carries the same limits, three House terms and two in the Senate, as are in a proposed amendment that\u2019s being supported by more than 30 Republicans in the two chambers.\n\nWhile he praises Cong. Jeff Miller for his work with the Veterans Administration, Thies says not only would he continue that work, but also tackle other First District issues such as jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if we have somebody in the presidency next time around who wants to do further cuts on the military?\u201d asked Thies. \u201cWhat would happen if NAS Pensacola would go away? We have tourism, we have a good military industry that brings a lot of jobs to the area, but let\u2019s attract some more jobs.\u201d\n\nThies faces a traditionally uphill fight for the House seat against an eight-term incumbent who\u2019s flush with cash. Thies concedes that Miller is a \u201cformidable opponent\u201d and that the final decision lies with the voters in the First District.\n\nThies filed his candidacy last month, has put together a campaign staff, and is preparing to hit the trail and get out his message. At this point, he\u2019s the lone challenger to Miller next year, but more are expected to enter the race. In 2014, Jeff Miller won by collecting 64% of the vote over one Democratic, and one \u2018No Party\u201d candidate.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "C ongressman Jeff Miller is getting at least one challenger for his U.S. House seat in 2016.
