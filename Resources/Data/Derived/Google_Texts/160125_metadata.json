Harry Reid\u2019s (D-NV) leadership position in the Senate\u2013Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY)\u2013would be voting against the nuclear deal with Iran. In a lengthy statement posted on Medium, the New York Democrat voiced his concerns over the weaknesses in the accountability measures of the deal and the political nature of the country, noting that it\u2019s dubious that hope and change will come to Iran any time soon. He noted that such sentiments for moderation have been present for over three decades and the only thing that\u2019s happened is that the hardline elements in the country have further tightened their grip on power.\n\nIn the House, fellow Democratic Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY), the highest-ranking Jewish Democrat in that chamber, voiced his opposition to the deal. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) also announced last Friday he would vote against the deal, and urged that we renegotiate the terms once Obama leaves office. So far, the Democrats are divided, and Obama\u2019s speech at American University on August 5 has predictably done nothing to assuage any fears his side of the aisle has on this agreement.\n\nNevertheless, Sen. Schumer is catching heat for his planned \u201cno\u201d vote, with far-left organizations, like Moveon.org and CREDO Action, saying he\u2019s \u201cunfit\u201d to lead the Democrats in the Senate, and that they should find \u201ca new leader\u201d (via the Hill):\n\nThe liberal activist group MoveOn is assailing Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) for his decision, announced late Thursday night, to oppose the nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cOur country doesn\u2019t need another Joe Lieberman in the Senate, and it certainly doesn\u2019t need him as Democratic leader,\u201d MoveOn political action executive director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement about Schumer, who is next to line to be the Senate\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cNo real Democratic leader does this,\u201d he added. \u201cIf this is what counts as \u2018leadership\u2019 among Democrats in the Senate, Senate Democrats should be prepared to find a new leader or few followers.\u201d \u201cIn response to Senator Schumer\u2019s decision to side with partisan war hawks, MoveOn.org\u2019s 8 million members are immediately launching a Democratic Party donor strike,\u201d Sheyman declared. As part of that strike, MoveOn is urging its members to withhold campaign contributions to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sheyman said. Within 72 hours after Schumer\u2019s Thursday evening announcement, the liberal group is hoping to withhold $10 million in campaign contributions.\n\nYet, the question comes about the veto portion of this battle. It\u2019s highly unlikely that Republicans will secure enough Democrat votes to override Obama\u2019s veto of their resolution to reject the agreement after the August recess.\n\n\u201cIt is less likely than not that Congress is going to override, said Rep. Sherman to the New York Times. \u201cThat happens almost never, and even less often on foreign policy,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to CNN, Republicans in the House and Senate need to poach 44 and 13 Democrats respectively to secure enough votes to override a veto. Sen. Schumer plans to vote to override the veto.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Unfit\".05/26/2016 18:01:03PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"Unfit\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Liberals Are Not Happy About Schumer's Defection On Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/09/liberals-are-not-happy-about-schumers-defection-on-iran-deal-n2036319", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/211/93a8d1a6-6f51-4879-b841-7760463e4e6f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"Unfit\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Liberals Are Not Happy About Schumer's Defection On Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/09/liberals-are-not-happy-about-schumers-defection-on-iran-deal-n2036319", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/211/93a8d1a6-6f51-4879-b841-7760463e4e6f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Liberals Are Not Happy About Schumer's Defection On Iran Deal, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo real Democratic leader does this,\u201d he added.\nSen.
