Low birth weight is a primary risk factor for infant deaths and is considered a key predictor of health and socioeconomic status throughout life and across generations.\n\nThe findings show that while low birth weight is linked to lower income and education levels in all four countries, that connection was most persistent in the US.\n\nThe research looked a low birth weights among babies born to mothers in five income groups and with varying levels of education. In the UK, Canada and Australia, disparities in birth weights were most pronounced between the highest- and lowest-income groups. But in the US, birth weights dropped consistently with income level. The findings underscore the degree to which inequity impacts health in the US, says lead author Melissa Martinson, assistant professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cWe would expect in any country that there would be health differences between the highest incomes and lowest incomes, but what\u2019s interesting in the US is how clear the distinction is for every dollar of income.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, looked at national birth weight data from maternal reports and birth certificates in the four countries, as well as maternal education and income data from longitudinal studies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the very rich and poor whose health is tied to income in the US, but infants at every step of the socioeconomic ladder.\u201d\n\nThe researchers controlled for differences in marital status, infant gender, and mothers\u2019 race and ethnicity. They found that low birth weights\u2014defined as 5.5 pounds or less\u2014 were highest overall in the UK (6.0 percent), followed by the US (5.8 percent), Canada (5.5 percent), and Australia (4.8 percent).\n\nThe data predates the Affordable Care Act, and the other three countries have more generous health care and social support systems than the US But low birth weights in the US are linked to factors beyond health insurance coverage, such as income instability, food insecurity, and residential segregation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a low-income woman and you grew up low-income and had poor nutrition and more stress, all these factors have accumulated throughout the life course to culminate in low birth weights,\u201d she says.\n\nMartinson began looking at health disparities across countries while employed as a social worker in the UK. Noting the differences in social services between England and the United States, she wondered what role those services played in health outcomes throughout life. Martinson published a paper in 2012 which found that health disparities by income were pervasive in both countries, despite England\u2019s better overall health and universal health insurance.\n\nThat prompted her to investigate whether inequities that contribute to health outcomes start at birth, and how those disparities might compare between the US and similar countries. The new study demonstrates that income and education matter more for health at birth in the US than in other countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the very rich and poor whose health is tied to income in the US, but infants at every step of the socioeconomic ladder,\u201d Martinson says.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act could help mitigate low birth weight and other poverty-related health impacts, but consistent rates of low-birth weights in the US over the past half century\u2014despite advances in reproductive technology, dramatic decreases in smoking rates, and expanded prenatal care \u2014 suggest that reversing the trend will take time.\n\n\u201cThere are many questions about how health inequities emerge over the life course,\u201d she says. \u201cThis research shows they\u2019re there at birth. Whatever health disparities a woman has as a 50-year-old, they\u2019re partially laid out for her at birth in the US, more than in these other countries.\u201d\n\nNancy Reichman, a professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at Rutgers University coauthored the study.\n\nSource: University of Washington", "article_metadata": {"description": "Low birth weight, income, and education are tied from the very beginning in the US, says Melissa Martinson. \"This research shows they're there at birth.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Futurity", "description": "Low birth weight, income, and education are tied from the very beginning in the US, says Melissa Martinson. \"This research shows they're there at birth.\"", "title": "Birth weight drops with income in U.S. - Futurity", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/USA_baby_1170.jpg", "height": 669}, "url": "http://www.futurity.org/low-birth-weight-income-1098362-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Low birth weight, income, and education are tied from the very beginning in the US, says Melissa Martinson. \"This research shows they're there at birth.\"", "creator": "@FuturityNews", "image": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/USA_baby_1170.jpg", "title": "Birth weight drops with income in U.S. - Futurity", "site": "@FuturityNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "56028DC055B0AA27F7D0287D219F4C4D", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Futurity/143906865226", "section": "Health and Medicine", "tag": "United States", "published_time": "2016-02-01T10:05:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe568e\"", "article_summary": "For a new study, researchers compared the link between income, education, and low birth weight in the United States with those in three comparable countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\nThe findings show that while low birth weight is linked to lower income and education levels in all four countries, that connection was most persistent in the US.\nThe research looked a low birth weights among babies born to mothers in five income groups and with varying levels of education.\nLow birth weight is a primary risk factor for infant deaths and is considered a key predictor of health and socioeconomic status throughout life and across generations.\nIn the UK, Canada and Australia, disparities in birth weights were most pronounced between the highest- and lowest-income groups."}
