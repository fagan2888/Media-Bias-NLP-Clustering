Ray Odierno, Cyndi Lauper \u2014 singing \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d was a little weird, but so were the commercials that bracketed the occasion: ads for scotch, beer and dating services called Asiandate.com and Anastasiadate.com.\n\nThe final episode of \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d on Thursday was a sad turning point, maybe, but it was also a happy reminder of how much of an anomaly that late-night comedy series really was: like \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d it became a vanity destination for the establishment in-crowd on Comedy Central, a cable channel that caters to the young and seemingly lonely (and thirsty).\n\nFor nine years, Stephen Colbert brilliantly kept up an unlikely, complicated and delightful imposture. He delivered wicked political satire by pretending to be a right-wing, monomaniacal cable talk show host. It was a double cross. Mr. Colbert was also a middle-aged comedian who tapped into a millennial sensibility.\n\nSo, of course, with characteristic brio and mock pomposity, Mr. Colbert stepped down as he prepares to replace David Letterman, who will leave the \u201cLate Show\u201d on CBS in 2015. (\u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d spot will be taken by \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,\u201d a onetime \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent.) Since the succession at CBS was announced, there has been much hand-wringing, not so much over Mr. Letterman\u2019s retirement as for the loss of Mr. Colbert\u2019s mock persona. People wonder how this comedian will manage once he drops his Comedy Central mask and has to be himself on the \u201cLate Show.\u201d\n\nActually, he won\u2019t have to be his real self onstage any more than Mr. Letterman or Jimmy Kimmel or Seth Meyers has to. Talk shows are acting jobs, except that the hosts play themselves rather than fictional characters. They maintain public personas that often have very little to do with the people they are privately.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Letterman, like his hero, Johnny Carson, is a notorious grump and loner once the studio lights go dark. Offstage, Jay Leno loves cars more than people. Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who crosses swords and curse words with Whoopi Goldberg on \u201cThe View,\u201d was once called the Queen of Nice on the cover of Newsweek. Viewers are not meeting the real Ellen DeGeneres when they watch her gambol with guests any more than they are seeing the real Meryl Streep when she plays Julia Child.\n\nMr. Colbert, who so brilliantly played a caricature of a Fox News talk show host, spent his last week showing that he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble dialing it back to become a charming, witty comedian with his own network talk show.\n\nHe won\u2019t change much, but his material probably will. Thursday night\u2019s episode was a valedictory showcase, but there was still plenty of time for barbed political commentary. In his segment \u201cThe Word,\u201d Mr. Colbert noted that now \u2014 as in 2005, the year his show started \u2014 people on television are defending torture, and troops are once again being sent to Iraq. The sardonic crawl accompanying his monologue read, \u201cWe\u2019ll be greeted as returners.\u201d\n\nNetwork talk show hosts also make political jokes in their opening monologues, but their jabs at Obamacare or government gridlock are small asides on platforms that thrive on common-denominator comedy and celebrity rubbernecking.\n\n\u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d like \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d was notable for using celebrity appearances to keep the political agenda aloft. Quite often, the guests weren\u2019t even famous, and Mr. Colbert interviewed scores of elected officials, journalists and scientists.\n\nAs Thursday night\u2019s ads suggested, Comedy Central\u2019s core audience is small and relatively narrow, and it\u2019s not at all surprising that Mr. Colbert was persuaded to leave it for CBS. It\u2019s more surprising that Mr. Stewart, who has hosted \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d since 1999, is staying on Comedy Central, at least for now. He made a cameo appearance on Mr. Colbert\u2019s final episode; on his own show on Thursday, he reminded viewers why they came to Comedy Central in the first place.\n\nMr. Stewart made fun of the meltdown at Sony, whose controversial comedy about North Korea, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d now shelved, appears to have inspired hackers to leak thousands of embarrassing company documents and emails.\n\nMr. Stewart chided the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, for being angry at Hollywood, saying he should love it instead because Hollywood is just like North Korea. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always telling you how great you are,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are billboards everywhere with your face on them, and no one eats.\u201d\n\nWhen he gets to CBS, Mr. Colbert is unlikely to go on those kinds of prolonged riffs about touchy political issues. On Comedy Central, there remains one established host who talks about little else. \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d is gone. And that makes \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d all the more valuable.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20141219090757, "twitter": {"description": "The final episode of \u201cThe Colbert
