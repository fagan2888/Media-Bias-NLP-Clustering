FIFA votes to keep Russia, Qatar as upcoming World Cup hosts

The FIFA executive committee voted on Friday to uphold the next two World Cup hosts' winning bids. The governing body has been criticized for its selection process that led to the choice of Russia and Qatar as host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively. A press release from FIFA said that while there were "irregularities" in the bidding process, "it is clear that (they)â€¦are not of an extent that would lead to the bidding process as a whole being qualified as significantly illegal or in contravention of the Statutes."
