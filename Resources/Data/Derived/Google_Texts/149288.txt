Aging rocker and knighted activist Sir Bob Geldof has decided that “all humans will die before 2030.”

Speaking to a group of youngsters at a summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, Geldof said while predicting the human race’s demise, “The world can decide in a fit of madness to kill itself,” Daily Star reported.

And what exactly has him convinced we are doomed? Climate change. Yes, that laughable theory that has been debunked time and again.

A Sept. 20 Forbes article exposed how “climate change alarmists” use vagaries and sleight of hand to confuse the public, saying:

“Global warming alarmists often misrepresent the peer-reviewed literature, claiming that virtually no peer-reviewed studies call the alarmist narrative into question. In order to make such a claim, they water down their narrative to the mere assertion that global temperatures have warmed during the past century, such that the Earth is no longer in the depths of the extraordinary Little Ice Age. Well heck, nobody disagrees with that. That is the equivalent of posting an opinion poll in which virtually everybody says health care is important and then twisting the poll results to claim virtually everybody favors Obamacare.”

Geldof wasn’t content with just shocking his audience. His high-browed, self-important rhetoric kept coming.

“The next war will not be a World War I or a World War II, it will be the end,” he said. “We may not get to 2030. We need to address the problem of climate change urgently.”

BBC News reported that Geldof is planning to take a commercial rocket flight into outer space in 2014. So maybe he can have a look at the Earth and see exactly what global warming looks like from outside the atmosphere. He may just see the folly of his own predictions.
