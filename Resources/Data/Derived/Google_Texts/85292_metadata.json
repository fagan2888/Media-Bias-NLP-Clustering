It was a lively but relatively brief skirmish that ended in a compromise, a deal that kept them joined at the hip for more than 12 years.\n\nBut this shotgun marriage is now officially dissolved. A recent $4.6 million stock sale closed out what could be The InterTech Group Inc.\u2019s longest disclosed investment to date in a public company.\n\nIt turned out to be a lucrative deal to boot for the North Charleston-based conglomerate, thanks to the power of outsized dividends.\n\nNo precise reason was given for the sale of the shares back to Span-America Medical Systems, which makes hospital mattress systems and other \u201cpressure management\u201d foam products designed to ease burns and other painful skin ailments.\n\n\u201cWe believe the purchase of approximately 9 percent of Span-America\u2019s stock highlights our board\u2019s confidence in our company\u2019s future,\u201d CEO Jim Ferguson said in a statement.\n\nFerguson didn\u2019t shed much more light on the all-cash repurchase Tuesday, when he briefly discussed it during a quarterly conference call with investors.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was a good opportunity for us to buy back a big block of shares and ... feel good about where that\u2019s headed,\u201d he said.\n\nIf anyone knows about InterTech\u2019s long involvement in Span-America, it\u2019s Ferguson. He was at the helm in January 2003 when Charleston industrialist Jerry Zucker began buying tens of thousands of shares in the thinly traded company based on an article one of his executives read abou the business in The Post and Courier. The InterTech founder and billionaire spent about $2 million of personal funds to acquire a nearly 10 percent stake, making him the single-largest shareholder in Span-America.\n\nZucker then launched a $21.1 million takeover bid for the rest of the stock, saying he was impressed by the business and its management.\n\nSpan-America immediately pushed back. Among other measures, its board adopted a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would jack up the stock price if an unwanted suitor came knocking.\n\nZucker, a brilliant scientist and hard-as-nails negotiator, called in his lawyers and sued, pushing his offer further into hostile territory.\n\nAfter a few months of back-and-forth legal bluster, the two sides settled the dispute in late 2003. InterTech agreed to drop its takeover bid in exchange for a seat on the board, among other conditions.\n\nZucker would succumb to brain cancer less than five years later at age 58, leaving the shares in a trust.\n\nSpan-America, meanwhile, plugged along quietly. But it would prove exceptional in at least one area since InterTech took its seat at the boardroom table: returning profits to investors.\n\nThe directors of Span-America have approved five special cash dividends totaling $8.40 since 2004, including a whopping $5 per-share bonus in 2007. Those were on top of the regular quarterly payouts, which have fluctuated over the past decade between 3\u00bd cents and its current rate of 16 cents.\n\nBased on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, InterTech cashed about $3 million in dividend checks from Span-America. That would bring the value of its original $2 million upfront investment to roughly $7.6 million, for a gain of about 280 percent before taxes.\n\nInterTech chief strategy officer Robert Johnston was the company\u2019s board representative at Span-America since the 2003 settlement. He stepped down as a director immediately after the stock buyback.\n\nJohnston said he was limited in what he could say about the transaction, citing a confidentiality agreement and his previous role as an insider. He called Span-America \u201ca good investment\u201d for InterTech.\n\n\u201cThere was an opportunity to sell the stock back to the company and exit,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe were pleased to do so.\u201d\n\nContact John McDermott at (843) 937-5572.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Once-hostile bid yields nice return for Charleston\u2019s InterTech Group, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Dividends,Greenville,Hostile takeovers,InterTech Group,Investing,Jim Ferguson,North Charleston,Robert Johnston,Span-America Medical", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "With so few publicly traded companies to pick from or pick on, South Carolina has never been a hot-bed of hostile takeovers.", "title": "Once-hostile bid yields nice return for Charleston\u2019s InterTech Group", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151115/151119763/once-hostile-bid-yields-nice-return-for-charleston-x2019-s-intertech-group", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/PC05/151119763/AR/0/AR-151119763.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/PC05/151119763/AR/0/AR-151119763.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With so few publicly traded companies to pick from or pick on, South Carolina has never been a hot-bed of hostile takeovers.", "title": "Once-hostile bid yields nice return for Charleston\u2019s InterTech Group", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/PC05/151119763/AR/0/AR-151119763.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151119763}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Once-hostile bid yields nice return for Charleston\u2019s InterTech Group , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Dividends,Greenville,Hostile takeovers,InterTech Group,Investing,Jim Ferguson,North Charleston,Robert Johnston,Span-America Medical", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-12T15:57:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "With so few publicly traded companies to pick from or pick on, South Carolina has never been a hot-bed of hostile takeovers."}, "article_summary": "A recent $4.6 million stock sale closed out what could be The InterTech Group Inc.\u2019s longest disclosed investment to date in a public company.\nHe called Span-America \u201ca good investment\u201d for InterTech.\nBased on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, InterTech cashed about $3 million in dividend checks from Span-America.\nInterTech agreed to drop its takeover bid in exchange for a seat on the board, among other conditions.\nInterTech chief strategy officer Robert Johnston was the company\u2019s board representative at Span-America since the 2003 settlement."}
