It passed 20-11 and now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott for approval.\n\nDoctors\u2019 groups say the bill would help physicians remind their patients to continue making monthly payments toward their health insurance premiums \u2014 what bill author Rep. J.D. Sheffield, a Republican from Gatesville, called a \u201cteachable moment.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, there is a 90-day grace period in which insurance companies must continue providing health coverage for people who purchased subsidized health plans, even if those people have fallen behind on their monthly payments. But for services used in the final 60 days of the grace period, an insurer seeking repayment can retroactively demand that doctors refund the cost of those services, according to the Texas Medical Association, a physician lobby group. Doctors say the legislation by Sheffield, a family practice physician, would allow them to explain that situation to patients in order to not get stuck with an unpaid bill.\n\nBut critics wondered why the special designation was needed for people purchasing plans under the Affordable Care Act. About 85 percent of Texans who purchased health plans on the exchange received a federal subsidy to help pay for insurance under the law.\n\nDoctors groups and advocates for the newly uninsured reached something of a compromise when the bill was amended to eliminate a special designation for subsidized health plans \u2014 previously marked by the letter \u201cS,\u201d for subsidy. Advocates for low-income Texans said that designation would lead to discrimination against people receiving financial aid and was akin to a \u201cscarlet letter.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: The Texas Medical Association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
