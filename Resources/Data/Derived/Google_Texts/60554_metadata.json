The West Virginia Business and Industry Council, who sponsored the event between Republican Alex Mooney and Democrat Nick Casey, stressed it was a forum for discussion.\n\nThe questions asked to both candidates were pre-written and Mooney and Casey got a look at them before the event got started Thursday morning at the Charleston Civic Center.\n\nDuring open statements, Casey, a Kanawha County native and lawyer, made it clear he is not a strong supporter of President Barack Obama and would not be a Democratic puppet if he were to win the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m not a career politician. I have never run in one state let alone in three areas. I\u2019m 60-years-old. I\u2019m not going to Washington to make a political name for myself,\u201d stressed the Democrat. \u201cI\u2019m going to Washington because, as my father used to say, \u2018We have the greatest form of government in the history of the world.\u2019 He\u2019s right but we are testing that right now. I think it\u2019s time we send in the adults, the experienced, responsible people who can go there and fix what\u2019s wrong with our country.\u201d\n\nMooney, who worked in Washington as a legislative analyst and then served 12 years in the Maryland State Senate, moved to West Virginia with his family a year and a half ago.\n\n\u201cI know I haven\u2019t lived in West Virginia as long as my opponent. I\u2019m proud to be a West Virginian by choice,\u201d said Mooney. \u201cMy wife and I are raising our family here. We\u2019re sending our children to school here. We want to make sure our children grow up in a state that is filled with opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe first topic up for discussion was one both Casey and Mooney agreed on. The Democrat and Republican said programs like No Child Left Behind and Common Core must go and states need to be fully in charge of their education systems.\n\nBut when it comes to Obamacare, the two candidates are on opposing sides.\n\n\u201cI am adamantly opposed to Obamacare. I think we should repeal it completely. Unlike the last issue, this is an issue where my opponent and I disagree,\u201d stated Mooney. \u201cObamacare has resulted in higher taxes, higher premiums and fewer jobs.\u201d\n\nWhile Casey does struggle with some issues within Obamacare, he says we shouldn\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\n\u201cThe reality is Obamacare is here. One hundred and thirty seven thousand, as of yesterday, uninsured, working West Virginians have obtained insurance because of the results of Medicare,\u201d explained Casey.\n\nBoth candidates answered questions on the deficit, global warming, transportation, the EPA and the future of coal, all issues important to the business leaders gathered in the room.\n\nIn closing, Casey made it clear he wanted the business and industry vote in November.\n\n\u201cIf you send me (to Washington), you know I\u2019m dependable. You know I\u2019m experienced. You know I\u2019m competent. You know I\u2019m accessible. And you know I don\u2019t answer to anybody but West Virginians,\u201d said Casey.\n\nMooney told those gathered it was time for a change in Congress and he\u2019s the candidate to make that happen.\n\n\u201cWest Virginia is an incredible state. Our citizens are hard working, industrious and creative,\u201d stressed the Republican. \u201cBut right now the federal government is stifling our businesses and burdening our families.\u201d\n\nThere are two other candidates running in the second district: Independent Ed Rabel and Libertarian Davy Jones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Second District candidates face off in Charleston.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Second District candidates face off in Charleston.", "title": "Mooney vs. Casey", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/07/24/mooney-vs-casey/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC04612.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC04612.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T18:46:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T18:46:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce57\"", "article_summary": "The West Virginia Business and Industry Council, who sponsored the event between Republican Alex Mooney and Democrat Nick Casey, stressed it was a forum for discussion.\nYou know I\u2019m competent.\nYou know I\u2019m accessible.\nYou know I\u2019m experienced.\nThe questions asked to both candidates were pre-written and Mooney and Casey got a look at them before the event got started Thursday morning at the Charleston Civic Center."}
