The life of Missy Franklin seems to have changed more on paper than in reality.

The four-time Olympic champion swimmer, who announced in March that she would forgo her final two years of college eligibility and turn pro, recently returned to the Denver area after completing her final exams at the University of California.

But while many of her friends embark on summer vacations, Franklin, 20, is transitioning to life as a professional. So far, it looks a lot like the life she had before, with four to six hours of training each day starting at 5:30 a.m., and a packed slate of upcoming races.

This time, though, she will get to cash in.

“I would have given anything to swim another two years in college,” she said Monday in Denver at a luncheon for the Association for Women in Sports Media. “But I truly feel this is going to be the best thing, to set me up financially and get my career going.”

With 22 medals from the Olympics, world championships and Pan Pacific championships, multiple records, and four individual and one team NCAA title, it’s hard to imagine there could still be a “first” for Franklin. But in June, the Regis Jesuit High School graduate will make her pro debut at the Arena Pro Swim Series in Santa Clara, Calif.

Franklin said she will stay here through the summer and train with her longtime coach, Todd Schmitz, and the Colorado Stars. After the world championships in Kazan, Russia, in August, she will re-evaluate her options regarding her training schedule as she prepares for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
