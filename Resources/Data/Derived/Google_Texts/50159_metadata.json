According to Harley, rivals have been offering discounts of as much as $3,000 per bike, an increase from $2,000 per bike in the fourth quarter of 2014. Manufacturer Suggested Retail Prices can wind up being cut by as much as 25 percent, according to Harley and Cycle World magazine.\n\nThere is no question that Japanese makers such as Yamaha, Honda Motor, Suzuki and Kawasaki have made inroads into the lower end of the U.S. motorcycle market. Suzuki even quit selling cars in the U.S. in 2012 to focus on motorcycles. The higher end is also getting more crowded. Indian, a brand with cachet among the two-wheel crowd, was resurrected a few years ago by Polaris Industries (PII) after being dormant for decades. Other premium brands such as Germany\u2019s BMW and Italy\u2019s Ducati reported record cycle sales in 2014. And U.K.-based Triumph has seen increased U.S. sales in recent years.\n\nHarley, though, dominates the market for heavyweight motorcycles with engines of 601 cubic centimeters: It had a 51.3 percent share in the first quarter, down 4.7 percent from a year earlier. The size of the decline surprised the company, according to Olin.\n\nNot everyone is happy that Harley is dissing discounts, especially given its recent mixed quarterly results. The Milwaukee-based company beat analysts\u2019 profit expectations but missed their revenue forecasts. Harley unnerved investors further when it slashed its forecast for growth in 2015 motorcycle shipments to an increase of 2 percent to 4 percent vs. earlier forecasts of a 4 percent to 6 percent gain. The company expects to deliver 83,000 to 88,000 bikes in the current quarter, a decrease of 5 to 10 percent from last year\u2019s second quarter.\n\nRelated: The 4 Dangers of Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nAt least three analysts lowered their price target on Harley after the report, though they didn\u2019t cut their ratings. Others, such as Sharon Zackfia of William Blair & Co., noted that the motorcycle maker\u2019s strategy comes with risks.\n\n\u201cHarley does not plan to discount, which could lead to continued share erosion over the next few quarters,\u201d Zackfia wrote in a note to clients. Still, she said, the company has begun some promotional financing aimed at young riders, with payments of as little as $99 a month, and low rates for core customers, with rates as low as 1.99%. Zackfia rated the shares, which have slumped nearly 14 percent this year, as \u201coutperform.\u201d On May 1, Harley was trading around 66.65 a share, down from its 52-week high of 75.04.\n\nOne reason for the continued optimism is that none of Harley\u2019s challengers have the status of the \u201cHog\u201d as an American icon celebrated in film and pop culture. A site that tracks customer loyalty even \u201ccertified\u201d Harley as a \u201ccult brand\u201d because of its longevity, among other reasons. The company describes its \u201ccore customers\u201d as Caucasian men aged 35 and older, but it is broadening its appeal to women, African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nRelated: Car Sales Are on Pace to Do Something They Haven\u2019t in 50 Years\n\nThe numbers for motorcycles sales in America don\u2019t lie, and Harley remains the 800-pound hog in the market.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, Harley sold 26,957 motorcycles in the U.S. Honda Motor, its biggest competitor, sold 10,343 bike in fiscal the U.S. during the same period.\n\n\u201cHarley has been selling bikes hand-over-fist for the past 20 years,\u201d said Mark Tuttle, editor-in-chief at Rider Magazine, in an interview. \u201c(These) riders don\u2019t want a lot of change. They want the bikes to keep their traditional look.\u201d\n\nThumbing your nose at discounting is a strategy that takes guts, but if Harley were to get into that game and make its bikes more affordable, it might lose some of the mystique that has it king of the road.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The storied maker of muscle bikes refuses to lower the value of its motorcycle brand", "title": "Harley Goes Whole-Hog Against Discount Pricing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/01/Harley-Goes-Whole-Hog-Against-Discount-Pricing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Easy-Rider.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/01/Harley-Goes-Whole-Hog-Against-Discount-Pricing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Easy-Rider.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The storied maker of muscle bikes refuses to lower the value of its motorcycle brand", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbefe\"", "article_summary": "There is no question that Japanese makers such as Yamaha, Honda Motor, Suzuki and Kawasaki have made inroads into the lower end of the U.S. motorcycle market.\n\u201cHarley does not plan to discount, which could lead to continued share erosion over the next few quarters,\u201d Zackfia wrote in a note to clients.\nA site that tracks customer loyalty even \u201ccertified\u201d Harley as a \u201ccult brand\u201d because of its longevity, among other reasons.\n\u201cHarley has been selling bikes hand-over-fist for the past 20 years,\u201d said Mark Tuttle, editor-in-chief at Rider Magazine, in an interview.\nManufacturer Suggested Retail Prices can wind up being cut by as much as 25 percent, according to Harley and Cycle World magazine."}
