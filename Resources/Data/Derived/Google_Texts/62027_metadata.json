When news broke that the director had signed on for an untitled six-part series with the online behemoth, the prospect was exciting, mysterious and vaguely unnerving: What would one of our greatest big-screen auteurs conjure up amid the brave new world of streaming TV? While his statement at the time (\u201cI have no ideas and I\u2019m not sure where to begin\u201d) didn\u2019t inspire much confidence, it was easy enough to write this off as Allen being glib.\n\nWell it turns out, Allen really does have no idea where to begin, and he wholeheartedly regrets agreeing to do the show. Talking to Deadline at Cannes about his new film \u201cIrrational Man,\u201d Allen laid all his cards on the table, explaining that he doesn\u2019t \u201ceven know what a streaming service is\u201d and also that he \u201cnever knew what Amazon was.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s much of a TV watcher in general. As he puts it: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any of those series, even on cable. I\u2019ve never seen \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 or \u2018Mad Men.\u2019 I\u2019m out every night and when I come home, I watch the end of the baseball or basketball game, and there\u2019s Charlie Rose and I go to sleep.\u201d\n\nOkay, not a great start here. So why did he sign on to the project? According to Allen, Amazon kept bombarding him until he gave in:\n\n\u201cI kept saying I have no ideas for it, that I never watch television. I don\u2019t know the first thing about it. Well, this went on for a year and a half, and they kept making a better deal and a better deal. Finally they said look, we\u2019ll do anything that you want, just give us six half hours. They can be black and white, they can take place in Paris, in New York and California, they can be about a family, they can be comedy, you can be in them, they can be tragic. We don\u2019t have to know anything, just come in with six half hours. And they offered a lot of money and everybody around me was pressuring me, go ahead and do it, what do you have to lose?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He also doesn't watch TV and has no idea what a streaming service is", "title": "Woody Allen hates his Amazon deal so much: \u201cI have regretted every second since I said OK\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He also doesn't watch TV and has no idea what a streaming service is", "title": "Woody Allen hates his Amazon deal so much: \u201cI have regretted every second since I said OK\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/15/woody_allen_hates_his_amazon_deal_so_much_i_have_regretted_every_second_since_i_said_ok/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/woody_allen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He also doesn't watch TV and has no idea what a streaming service is", "title": "Woody Allen hates his Amazon deal so much: \u201cI have regretted every second since I said OK\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/woody_allen.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, TV, Woody Allen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0a2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: amazon, TV, Woody Allen, Entertainment NewsRemember that Woody Allen Amazon series we heard about back in January?\nAccording to Allen, Amazon kept bombarding him until he gave in:\u201cI kept saying I have no ideas for it, that I never watch television.\nWell, this went on for a year and a half, and they kept making a better deal and a better deal.\nWell it turns out, Allen really does have no idea where to begin, and he wholeheartedly regrets agreeing to do the show.\nWe don\u2019t have to know anything, just come in with six half hours."}
