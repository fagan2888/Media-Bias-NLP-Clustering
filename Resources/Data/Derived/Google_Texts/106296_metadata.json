But there was also more concern expressed about the slowing national economy, and the need for more high-paying jobs and education in the region.\n\n\u201cThe economy nationwide is close to stall speed,\u201d UCF economist Sean Snaith said in his keynote address to hundreds at the Orange County Convention Center. He cited slowing growth nationally and globally, and stock market woes this year.\n\nSnaith politicized his speech more than usual, slamming the Dodd-Frank Act and the Affordable Care Act as burdensome regulation. He was even more pessimistic than he was during in-depth interviews just last week with the Sentinel.\n\n\u201cYes, my antennae are up and I have been watching the signals,\u201d Snaith said after his speech. \u201cThe stock market is of particular concern now. It may not have immediate effect on consumers, but it effects retirement planning, company hiring and so forth.\u201d\n\nSnaith said Central Florida\u2019s attractions, like the Harry Potter themes at Universal and Star Wars\u2019 plans at Disney, are the region\u2019s \"shale oil deposits,\" but he studiously avoided any mention of concerns over lower-paying jobs or growing poverty rates in the metro area. He referred only to a desire for \u201cemployment diversification\u201d in the area.\n\nSnaith said he acknowledges that something had to be done to reform health care in the U.S., but he said the ACA was too much and the timing was off.\n\nAngel de la Portilla, a local lobbyist for hospitality businesses, said he enjoyed hearing about the booming tourism economy. But he also applauded efforts to attract more diverse jobs here. He said he is now concerned about the impact that the coming national election will have, particularly if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee.\n\nRick Weddle, director at the Orlando Economic Development Commission, made the pitch for more funding to offer incentives that attract higher paying jobs.\n\nWeddle said the area is lagging in new patent filings, venture capital, education, STEM employment.\n\nCounty Mayor Teresa Jacobs unveiled a new initiative to name the greenest business in Central Florida, and announced that the next Modeling, Simulation and Training summit would be held Sept. 22.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "At county economic summit: Hope, concerns for 2016", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Orange County \u2019s economic summit highlighted the Orlando region\u2019s steady growth in the number of jobs Thursday.
