Officials said the number of people attempting the sea crossing from North Africa to Italy rose sharply during January to April, when 42,000 migrants were detected on these routes, with 25,650 of these crossing from Libya, according to a BBC report.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCombined with seven other less busy routes, the total figure for this year is probably now about 60,000.\n\nThis follows publication of Frontex\u2019s annual report which showed that illegal border crossings increased sharply in 2013, rising to over 107,000 from 75,000 in 2012, with the greatest number of illegal migrants being Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans.\n\nThe number of Syrians detected at the borders of EU member states accounted for almost a quarter of all arrivals in 2013 and at 25,500 was almost three times the 2012 figure.\n\nWhile Syrians and Egyptians departed for Italy primarily from Egypt in 2013, migrants from the Horn of Africa and West Africa departed mostly from Libya.\n\nAccording to Frontex, to reach Italy, migrants from the Horn of Africa typically used a perilous route across the Sahara, travelling onward through Libya. In 2013, over 40,000 made this crossing, \u201c38 per cent of all detections of irregular migration at EU level.\u201d\n\nThis number will surge even more if Libya\u2019s interior minister, Salah Mazek, carries out a threat he made earlier this month when he said his country could \u201cfacilitate\u201d the crossing of the thousands of people waiting in Libya to cross to Europe.\n\nAccording to a report on al-Jazeera, he told a press conference on May 10: \u201cWith regards to illegal immigration, I am warning the world, and the European Union in particular, that if they do not shoulder the responsibility with us, the state of Libya will take a position on this matter that could facilitate the quick passage of this flood of people through Libya since God has made us a transit point for this flood.\u201d\n\nHe said Libya was \u201csuffering\u201d because thousands of mainly sub-Saharan Africans were spreading disease, crime and drugs in the North African nation: \u201cLibya has paid the price. Now it\u2019s Europe\u2019s turn to pay.\u201d\n\nOn the Western Mediterranean route, numbers of illegal migrants at the Greek borders with Turkey in 2013 were at their lowest level in five years though this route still accounted for almost a quarter of all detections in the EU.\n\nAt 19,000, the number of illegal migrants at the border between Hungary and Serbia was almost three times that of a year earlier and according to Frontex \u201cmade the Western Balkan route the number-three hot spot for illegal border crossings in Europe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Surge in Illegal Migrants Across the Mediterranean Now Greater than in Arab Spring", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Surge in Illegal Migrants Across the Mediterranean Now Greater than in Arab Spring", "title": "Surge in Illegal Migrants Across the Mediterranean Now Greater than in Arab Spring - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/05/31/African-Immigration-Europe-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/06/06/surge-in-illegal-migrants-across-med-greater-than-in-arab-spring/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Surge in Illegal Migrants Across the Mediterranean Now Greater than in Arab Spring", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/05/31/African-Immigration-Europe-AP.jpg", "title": "Surge in Illegal Migrants Across the Mediterranean Now Greater than in Arab Spring - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Illegal Immigrants, Italy, New York Times,Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "New York Times", "published_time": "2014-06-06T02:44:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This follows publication of Frontex\u2019s annual report which showed that illegal border crossings increased sharply in 2013, rising to over 107,000 from 75,000 in 2012, with the greatest number of illegal migrants being Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans.\nAt 19,000, the number of illegal migrants at the border between Hungary and Serbia was almost three times that of a year earlier and according to Frontex \u201cmade the Western Balkan route the number-three hot spot for illegal border crossings in Europe.\u201d\nWhile Syrians and Egyptians departed for Italy primarily from Egypt in 2013, migrants from the Horn of Africa and West Africa departed mostly from Libya.\nAccording to Frontex, to reach Italy, migrants from the Horn of Africa typically used a perilous route across the Sahara, travelling onward through Libya.\nThe total so far for 2014 is more than the equivalent period in 2011, the year of the Arab Spring, which eventually saw 140,000 make clandestine crossings into Europe."}
