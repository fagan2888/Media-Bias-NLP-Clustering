That\u2019s the situation for 412 medical school graduates this year in the United States.\n\nA residency \u2014 paid, on-the-job training \u2014 is an essential step in becoming a medical doctor. In some cases, students\u2019 failure to obtain a residency has nothing to do with their performance, but rather with the supply and demand of the system that allocates them, the National Resident Match Program.\n\nIt also has to do with simple math. The National Resident Match Program\u2019s annual report, released in May, shows 26,678 positions. For the second year in a row, the number of graduates exceeded the number of residencies available.\n\nMedicare funds those residencies, costing $10 billion a year. Congress set this allocation in 1997, and it has remained unchanged since then.\n\nBut not for lack of trying. In 2013, lawmakers introduced two bills, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act and the Training Tomorrow\u2019s Doctors Today Act. Neither bill passed the House of Representatives.\n\nJanis Orlowski, the senior director in health care affairs for the Association of American Medical Colleges, said Congress needs to increase funding to prevent a catastrophic shortage of doctors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a choke point where there are more students graduating than are getting a residency,\u201d Orlowski said.\n\nThis residency shortage comes at a time when demand for doctors is increasing, she said. An aging population, an increase in the pool of insured people due to the Affordable Care Act, and the fact that almost a third of all physicians are expected to retire in the next decade all contribute to the rising need for new doctors. Her organization, interpreting U.S. Census data, predicts a shortage of 130,000 physicians by 2025.\n\nOrlowski said that when she was in medical school during the 1980s, the country faced a similar physician shortage, which led to a federal investment in building and expanding medical schools.\n\nThis time around, medical schools have increased class sizes in response to the shortage, which is a good start, she said. But without an increase in the number of residency positions, the number of doctors cannot increase \u2014 no matter how many people graduate from medical school.\n\nCurrently, students select and rank desired residencies through the National Resident Match Program, which uses an algorithm to meet the needs of both the students and hospitals. For the unlucky ones who don\u2019t get a match, it\u2019s often just a matter of too many applicants for certain specialties.\n\nThis year \u2014 Match Day was March 31 \u2014 the number of unmatched graduates decreased to 412 from last year\u2019s 528, which Orlowski attributes in part to students\u2019 increased willingness to apply for primary care positions.\n\n\u201cSome primary care residencies did not fill in the past, and they did now, which is good,\u201d Orlowski said. \u201cRather than everyone wanting to be a dermatologist \u2014 a very lucrative but hard-to-fill spot \u2014 people selected wisely, especially in competitive areas.\u201d\n\nJames E. Wilberger, a neurosurgeon and vice president for graduate medical education at Allegheny Health System, said that unless something is done, the residency shortage will continue to get worse.\n\n\u201cRight now the number is small, but the trend is disturbing,\u201d he said.\n\nWilberger said he knew one graduate who failed to get a residency this year. Describing the graduate as a \u201ctop-notch student,\u201d an aspiring orthopedic surgeon with \u201cexcellent credentials,\u201d he said there is sometimes no predicting which students will fail to match.\n\nOfficials at University of Pittsburgh Medical School would not comment on whether they had any unmatched graduates.\n\nBut Alexis Chidi, a Pitt medical student who also is seeking a Ph.D., said she was aware of at least two Pitt medical school seniors who had failed to get a residency in the past two years. Chidi said that each student\u2019s choice of specialty and his or her desired locale both may have played a role.\n\n\u201cEverybody goes into medical school wanting to have unlimited choice of specialty and geographic areas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut depending upon a number of factors, including performance in medical school or what school you go to, might affect your ability to match into a program.\u201d\n\nThere is a process in place, known among medical students as \u201cthe scramble,\u201d which gives students who didn\u2019t match one last opportunity to get a residency without having to wait another year. But Chidi said that some specialties don\u2019t have many opportunities available during the scramble, leaving some students out of luck.\n\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\n\nAt the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, Ross Knowles is a third-year medical student who hopes to become a surgeon. He said that until more residencies open up, some aspiring physicians may not be able to pursue their areas of interest.\n\nKnowles, who would prefer to work in a small town or rural setting, said he was worried that he would take a less-than-ideal residency out of necessity.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re going to have people with the aptitude and the passion to work in a certain field or certain region, and they\u2019re not going to be able to do it because there aren\u2019t enough spots,\u201d Knowles said.\n\nEverette James, the director of the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Health Policy Institute, said that addressing the doctor shortage will require more than simply upping Medicare funding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to need more primary care physicians,\u201d James said. \u201cSimultaneously, we\u2019re going to need to expand the use of advance practice providers.\u201d\n\nJames listed nurse practitioners, physicians\u2019 assistants, physical therapists, pharmacists and others as playing key roles in future delivery of health care.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be some tough changes for all of us, but we can certainly look at federal and state deficits and realize we can\u2019t continue to pay health services at the rate of increase we\u2019ve been paying,\u201d James said. \u201cWe must develop new cost-effective models of health care delivery.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, those graduates without residencies must wait until next year to apply again \u2014 while managing to pay or defer student loans. What they\u2019re doing in the meantime is somewhat of a mystery. Although a failure to get a residency isn\u2019t usually the student\u2019s fault, the stigma associated is likely keeping those students from speaking out.\n\n\u201cMedical students are used to being at the top of their game,\u201d Chidi said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get to medical school throughout their educational career. So for some medical students, it\u2019s the first time they haven\u2019t gotten what they wanted.\u201d\n\nWilberger said that some unmatched graduates may work in pharmaceuticals or other fields not directly related to medicine. He said that at West Penn, students are allowed to spend an extra year in medical school, working in a lab. Since they haven\u2019t technically graduated, they don\u2019t have to begin paying student loans.\n\nOrlowski said that some students do a year of research or take a fellowship.\n\n\u201cThe average debt (of medical school graduates) is between $150,000 and $200,000,\u201d Orlowski said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be licensed.
