In two nearly identical letters in The Forum North Dakota Sen. Judy Lee and Insurance Commissioner Adam Hamm defended Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem's encouragement for the Supreme Court to legislate from its bench.

Obamacare was crystal clear that federal subsidies for those obliged to buy healthcare would only be through state-run exchanges.

Some states such as North Dakota declined to establish their own exchanges, which meant no subsidies from federal exchanges unless the law was changed. The making of laws is the purview of legislatures, not the judiciary. Yet Stenehjem joined a passel of Democrats to help the Supreme Court rewrite the law and its clear intent in order to keep this subsidy flowing to some two percent of North Dakotans.

In short, Stenehjem as an officer of the law encouraged a nationwide unlawful, unconstitutional change to Obamacare to save a minor welfare subsidy. If he lacks the spine to uphold the law, then he's unfit to be dogcatcher, much less attorney general or governor.
