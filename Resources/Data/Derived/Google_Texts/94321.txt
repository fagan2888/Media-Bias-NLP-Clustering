RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The aspiring soccer stars of Rio de Janeiro’s historic Mangueira slum don’t have far to look for inspiration.

The slum sits on a hill overlooking Brazil’s temple to soccer, the fabled Maracana stadium, where legends from Pele to Neymar have played.

Less than half a kilometer separates the sprawling slum from the stadium, where seven World Cup matches will be played, including the July 13 final.

But with tickets to the tournament expensive and hard to come by, the gulf between Mangueira and Maracana is almost impassable.

“I would like to watch a final match between Brazil and Portugal because I’m a fan of Brazil’s Neymar and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo,” said 13-year-old Alex Silva, a Mangueira resident. “But I know I won’t get to because I don’t have money to buy a ticket.”

Some of Mangueira’s other budding soccer talents concurred: Despite their physical proximity, they’ll be following the World Cup in other ways.
