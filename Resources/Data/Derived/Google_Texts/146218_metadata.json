Bernie Sanders went to West Virginia on May 5 and spoke about the life expectancy gap between the region and other areas of the country. \"Poverty is a death sentence,\" he said before asking for a large turnout for the state's May 10's primary. (Reuters)\n\nAs Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders prepared to campaign across the South a couple of months ago, there was a moment when it looked as though the senator from Vermont had found an opening in a region with some of the country\u2019s poorest places.\n\nClinton had supported the 1996 welfare reform effort during her husband\u2019s presidency. Sanders said the legislation had doubled extreme poverty, creating hardship for millions of Americans. \u201cWhat welfare reform did, in my view, was to go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,\u201d he said in South Carolina in February.\n\nSanders did not continue to press the issue, however, and while he has campaigned as a champion of the downtrodden and a nemesis of inequality, Sanders has not proposed many policies that would directly address the law\u2019s negative consequences, such as an expansion of the food-stamp program or a tax credit that can be converted to cash. Now that his presidential campaign may be drawing to a close, some on the left are disappointed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Sanders didn\u2019t put anything on the table,\u201d said economist Dean Baker, a director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nIn the years before Clinton's reforms passed with bipartisan support, Baker recalled, the debate often devolved into stereotypes. \u201cThe idea was, \u2018We can\u2019t be associated with these people who are lazy good-for-nothings,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gone away,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Sanders, probably like everyone else, is scared of that.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, objected in an interview to the suggestion that the senator should have focused more on poverty, calling it \u201cpreposterous and absurd.\u201d\n\nSanders \u201cis doing everything he can in this campaign to lift millions of Americans out of poverty and into the middle class,\u201d Gunnels said. He pointed to Sanders\u2019s proposal for national health insurance, an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and a major investment in infrastructure, which he said would put more Americans to work and ensure that they earn a living wage.\n\n\u2018He has not suggested anything\u2019\n\nSanders\u2019s overall philosophy is to tax the rich more heavily to provide more benefits for all. The costliest benefits would come from establishing a government-run universal health-insurance program and eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities.\n\nYet these initiatives would not radically change the lives of the country\u2019s poorest people. Many poor Americans already qualify for Medicaid. Higher education is a distant dream for many of them. Likewise, doubling the minimum wage would only help those who already have a job.\n\nEconomists who support Sanders\u2019s proposals generally argue that a major increase in federal borrowing would stimulate an economy that seems persistently weak, putting more people to work and increasing national income.\n\nWhen President Clinton was in office, the economy was expanding rapidly and poverty declined. Sanders\u2019s spending could replicate those conditions \u2014 for example, he proposes an additional $1 trillion on repairing and maintaining physical infrastructure, which his campaign says would employ 13 million people.\n\nOn the other hand, some on the left say this logic just repeats what they see as the error of Clinton\u2019s approach to poverty. The president\u2019s policies ignored those who cannot work, whether due to a disability or because they have to care for young children or relatives who are sick, said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who has advocated for more generous family benefits.\n\nCohen said that focusing benefits on poor people who work is easier politically, since opponents can accuse those without a steady job of laziness. \u201cIf you say what you\u2019re doing is for working families, nobody who votes objects to that,\u201d he said. This focus \u201chas shifted assistance to people who are just barely poor and not the seriously poor,\u201d he added.\n\nBefore the 1996 law, welfare beneficiaries weren\u2019t required to work to receive checks from the government. Critics said the system created dependency and discouraged people from working. Under Clinton\u2019s reforms, beneficiaries had to work or participate in various kinds of employment-related activities, such as vocational training, to continue receiving benefits.\n\nTogether with his expansion of a major tax credit that increases in value as a worker\u2019s wages increase up to a certain level, Clinton\u2019s policies were a boon for the working poor, said Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOn the other hand, her research suggests that those who could not get steady work received less help as the law took effect. Edin and the University of Michigan\u2019s Luke Shaefer found that the number of households living in extreme poverty in any given year \u2014 which they define less than $2 in cash a day \u2014 has roughly doubled.\n\nSanders voted against Clinton\u2019s reform. Edin credited him with an \u201cimpeccable voting record\u201d on questions of poverty throughout his career in Congress, but faulted him for not talking about the issue on the trail.\n\n[Bernie Sanders is right: Bill Clinton\u2019s welfare law doubled extreme poverty]\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been right on the issues, and really in a principled way, but yet the only time he\u2019s really talked about mending the safety net is in attacking Hillary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to use that as an attack, and another thing to have a policy to remediate it. He has not suggested anything to mend the safety net.\u201d\n\nMedicare for all and more\n\nFamily leave, another plank in Sanders\u2019s platform, would largely benefit people with jobs. Since the poorest one in five households are less likely to have steady employment, Sanders\u2019s family-leave proposal would be worth just $7 a year to families in this group on average, according to an analysis published by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on Monday.\n\nGunnels, the candidate\u2019s policy director, pointed to other policies that would help people who cannot work, such as Sanders\u2019s call for an additional $5 billion dedicated to public housing.\n\n\u201cThe best way to make sure that Americans are lifted out of poverty is to make sure that millions of Americans have jobs, jobs that pay a living wage \u2014 and that we also do help out the most vulnerable Americans,\u201d Gunnels said.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposal for a national health-insurance system would also offer generous benefits for some poor people who aren\u2019t working. The government would pay for long-term care for those who need it due to disability or age. Among the poorest one in five U.S. households, the value of this benefit would average about $1,300 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. Of course, many of those households wouldn\u2019t need this benefit, and the actual value would be far more for the households that would use it.\n\n[Sorry, Bernie fans. His health care plan is short $17,000,000,000,000.]\n\nAdditionally, adults who are poor but nonetheless do not qualify for Medicaid would gain coverage under Sanders\u2019s plan.\n\nIn general, though, Sanders\u2019s health-care plan would benefit affluent households more than it would poorer ones. Many poor and middle-class families already receive help from the federal government in obtaining health insurance, whether through Medicaid or through the subsidies on insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s health-care legislation. Sanders\u2019s new system would replace those benefits.\n\nThe same is true of Sanders\u2019s proposal to pay for tuition at public colleges and universities. Since children in more affluent families are more likely to graduate from high school and apply to costly four-year degrees, these families would be more likely to benefit.\n\nTo be sure, federal health insurance and tuition grants could be priceless for those poor families that do benefit from them. In total, though, the richest one in five households would receive about twice as much on average as the poorest one in five would under Sanders\u2019s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nSanders's vision\n\nWhen it comes to poverty, Sanders\u2019s vision for the United States contrasts with the northern European democracies he often points to as exemplars. In those places, governments shield residents from extreme hardship, said Lane Kenworthy, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego.\n\nIn some places, such as Denmark and Sweden, citizens and sometimes immigrants who can\u2019t support themselves are guaranteed a minimum income. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, use a combination of tax credits, housing allowances and other benefits to achieve the same goal.\n\nKenworthy cited data showing that people in Finland, Germany and Denmark are guaranteed incomes in excess of $20,000 annually. In the United States, the equivalent figure is below $10,000, including housing, public assistance and tax credits that can be refunded in cash (not just used to pay taxes).\n\nThese schemes aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 as in the United States, some Europeans don't benefit from them, perhaps because they can\u2019t meet certain requirements imposed on beneficiaries or simply because they are unaware of what they are entitled to. Where these programs are available, though, they seem to help reduce dire poverty.\n\nAbout 0.2 percent of the French population was living on less than $2.15 per person per day in 2008, according to an E.U. report. Edin and Shaefer\u2019s estimates suggest that something more like 1 percent of the U.S. population is living on less than $2 per household per day, an even more extreme measure.\n\nBecause this subject is so politically fraught in this country, Kenworthy said he doesn\u2019t blame Sanders for avoiding it during the campaign.\n\n\u201cThey, basically, are okay with insuring that people at the bottom have a decent income,\u201d Kenworthy said of the Europeans. \u201cThat\u2019s just proved so contentious over time in the United States. Even somebody as progressive as Bernie Sanders hasn\u2019t been willing to put that on the table, precisely because it\u2019s so contentious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some people actually feel that Sanders didn't go far enough.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/max.ehrenfreund", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some people actually feel that Sanders didn't go far enough.", "title": "What didn\u2019t happen after Sanders slammed Clinton on helping poor people", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/11/bernie-sanderss-plans-have-surprisingly-small-benefits-for-americas-poorest-people/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/01/Sanders-square.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MaxEhrenfreund"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/11/bernie-sanderss-plans-have-surprisingly-small-benefits-for-americas-poorest-people/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders; Bill Clinton; Hillary Clinton;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/max.ehrenfreund"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders; Bill Clinton; Hillary Clinton;"}, "article_summary": "Sanders's visionWhen it comes to poverty, Sanders\u2019s vision for the United States contrasts with the northern European democracies he often points to as exemplars.\nMany poor Americans already qualify for Medicaid.\nThis focus \u201chas shifted assistance to people who are just barely poor and not the seriously poor,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Sanders didn\u2019t put anything on the table,\u201d said economist Dean Baker, a director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.\nAmong the poorest one in five U.S. households, the value of this benefit would average about $1,300 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center."}
