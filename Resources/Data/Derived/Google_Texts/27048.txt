The young man suspected of killing six and wounding seven last night near University of California, Santa Barbara, has been identified by the family as the son of Peter Rodger, a filmmaker and assistant director on the first “Hunger Games” movie.

The family’s attorney Alan Schifman said Peter Rodger identified his son, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, as being involved in the shooting, according to ABC News.

“They want to send the deepest condolences to all the victims’ families involved at this time,” Schifman said of the Rodger family. He called the family “devastated.” A video of the statement can be found here at BBC.

Elliot Rodger was also among the dead; he was found in a black BMW with a semi-automatic handgun and a gunshot to the head. The investigation is ongoing and it is unclear if he took his own life, or if he was shot in one of the two separate shootouts with deputies.

ABC News is also reporting that Elliot Rodger was allegedly being treated by multiple therapists, and according to reports he was a student at Santa Barbara City College.

According to Schifman, questions had been raised about Elliot Rodger’s well-being in the last several weeks. His parents had allegedly reported his disturbing YouTube videos to police, ABC News reported. Schifman also said that Elliot had been questioned by police, but did not specify which jurisdiction.

ABC News reported that a social worker also contacted police about Elliot Rodger last week.
