But if you thought that ObamaCare was bad, just wait for AyatollahDate.\n\nIran has announced plans to combat what it says are \"immoral\" online dating websites by launching an official site for young people seeking marriage. The ministry, in cooperation with the Islamic propaganda organisation, will launch a new site \"where young people can sign up and introduce themselves,\" the deputy minister for youth and sport, Mahmoud Gholrazi was quoted by daily newspaper Arman as saying. Noting that Iran has a marriageable population of around 11 million, he said that, \"with the help of this site, we could have 100,000 marriages with a correct method, and the problem of marriage for young people would be partly solved.\"\n\nI'm sure that will out really well.\n\nIran's Islamic authorities don't exactly have a great track record with young people, but there's no doubt that their plan to use a nuclear powered dating website that will feature photos of angry Ayatollahs will solve that marriage crisis.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, they can just resort to rape, just like the Revolutionary Guard does in prison.\n\nIf there's one thing the Supreme Ayatollah knew, it's what women want. Like the time Ayatollah Khomeini said that women in parliament is just like prostitution.\n\nThis dating website will no doubt have some of the greatest hits of the leading figure of the Islamic Revolution. \"An Islamic regime must be serious in every field. There are no jokes in Islam. There is no humor in Islam. There is no fun in Islam.\"\n\nAnd let's not forget his favorite age for marriage. \"It is better for a girl to marry at such a time when she would begin menstruation at her husband\u2019s house, rather than her father\u2019s home. Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.\"\n\nOr you know... hell.\n\nIs this Iranian marriage government website going to be for pedophiles?", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "If you thought ObamaCare was bad, just wait for AyatollahDate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "If you thought ObamaCare was bad, just wait for AyatollahDate.", "title": "Iran to Create Government Dating Site", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/249629/iran-create-government-dating-site-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/249629/iran-create-government-dating-site-daniel-greenfield", "description": "If you thought ObamaCare was bad, just wait for AyatollahDate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Iran to Create Government Dating Site"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-21T05:27:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40a0\"", "article_summary": "Iran has announced plans to combat what it says are \"immoral\" online dating websites by launching an official site for young people seeking marriage.\nNo it's not a website for dating Iranian Ayatollahs, which would be almost as horrible.\nThis dating website will no doubt have some of the greatest hits of the leading figure of the Islamic Revolution.\nIs this Iranian marriage government website going to be for pedophiles?\nNoting that Iran has a marriageable population of around 11 million, he said that, \"with the help of this site, we could have 100,000 marriages with a correct method, and the problem of marriage for young people would be partly solved.\""}
