In fact, roughly 32% of Chicago\u2019s 802 communities were classified as pharmacy deserts for having low-income residents with low access to prescription medications.Compared to the entire Chicago population, independent community pharmacies covered a 20% higher share of the drugstores serving those minority neighborhoods between 2000 and 2012. The disparity worsened during that time period because the number of pharmacies in predominately white areas expanded by 20% without a similar increase in segregated black communities, the researchers determined.In light of those findings, the authors suggested offering incentives to more independent pharmacies to relocate to communities that meet the definition of pharmacy deserts.
