Steven King/Worcester Magazine\n\nA move by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that now subjects automatic gratuities at restaurants to payroll taxes has many restaurants doing away with including tips in the overall bill for large groups of customers. It is what one local restaurateur calls a \u201cfoolish\u201d move.\n\nStarting Jan. 1 all restaurants are required to withhold the so-called \u201cautomatic tips\u201d many of them add to bills for large groups, a practice widely done when there are eight or more customers in a party. Most restaurants charge an 18-percent gratuity. The IRS is now classifying those automatic gratuities as service charges, or regular wages. As such, instead of pocketing the money at the end of a their shift, servers have them withheld until their paycheck. The change did not come out of the blue; it originally went into effect in 2012, but it was not immediately enforced to allow restaurants time to adjust and comply.\n\nRestaurant servers, who earn paltry wages and rely heavily on tips to augment their income, have always been expected to claim their earnings as taxes, which would include the tips pocketed from larger groups. The IRS, however, decided those gratuities qualified as payroll and not tips. That has led many restaurants to make their own decisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided not to include automatic gratuities, anymore,\u201d says Tom Oliveri, owner of Peppercorn\u2019s Grille & Tavern at 455 Park Ave., Wormtown Brewery and Prezo Grille and Bar in Milford. \u201cI kind of polled my staff and asked them whether they wanted to roll the dice or wait and get their tips the following week with their paycheck.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming choice among his staff, Oliveri says, was to bite the bullet and see what happens by eliminating the group tip. He admits there is a risk, at least in the short-term, of large groups still assuming their tip is automatically included in their check. In that case, the server would leave the table with nothing but the money to pay the tab.\n\n\u201cOne thing is people are used to having a check with an automatic gratuity,\u201d Oliveri acknowledges. \u201cThey may not add a tip.\u201d\n\nTips are the life blood for servers in restaurants. Most earn a regular wage of well under $5 an hour. At Peppercorn\u2019s, Oliveri says his servers earn $2.63 an hour. In tips alone, a server can take home between $500-$1,000 in a good week.\n\n\u201cThey rely heavily on tips,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s foolish. You\u2019re hurting the servers.\u201d\n\nSeveral attempts to reach the IRS for comment on the new automatic tip rule have been unsuccessful.\n\nOliveri is not alone in doing away with automatic gratuities as a result of the new requirement. Jim Voyiatzis, co-owner of Coral Seafood at 225 Shrewsbury St., is making the switch. So, too, is Darden Restaurants Inc., which owns Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Red Lobster. There is an Olive Garden in Worcester at 7 Tobias Boland Way. Not far away in Millbury there is a LongHorn Steakhouse at The Shoppes at Blackstone Valley.\n\nDarden Restaurants Inc. made its move away from automatic tips Monday, Jan. 6 \u201cin order to ensure, to the extent we can, tips for our employees,\u201d according to spokesperson Rich Jeffers. The restaurant company is trying to encourage customers in large groups to tip their server by including suggested tip amounts on a separate section of the check. Customers can choose from 15, 18 or 20 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing several restaurants, about 100,\u201d Jeffers says. \u201cEmployees were seeing consisted tip levels.\u201d\n\nThe whole purpose of automatic gratuities was to try to make sure servers did not walk away from a large group empty-handed \u2013 or empty-pocketed.\n\n\u201cOften, when you have large parties you\u2019ve got folks that [tipping] may not be first and foremost on their minds,\u201d says Jeffers.\n\nOver at Coral Seafood, Voyiatzis says his servers, much like those at other restaurants, did not want to wait until their paycheck to receive their tips from large parties. Whether it affects how much they are tipped, now that it will not be automatically included, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Voyiatzis says, adding he has considered doing what Darden Restaurants has done by including suggested tips on checks. \u201cI had thought about that. That\u2019s something we might look at.\u201d\n\nBoth Voyiatzis and Oliveri acknowledge that group sales are not a large part of their businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass,\u201d says Oliveri, \u201cbut the majority of our parties aren\u2019t auto-gratuities. But a lot of restaurants in New York, they auto-gratuity everything.\u201d\n\nVoyiatzis, too, says the rule probably will not have a wildly adverse affect on his restaurant.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many [groups],\u201d he says. \u201cYou might get a few large parties a week, but it was not the case that it was a major part of our business.\u201d\n\n\n\nHave a story tip or idea?
