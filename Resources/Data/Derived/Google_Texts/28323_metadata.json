The national media spotlight largely faded.\n\nMore than 2 \u00bd years after Madison was indicted on multiple charges of aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape, jury selection for his trial is set to begin Monday in a Cleveland courtroom. He faces the death penalty if convicted.\n\nJury selection is expected to stretch into next week, and prosecutors have lined up at least 50 witnesses that could take an additional three weeks to question. Madison\u2019s attorneys aren\u2019t commenting on what evidence or witnesses they plan to present, but attorney David Grant said last week that if Madison is convicted, the defense team will work to save his life during the mitigation phase of the trial.\n\nIn Ohio, a jury can recommend the death penalty, but the ultimate decision is left to the judge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to do whatever we have to do,\u201d Grant said.\n\nThe case involving Madison, 38, began with a cable television worker reporting to police in July 2013 a putrid smell coming from a garage shared by Madison at the apartment building where he lived. Once inside, police found the decaying body of a woman wrapped in garbage bags that were sealed closed with tape. The next day, searchers found bodies in the basement of a vacant house and in the backyard of a home close to where Madison lived.\n\nMadison was arrested at his mother\u2019s home in Cleveland after a two-hour standoff. Cuyahoga County prosecutors have said Madison confessed to killing one of the women and disposing her body and to disposing the body of a second woman. He told investigators he couldn\u2019t remember killing the other two women, blaming his faulty memory on drugs and beer.\n\nCoincidentally, attorneys on Tuesday will present oral arguments to the Ohio Supreme Court on why Sowell shouldn\u2019t be put to death. The bodies of 11 women were found in and around his Cleveland home in 2009. He was convicted two years later.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "author": "Mark Gillispie", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "title": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/03/trial_for_ohio_man_charged_with_killing_3_women_set_to_begin/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ohio-bodies.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ohio-bodies.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Trial for Ohio man charged with killing 3 women set to begin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Once inside, police found the decaying body of a woman wrapped in garbage bags that were sealed closed with tape.\nHe told investigators he couldn\u2019t remember killing the other two women, blaming his faulty memory on drugs and beer.\nCuyahoga County prosecutors have said Madison confessed to killing one of the women and disposing her body and to disposing the body of a second woman.\nThe bodies of 11 women were found in and around his Cleveland home in 2009.\nCoincidentally, attorneys on Tuesday will present oral arguments to the Ohio Supreme Court on why Sowell shouldn\u2019t be put to death."}
