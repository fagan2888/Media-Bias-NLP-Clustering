Joe Gliniewicz was not, in fact, a murder in the line of duty but \u201ca carefully staged suicide.\u201d\n\nFor Fox News and other conservative media outlets, Gliniewicz\u2019s death was just but one of several anecdotal truths pointing to a deadly repercussion of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nOn his Thursday show, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith called out those conservative commentators who jumped to use the cop\u2019s death as a tool to undermine the anti-police brutality movement.\n\n\u201cThink of the narrative that came out of that from so many, many places,\u2019it\u2019s the fault of the Black Lives Matter movement\u2019 and all of this stuff that was just\u2013 it really turned up the rhetoric and it really was factually wrong,\u201d Smith said, rebuking his colleagues\u2019 rush to judgement.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of the news,\u201d Smith admonished. \u201cIt will run you over.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Post\u2019s Radley Balko\u2019s partial list of pundits who used Gliniewicz\u2019s staged death to prop up a so-called \u201cwar on cops\u201d narrative, at least seven of Smith\u2019s Fox News colleagues are guilty of getting ahead of the news \u2014 as Shep would say.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a police officer's death is ruled a suicide, not a murder, Fox News has a lot to answer for VIDEO", "title": "Shepard Smith calls out Fox News colleagues for dishonest Black Lives Matter smears: \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of the news \u2026 It will run you over\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a police officer's death is ruled a suicide, not a murder, Fox News has a lot to answer for VIDEO", "title": "Shepard Smith calls out Fox News colleagues for dishonest Black Lives Matter smears: \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of the news \u2026 It will run you over\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/06/shepard_smith_calls_out_fox_news_colleagues_for_dishonest_black_lives_matter_smears_dont_get_ahead_of_the_news_it_will_run_you_over/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shep_smith.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a police officer's death is ruled a suicide, not a murder, Fox News has a lot to answer for VIDEO", "title": "Shepard Smith calls out Fox News colleagues for dishonest Black Lives Matter smears: \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of the news \u2026 It will run you over\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shep_smith.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, black lives matter, Conservatives, Fox News, Lt.
