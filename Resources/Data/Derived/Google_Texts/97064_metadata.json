Thanks to the McCarran\u2013Ferguson Act, which was passed in 1945, each of the fifty states has the exclusive power to license health insurance within a state\u2019s own borders even if, in doing so, a state directly burdens interstate commerce by shutting out-of-state insurers out of the market\u2026 The McCarran\u2013Ferguson Act essentially sets up fifty separate state monopoly or oligopoly markets, each with its own set of state licensed health insurance providers.\n\nAdvocates for a free market in health care, such as Prof. Calabresi and Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN), have long argued that only free market solutions can improve the performance of our health care and health insurance industries, and that the first step that must be taken is the repeal of the crony capitalist-friendly McCarran-Ferguson Act. In 2013, Roe introduced a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at accomplish such a repeal, but it went nowhere.\n\nSo, despite moves by state legislators in several states to allow out-of-state health insurers to compete in their states, at present 50 cozy state health insurance oligopolies are operating. Meanwhile, recent financial statements indicate that the health insurance industry is doing very well.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, \u201cU.S. health insurers that waged a campaign against Obamacare hit an all-time high on the stock market Wednesday after UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) said it would add hundreds of thousands of new customers because of the law.\u201d Bloomberg adds that the company\u2019s \u201cshares have more than tripled since April 2010, the month after the law was passed, compared with a 72 percent gain in S&P 500.\u201d\n\nHigh profitability in the health insurance industry is not limited to UnitedHealth. \u201cAetna Inc. (AET), Anthem Inc., Humana Inc. (HUM) and Cigna Corp. (CI) all also hit record highs Wednesday. Together, the companies make up the biggest for-profit insurance providers in the industry,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the profitable state health insurance market lurched from a very loose oligopoly to a virtual monopoly when a law sponsored by then-State Senator and current Democratic U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, SB 711, went into effect in 1995.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a subsidiary of the publicly traded subsidiary of Wellpoint Inc., was one of 26 companies licensed by the New Hampshire Department of Insurance licensed to compete for the health insurance business of New Hampshire residents in 1994. Representatives of that company, according to Conrad Meier, writing at Heartland.org in 2004, encouraged Shaheen to introduce and champion SB 711 into law.\n\nThat law, as Meier wrote:\n\nRequired insurance companies to guarantee-issue individual health insurance policies. Companies were prohibited from denying coverage to any person or eligible dependent. Imposed price controls, in the form of modified community rating, on individual health insurance premiums. Premiums could be modified or adjusted only for age, not health status. Prohibited insurers from increasing premiums by more than 25 percent until January 2000.\n\nAs Watchdog reported, by 2004 \u201cthe number of insurers in New Hampshire decreased from 26 to five: SB711 drove 21 health insurance providers out of the state.\n\nGolden Rule was one company forced out of New Hampshire by Shaheen\u2019s bill, according to Lee Tooman, at the time one of the company\u2019s vice presidents.\n\n\u201cIn 1994, Golden Rule had a thriving business in New Hampshire. We insured a lot of people and paid millions of dollars of claims expeditiously and accurately. But Blue Cross complained that carriers like Golden Rule were doing great harm in New Hampshire. In fact, the only entity suffering harm was Blue Cross,\u201d Tooman told Meier in 2014.\n\nAs Meier wrote at the time:\n\n\u201cJeanne Shaheen\u2019s 1994 reforms ended up freeing Blue Cross of its money-losing business and handed it a virtual monopoly in the individual market,\u201d Tooman continued. \u201cBlue Cross returned to the individual market, able itself now to \u2018cherry pick.\u2019 But it still has the provider discounts no one else can touch.\u201d \u201cTen years after \u2018reform,'\u201d he said, \u201cthe market has not recovered.\u201d\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield quickly became the dominant player in the New Hampshire health insurance market, as others were forced out.\n\nBy 2014, four years after Obamacare passed (the outcome in the U.S. Senate was dependent on Shaheen\u2019s vote in favor) Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was, in effect, the only health insurance provider in the state of New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire is a market crying out for competition,\u201d Thomas D. Policelli, CEO of Minuteman Health Inc., said in December 2013. \u201cThe market there is effectively controlled by a monopoly.\u201d He was announcing his company\u2019s intention to enter the New Hampshire health insurance market and compete with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nSince then, four additional new competitors have entered the market. So far, however, it looks as if none have made much of a dent on Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s stranglehold.\n\nAnd Minuteman Health\u2019s entry into the New Hampshire health insurance market is not exactly the kind of free market competition most economists had in mind.\n\nAs New Hampshire Business Review (NHBR) reported recently, the company is \u201ca member owned CO-OP which has already received an $88 million [federal] loan to offer policies on the exchange in Massachusetts\u201d It \u201cwill get a $67 million federal loan\u201d to compete in New Hampshire, the magazine adds.\n\nNHBR also noted that \u201c[t]he U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be financing the expansion through a little-known ACA program to encourage the formation of CO-OPs (Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans), which operate like mutual savings banks. So far, HHS has sponsored at least two dozen of these plans, including one in Maine.\u201d\n\nAccording to Open Secrets, Shaheen\u2019s successful 2014 re-election campaign received $110,783 in contributions from individuals and PACs associated with the insurance industry, and $194,215 from individuals and PACs classified as health professionals.\n\nAmong the health insurance executives who donated to Shaheen\u2019s campaign was Mary Beth Donahue, Vice President of American Health Insurance Plans, \u201cthe national trade association of the health insurance industry,\u201d who contributed the maximum $2,600, according to FEC records.\n\nMs. Donahue served as the chief of staff to Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala when she served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s cabinet.\n\nThe conservative group Americans For Prosperity highlighted Shaheen\u2019s record of passing legislation that pushed health insurance companies out of New Hampshire in this July 2014 independent expenditure commercial. But Shaheen\u2019s opponent in her 2014 re-election campaign, former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown (R-MA), couldn\u2019t capitalize on the issue.\n\nYou can see the AFP ad here:\n\nShaheen defeated Brown by a comfortable 3-point margin, 51.6 percent to 48.4 percent in November 2014.\n\nWhile free market supporters around the country are hoping the New Hampshire state legislators succeed with their bills to allow out-of-state health insurance companies to compete for business in the state, the institutional forces arrayed against such common sense solutions to the health care problems arising from Obamacare remain formidable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NH state legislators are considering two bills that \u201cwould allow individuals... to purchase health insurance from out-of-state companies.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "NH state legislators are considering two bills that \u201cwould allow individuals... to purchase health insurance from out-of-state companies.\u201d", "title": "New Hampshire Legislators Promise Free Market Health Insurance to Fix Obamacare Mess - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obamacare-website-laptop-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-23T04:33:28-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/22/new-hampshire-legislators-promise-free-market-health-insurance-to-fix-obamacare-mess/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NH state legislators are considering two bills that \u201cwould allow individuals... to purchase health insurance from out-of-state companies.\u201d", "title": "New Hampshire Legislators Promise Free Market Health Insurance to Fix Obamacare Mess - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obamacare-website-laptop-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "andy sanborn, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Conrad Meier, Golden Rule, Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire,Big Government, Obamacare,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-22T19:49:58-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T04:33:28-07:00", "tag": "New Hampshire", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1248\"", "article_summary": "And Minuteman Health\u2019s entry into the New Hampshire health insurance market is not exactly the kind of free market competition most economists had in mind.\nAmong the health insurance executives who donated to Shaheen\u2019s campaign was Mary Beth Donahue, Vice President of American Health Insurance Plans, \u201cthe national trade association of the health insurance industry,\u201d who contributed the maximum $2,600, according to FEC records.\nSo, despite moves by state legislators in several states to allow out-of-state health insurers to compete in their states, at present 50 cozy state health insurance oligopolies are operating.\nThe roots of the state health insurance monopolies and oligopolies can be directly traced to a federal law.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for Alabama,\u201d Sanborn said, \u201cit should be good enough for New Hampshire.\u201dIntroducing free market principles to health insurance, however, is no simple matter."}
