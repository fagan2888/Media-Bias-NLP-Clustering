Every Monday, we ask a question via Facebook and Twitter and then post the responses from our Facebook \"likers\" and Twitter followers in this column. Well-known Milwaukee movers and shakers will contribute, too.\n\nA recent conversation in the editorial office prompted this week's odd Social Circle question and the OnMilwaukee.com editors were pleased by how seriously some took it.\n\nAnd yet others took the question to a new, equally-amusing place. Feel free to add your thoughts via the Talkback feature.\n\nClassic Slice, Transfer, Pizza Man and other imaginative, local pizzerias: you taking notes?\n\nEric Cooper: \"Dates. To me, dates, even though a fruit, are candy to me. They are oh so good.\"\n\nMichelle Drewek: \"Pepperoni and chocolate coins.\"\n\nHelene Feider: \"Bit-O-Honey shavings in the crust. Or ice cream.\"\n\nElisha Ann Fields: \"M&Ms on Dairy Queen's ice cream pizza.\"\n\nYana Glik Gainizamanov: \"How about someone at OnMilwaukee.com is having hormonal disbalance?\"\n\nSteve Gondek: \"I consider bacon candy.\"\n\nBeth Jaworksi: \"In Germany I saw gummy bear pizza.\"\n\nKirk Jonssen: \"Candied ginger?\"\n\nJennie Duehr Jontry: \"Mozzarella-flavored Jelly Bellies.\"\n\nSarah Klein: \"Peeps.\"\n\nElba Lopez: \"Milky Ways.\"\n\nColleen McShane: \"Fruit slice gummy candy and pineapple.\"\n\nBrian Patrick Maguire: \"Are we putting the candy on before or after baking it? That would make a difference. Butterfinger and bacon pizza might be pretty good. Or Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and bacon.\"\n\nDaniel Mayeshiba: \"Boston Baked Beans. Or a Hawaiian pizza with cherry coins on it.\"\n\nDan Polley: \"Anything chocolate if you made a dessert pizza. Maybe Snickers and honey crisp apple with a caramel drizzle.\"\n\nMichelle Rangel: \"Butterfingers.\"\n\nSteve Rickun: \"Black licorice.\"\n\nBonnie Ristow: \"It depends on if this is a lunch / dinner pizza or a dessert pizza.\"\n\nAlex Stafford: \"Oreo cookies would be better.\"\n\nSteven Wroblewski: \"Big League chew.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent conversation in the editorial office prompted this odd Social Circle question.
