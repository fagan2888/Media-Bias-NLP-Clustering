Postal\n\nInsuranceNewsNet\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014 Adding managed volatility overlays to funds that underlie variable annuities \u201cmay raise important disclosure, suitability and other concerns,\u201d according to Norm Champ, director of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Investment Management.\n\nChamp made his remarks at the 32nd annual ALI CLE 2014 Conference on Life Insurance Company Products in Washington. He noted that \u201cif an underlying equity fund is changed to add a managed volatility component after a contract owner has allocated contract value to that fund, the [SEC] staff generally believes that insurers should consider whether adding downside protection is redundant with the living benefits contract owners may have already purchased and/or suppresses the potential for gains that may have motivated the original equity investments.\u201d\n\nChamp\u2019s remarks echo similar concerns expressed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) earlier this year. On March 17, the NYDFS fined AXA Equitable $20 million. The fine was part of a consent order that alleged that AXA filed plan of operations amendments that did not adequately discuss the significance of implementing a managed volatility strategy, called the AXA Tactical Manager Strategy or \u201cATM Strategy,\u201d to underlying funds that \u201csubstantially changed its variable annuity products.\u201d\n\nAccording to the consent order, the ATM Strategy \u201cmay have the effect of suppressing the value of certain guarantee benefits\u201d that are available when the policyholder\u2019s account value rises. The consent order goes on to note that if the NYDFS \u201chad been aware of the extent of the changes, it may have required that the existing policyholders affirmatively opt in to the ATM Strategy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Champ stated that that use of managed volatility strategies at the fund level in connection with contracts that provide living benefits may, in some cases, \u201cresult in limited benefits to contract owners who have already paid for protections against market loss, particularly to the extent that they limit upside earning potential.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Richard T. Choi, a lawyer with Carlton Fields Jorden Burt in Washington and co-chair of the conference, managing volatility \u201cdoes not necessarily equate to lower overall long-term performance.\u201d To the contrary, \u201cmanaging volatility may result in superior long-term performance since the dips are not as severe, which means less ground has to be made up to recover from losses,\u201d Choi said. \u201cIt\u2019s an appropriate strategy for variable annuities, which are long-term investments.\u201d\n\nChoi added that the NYDFS threat of imposing a requirement that a policyholder affirmatively opt in to a variable annuity underlying fund change involving a managed volatility overlay would contradict the federal securities laws. \u201cCongress preempted state regulation of mutual funds in 1996,\u201d Choi said, \u201cand such a requirement would effectively enable New York to prevent a fund from implementing investment strategy changes approved by the fund\u2019s independent board acting in the best interests of the fund\u2019s shareholders. This is not what Congress had in mind.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the NYDFS position could create mischief in the area of fund substitutions approved by the SEC. \u201cIn 1970, Congress mandated that the SEC exercise its judgment in approving substitutions on behalf of investors on grounds that investors are seldom in a position to judge the merits of the substituted security,\u201d Choi said. \u201cRequiring policyholders to opt in would, in effect, turn this congressional policy on its head and for no good reason since VA policyholders typically have a wide range of investment options to which to transfer their assets if they so desire, both before and after a substitution.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen what will come of the SEC\u2019s review of this area, and how the SEC will react to the positions expressed by the NYDFS.\n\nArthur D.
