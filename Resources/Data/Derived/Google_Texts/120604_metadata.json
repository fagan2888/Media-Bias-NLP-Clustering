The guidelines are extensive and include a detailed checklist as well as step-by-step instructions.\n\nBut researchers who examined 492 unique hospital policies found that the policies are inconsistent and many organizations have not fully implemented the guidelines.\n\nFor example, more than 20 percent of hospitals don't require clinicians to check a patient's temperature; 56 percent don't assess a patient's blood pressure; and only 33 percent require an expert in neurology or neurosurgery to determine brain death. In addition, 150 policies fail to mention who could determine brain death.\n\nThe danger is that without a standard policy, hospital staff--especially a less experienced clinician--could mistakenly mispronounce someone brain dead.\n\n\"This is truly one of those matters of life and death, and we want to make sure this is done right every single time,\" lead author David Greer, M.D., a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, told NPR.\n\nGreer helped write the 2010 guidelines and told the publication that the potential danger is that a hospital could declare someone brain dead who later recovers some neurological function. \"That would be horrific if that were the case,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with U.S. News & World Report, Greer said it may be time for the Joint Commission to make it part of the hospital accreditation process to ensure that hospitals uniformly update their policies and follow the AAN guidelines.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the NPR report\n\n- check out the U.S. News & World Report story", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new\u00a0study\u00a0in\u00a0JAMA Neurology\u00a0finds that policies to determine brain death vary significantly among hospitals in the United States and most don't fully follow national guidelines.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new\u00a0study\u00a0in\u00a0JAMA Neurology\u00a0finds that policies to determine brain death vary significantly among hospitals in the United States and most don't fully follow national guidelines.", "title": "Policies on brain death vary significantly by hospital", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/policies-brain-death-vary-significantly-hospital/2015-12-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Brain Dead,David Greer,JAMA Neurology,Neurology,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "But researchers who examined 492 unique hospital policies found that the policies are inconsistent and many organizations have not fully implemented the guidelines.\nA new study in JAMA Neurology finds that policies to determine brain death vary significantly among hospitals in the United States and most don't fully follow national guidelines.\nThe American Academy of Neurology (AAN) issued new guidelines in 2010 that every hospital should follow when declaring patients brain-dead.\nThe danger is that without a standard policy, hospital staff--especially a less experienced clinician--could mistakenly mispronounce someone brain dead.\nIn addition, 150 policies fail to mention who could determine brain death."}
