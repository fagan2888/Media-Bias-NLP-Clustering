Gordon \u2014 killed in Normandy in 1944, then mistakenly buried as a German soldier \u2014 will soon be going home to his family.\n\nBut don\u2019t thank the American military for this belated return. The Pentagon declined to act on his case, despite exhaustive research by civilian investigators that pointed to the location of his remains.\n\nInstead, Gordon\u2019s family and advocates used the same evidence to persuade French and German officials to exhume Gordon and identify him through DNA testing. That\u2019s right: the relatives of this U.S. soldier, who fought against the Germans, are relying on Germany to bring him back home.\n\nGordon\u2019s case is another example of breakdowns in the American system for finding and identifying tens of thousands of missing service members from past conflicts. More than 9,400 troops are buried as \u201cunknowns\u201d in American cemeteries around the world. Yet, as ProPublica and NPR recently reported, the Joint Prisoners of War/Missing in Action Accounting Command (J-PAC) rarely disinters any of those men to try to use DNA to identify them. On average, just 4 percent of such cases move forward.\n\nSeveral U.S. and international news outlets have written about Gordon\u2019s case, but ProPublica obtained a previously undisclosed J-PAC memo from April 2013 that, for the first time, reveals the agency\u2019s rationale for turning aside his family\u2019s entreaties. One J-PAC historian advised \u201cextreme caution\u201d on the case, saying that making an identification would require a \u201cmonumental\u201d amount of research about thousands of Americans and Germans killed in roughly the same area.\n\nA Pentagon review ordered by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of how the military is managing its mission to find and identify MIAs concludes next month.\n\nGordon\u2019s family benefited from a fluke of circumstance: Gordon was in a German cemetery in France, not an American one, allowing his case to advance without the U.S. military\u2019s participation.\n\nJed Henry, a filmmaker from Wisconsin whose grandfather served in Gordon\u2019s unit, took up Gordon\u2019s case in 2011. Henry scoured records, witness statements and various archives and pieced together evidence about Gordon\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nGordon\u2019s family knew only that he was killed in Normandy when a German shell hit his armored car in August 1944. Gordon\u2019s bloody wallet was sent home to his mother in Canada. (Gordon had Canadian citizenship, but he was born to American parents and decided to enlist in the U.S. Army.)\n\nHenry found paperwork revealing the Army had recovered the destroyed vehicle and two badly burned, unidentifiable bodies. They were buried as American unknowns.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Army dug up both sets of remains, finding they wore German clothing. Using fingerprints, one was identified as U.S. Army Pvt. James Bowman, who had been in the turret of the car next to Gordon.\n\nIt was impossible to use fingerprints to identify the other set of remains. The bones were given a number, X-356, for lack of a name. Because of the German clothing, they were turned over to the Germans, who interred them in a crypt in France.\n\nThat evidence was enough to persuade the French and German governments to exhume the remains last fall and test for DNA, but not the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cWhy is that we had enough evidence to convince the French and the Germans but not the Americans?\u201d Henry asked. \u201cWhy is the burden of proof in America so much higher? It\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "French and German officials agreed to help the soldier's family after the U.S. government abandoned its search", "title": "70 years later, U.S. soldier killed in Normandy returns home \u2014 no thanks to the Pentagon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "French and German officials agreed to help the soldier's family after the U.S. government abandoned its search", "title": "70 years later, U.S. soldier killed in Normandy returns home \u2014 no thanks to the Pentagon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/22/70_years_later_u_s_soldier_killed_in_normandy_is_finally_coming_home_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_144610109.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "French and German officials agreed to help the soldier's family after the U.S. government abandoned its search", "title": "70 years later, U.S. soldier killed in Normandy returns home \u2014 no thanks to the Pentagon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_144610109.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Megan McCloskey", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, France, Germany, M.I.A. soldiers, Normandy, Pentagon, ProPublica, U.S. Military", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Jed Henry, a filmmaker from Wisconsin whose grandfather served in Gordon\u2019s unit, took up Gordon\u2019s case in 2011.\nGordon\u2019s case is another example of breakdowns in the American system for finding and identifying tens of thousands of missing service members from past conflicts.\nGordon\u2019s family knew only that he was killed in Normandy when a German shell hit his armored car in August 1944.\nThe Pentagon declined to act on his case, despite exhaustive research by civilian investigators that pointed to the location of his remains.\nThat\u2019s right: the relatives of this U.S. soldier, who fought against the Germans, are relying on Germany to bring him back home."}
