The former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal spoke on Friday.\n\nCruz peppered his address with jokes, scriptural references and jabs at Obama and the Democratic frontrunner for 2016 Hillary Clinton. He said he was the best choice among the 17-strong Republican field because he would always do what he said he was going to do.\n\nAmong Cruz\u2019s jokes was a remark that he would like to see the Internal Revenue Service discontinued and its 90,000 employees used to guard the US-Mexico border.\n\nRubio, following Cruz, told the audience US economic growth was lagging because other countries were doing better at what the US set in motion but abandoned.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are dozens of countries that have learned from our example \u2026 so the first thing we must do is become globally competitive again. That\u2019s why we talk about tax reform.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered often during his 20-minute speech, and laughed at his jokes, though not as fervently as they did during Cruz\u2019s speech. Unlike Cruz, who appeared in shirtsleeves, Rubio, at 43 the youngest GOP candidate, wore a dark suit, white shirt and Republican-red tie.\n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics.com polls average puts Cruz at 7.3% support among likely Republican voters, enough for sixth place and a position in the next main debate. Rubio is a place ahead with 7.6% while Perry is 12th, with 1.3%.\n\nDonald Trump, the clear leader in polls concerning the Republican primary field, was not invited to the AFP event, which is sponsored by the vastly influential and wealthy Kochs. AFP president Tim Phillips told Reuters the group would keep its \u201claser\u201d focus on issues like tax reform, repealing the Affordable Care Act and fighting environmental regulations, no matter who was eventually elected.\n\n\u201cWe talked to people who had records that for the most part were philosophically aligned with us,\u201d Phillips said, adding that \u201cwe didn\u2019t want a cattle call\u201d while noting that Trump had appeared at past AFP events.\n\nAccording to AFP, 3,600 people attended. Among them, support for and criticism of Trump was evident.\n\n\u201cIt really frustrates me when he bashes other candidates \u2013 and they\u2019re really cheap personal shots,\u201d said Althea Cole, 31 and from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a county chairwoman for the campaign of the neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nCole, however, had some admiration for Trump\u2019s business success.\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s a jackass, but you don\u2019t get to be a billionaire by making friends,\u201d she said.\n\nA group of college students from a Republican club at Augustana College in South Dakota felt Trump was too much of a bully.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mocking it with his presence,\u201d said Cara Beck, 20, as she stood with five male students between 19 and 21 years of age. Their picks for president were Bush, former Ohio governor John Kasich, Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Rubio.\n\nRelated: Here's why Donald Trump won't win the Republican presidential nomination\n\nAmong a group of young Tennesseans, Trump garnered mixed reactions \u2013 plaudits for his business acumen, and boos for the reality TV star\u2019s showmanship.\n\n\u201cBoth my parents love Donald Trump but I can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said Michael Stooksbury, 18, who liked Paul best. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any experience, he\u2019s just an entertainer.\u201d\n\nThomas Parham, 29, said the US could benefit from Trump\u2019s business background.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather us be a financial empire than an empire of war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way we can take over country after country, territory after territory, without firing a single shot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Texas senator targets Obama orders, Planned Parenthood and Iran deal while Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio says US must \u2018become globally competitive\u2019 via tax reform", "application-name": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Texas senator targets Obama orders, Planned Parenthood and Iran deal while Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio says US must \u2018become globally competitive\u2019 via tax reform", "title": "Ted Cruz talks scripture and presidential crusade at Koch brothers-funded event", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/ted-cruz-koch-brothers-sponsored-event", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3c3c72f711eaa401dabed58c56da1bad84a5bd/0_114_3500_2106/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=070ad5a10bba80cf0b25205046e72961", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/22/ted-cruz-koch-brothers-sponsored-event?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/ted-cruz-koch-brothers-sponsored-event", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/22/ted-cruz-koch-brothers-sponsored-event?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3c3c72f711eaa401dabed58c56da1bad84a5bd/0_114_3500_2106/master/3500.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/22/ted-cruz-koch-brothers-sponsored-event?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Ted Cruz,US news,Republicans,US elections 2016,Donald Trump,Marco Rubio,Ben Carson,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "US news", "tag": "Ted Cruz,US news,Republicans,US elections 2016,Donald Trump,Marco Rubio,Ben Carson,Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-08-22T20:30:28.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:50:46.000Z"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3c3c72f711eaa401dabed58c56da1bad84a5bd/0_114_3500_2106/3500.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=97083d1e5528cceb298d86b7d594653e", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz,US news,Republicans,US elections 2016,Donald Trump,Marco Rubio,Ben Carson,Rand Paul"}, "article_summary": "The Texas senator and Republican presidential campaigner Ted Cruz on Saturday told a Koch brothers-sponsored gathering he would have a busy agenda on his first day in the White House.\nRubio, following Cruz, told the audience US economic growth was lagging because other countries were doing better at what the US set in motion but abandoned.\nCruz peppered his address with jokes, scriptural references and jabs at Obama and the Democratic frontrunner for 2016 Hillary Clinton.\nUnlike Cruz, who appeared in shirtsleeves, Rubio, at 43 the youngest GOP candidate, wore a dark suit, white shirt and Republican-red tie.\nFlorida senator Marco Rubio and former Texas governor Rick Perry were the others."}
