The natural thing would be to spread out.\u201d\n\nIn hope of gathering enough data to learn whether her impression is accurate, she\u2019s now working with people in Louisiana and Texas to expand the network \u2014 \u201cas far as I know, the only manatee sighting network in the country\u201d \u2014 to those states.\n\nLouisiana has averaged seven manatee sightings a year in the past 20 years, up from about one a year over the previous two decades, according to the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries\u2019 Natural Heritage Program, which has about 80 signs in areas where they\u2019ve been seen, asking people to report sightings.\n\nTexas gets perhaps one sighting report a year, said Steve Lightfoot of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.\n\nWork toward a four-state sighting network is preliminary so far, but the project is important, said Suzanne Smith, marine mammal stranding coordinator at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans and one of the people working with Carmichael.\n\n\u201cThey are an endangered species. So we need to work together to protect and conserve them,\u201d Smith said.\n\nManatees are vegetarians averaging about 10 feet long and about a ton in weight. Their greatest threats in the United States are habitat loss and boat propellers, which injure so many that biologists identify hundreds from their scars.\n\nThe population was estimated in the hundreds in 1967 but is now at least 4,800, the number counted late last January by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The commission won\u2019t give total population estimates.\n\n4,800\n\nNumber of manatees counted late last January by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\n\n1,387\n\nManatee sightings in Alabama from 2007 through November\n\n147\n\nSightings in Mississippi since 2006", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Manatee sighting network expands west", "title": "Manatee sighting network expands west", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/manatee-sighting-network-expands-west/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110__20150111_A4_ND11MANATEEALONEp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110__20150111_A4_ND11MANATEEALONEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T18:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:25:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd986e\"", "article_summary": "Since then, \u201cwe\u2019ve responded to dozens\u201d of strandings, said Ruth Carmichael, head of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab\u2019s Manatee Sighting Network for Alabama and Mississippi.\n\u201cI think things are changing, in the manatee population and in the environment,\u201d Carmichael said.\nTexas gets perhaps one sighting report a year, said Steve Lightfoot of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.\nThe natural thing would be to spread out.\u201dIn hope of gathering enough data to learn whether her impression is accurate, she\u2019s now working with people in Louisiana and Texas to expand the network \u2014 \u201cas far as I know, the only manatee sighting network in the country\u201d \u2014 to those states.\nSeven stranded manatees, also called sea cows, were reported along the Alabama coast before 2007, when a network to report strandings and sightings was created."}
