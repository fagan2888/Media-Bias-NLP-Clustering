Most Parents Think Their Kids Will Be Less Well Off\n\nThe report cited data from a member of the graduating MBA class, who blogged about the findings of a class survey he received from the university.\n\nBanking no longer sexy\n\nThis may not come as a surprise.\n\nEntry-level jobs on Wall Street are notoriously grueling: Young people work 90-hour weeks perfecting pitch books, scrolling through spreadsheets, or making presentations.\n\nMBA grads, of course, would typically join banks at the associate or vice-president level. But many of them started out their careers as interns and analysts and may not have shaken the memories.\n\nRelated: The 10 Fastest-Growing Jobs Right Now\n\nThe Harvard blog's author started out in M&A at Morgan Stanley, according to his bio. Now he's running a tech startup as well as a family healthcare business, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIndustry veterans, too, know that banking is no longer as sexy. Ex-Credit Suisse managing director Fred Lanes said: \"The opportunities elsewhere ... are more attractive outside of investment banking.\"\n\nAnd then there's the buyside\n\nThat doesn't mean that bright Harvard MBA-holders are leaving finance altogether.\n\nMany young financiers, after putting in their time at investment banks, make the jump to the \"buyside\" \u2014 hedge funds or private-equity firms.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that many MBA students are now only interested in becoming activist investors like Bill Ackman or Carl Icahn.\n\nAckman's Pershing Square even holds an annual investing competition at Columbia as part of its recruiting efforts.\n\nEx-Merrill Lynch analyst and Financial Times writer Sujeet Indap published a study on Wednesday on where his banking analyst class from the year 2000 now work.\n\nOver half the class, he found, had taken a break at some point to earn graduate degrees, two-thirds of which were MBAs. More than 40% of the analyst class now work in private equity or in the hedge fund/investment management industry.\n\nLess than 20% still work at investment banks.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nRead more from Business Insider:\n\nDonald Trump's campaign has reportedly erupted into 'civil war'\n\nThis is why Tesla's 'sculptural work of art' back seat in the Model X is so tricky\n\nEveryone was shocked when George W.
