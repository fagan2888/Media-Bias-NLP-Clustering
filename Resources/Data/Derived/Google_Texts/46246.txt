CHERRY HILLS VILLAGE, Colo. â€” Phil Mickelson has withdrawn from the BMW Championship, just three days after saying it was the one FedEx Cup playoff event he wanted to play.

In a release early Saturday from his management company, Mickelson says his goal is to rest and prepare for the Ryder Cup on Sept. 26-28 in Scotland.

Mickelson shot 76 on Friday at Cherry Hills and was 14 shots out of the lead. He needed to finish fourth to have a chance to advance to the Tour Championship next week. Mickelson says without a chance to contend at East Lake, it was more important to be ready for the Ryder Cup.

Mickelson won the 1990 U.S. Amateur at Cherry Hills. He has said he did not like the PGA Tour going four straight weeks of FedEx Cup events. Typically, there is a one-week break.

Mickelson failed to win a PGA Tour event this season for only the third time since his first full year in 1993.
