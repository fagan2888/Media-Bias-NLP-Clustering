Trainer Bob Baffert watched from well past the finish line.\n\n\u201cWhen he went by us after going around there he looked like he was just still floating over the race track like he normally does,\u201d he said.\n\nSince arriving Tuesday, the 3-year-colt has had a jog and two gallops. American Pharoah faces seven rivals Saturday in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown winner and first since Affirmed in 1978.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all excited,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cThe anxiety is starting to build up. The next time he\u2019s on that track, it\u2019ll be in front of 90,000 \u2014 wait, there\u2019s still 8,200 tickets left. But I recommend you might want to scoop those tickets up. Everything looks good. I think he\u2019s going to run his race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "American Pharoah gallops for final time before Belmont Stakes", "title": "American Pharoah gallops for final time before Belmont Stakes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/american-pharoah-gallops-for-final-time-before-belmont-stakes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_091605_american-pharoah.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_091605_american-pharoah.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T09:14:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T07:48:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 American Pharoah took a final gallop around Belmont Park on Friday before he attempts to win the Belmont Stakes and become the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years.\nAmerican Pharoah faces seven rivals Saturday in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown winner and first since Affirmed in 1978.\nI think he\u2019s going to run his race.\u201d\nThe Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner looked fresh and ready for his morning run but was held to an easy lap around the 1 1/2-mile oval by exercise rider Jorge Alvarez.\n\u201cWhen he went by us after going around there he looked like he was just still floating over the race track like he normally does,\u201d he said."}
