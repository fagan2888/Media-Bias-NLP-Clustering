The fact that Affordable Care Act enrollment managed to exceed projections, giving the party a much-needed policy and political victory, gave Dems something to brag about for a change.\n\nAnd as Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) noted , it was soon followed by another development that brought smiles to Democratic faces: the release of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-Wis.) budget plan.\n\n\u201d[The political conditions are] changing. If you\u2019ve been around awhile, and I\u2019ve been around awhile, you can sense it,\u201d Durbin said . \u201dYou\u2019re not going to turn away seven or 10 million people from insurance coverage \u2013 doesn\u2019t work anymore. And then comes Ryan. Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan, for reminding us what Republicans would do if they had control.\u201d\n\nHow excited are Democrats about the far-right Ryan plan ? President Obama devoted much of his weekly address over the weekend to highlighting its provisions, making the case that it \u201cshrinks opportunity and makes it harder for Americans who work hard to get ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican budget begins by handing out massive tax cuts to households making more than $1 million a year. Then, to keep from blowing a hole in the deficit, they\u2019d have to raise taxes on middle-class families with kids. Next, their budget forces deep cuts to investments that help our economy create jobs, like education and scientific research.\n\n\u201cNow, they won\u2019t tell you where these cuts will fall. But compared to my budget, if they cut everything evenly, then within a few years, about 170,000 kids will be cut from early education programs. About 200,000 new mothers and kids will be cut off from programs to help them get healthy food. Schools across the country will lose funding that supports 21,000 special education teachers. And if they want to make smaller cuts to one of these areas, that means larger cuts in others.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Paul Ryan didn't just release a budget plan for no particular reason; he also packaged a Democratic election-year message for the rest of 2014.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dems-thank-you-thank-you-congressman", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Paul Ryan didn't just release a budget plan for no particular reason; he also packaged a Democratic election-year message for the rest of 2014.", "title": "Dems: 'Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dems-thank-you-thank-you-congressman", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap78883987434.jpg?itok=k3xwSOJe", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dems-thank-you-thank-you-congressman", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap78883987434.jpg?itok=T1cJE2X1", "height": 553}, "title": "Dems: 'Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Paul Ryan didn't just release a budget plan for no particular reason; he also packaged a Democratic election-year message for the rest of 2014."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-07T08:39:01-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Dems: 'Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan'", "tags": "budgets,dick-durbin,economy,election-2014,elections,paul-ryan,poverty,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/07/2014 08:39:01 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dems-thank-you-thank-you-congressman"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Paul Ryan didn't just release a budget plan for no particular reason; he also packaged a Democratic election-year message for the rest of 2014.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Poverty, Elections, Election 2014, Budgets, Dick Durbin, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan, for reminding us what Republicans would do if they had control.\u201dHow excited are Democrats about the far-right Ryan plan ?\nBut compared to my budget, if they cut everything evenly, then within a few years, about 170,000 kids will be cut from early education programs.\nNext, their budget forces deep cuts to investments that help our economy create jobs, like education and scientific research.\nAnd if they want to make smaller cuts to one of these areas, that means larger cuts in others.\nAbout 200,000 new mothers and kids will be cut off from programs to help them get healthy food."}
