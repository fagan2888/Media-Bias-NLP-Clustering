That system came out more than a month ago, but, according to the analytics firm Mixpanel, yesterday was the first day more than half of users were registered as using it. It overtook iOS 7 only last week. Before that, it had lingered in the 45-percent area for weeks.\n\nLast year, iPhone and iPad users upgraded in droves to the company\u2019s new operating system, iOS 7. Just a week after its release, more than half had moved to the new system. A month after, more than 75 percent had made the jump.\n\nThis is more than a hiccup for Apple. The company promises that its hardware and software \u201cjust work,\u201d but that tight integration requires consumers to upgrade every year. Perhaps this indicates more and more people sticking with older hardware rather than buying the newest phones\u2014and avoiding the software upgrade due to worries it won't work on their older device. The chart also includes phones so old they can\u2019t upgrade at all. The premier Apple blogger John Gruber called the lagging upgrades \u201cvery worrisome,\u201d adding that they were \u201ca canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator that casual users no longer trust Apple with major iOS updates.\u201d\n\nIs that true? It\u2019s not as though iPhone users have always been thrilled to install a new Apple concoction. In the fall of 2012, many balked at the new version of iOS\u2014the sixth\u2014after it removed Google Maps and replaced it with a mistake-ridden Apple-made clone. But even that year, iOS 6 upgrade rates had still overtaken the 60-percent mark a month after release\u2014a milestone iOS 8 has yet to reach. Despite all the Maps hoopla, consumers still installed it.\n\nSo we know something of what a software-associated rejection of a new iOS looks like. It looks better than this year\u2019s pattern.\n\nGruber eventually came around to another view, though\u2014one that I\u2019m inclined to agree with. It\u2019s not the software itself, he says, but the storage space that it requires. Upgrading an iPhone \u201cover the air\u201d (that is, not connecting it to iTunes) requires some five gigabytes of space on the phone. Who has five gigabytes of space on their phone?\n\nNote this is only \u201cover the air,\u201d though. If you connect your phone to iTunes, it will upgrade it remotely, without requiring much extra space on the device. But many users long ago stopped thinking of their phone as tethered to a computer. Unless Apple reduces the size of that over-the-air upgrade, I wonder if an overwhelming upgrade to iOS 8 will ever happen.\n\nSo taste isn\u2019t holding the new iOS back\u2014only terabytes. And while it\u2019s not the \u201ccanary-in-the-coal-mine\u201d situation proclaimed at first by Gruber, with consumers distrusting Apple en masse, I do think the lagging iPhone upgrades this time around reflect an infrastructural crisis for Apple. Most iPhones still ship with a default 16 gigs. That\u2019s just not very much. The new iPhone 5Cs ship with only eight default gigabytes.\n\nIf most users have switched to upgrading their phone over the air\u2014and most, this chart hints, have\u2014and if Apple continues to make phones with so little storage by default, then it will see its previously pristine upgrade rates plunge, and the nature of its products change.\n\nOne final note: These kinds of rates do vary wildly from ecosystem to ecosystem. It\u2019s apples-to-oranges, or at least free-mobile-to-paid-desktop, but Windows 8 hasn\u2019t even reached 14 percent of the market yet. It was released in 2012. And Windows XP, a 13-year-old piece of software, is still installed on almost 24 percent of PCs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An exclusive graph shows just how much worse this year&#39;s installation cycle is going than last year&#39;s.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "An exclusive graph shows just how much worse this year&#39;s installation cycle is going than last year&#39;s.", "title": "The Upgrade Gap: Apple's New iOS Problem in One Chart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/Mixpanel_Trends_iOS7_vs_iOS8/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-upgrade-gap-apples-new-ios-problem-in-one-chart/381714/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "This year, the release of Apple\u2019s newest mobile operating system, iOS 8, isn\u2019t quite going like that.\nUnless Apple reduces the size of that over-the-air upgrade, I wonder if an overwhelming upgrade to iOS 8 will ever happen.\nLast year, iPhone and iPad users upgraded in droves to the company\u2019s new operating system, iOS 7.\nBut even that year, iOS 6 upgrade rates had still overtaken the 60-percent mark a month after release\u2014a milestone iOS 8 has yet to reach.\nPerhaps this indicates more and more people sticking with older hardware rather than buying the newest phones\u2014and avoiding the software upgrade due to worries it won't work on their older device."}
