The Court issued three opinions \u2014 Riley v. California, United States v. Wurie, and American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Aereo \u2014 that taken together served as an endorsement of cell phone privacy and a condemnation of the online retransmission of TV shows to paid subscribers.\n\nThe months leading up to the decisions had been a rough ride for the justices. Following oral arguments for these cases, they were called \u201cblack-robed techno-fogeys.\u201d They were ranked based on technological incompetence. Their discussions of \u201cthe cloud\u201d became the soundtrack for a comical YouTube video, and the blogosphere cringed when Chief Justice John Roberts learned, for the first time, that some people carry more than one cell phone. So, was all that nervous taunting warranted?\n\nWell, yes, but not for the reasons we thought.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that the justices are old fogeys. The problem is that the justices were groomed in a field that emphasizes reasoning by analogy. And analogies were critical in these cases: The Aereo decision, for example, hinged on whether the company was more like an equipment provider or a cable company; the Riley and Wurie decisions addressed whether cell phones are sufficiently analogous to wallets. But emerging technology is, by definition, about breaking away from history. Perhaps reason by analogy hamstrings innovation, or perhaps it promotes impartial decision-making. In any event, it helps explain why the justices sometimes say such silly things.\n\nYears of tortured analogies at oral arguments culminated most recently with this week\u2019s cases, but a look back at decisions from years past reveals an abundance of strained analogizing. In past arguments, computers were analogized to typewriters, phone books and calculators. Video games were compared to films, comic books and Grimm\u2019s fairy tales. Text messages were analogized to letters to the editor. A risk-hedging method was compared to horse-training and the alphabet. EBay was likened to a Ferris wheel, and also to the process of introducing a baker to a grocer. The list goes on.\n\n\u201cI think there are very, very few things that you cannot find an analogue to in pre-digital age searches,\u201d Justice Breyer said during the Riley oral argument. \u201cAnd the problem in almost all instances is quantity and how far afield you\u2019re likely to be going.\u201d For the high court, a prior century or two apparently isn\u2019t too far afield.\n\nThe justices are tickled by these analogies. Justice Kennedy, for example, appears blissfully unaware of the new definition of \u201ctroll,\u201d and covered for his ignorance with a joke during oral argument for eBay v. MercExchange: \u201cIs the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique?\u201d This raised eyebrows in the patent industry, where \u201cpatent troll\u201d is a stock phrase. Justice Breyer, during the the Riley oral argument, interrupted a discussion about the GPS capabilities of smartphones with another analogy joke: \u201cI don\u2019t want to admit it, but my wife might put a little note [with directions] in my pocket.\u201d (Is the smartphone supposed to be like his wife? Unclear.)\n\nJustice Alito, arguably the most analogy-obsessed of the bunch, best summed up the Court\u2019s historical handicap when he teased Scalia in 2011, saying: \u201cI think what Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison thought about video games. Did he enjoy them?\u201d\n\nBut this fixation on technological analogies is more than just an idle curiosity. It has real-world implications that are not to be underestimated. Recent years have borne out that if a technology under scrutiny cannot be analogized to a historically protected invention, it may be doomed. In 2006, for example, Chief Justice Roberts doubted that eBay was an actual invention. He asked the lawyer, Seth Waxman, what the invention of eBay was, and when Waxman explained it as an electronic market, Chief Justice Roberts responded flippantly, saying, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like he invented the internal combustion engine or anything. It\u2019s very vague.\u201d\n\nWhen Waxman pushed back at Roberts, pointing out that \u201cI\u2019m not a software developer and I have reason to believe that neither is Your Honor,\u201d Roberts fully explicated his contempt for the technology. \u201cI may not be a software developer, but as I read the invention [of eBay], it\u2019s displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them.\u201d He next said about the multibillion-dollar Internet corporation: \u201cI might have been able to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If one thing has become clear in recent years, it's that SCOTUS struggles with technology", "title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s baffling tech illiteracy is becoming a problem", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If one thing has become clear in recent years, it's that SCOTUS struggles with technology", "title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s baffling tech illiteracy is becoming a problem", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/the_supreme_courts_baffling_tech_illiteracy_is_becoming_a_big_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/scalia_roberts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If one thing has become clear in recent years, it's that SCOTUS struggles with technology", "title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s baffling tech illiteracy is becoming a problem", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/scalia_roberts.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Selina MacLaren", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aereo, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Editor's Picks, John Roberts, SCOTUS, Stephen Breyer, technology, The Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In 2006, for example, Chief Justice Roberts doubted that eBay was an actual invention.\n\u201cI think there are very, very few things that you cannot find an analogue to in pre-digital age searches,\u201d Justice Breyer said during the Riley oral argument.\nTopics: aereo, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Editor's Picks, John Roberts, SCOTUS, Stephen Breyer, technology, The Supreme Court, Innovation News, Technology News, News, Politics NewsThis week was a huge one for technology at the Supreme Court.\nThe problem is that the justices were groomed in a field that emphasizes reasoning by analogy.\nFollowing oral arguments for these cases, they were called \u201cblack-robed techno-fogeys.\u201d They were ranked based on technological incompetence."}
