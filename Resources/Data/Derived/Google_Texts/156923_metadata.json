The figure pertains to people who now have government funded health insurance as a result of the state's expansion of Medicaid which became available on Jan. 1.\n\nPennsylvania was among the slower states in expanding Medicaid, which is the part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and the part the U.S. Supreme Court decided is voluntary and can't be forced on states.\n\nIt's for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $16,243 for a single person and $33,465 for a family of four.\n\nWolf on Thursday said Pennsylvania's uninsured rate has dropped to eight percent, down from 14 percent in 2013.\n\nWhile former Gov. Tom Corbett, an Obamacare opponent, eventually decided to expand Medicare, he did so under a plan that imposed certain cost-sharing and other requirements which were opposed by Democrats.\n\nWhen Wolf took office in January he began undoing Corbett changes and shifting to the straight Medicaid expansion favored by Obama and Democrats.\n\nThe state on Thursday released these figures about the 500,000 newly-enrolled Medicare recipients:\n\n-- 34 percent are between the ages of 21 and 30; and 24 percent are between 31 and 40;\n\n-- 59 percent are white; 23 percent are African-American; 10 percent are Hispanic and four percent are Asian;\n\n-- 22 percent live in Philadelphia County, while the state's smallest county, has 217 people who are covered as a result of the expansion.\n\nState officials have said more than 100,000 more Pennsylvania residents are eligible for the expanded coverage, which in the past was available only to people earning up to 100 percent of the poverty level, and few people who didn't have dependent children.\n\nThe federal government is paying 100 percent of the medical costs of the expansion through next year, then will gradually scale back the federal share to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond.\n\nInformation about enrolling can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, Wolf, health-care, pennsylvania, politics, Tom-Wolf", "title": "Gov.
