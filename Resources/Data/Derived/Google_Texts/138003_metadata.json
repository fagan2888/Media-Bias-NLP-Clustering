About 50 people sang Christmas carols and prayed to welcome the temporary nativity scene to the Capitol in a scene that likely wouldn\u0092t have happened were it not for a group of Satanists from Detroit. The three statues of the infant Jesus Christ and his parents, Mary and Joseph, stand about three feet tall in a small wooden manger were placed just south of the east steps of the Capitol. The display was celebrated by speakers at a brief ceremony as not only a symbol of the season but of a symbol of the right to celebrate that season. (AP Photo/David Eggert)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 A county in southeastern Indiana reached an agreement Friday with a group suing to force the removal of a Nativity scene on the courthouse lawn that will allow the decades-old display to remain in place through Christmas.\n\nAttorneys for Franklin County and the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana came to the agreement following a Friday hearing before a federal judge on the ACLU\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction seeking the display\u2019s removal.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of the Madison, Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion argues that the display in Brookville, about 70 miles southeast of Indianapolis, is unconstitutional.\n\nThe suit contends that the privately owned nativity scene erected each winter by citizens in Brookville \u201crepresents an endorsement of religion and has the principal effect of advancing religion\u201d and therefore violates the First Amendment.\n\nUnder the agreement reached Friday, the Nativity display that\u2019s been erected on the lawn each winter for more than a half-century will be taken down Dec. 26 and the Freedom from Religion Foundation will drop its preliminary injunction request.\n\nBut the group\u2019s lawsuit against the county will continue, said ACLU of Indiana senior staff attorney Gavin Rose.\n\n\u201cThe display has been up for more than 50 years and obviously there\u2019s still a constitutional issue. This just takes the immediacy out of the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Breen, an attorney with the Thomas More Society \u2014 a Chicago-based public interest law firm that\u2019s representing the county in the dispute \u2014 said he and his clients are pleased with the agreement.\n\n\u201cThe parties will now litigate the case on a normal schedule, without the threat of an emergency injunction forcing the removal of the nativity scene just before Christmas,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue working to protect the First Amendment rights of the people of Franklin County as they express themselves in the public forum in front of their courthouse.\u201d\n\nRose told U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt during Friday\u2019s hearing that the display that includes figures of the Christ child, Mary and Joseph has an \u201cundeniable\u201d religious significance. And he noted that taxpayers pay for the electricity that\u2019s used to light the nativity so that it\u2019s visible at night.\n\nPratt had agreed Friday morning to continue until Monday the county\u2019s presentation in the preliminary injunction request. Rose said the parties will inform the court that Monday\u2019s hearing is no longer needed.\n\nThe Freedom from Religion Foundation agreed to drop its preliminary injunction request because there was little time for Pratt to consider the complaint and briefs in the case and make a decision next week, Rose said, and now the parties can \u201clitigate the issue more fully after this year.\u201d\n\nRose said his clients hope to make this the final year the Nativity scene is displayed.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
