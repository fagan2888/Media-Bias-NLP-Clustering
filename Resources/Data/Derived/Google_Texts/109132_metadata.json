In all, 240 Republicans and 12 Democrats voted for the bill while 172 Democrats voted against it. In the Senate, two Democrats recently joined dozens of Republicans to sponsor a similar measure.\n\nLike other attempts to weaken health care reform, the bill, named the Save American Workers Act, is based on false premises and offers false promises. But its bipartisan patina makes it a threat, as do the catchy if misleading assertions of its supporters to win public support.\n\nAt issue is the threshold at which the employer mandate kicks in. The law requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide insurance to those who work more than 30 hours a week, or pay a penalty of $2,000 to $3,000 per worker. Most of the roughly 230,000 companies with 50 or more workers already provide health insurance, while about 11,500 of such companies do not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe House bill, however, would encourage many companies that provide insurance to stop doing so. It would require coverage (or a penalty) only for employees who work at least 40 hours a week, on the ground that 40 hours is the standard in employment law for a full-time worker. That is true but misses the point of the health care law, which sets a 30-hour threshold to ensure the broadest possible coverage without unduly burdening companies or taxpayers. The law is not intended to address employment-law standards. Turning the issue into an argument over the definition of \u201cfull time\u201d is specious.\n\nRepublicans have also argued that a higher, 40-hour-a-week threshold would protect employees from having their hours cut by employers seeking to evade the coverage requirement. That\u2019s backward. A higher threshold would put more workers, not fewer, at risk of shortened workweeks. With a 30-hour threshold, the employees in danger of cutbacks are those who work around 30 to 34 hours a week, about 7 percent of the work force. With a 40-hour threshold, the employees in danger of cutbacks are those who work 40 hours or more a week, nearly half of the work force.\n\nOne thing Republicans don\u2019t say is that raising the hourly threshold would worsen the deficit as more employees turn to publicly subsidized exchanges to find insurance.\n\nPresident Obama has vowed to veto legislative attempts to weaken or undo the health reform law. But that could prove difficult if the measure were attached to other important legislation. The attacks on health reform are senseless, but the danger that they could weaken reform is real.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150128032708, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act piece by piece.", "title": "Continued Assaults on Health Reform", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/opinion/continued-assaults-on-health-reform.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003476581"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/opinion/continued-assaults-on-health-reform.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003476581", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/opinion/continued-assaults-on-health-reform.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Continued Assaults on Health Reform", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 28, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Editorials,Health Insurance and Managed Care,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Senate,House of Representatives,Working Hours,Law and Legislation,Labor and Jobs,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act piece by piece.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act piece by piece.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-01-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2015-01-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "28wed2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150128123313, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/opinion/continued-assaults-on-health-reform.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act piece by piece.", "title": "Continued Assaults on Health Reform"}, "pdate": 20150128, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003476581, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Continued Assaults on Health Reform", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26d1\"", "article_summary": "The attacks on health reform are senseless, but the danger that they could weaken reform is real.\nPresident Obama has vowed to veto legislative attempts to weaken or undo the health reform law.\nMost of the roughly 230,000 companies with 50 or more workers already provide health insurance, while about 11,500 of such companies do not.\nLike other attempts to weaken health care reform, the bill, named the Save American Workers Act, is based on false premises and offers false promises.\nThat is true but misses the point of the health care law, which sets a 30-hour threshold to ensure the broadest possible coverage without unduly burdening companies or taxpayers."}
