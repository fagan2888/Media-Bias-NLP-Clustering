A 17-year-old Wister teen has been charged with first-degree murder with deliberate intent.

LeFlore County court records show Brittney Nicole Orand is charged as an adult in the shooting death of Goldie Long earlier this month.

Orand is being held in the county jail without bond and scheduled to appear in court in February.

The sheriff office says the fatal shooting happened in the southern end of LeFlore County on January 9.
