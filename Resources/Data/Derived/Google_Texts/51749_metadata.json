The agency\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) said airlines also collected $3.0 billion in reservation change fees last year.\n\nAirlines have said airports are the ones who have collected enough fees from passengers.\n\nThe group that lobbies for the airline industry in Washington, Airlines for America (A4A), said Monday evening that airports have collected billions from the existing Passenger Facility Charge.\n\n\"There is no crisis in airport funding and airports cannot identify a single project that has failed to move forward due to lack of funding,\" A4A spokesman Vaughn Jennings said in a statement provided to The Hill.\n\n\"Comparing revenue from optional ancillary services to mandatory tax hikes that passengers are forced to pay every they fly is misleading at best, as it completely ignores that fact that airports across our country are in a very strong financial position, already receiving billions of dollars from passengers and the government alike,\" Jennings continued. \"In 2013, U.S. airports collected a record $24.5 billion in revenue \u2013 a 52 percent increase on a per passenger basis from 2000 \u2013 including $10 billion in airline rents and fees, $2.8 billion from existing PFCs, $8.2 billion in non-airline revenues and $3.4 billion from the FAA\u2019s Airport Improvement Program.\"\n\nThe fight between airlines and airports over passenger fees is expected to simmer until lawmakers approve a new funding bill for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later this year.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s current funding bill is scheduled to expire in September, and airports are hoping to convince lawmakers to include an increase in the PFC cap in a potential extension of the agency\u2019s spending bill.\n\nThe Passenger Facility Charge was first established by Congress in 1990. The FAA says \"airports use these fees to fund FAA-approved projects that enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce noise; or increase air carrier competition.\"\n\n-This story was updated with new information at 10:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Passenger fees for both airlines and airports are the subject of debate in Washington.", "description": "Passenger fees for both airlines and airports are the subject of debate in Washington.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Passenger fees for both airlines and airports are the subject of debate in Washington.", "title": "Airports rap airlines on bag fees", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241015-airports-rap-airlines-on-bag-fees", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/laguardia_americaneagle_airport_082313getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241015-airports-rap-airlines-on-bag-fees", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-04T19:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "FAA bill, Passenger Facility Charge,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T19:10:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241015-airports-rap-airlines-on-bag-fees", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Passenger fees for both airlines and airports are the subject of debate in Washington.", "card": "summary", "title": "Airports rap airlines on bag fees"}, "dcterms.title": "Airports rap airlines on bag fees"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd820\"", "article_summary": "The Transportation Department figures showed airlines collected 2.1 percent of their total operating revenue in 2014 from baggage fees.\nAirlines have said airports are the ones who have collected enough fees from passengers.\nThe fight between airlines and airports over passenger fees is expected to simmer until lawmakers approve a new funding bill for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later this year.\nThe agency\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) said airlines also collected $3.0 billion in reservation change fees last year.\nThe group that lobbies for the airline industry in Washington, Airlines for America (A4A), said Monday evening that airports have collected billions from the existing Passenger Facility Charge."}
