On Friday’s edition of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” host Bill Maher held a discussion about the effort of 47 Republican senators to interfere with the Obama Administration’s negotiations with Iran by way of a letter. The panelists, Sean Penn, Arianna Huffington, the Telegraph’s Tom Rogan and Sharyl Attkisson, were largely critical of the letter (with the exception of Attkisson).

“When a young William Jefferson Clinton was at Oxford protesting the Vietnam War and then later ran for president of the United States they said that he was a traitor for protesting from foreign shores,” said Penn. “And the moment that letter arrived in Tehran, they were protesting from foreign shores. And in fact I think where we should be looking at this is not in terms of treason, but mutiny. And I think perhaps criminal mutiny.”
