Charles Schumer will answer your questions from 11:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSchumer, one of the most powerful members of the U.S. Senate, has rarely participated in live, online Q&A sessions. He will spend an hour in his Washington office answering questions submitted by syracuse.com readers.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate. He serves as vice chairman of the Democratic Conference. He also chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, serving as the party's chief message-maker.\n\nSchumer made national headlines last week when he criticized his fellow Democrats, saying the party made a mistake in 2010 by passing the Affordable Care Act instead of first focusing more directly on helping the middle class.\n\nSchumer's leadership role in the Senate has placed him at the center of some of the biggest debates in Congress. Last year, he was lead author of a bipartisan immigration reform bill that would have tightened border security and provided a path to citizenship for about 11 million immigrants. The bill passed with strong support, 68-32, but never came to a vote in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nSchumer also helped lead efforts for gun-control legislation that would have expanded background checks to include private gun sales. The effort ultimately failed.\n\nNow with Democrats preparing to lose control of the Senate when the 114th Congress begins in January, Schumer says his ability to help Upstate New York will not diminish.\n\nYou can begin submitting questions for the senator 15 minutes before the Q&A begins at 11 a.m. Wednesday, or at any time during the live session.\n\nContact Mark Weiner anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751\n\n\n\nLive Blog Live Q&A with U.S. Sen.
