To mitigate these challenges, this year's AICPA Advanced Personal Financial Planning Conference, held at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas from January 19-21, will look to give planners the necessary skills tools and skills to navigate today's field of financial planning.\n\n\u0093As the population ages, life expectancy rises, and consumers face more complex financial situations, planners are in increased demand,\u0094 said Jeannette Koger, vice president of Member Specialization & Credentialing with the AICPA, in a statement. \u0093To help meet this demand, the AICPA is offering the Emerging Leaders Learning Track to ensure that the pipeline of planners remains strong and emerging planners have the tools they need to grow their practices.\u0094\n\nThis year\u0092s conference will again offer the \u0093Emerging Leader Learning Path\u0094 track, intended to aid newer financial planners to develop their communications and computer skills, as well as providing financial planning best practices to help better serve their clients. Sessions for the Emerging Leaders track have been selected from the Wealth Management and Tax, Retirement/Elder Planning, Investment Management, Practice Management and Technology, and Insurance and Risk Management session tracks.\n\nThe AICPA\u0092s PFP Conference has been ranked by industry insiders as one of the top conferences for financial planners. Attendance has doubled since 2009, with attendees at last year\u0092s conference representing financial firms with more than $240 billion assets under management. This year\u0092s conference will include more than 65 sessions on topics ranging from retirement planning, tax strategies, building trust online, and estate planning strategies for high net worth clients.\n\nFor more information on the PFP Conference, head to the event's site here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/blogs/accounting-tomorrow/aicpa-to-hold-2015-personal-financial-planning-conference-in-las-vegas-73272-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Accounting Tomorrow", "title": "AICPA to hold 2015 Personal Financial Planning Conference in Las Vegas"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "description": "Political uncertainty, the effects of the Affordable Care Act, and retirement costs are just some of the challenges Americans face in today s ever-changing financial landscape.
