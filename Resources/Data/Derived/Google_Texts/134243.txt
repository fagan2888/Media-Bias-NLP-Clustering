In a recent letter to Governor Fallin, Dorothy explained why she thinks the refugees need to come to Oklahoma.

The letter reads:

Dear Governor Fallin,

Please take in Syrian refugees into our state. They need homes because their country had a big war, and they should be treated nicely so they don’t become cruel like the people in ISIS.

The people in Syria are a lot like the people in Ireland during the famine. The same thing happened. People had to leave Ireland because they didn’t have any food, and people didn’t want to let them into our country. It turned out that it was a good idea to let the Irish in, because nobody was cruel and the Irish did great things for the United States.

Just because somebody is a Muslim doesn’t mean that they are cruel. In fact, it could mean that they are nice and that they want to do great things as soon as they are able to. It would be like what happened with Ireland and America, except with Syria and America.

And so, as I said at the beginning, will you please let some Syrian refugees into Oklahoma? It’s your choice.

Sincerely,

Dorothy Marguerite Cusack (6 years old)
