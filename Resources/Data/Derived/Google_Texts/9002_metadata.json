The beleaguered Cover Oregon health insurance exchange has been riddled with ongoing problems, errors, and glitches since last October that have yet to be fixed. Take note: This wasn\u2019t a one-time computer meltdown. Because Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange website has been offline and its software architects under investigation for possible fraud, the Oregon Obamacare drones have been processing each and every application manually. That means nearly 4,000 illegal-alien applications with \u201cinaccurate\u201d data somehow passed through government hands and somehow ended up getting routed through as new enrollees with Obamacare-approved full-service health care.\n\nAnd courting conservative outrage stemming from the incident, an Oregon-based Obamacare official explained the 4000 enrollments away, saying, \u201cWe were just getting people into the services.\u201d\n\nAt around the same time, the Obama Administration was working to let legal-immigrant family members of illegal aliens know that enrolling in Obamacare will not increase the chances of their loved ones\u2019 deportations.\n\n\u201cI have heard that some Americans who are eligible to enroll in the Marketplace are reluctant to do so because they fear that the information they provide on their health coverage applications will be shared with immigration authorities and used to deport their undocumented family members,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson wrote in a February editorial. \u201cThis is not true.\u201d\n\nRead more on that here, from Personal Liberty\u2019s Ben Bullard.\n\nThe White House\u2019s official line on Obamacare for undocumented immigrants is this: An illegal alien who has at least one U.S.-born child can sign the child (up to the age of 26?) up for Obamacare with no fear of a call from immigration authorities.\n\nThe White House can say whatever it wants about its goals and regulations for illegal immigrants with regard to Obamacare. But should Americans realistically expect an Administration that had to be urged to leave illegals out of Obamacare in the first place to make a real effort to prevent enrollment numbers from being boosted by folks lacking Social Security numbers?\n\nJournalist Matt Drudge, of Drudge Report fame, tweeted a photo from Miami today that could explain why there may be some confusion about Obamacare in communities with high numbers of undocumented immigrants:\n\nGovt looking vans offering free Obamacare hit Miami streets today.
