Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, was spotted Tuesday sporting a Peyton Manning jersey in the halls on Capitol Hill \u2014 and is already instigating some intra-party trash talk in response to Mrs. Murray\u2019s prognostication.\n\n\u201cSorry @PattyMurray but closest @RSherman_25 will come to greatness = trying to keep up w @DemaryiusT,\u201d Mr. Udall tweeted Wednesday, referring to Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.\n\nThough Mrs. Murray laughed when she was asked whether she had any inside information, the prediction could be an indication that the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman has done her homework.\n\nThe last time Manning, the Broncos quarterback, played in a Super Bowl, in 2010, his Indianapolis Colts were favored against the New Orleans Saints. Oddsmakers are giving the edge to the Broncos this year.\n\nThat year was also the last time two No. 1 seeds advanced to the Super Bowl until the Seahawks and Broncos did so this year.\n\nWith just over three minutes left in Super Bowl XLIV, the Saints\u2019 Tracy Porter picked off a pass from Manning and scored on a 74-yard interception return, effectively clinching the 31-17 Saints win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not exactly surprising that Sen.
