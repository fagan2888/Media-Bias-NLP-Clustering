New formats, such as mobile and downloadable titles, are making games more affordable and more accessible. But at least one veteran Japanese game designer doesn\u2019t care to follow the trend.\n\nHidetaka Miyazaki wants his games to be imposing. He wants players to struggle. He counts on it \u2014 relishes it, even. Sure, he wants players to win, but not before they curse him out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t want to create a product for the masses, but I want something that will be appreciated by the core,\u201d he says, referring to the most die-hard of gamers.\n\nHis approach is elegantly old school but modernly (some may say maddeningly) unconventional.\n\nDuring a recent interview, the dapper and bespectacled game director arrived in a suit and discussed the joy of making games that celebrate playfulness at its most difficult. Right now, he\u2019s putting the finishing touches on \u201cBloodborne,\u201d a PlayStation 4 title due to launch in March and one that has a similar brooding spirit to his past games, such as \u201cDemon\u2019s Souls\u201d and \u201cDark Souls.\u201d\n\nThe titles here act as spoilers, and \u201cBloodborne\u201d is set in a meticulously detailed Victorian world. Shadows give way to cracked, rain-soaked bricks that butt against Gothic buildings with spires that twist into the clouds. It\u2019s a grim, storybook world and one where demonic mutations can descend upon the player in a moment\u2019s notice. In a short 30-minute play session in December, I\u2019m pretty sure I killed off my character every 30 seconds or so.\n\nThe struggle to make it through Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cDark Souls\u201d games is well known, and online death-counters track player casualties. But there\u2019s more at play than brutal obstacles. Sean Velasco, a designer on the independent hit \u201cShovel Knight,\u201d notes that Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cability to make every element of the \u2018Souls\u2019 games contribute to the themes of challenge and despair is remarkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiyazaki drops the players into the game world with little explanation and allows them to explore and make their own mistakes,\u201d Velasco says. \u201cMiyazaki also masterfully shatters the player\u2019s sense of confidence by surprising them constantly with new enemies or twists on what had been previously seen.\u201d\n\nJust as Miyazaki\u2019s games are demanding, so is Miyazaki. He jokes that he\u2019s a perfectionist and that his staff at From Software will likely quit on him in a few years. The pursuit of creating a faultless interactive challenge is not one he takes lightly, and if players don\u2019t consider the action-fantasy epic \u201cBloodborne\u201d to be downright punishing, he\u2019ll consider it a disappointment.\n\nCrafting a cinema-like experience or a tightly wound linear story isn\u2019t Miyazaki\u2019s goal. They\u2019re not his strengths, he admits through a translator, but neither is delegating the task to someone else. Characters and story are simply \u201cpillars,\u201d just pieces of the architecture that ultimately form a tightly wound gaming structure.\n\nSo what, exactly, in his own words, does Miyazaki want to achieve?\n\n\u201cThe maximum level of an awesome game experience,\u201d he says, leaning in so his elbows are resting on his knees.\n\nAnd why, at the age of 40, is this still what drives him?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that, for all the games I work on, the core common denominator of the DNA hasn\u2019t changed. What I want is for our core users to really get the sense of accomplishment and achievement that comes with overcoming the hardest challenges a game can present. That level of challenge will vary depending on who you\u2019re talking to, but it\u2019s that exhilaration moment. \u2018You did it! You overcome a hurdle!\u2019 If they can feel that, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nOr, as Velasco noted, the \u201cDark Souls\u201d games were flexible enough to remember a player\u2019s decision, even a crucial mistake. The end result? \u201cThe player\u2019s despair is his own, but so are his victories, making them all the sweeter.\u201d\n\nGames without Miyazaki\u2019s mix of discovery and adversity simply feel \u201cempty,\u201d adds another developer. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t earned the experience, it doesn\u2019t feel special,\u201d says James Silva, currently developing the fantasy action title \u201cSalt and Sanctuary\u201d for the PlayStation 4.\n\nMiyazaki says \u201cBloodborne\u201d doesn\u2019t represent one specific goal he\u2019s had. Instead, it\u2019s a culmination of all the best parts of past ideas that were left on the cutting room floor, either because of time or technological limitations. He notes that, as he\u2019s getting older, his dream of making games that require multiple years and large teams are a rarity, as the industry is increasingly split between name-brand big-budget titles and small, download-only indies.\n\n\u201cThe challenge I have for myself is that I\u2019m 40 right now, and I don\u2019t know how many more types of games that I can work on \u2014 games that I can fully develop and release,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about how I can perfect one game. Right now, the question is how many more of these can I actually make with the laundry list of things I wanted to do in our previous games. It\u2019s a challenge for me to figure out what to do in the remaining years I have in my career.\u201d\n\nBut for someone who refers to himself repeatedly as a perfectionist, perhaps it\u2019s time to think smaller, to go with more manageable teams that explore different facets of his game design philosophies?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good point,\u201d he says. \u201cI still dream of my dream scenario, which is to have a budget of the highest maximum pinnacle. I think those kinds of opportunities either come once in your lifetime or not at all.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, I see advantages to having a smaller team, a smaller, more conceptual project. Why do I say that? I get down to the details when it comes to direction \u2014 the story, the art and everything. I\u2019m a pretty anal person. I tinker with every little thing. In five or 10 years, my guys aren\u2019t going to want to work with me. At that point, maybe it will be smarter for me to work on my own little idea.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Todd Martens | @Toddmartens | @LATherocomplex\n\nRECENT AND RELATED:\n\n\n\nL.A. studio to restore venerable \u2018King\u2019s Quest\u2019 to its gaming throne\n\n\u2018Lost Constellation\u2019 lets players wander a cat\u2019s world\n\n\u2018Shovel Knight\u2019 keeps it all old school\n\nThe best video games of 2014\n\n\u2018Framed\u2019: Craft a noir comic in a mobile game\n\n\u2018Hatred\u2019 takes ugly aim at gaming progress\n\n\u2018Super Smash Bros.\u2019 has nostalgic appeal\n\n\u2018A Bird Story\u2019: Targetting pet owners\u2019 hearts\n\n\u2018The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\u2019: Hauntingly magical", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE PLAYER Broadly speaking, games today are becoming easier to play.
