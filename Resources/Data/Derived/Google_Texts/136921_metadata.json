Karen Vachon Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThe bill is a response to a state Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 decision last year not to contract out the ombudsman service and instead handle consumer inquiries through its own MaineCare eligibility hotline. The decision has drawn strong opposition.\n\nThe former ombudsman contractor, Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a advocacy group that also helps Mainers find insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, is suing the LePage administration for not continuing the service.\n\nThe advocacy group handled 7,000 consumer requests for help in 2014 before its contract was terminated at the end of the fiscal year in June 2015, said Executive Director Emily Brostek. That\u2019s a four-fold jump from 2006, when it fielded 1,600 inquiries. The jump in inquiries coincides with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brostek\u2019s group joined other health care organizations and several Republican legislators in supporting the bill, which compels DHHS to use the federal grant to help Mainers navigate the state bureaucracy and settle eligibility disputes.\n\nLAUNDRY LIST OF PROBLEMS\n\nDHHS has argued that federal law doesn\u2019t require the state to contract with an outside vendor for ombudsman services, and that it can fulfill its outreach and education obligations in-house.\n\nAdvocates of the bill disagree. During the public hearing, lawmakers and health organizations told stories of individuals unable to reach DHHS because of long wait times on the agency\u2019s hotline and conflicting written responses about eligibility. The result, proponents of the bill said, was delayed access to coverage, accumulating medical bills and frustration.\n\nRep. Karen Vachon, a Scarborough Republican and insurance agent, said that she had seen firsthand how badly consumers need an advocate to help them navigate \u201cthe complex relationship between private and public health care coverage\u201d and \u201chow to defend themselves when an injustice has occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that navigating these systems is a nightmare for many people,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers, and even professionals like myself, need to be able to rely on an ombudsman for help, whose role is clear and whose advocacy is delivered impartially.\u201d\n\nThe proposal, L.D. 1498, has more than a dozen Republican co-sponsors, many representing rural districts where constituents face either long drives or long hold times on the DHHS hotline. In written testimony, Sen. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, said many of his constituents don\u2019t have Internet access and cannot use DHHS\u2019 Maine Connection portal.\n\n\u201cThis means that people who are eligible for MaineCare \u2013 kids, parents, people with disabilities, the elderly \u2013 are having trouble applying to DHHS and getting the coverage they need to take care of their health,\u201d Davis wrote.\n\nDHHS: POSITION NOT REQUIRED\n\nHoldups in processing MaineCare has another effect, advocates of the bill argued. Doug Strout, an insurance agent in Scarborough, said in written testimony that Mainers sometimes have difficulty getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOne problem I come across is the inability for some of my customers to qualify for (ACA) marketplace coverage until they have first been turned down for coverage through (MaineCare),\u201d Strout wrote. He said it\u2019s not uncommon to have children denied coverage through the ACA until they can provide a letter from DHHS showing they\u2019ve been denied MaineCare coverage.\n\nThe DHHS is required to process MaineCare applications within 45 days. Brostek, at Consumers for Affordable Health Care, said some of her customers have had to wait 19 months.\n\nWilliam Logan, an attorney representing DHHS, told the committee that the department hasn\u2019t spent federal funds allocated for the ombudsman. Logan, while testifying against the bill, reiterated the department\u2019s position that the ombudsman isn\u2019t required under federal law.\n\nLogan also argued that the bill would exempt the ombudsman from Maine\u2019s records retention law, requiring neither reports about its services nor oversight by the Health and Human Services Committee.\n\nBrostek said her agency continues to provide guidance for MaineCare recipients and is using other funding sources to do so. Two open positions at the organization went unfilled when DHHS ended the ombudsman contract.\n\nLawmakers will hold a work session on the bill before taking a vote on sending it to the full Legislature for consideration.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 620-7016 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "DHHS had ended its contract with a private group and took on the work, but now Mainers are facing delays and struggling to get answers vital to their medical care, critics say.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "DHHS had ended its contract with a private group and took on the work, but now Mainers are facing delays and struggling to get answers vital to their medical care, critics say.", "title": "Committee backs advocates on restoring service that helps customers with health insurance - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/782831_298964-Rep.KarenVachon.jpg", "height": 631}, "updated_time": "2016-01-13T23:02:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/13/advocates-for-mainecare-ombudsman-hope-bill-forces-dhhs-to-reinstate-contract/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "DHHS had ended its contract with a private group and took on the work, but now Mainers are facing delays and struggling to get answers vital to their medical care, critics say.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/782831_298964-Rep.KarenVachon.jpg", "title": "Committee backs advocates on restoring service that helps customers with health insurance - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2016-01-13T18:14:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T23:02:40-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brostek, at Consumers for Affordable Health Care, said some of her customers have had to wait 19 months.\nInsurance agents, lawmakers and health care organizations urged the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee to endorse a measure to reinstate a $300,000 federally funded ombudsman service.\nThe former ombudsman contractor, Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a advocacy group that also helps Mainers find insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, is suing the LePage administration for not continuing the service.\nThe jump in inquiries coincides with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nDoug Strout, an insurance agent in Scarborough, said in written testimony that Mainers sometimes have difficulty getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act."}
