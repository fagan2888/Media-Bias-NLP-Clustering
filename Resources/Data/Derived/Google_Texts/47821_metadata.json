Because of that, administrators at St. Rita\u2019s Medical Center were gratified when representatives of U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, reached out to them about having the senator pay the facility a visit.\n\n\u201cAny time we have an opportunity to visit with an elected official about what\u2019s going on the community so they can understand the impact of some of the decisions that are made at the federal level and educate them on what\u2019s going on here at what Mercy Health\u2019s doing to improve the health of the community, we want to take advantage of those opportunities,\u201d St. Rita\u2019s CEO Bob Baxter said.\n\nDuring Brown\u2019s visit Monday, the senator got to meet both with administrators and employees, learning more about St. Rita\u2019s and its place in the Lima community.\n\n\u201cI think cities this size have a different set of issues,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOne is that the hospital is almost always the biggest employer in town. Also, people depend on the hospital for all kinds of community services. They look to a hospital like this to set the tone, sometimes, on a variety of community issues, and I think they play that role very well.\u201d\n\nBaxter and other administrators discussed with the senator St. Rita\u2019s efforts to offer increased care for high-risk patients after they are released from the hospital.\n\n\u201cAs an elected official, he needs to know what the focuses are at the local and community level, how we help people stay healthy while they\u2019re out of the hospital, not only getting the best care when they\u2019re in the hospital, which is what we\u2019ve always been about, but ensuring that once they leave the hospital, they don\u2019t have to come back again soon,\u201d Baxter said.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, specifically the Affordable Care Act, Brown maintained that many people he talked to were generally in favor of the law.\n\n\u201cIn Allen County, there are between 5,000 and 10,000 people who have health insurance who didn\u2019t have it five years ago because of the Affordable Care Act, and there are also a lot of consumer protections for families with a sick child and who couldn\u2019t get insurance as a result and now can,\u201d he said.\n\nCraig J.
