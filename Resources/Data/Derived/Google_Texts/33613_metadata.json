What we see are people traveling less out of choice than out of some form of compulsion: \u201c[T]he bulk of medical tourism today,\u201d Issenberg justly contends, \u201cat least beyond frivolous cosmetic procedures, is not undertaken as an act of privilege.\u201d\n\nTo understand the emergence of the modern medical tourism industry, it\u2019s not enough to only emphasize rising health care costs. Though no doubt circumstances differ from nation to nation, medical tourism can be better conceived as arising out of the intersection of three developments in the international political economy of health care.\n\nThe first of these is the emergence of the corporate health care industry itself. While there has always been a business side of health care, the appearance of a \u201clarge and growing network of private corporations,\u201d as then editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine Arnold Relman wrote in a 1980 article \u201cThe New Medical-Industrial Complex,\u201d which are \u201cengaged in the business of supplying health-care services to patients for a profit,\u201d is a much newer development. Today, however, it\u2019s also an increasingly globalized phenomenon, with for-profit health care corporations seeking to \u201ccarve out more profit from \u2026 the global total of almost $5 trillion annually spent on health,\u201d as journalist John Lister describes in his 2013 book Health Policy Reform: Global Health versus Private Profit.\n\nIssenberg begins his book, for instance, with a description of a new hospital built by the Tokushukai Medical Corporation\u2014a huge Japanese hospital chain\u2014in Sofia, Bulgaria. The Tokuda Hospital Sofia, an oddly situated \u201cnine-story ivory puzzle piece in a sort of corporatized-Bauhaus style,\u201d as he puts it, draws patients from various nations in the region. As he walks through the Tokuda, he catches a glimpse of a fearful-appearing Libyan woman lying in a hospital bed, grasping the hand of a man he assumes is her husband. A hospital employee tells him that the Libyan civil war has strained that nation\u2019s health care system, and as a result Libya started sending its knee surgery patients to the Tokuda. \u201cHere was a Libyan woman,\u201d Issenberg describes, \u201ctrapped in a Japanese hospital in the Bulgarian capital, all when at her most vulnerable.\u201d This sentence nicely underscores both the odd internationalization of health care, and the fact that the position of the medical tourist is, in general, probably not one that we should envy.\n\nOne stereotype of the medical tourist\u2014that of an individual seeking a luxurious medical experience \u2014does little justice to the typical experience for most.\n\nA second development, at least with respect to the nations of the former Eastern Bloc, has been the impact of the post-Communist transition to capitalism on the health systems of these nations. The demise of the Bloc\u2019s ugly authoritarian regimes was no doubt a long time coming. However, as epidemiologists David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu describe in The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills, unbridled neoliberal \u201cshock therapy\u201d had a disastrous (and unnecessary) impact on health\u2014and health systems\u2014in many nations of the former Soviet Union. Nations that pursued \u201cmass privatization,\u201d they note (drawing on their own research), saw greater reductions in government health care expenditures and \u201csubstantial drops in access to healthcare.\u201d\n\nIssenberg situates the evolution of a medical tourism industry in Hungary in the context of its unique post-Communist transition. Hungary\u2019s nationalized health system, he describes, served it reasonably (if imperfectly) for decades, with free health care available to nearly all (albeit with under-the-table payments to doctors an all-too-common expectation, the corrupt legacy of which lasts to the current day). In seeking to control health spending, the post-communist government of Hungary effectively capped the pay of physicians who remained in the public sector, and, as he notes, in 1995 it privatized dental care. Those who moved into private practice \u201cthrived more than ever,\u201d with dentists in particular looking abroad for cash-paying customers.\n\nThe dental tourism industry in the city of Sopron arose, for example, in part to cater to nearby Vienna, and by the end of the 1990s \u201chad become the one city in this pastry-mad country where it was easier to find someone skilled in fixing cavities than a vendor of the sweets liable to provoke them\u201d (one of Issenberg\u2019s several nice turns of phrase). A bit of cronyism, it should be noted, factored into these developments as well, as with the bids won by B\u00e1torfi. \u201cIt is possible to get the money through a complex application,\u201d one news website (quoted by Issenberg) predicted, \u201cbut inevitably Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s denist\u2019s company will be awarded the billion forints.\u201d Indeed.\n\nWhich brings us to a third development: persistent\u2014and, in some instances, widening\u2014coverage gaps within the health systems of high-income countries. Issenberg describes how B\u00e1torfi\u2019s business model revolved around attracting customers from Britain: he would eventually visit London once a month, performing consultations and forwarding amenable customers onward to his clinic in Budapest. Though Issenberg doesn\u2019t get into this much, the demand for inexpensive dental care in England should probably be understood in the context of an inadequate supply of free public dental care available under the British National Health Service\u2014a change instigated by the government of Margaret Thatcher. As health policy researcher Allyson Pollock describes in the book NHS Plc, the conservative government reduced reimbursement for dental services in the late 1980s, predictably and progressively pushing dentists into the private sector. This turned the NHS, Pollock notes, into a \u201c\u2018residual\u2019 dental service\u201d for those who couldn\u2019t afford private dental care. However, this was only one aspect of a much larger conservative effort to privatize parts of the British health system (which continues to the present day in David Cameron\u2019s England).\n\nIn other words, rising demand for less expensive medical care for those in high-income nations can be seen as flowing (in part) through the interstices found within the fabric of these nation\u2019s health systems. In some instances, these gaps opened as the result of the defunding or partial dismantling of these systems; in other instances, they represent more long-standing inadequacies. For instance, those seeking less expensive health care in the United States might include the uninsured, but also the underinsured (those with paltry insurance with high out-of-pocket health expenses). The average annual deductible for a so-called \u201cBronze\u201d insurance plan purchased on the Obamacare exchanges, for example, will be $11,601 for a family in 2016, according to the firm HealthPocket. Such out-of-pocket exposure could understandably prompt some to seek less expensive care abroad.\n\nA notable strength of this book is Issenberg\u2019s keen and thorough shoe-leather reporting as he brings us through the hospitals of Eastern Europe, albeit also with an eye on the policy context. His focus\u2014appropriately, in my opinion\u2014is less on the medical tourists themselves, and much more on their providers and host nations. This is important, because in reality medical tourism impacts the nations receiving patients more than those sending them. Issenberg is aware, for instance, that medical tourism could potentially compromise the provision of care for a nation\u2019s own citizens, for instance by directing domestic resources and personnel towards the service of a global elite. For instance, he notes that the tourist-serving Nadezhda Women\u2019s Health Hospital in Bulgaria\u2014nicely described as a \u201cpotentially dreary building \u2026 reclaimed from an insurance company and heroically jazzed up for gynecological uses by a television-set designer\u201d\u2014has a wait list for Bulgarians, but not for cash-paying foreigners.\n\nThere is something very unjust about a nation providing privatized health services for an international market while at the same time failing to provide universal health care for its own citizens. Zahra Meghani, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Rhode Island, went further in a 2011 paper in the journal Developing World Bioethics, contending that it was \u201cethically problematic\u201d for Americans, on an individual level, to seek inexpensive surgical care in India. As she describes, such consumption of private health care by foreigners can draw from the public resources available to poor Indians, for instance through the inevitable \u201cinternal brain drain\u201d that occurs as physicians seek employment at better paying private facilities and neglect the lower-paying public ones. Lister similarly notes that public subsidies for these enterprises\u2014for instance through tax breaks or grants of land\u2014represent a drain on the resources that might instead be used for domestic public health projects. And when the hospitals are owned by international companies, he points out, profits aren\u2019t used for the care of the poor\u2014they are simply whisked abroad.\n\nThe main harm of this model of medicine is not that it happens to take place in a foreign country, but that it takes place at all.\n\nThere is no doubt much truth to these perspectives. I think Issenberg is right, however, to stress that foreigners can also serve as \u201cconvenient scapegoat[s],\u201d when the real problem is the underdevelopment and underfunding of the health systems of these nations. More broadly, I\u2019d suggest that the problem is not so much that care is being provided to outsiders, but instead that different care is provided to those in different economic strata, frequently with a for-profit private tier for the well-off (whether they be domestic or foreign) and an inferior public system for the rest.\n\nIn this respect, Issenberg\u2019s conclusions fall very short. Medical tourism, he fairly argues, shows us that the deficiencies of our health care systems are not preordained, but are instead the result of policy choices. He adds that by taking flight, tourists are engaging in \u201cpersonal defiance against the state\u2019s monopoly on decision-making about medical economics, and the trade-offs between access, quality, and cost that are at the heart of every national system.\u201d In other words, patients that find their own health system inadequate in some way\u2014whether because of high costs, inadequate facilities, or poor performance\u2014can fly for care for respite. Now it is true that some compromises are no doubt inevitable in any health system. Medical tourism, however, is in reality the downstream consequence of a much larger compromise: a conscious embrace of health care commoditization over health care rights.\n\nAnd there are costs in that choice. The medical tourism industry is an intrinsically entrepreneurial endeavor: it seeks the maximization of profit. Those without sufficient cash are, of course, excluded. Lucrative, in-and-out procedures are emphasized, while costly long-term follow-up is left out. A surplus is skimmed, and the old, the immobile, and the poor are left behind. The main harm of this model of medicine is not that it happens to take place in a foreign country, but that it takes place at all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A new book explores the new world of medical tourism, an industry that's made Hungary the capital for glamorous dental work.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "A new book explores the new world of medical tourism, an industry that's made Hungary the capital for glamorous dental work.", "title": "Need Surgery, Will Travel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/dd7e3c8384d75602dc00bc711d70351eaa42fc51.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/127547/need-surgery-will-travel", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new book explores the new world of medical tourism, an industry that's made Hungary the capital for glamorous dental work.", "title": "Need Surgery, Will Travel", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/dd7e3c8384d75602dc00bc711d70351eaa42fc51.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@awgaffney", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/dd7e3c8384d75602dc00bc711d70351eaa42fc51.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Need Surgery, Will Travel\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/127547/need-surgery-will-travel\",\"section\":\"Books\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-13T15:00:23.000Z\",\"post_id\":127547,\"author\":\"Adam Gaffney\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Books\",\"Culture\",\"Medicine\",\"-homepage-lower\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Books", "published_time": "2016-01-13"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "A hospital employee tells him that the Libyan civil war has strained that nation\u2019s health care system, and as a result Libya started sending its knee surgery patients to the Tokuda.\nMedical tourism, however, is in reality the downstream consequence of a much larger compromise: a conscious embrace of health care commoditization over health care rights.\nThe first of these is the emergence of the corporate health care industry itself.\nThe medical tourism industry is an intrinsically entrepreneurial endeavor: it seeks the maximization of profit.\nNow it is true that some compromises are no doubt inevitable in any health system."}
