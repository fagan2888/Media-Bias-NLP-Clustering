Our healthcare experts understand the unique requirements of communicating in a regulated industry, helping each client build an unshakable presence with a thought leadership voice and position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe chose Racepoint Global because they immediately understood that we didn\u2019t want to hire a PR firm just for the sake of having PR,\u201d said Tom Ferry, president & CEO, Curaspan. \u201cAs a first time exhibitor at HIMSS, it was important for us to collaborate with an agency that is familiar with the show, has established media relationships and experience elevating a niche brand to a national audience. The Racepoint Global team secured more than a dozen HIMSS briefings and we\u2019re looking forward to building off of that success.\u201d\n\nNew Racepoint Global client partnerships in the UK and US include:\n\nSpinal Modulation Spinal Modulation is a provider of neuromodulation pain therapy for people with chronic pain. Its implantable device stimulates the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) with electrical pulses that help to mask the pain signals.\n\nCuraspan Curaspan is the United States leading provider of care transition solutions. Working directly with hospitals, post-acute care providers and payers, the software-as-a-system helps reduce readmissions, shorten length of stay and improve patient outcomes.\n\nEvariant Evariant is the leading provider of a CRM platform based on a centralised healthcare data hub, analytics, and communications engine.\n\nGamma Medica Gamma Medica developed the LumaGEM Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) system, a functional imaging modality, used to detect breast cancer. With its sensitivity and specificity unmatched by other modalities and its ability to nearly quadruple the detection of invasive breast cancers, MBI is an ideal secondary diagnostic tool for complex mammograms, such as those with dense breast tissue.\n\nGenoSpace GenoSpace provides a comprehensive platform for precision medicine to enable interpretation, analysis, reporting and collaboration on high-dimensional genomic and other biomedical data. With specific applications supporting research, development, pathology and clinical care, many of the most advanced precision medicine organisations are powered by GenoSpace.\n\n\n\nHealing for People Healing for People is an energy medicine clinic focused on treating common physical, mental and emotional conditions and diseases.
