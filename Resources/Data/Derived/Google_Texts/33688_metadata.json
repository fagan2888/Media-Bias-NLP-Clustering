I love \u2019em. Many, many people from Mexico are legal. They came in the old-fashioned way. Legally.\u201d\n\nHe quickly returned to the sharp tone that has brought him scorn as well as praise. \u201cI respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours, and they\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us on trade.\u201d\n\nHis speeches in both venues were long on insults aimed at critics and short on solutions to the problems he cited. When he called for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the audience in Las Vegas groaned.\n\nIn a break from the immigration rhetoric that has garnered him condemnation and praise, Trump asserted that he would have more positive results in dealing with China and Russia if he were president and said he could be pals with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAsked by an audience member in Las Vegas about U.S.-Russia relations, Trump said the problem is that Putin doesn\u2019t respect Obama.\n\n\u201cI think we would get along very, very well,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has turned to victims of crime to bolster his argument that immigrants in the U.S. illegally have killed and raped. In Las Vegas and Phoenix, he brought on stage Jamiel Shaw Sr., a Southern California man whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed in 2008 by a man in the country illegally. Shaw vividly described how his son was shot \u2014 in the head, stomach and hands while trying to block his face \u2014 and how he heard the gunshots as he talked to his son on the phone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump draws thousands, Hillary Clinton is called \"the worst secretary of state in the history of the country\"", "title": "Trump goes wild in Arizona, unloads on Obama, Hillary, Mexico", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Trump draws thousands, Hillary Clinton is called \"the worst secretary of state in the history of the country\"", "title": "Trump goes wild in Arizona, unloads on Obama, Hillary, Mexico", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/trump_goes_wild_in_arizona_unloads_on_obama_hillary_mexico/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/gop-2016-trump.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump draws thousands, Hillary Clinton is called \"the worst secretary of state in the history of the country\"", "title": "Trump goes wild in Arizona, unloads on Obama, Hillary, Mexico", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/gop-2016-trump.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Associated Press", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Immigration, Mexico", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd69\"", "article_summary": "Asked by an audience member in Las Vegas about U.S.-Russia relations, Trump said the problem is that Putin doesn\u2019t respect Obama.\nWhen he called for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the audience in Las Vegas groaned.\n\u201cThese people wreak havoc on our population,\u201d he told a few thousand people attending the Libertarian gathering FreedomFest inside a Planet Hollywood ballroom on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\u201cI respect Mexico greatly as a country.\nTrump has turned to victims of crime to bolster his argument that immigrants in the U.S. illegally have killed and raped."}
