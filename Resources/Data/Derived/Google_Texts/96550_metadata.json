Even after she met the deductible, she said, she still had to pay 40 percent of the cost of supplies like an insulin pump. She dropped the plan this year and switched to her partner\u2019s insurance, which is less expensive but still onerous.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s continue to work for something better,\u201d Ms. Carberry said.\n\nUnder the single-payer law that the Vermont Legislature passed in 2011, the state was to seek a waiver in 2017 to trade its insurance exchange for the government-run system. Most of its 625,000 residents would be eligible for a uniform package of benefits under that system, which would be financed with a mix of state and federal funds.\n\nBut Mr. Shumlin and his advisers concluded the plan would require \u201cenormous\u201d new taxes, including an 11.5 percent payroll tax on all Vermont businesses and a sliding-scale income tax of up to 9.5 percent. In all, he said when he announced that he was shelving it, the plan would require about $2.5 billion in additional revenue in its first year, in a state that raises only about $2.7 billion in taxes annually.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Vermont health care advocates say support for the governor\u2019s plan was also seriously eroded by dysfunction in the state online insurance marketplace. Problems with that exchange had \u201churt, there\u2019s no doubt,\u201d public confidence in the effort to achieve single-payer universal coverage, Mr. Haslam said.\n\nOther state-based exchanges have experienced as much or more turmoil: Oregon and Nevada essentially shut down their marketplaces last year, requiring residents who want subsidized insurance to enroll instead through the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Hawaii is also planning to switch to the federal exchange this fall, at least temporarily, after running out of money. Massachusetts was forced to rebuild its exchange last year after it failed to function, and has spent more than $250 million, mostly in federal funds, on it so far.\n\nA number of state-based exchanges, after receiving a total of nearly $5 billion in federal establishment grants, are also encountering financial problems because they now must cover their own costs.\n\nBut Vermont, with its initial view of the Affordable Care Act as a bridge to a single-payer system, is in a singularly unhappy position.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a backlash against all things health care reform because Vermont Health Connect has been such a bad experience,\u201d said Trinka Kerr, the chief health care advocate at Vermont Legal Aid, which gets several hundred calls a month from people who have encountered problems with the exchange, including billing errors and even delayed access to care. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ll just go without insurance,\u2019 and we try to convince them that\u2019s not a good plan. They don\u2019t like the way this is working and want to go back to the old way.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRob Muessel, a self-employed security consultant from Shelburne, is one of those people. He said he spent hours on the phone with Vermont Health Connect representatives over the past year, trying to resolve problems. Most recently, when his daughter got a job with benefits in March, he called the marketplace to get her taken off his plan. Six weeks passed before he got a call back from an exchange employee, who had to spend more than two hours helping him redo his entire application for what should have been a simple fix.\n\n\u201cThat just blew my mind,\u201d said Mr. Muessel, 61. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to pull the plug, because it may just be an unending money pit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a blistering report released in April, Douglas Hoffer, the state auditor, detailed a number of unresolved problems with Vermont Health Connect and said it would be \u201cprudent\u201d to develop a plan for \u201can alternative model for running an exchange.\u201d\n\nMr. Shumlin had set a deadline of May 31 for Optum, the second vendor hired to fix a problem that has prevented thousands of Vermonters from easily changing basic information in their account, such as if they have a baby, get married or move. Workers have had to process such changes by hand, costing the state extra money and creating a backlog of 10,000 change requests. On Monday, Mr. Shumlin announced that Optum had fixed the problem, allowing such changes to be made in a matter of minutes, although customers will not be able to do so without assistance until later this year.\n\nOptum has a second deadline, in October, to automate the process by which exchange plans are renewed from year to year. In an interview, Lawrence Miller, the state\u2019s chief of health care reform, said the state was analyzing the costs of various alternatives, including switching to the federal marketplace, should the exchange still be broken in the fall.\n\nMr. Miller said he would prefer Vermont to be \u201ctucked away in a fully state-operated marketplace until we see exactly how the Supreme Court rules\u201d in the subsidies case. A great deal of uncertainty remains about whether people would be able to keep their subsidies if the state started relying on the federal marketplace.\n\nMr. Miller added that Vermont intends to remain a leader in health care reform, particularly with a plan to replace the traditional system of paying health care providers for each procedure with one that pays them based on outcomes, including under Medicaid and Medicare as well as private coverage.\n\nPointing out that Vermont\u2019s was not the only state-based exchange to still be struggling, he added, \u201cI talk to my colleagues elsewhere and, good God, this just wasn\u2019t set up for success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150604065016, "twitter": {"description": "Though other states have
