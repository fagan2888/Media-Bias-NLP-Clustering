CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the school in which Sahray Barber is enrolled. She is a student at the Art Institute of California.

Hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil for a missing San Bernardino college student Friday night.

Sahray Barber vanished on outside her apartment across from Cal State, San Bernardino on Monday. Her cellphone and laptop computer were found in bushes nearby.

The people at the event, held at the Art Institute of California's Inland Empire campus, are hoping she will be found safe. Barber was supposed to graduate the Art Institute with a degree in graphic design this March.

Her friend, Christopher Etheridge, who has started a Facebook page dedicated to her disappearance, has been unable to sleep since her disappearance.

"Every day I think about her and it just blows my mind because I would never expect something like this to happen to her," Etheridge said. "Sahray was one of the most positive people I know...very kind, very outgoing."

Sahray went missing early Monday morning, possibly on her way to school, where she is supposed to graduate in two weeks with a degree in graphic design.

"She would never disappear like that. I know that something happened to her," Etheridge said. "I just hope that she is safe."

Investigators have questioned Sahrays's two roommates and her ex-boyfriend, and said all three have been cooperative.

They have also searched numerous open areas around her apartment complex, but so far have no strong leads.
