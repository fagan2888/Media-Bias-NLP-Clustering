He went 1-2-3 in the first against Jake Cave, Ivan De Jesus Jr. and Eugenio Suarez, on two flyouts and a groundout to second.\n\nHe walked Tyler Holt in the second and allowed only an infield single on a grounder to shortstop. Daniel Descalso back-handed the ball well and threw to first, but he short-hopped Mark Reynolds who missed a scoop.\n\nBergman is likely headed for a long-relief role in Colorado\u2019s bullpen, the position he took over last season after a stint in the starting rotation.\n\nAmong Rockies regulars, Bergman has looked the most ready for their April 4 season-opener through live bullpen sessions and, now, live practice games.\n\nHITS\n\n** Sunday\u2019s game was a potential-riddled look at a bevy of prospects. LHP Jeff Hoffman and RHP Kyle Freeland allowed just two hits between them. OF David Dahl homered in two runs on a line drive to the opposite field in left. And Trevor Story homered in his only at-bat, his second in the Cactus League.\n\nMISSES\n\n** Catcher Dustin Garneau got hit by a pitch twice, once on the brim of his helmet by Pedro Villareal and once on the arm by Ryan Mattheus.\n\n** Shortstop Daniel Descalso struck out three times.\n\n\u201cB\u201d GAME BUMPS\n\n** New Rockies outfielder Ryan Raburn went 2-for-4 with a run scored in an unofficial \u201cB\u201d game against Arizona at Salt River. Pitching prospect Antonio Senzatela was the game\u2019s standout. He threw three innings, with four strikeouts and four groundouts, while allowing two hits.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies (3-2) host the Chicago Cubs (1-3) at Salt River Fields on Monday at 1:10 p.m.\n\nRockies pitchers \u2014 RH Jon Gray, LH Tyler Anderson, RH Carlos Estevez, RH Simon Castro, RH Brock Huntzinger, LH Sam Moll, RH Gonzalez Germen.\n\nCubs starter \u2014 RH Aaron Brooks.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Christian Bergman, with his long hair and quiet cool, continued to confidently breeze through spring training Sunday.", "title": "Christian Bergman calmly nearing season-ready form as Rockies utility arm", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2016/03/06/21583/21583/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2016/03/christian-bergman-rockies-495x336.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Christian Bergman, with his long hair and quiet cool, continued to confidently breeze through spring training Sunday.", "title": "Christian Bergman calmly nearing season-ready form as Rockies utility arm", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2016/03/06/21583/21583/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2016/03/christian-bergman-rockies-495x336.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christian Bergman,David Dahl,Dustin Garneau,Jeff Hoffman,Kyle Freeland,Ryan Raburn,Trevor Story"}, "article_summary": "ROCKIES 9, REDS 3At Goodyear BallparkGoodyear, Ariz. \u2014 Christian Bergman, with his long hair and quiet cool, continued to confidently breeze through spring training Sunday.\nAmong Rockies regulars, Bergman has looked the most ready for their April 4 season-opener through live bullpen sessions and, now, live practice games.\n\u201cB\u201d GAME BUMPS** New Rockies outfielder Ryan Raburn went 2-for-4 with a run scored in an unofficial \u201cB\u201d game against Arizona at Salt River.\nHe walked Tyler Holt in the second and allowed only an infield single on a grounder to shortstop.\nDaniel Descalso back-handed the ball well and threw to first, but he short-hopped Mark Reynolds who missed a scoop."}
