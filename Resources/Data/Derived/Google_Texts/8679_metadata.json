On \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d her family prays at the end of every single episode. Before she became the also-ran on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d last year, she showed the audience that she will not compromise her religious morals to perform or dress seductively. Now, in her role in the new film God\u2019s Not Dead 2, the sequel to the 2014 surprise hit, Robertson has a whole new opportunity to use her fame to glorify God.\n\nRobertson said seeing her parents appear in a cameo in the first God\u2019s Not Dead was major motivation for her to say yes to the project.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge reason,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never been in a movie either and mom was like, \u2018You got this.\u2019\u201d\n\nGod\u2019s Not Dead was a surprise box office success two years ago, even keeping pace with more mainstream films. In the sequel, a teacher named Grace Wesley, played by Melissa Joan Hart, is dragged to court after daring to speak the name Jesus in her classroom.\n\nRobertson and Hart had an instant bond because they both waltzed in front of America during their respective turns on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so funny because she had Mark (Ballas) as a partner as well,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cSo it was fun to bond over that.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cDancing,\u201d Robertson spoke boldly about the important role God plays in her life and we got behind-the-scenes looks at her praying with her partner before their performances. The viewer feedback was very encouraging, she recalls. She admitted she had her hesitation to participate in a somewhat \"worldly show\" that has proven to be risqu\u00e9 at times, yet people just saw how \"real\" she was in staying true to her values.\n\nThat kind of spiritual commitment, Robertson noted, is all too apparent in God\u2019s Not Dead 2.\n\n\u201cIf [Grace] would have wavered in her faith, then it wouldn\u2019t have worked out for her,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she stayed true the whole time, and never doubted it, she was very successful. People wanted to root for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you question yourself, people are going to question you, but if you go 100 percent then people are going to vote for you,\u201d she continued.\n\nRobertson noted she has often had to use this logic to defend her Christian faith.\n\n\u201cMany times,\u201d she said. \u201cThe time that you don\u2019t you always regret. Every day I pray that God will breathe through me and I seize every opportunity and I don\u2019t miss them. Whenever you see everything as an opportunity, it changes the game. When you don\u2019t look for that, you come off shy. Anyone that\u2019s really scared of doing that, the movie says it so well.\u201d\n\nRobertson noted that being afraid, however, is only natural. While she is comfortable in front of those intimidating lights on TV and film, she still gets nervous about the people standing around watching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because cameras have never bothered me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the people that are there. When I was on 'Dancing With the Stars,' even though they had the 20 million viewers, that didn\u2019t bother me. It bothered me that the four judges watched me dance. I was kind of nervous, I didn\u2019t\u2019 know if I was good enough.\u201d\n\nYet, Robertson has realized that a dance critic is not the most important judge we need to please. She quoted one of the most profound lines uttered in God's Not Dead:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with the world and be judged by God.\u201d\n\nRobertson chooses not to fear the world\u2019s reaction to her bold Christian message.\n\nNeither, it appears, do other Christians in Hollywood. In the past few years, faith-based entertainment has had a much more profound presence on both the small and silver screens. In addition to the God's Not Dead franchise, movies like Heaven is For Real, Miracles From Heaven, Risen and The Young Messiah have been added to movie theater marques and the TV series \"The Bible,\" produced by Hollywood-producing couple Roma Downey and Mark Burnett, had huge ratings success on The History Channel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cGod has really opened doors.\u201d\n\nBetween the traveling, the movie promotion, \"Duck Dynasty,\" and her Live Original Tour where she tours the country bringing the gospel to young adults, Robertson has limited free time. When she does have a few moments to reflect, however, she knows who to spend it with.\n\n\u201cHow can He be your best friend if you don\u2019t talk to Him?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bold, young witness for God in Hollywood..05/27/2016 3:21:47AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A bold, young witness for God in Hollywood.", "title": "Christians in Hollywood: Sadie Robertson Talks 'God's Not Dead 2,' 'Dancing With the Stars'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/28/sadie-robertson-dishes-on-gods-not-dead-2-and-dancing-with-the-stars-n2139473", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/28/4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A bold, young witness for God in Hollywood.", "title": "Christians in Hollywood: Sadie Robertson Talks 'God's Not Dead 2,' 'Dancing With the Stars'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/28/sadie-robertson-dishes-on-gods-not-dead-2-and-dancing-with-the-stars-n2139473", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/28/4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Christians in Hollywood: Sadie Robertson Talks 'God's Not Dead 2,' 'Dancing With the Stars' , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "That kind of spiritual commitment, Robertson noted, is all too apparent in God\u2019s Not Dead 2.\nRobertson noted she has often had to use this logic to defend her Christian faith.\nRobertson said seeing her parents appear in a cameo in the first God\u2019s Not Dead was major motivation for her to say yes to the project.\nSadie Robertson has never been afraid to express her Christian faith in Hollywood.\nWhen I was on 'Dancing With the Stars,' even though they had the 20 million viewers, that didn\u2019t bother me."}
