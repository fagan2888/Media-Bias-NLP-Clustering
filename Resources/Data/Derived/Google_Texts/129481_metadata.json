However, one sector that seems bulletproof in the next year or so is health care.\n\nConsumers will cut back on just about anything before they stop taking the drugs that numb their pain or the treatments that extend their lives. Even if spending takes a hit, which I don\u2019t expect, health-care stocks will hang tough.\n\nThere\u2019s also massive growth thanks to the Affordable Care Act and aging baby boomers who need more care. And outside the U.S., there\u2019s brisk growth in medical spending across emerging markets as residents win access to better care.\n\nThat combination of growth and stability is powerful. But equally compelling is that many picks also trade for bargain valuations or offer good dividends for those willing to buy and hold.\n\nWhen I scan the market across these metrics, the following five picks in health care stand out:\n\nWellPoint: Let\u2019s start with the political lightning rod of Obamacare, and the fact that WellPoint US:WLP is the insurance carrier that has enjoyed the biggest success as a result of the law.\n\nThose who wish to freak out about death panels, please scroll down to the comments section and link to your favorite AM radio show. As for the rest of you:\n\nAccording to reports, the company had 400,000 new enrollees at the end of the first quarter and had said its policies were already running at a profit. That total was estimated to have hit almost 770,000 new enrollments by midyear, far surpassing the company\u2019s target of 600,000.\n\nThis big success in winning Obamacare enrollees is surely a sign of growth to come for WellPoint. It\u2019s hard to dispute that navigating this complicated marketplace to win new business speaks highly of the management at this company and their ability to seize new opportunities.\n\nBigger picture, WellPoint is the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., and already had the scale to hang tough in any market. But the Obamacare momentum coupled with a return to consumer-facing marketing should help it grow even more.\n\nAmong big-name health-care stocks, WellPoint doesn\u2019t have the most attractive dividend, at only 1.5% in yield. But it only initiated a dividend in 2011, starting at 25 cents per share and quickly ramping that up to 43.75 cents. And even after that rapid dividend growth, payouts are just 20% of fiscal 2015 earnings, so expect another big dividend hike soon as earnings keep growing.\n\nDespite a run of 22% this year, the insurer trades for just around 12 times forward earnings. That means WLP stock has great growth, value and dividend increases all in one neat package.\n\nSPDR S&P Biotech ETF: This spring, many investors were scared out of biotech investments as the sector broke down. However, many biotech stocks have bounced back in the past few months, including the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, -1.00% which has gained 25% over 90 days.\n\nAs the name implies, this fund is benchmarked to an S&P biotechnology index. I prefer the XBI to its larger peer, the iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF IBB, -0.49% because the biggest players in the industry are all on the Nasdaq index and in the IBB fund; the XBI fund has a bias to smaller companies, giving it more of a development-phase feel.\n\nConsider that only two positions out of the top 10 SPDR S&P Biotech ETF holdings have a market cap over $10 billion. Furthermore, aside from a single position, there are no holdings with a weighting over 1.7% of the fund, making it very diverse in its makeup.\n\nTo me, this strategy of mixing a select few big players with a boatload of smaller start-up drugmakers is the best way to play innovative biotechs while still mitigating risk via diversification.\n\nWhile the iShares fund is larger by assets, it also has over 40% of its assets in only five stocks, all of which are blue-chip players with massive market caps.\n\nIf you want to have a position in the next breakout biotech, this fund is much less riskier than betting all-or-nothing on a single company\u2019s drug trial going well. Check out this fund on the SPDR website for more details.\n\nHCP: HCP Inc. HCP, +0.31% is a real estate investment trust that focuses on health-care-related facilities. The shares are up 17% so far in 2014, more than double that of the S&P 500.\n\nHCP is a great way to marry the stability of health care with the income mandate of REITs. It operates a diverse portfolio of medical office buildings, hospitals and senior-housing facilities nationwide. And as health care spending marches ever higher, this is a great way to play that trend and get a good dividend.\n\nThat dividend, today, tops 5% annually.\n\nOn the stability front, HCP has a very low beta of under 0.6 right now, meaning it moves much less than the broader market, and is a great hedge against low volatility. The company also trades at a fair 13 times fiscal 2015 earnings forecasts.\n\nAs for growth, HCP has been expanding briskly in recent years, having acquired 133 senior-housing communities in 2012 to capitalize on the aging baby boomer population. And more recently, the company embarked on a $1.2 billion partnership with Brookdale Senior Living BKD, -2.99%\n\nAll in all, HCP\u2019s stability, growth and dividend potential make for a compelling high-yield investment.\n\nChemed: I really like the senior-housing angle of HCP, but another interesting twist on the shift in American demographics is Chemed Corp. CHE, -1.16% Chemed is a leader in home-health services, including personal hospice care.\n\nIt may sound morbid, but this is going to be just as big a growth industry as senior housing, and Chemed is one of the biggest players in the space.\n\nChemed\u2019s stock is up 33% this year, and up 52% since January 2013. And even after this run, Chemed has a forward P/E of about 16 based on its fiscal 2015 earnings forecast \u2014 slightly less than that of the S&P 500.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s dividends aren\u2019t substantial yet, yielding only 0.9%, payouts have soared from 12 cents per quarter in mid-2010 to 22 cents currently, an 83% increase in four years.\n\nThrow in the fact that Chemed has a beta of 0.7 despite its clear outperformance, and you have a great mix of growth and stability in this mid-cap health-care stock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson: We\u2019ll end on a \u201cboring\u201d note with an old favorite in Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.40% No matter how stodgy you think this company is, there\u2019s a lot to be said for having this rock-solid company as part of your portfolio\u2019s foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s a hybrid health-care and consumer-staples play, thanks to popular brands including Band-Aid, Tylenol and Splenda, and that makes this mega-cap pretty bulletproof.\n\nMany investors soured on Johnson & Johnson after the company struggled from 2010 to 2012 amid quality-control issues and product recalls. However, Johnson & Johnson has roared back since January 2013, gaining about 50% to outperform the S&P 500. And that excludes dividends.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is fairly valued at 16 times 2015 earnings, and is scheduled to pay out only about 45% of those projected earnings in dividends so there\u2019s room for future increases.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t convince you of stability in Johnson & Johnson, consider this company is one of just four players with a AAA credit rating, boasts almost $32 billion in cash on the books and clears $17 billion annually in operating cash flow.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about volatility or a market correction, there are few better options to hide out in than Johnson & Johnson stock.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Health care is the ultimate shield from volatility and a market decline, writes Jeff Reeves.", "creator": "@JeffReevesIP", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS950_johnso_MG_20140121111739.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jeff Reeves", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Investing", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Health care is the ultimate shield from volatility and a market decline, writes Jeff Reeves.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-one-stock-sector-can-withstand-all-the-bubble-talk-2014-08-21", "author": "Jeff Reeves", "parsely-title": "This one stock sector can withstand all the \u2018bubble\u2019 talk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-21T06:00:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Investing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Health care is the ultimate shield from volatility and a market decline, writes Jeff Reeves.", "title": "This one stock sector can withstand all the \u2018bubble\u2019 talk", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-one-stock-sector-can-withstand-all-the-bubble-talk-2014-08-21", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS950_johnso_MG_20140121111739.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS950_johnso_MG_20140121111739.jpg"}, "article.id": "033745A4-289B-11E4-B336-00212804637C", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Bloomberg A beleaguered Johnson & Johnson has rebounded since January 2013, with its stock jumping 50% to beat the S&P 500.\nIf you\u2019re worried about volatility or a market correction, there are few better options to hide out in than Johnson & Johnson stock.\nSPDR S&P Biotech ETF: This spring, many investors were scared out of biotech investments as the sector broke down.\nMany investors soured on Johnson & Johnson after the company struggled from 2010 to 2012 amid quality-control issues and product recalls.\nHowever, Johnson & Johnson has roared back since January 2013, gaining about 50% to outperform the S&P 500."}
