The Netropolitan Club might be the answer. It's a new fee-based social network for \"people with more money than time,\" according to the site.\n\nThe cost is $9,000 to join and $3,000 annually thereafter. Members get a site that promises to never sell their data and to remain ad-free. Plus, the added bonus of no interference from \"the 99 percent that clutter up the rest of social media,\" said author Mark Ellwood.\n\nRelated: 13 Gadgets the 1 Percent Should Take to College\n\nEllwood, who appears on CNBC's \"The Filthy Rich Guide,\" can't understand why anyone would pay for social media when so many already established sites cost nothing. \"What I don't understand is why you wouldn't just do like the rest of us and purge your friend's list?\" he said.\n\nA Virtual Country Club for the Rich\n\nBut Netropolitan founder James Touchi-Peters says people will pay for the site for the same reason they'd join a real world country club.\n\n\"Technically the site isn't different than a standard social network site,\" said Touchi-Peters. \"The difference is you get privacy and access to a global network of people who share a similar lifestyle with you.\"\n\nA composer and former conductor of the Minnesota Philharmonic Orchestra, Touchi-Peters would commiserate with his accomplished friends about not fitting in with the general public. So he created the site, which is billed as \"The World's Most Exclusive Online Community.\" \"It's lonely at the top and you have to be at the top to understand how true that is,\" said Touchi-Peters.\n\nRich Chatter Is \u2026 Quite Ordinary?\n\nThe big advantage of paying for Netropolitan is that like-minded people can network globally to brainstorm ideas, Touchi-Peters said. But so far he hasn't read anything extraordinary.\n\n\"I haven't seen any great political debates yet, instead the conversations seem amazingly ordinary,\" he said. \"People are posting pictures of their kids and vacations.\"\n\nRelated: In NYC, Front Doors Are for the One Percent\n\nThe site launched in mid-September. He wouldn't give exact figures but said Netropolitan's community is small and growing with more people joining from outside the United States. As for the price tag, he's actually been criticized for it being too low. But since members can't have dinner and go golfing together like at a real club, he thinks it's fair.\n\nPrivacy from the Outside\n\nUsers can post status updates but unlike other social media sites they're required to display their real names, truthfully tell where they live, and any background information they provide must be real. No solicitations of any kind are allowed.\n\nUpon joining, all members are connected and can access the names of everyone on the site. A main newsfeed visible to anyone scrolls with the activity of all members.\n\n\"Most people join to meet and connect with others, so asking them to mutually accept relationships (friend requests) is pointless\" Touchi-Peters said.\n\nBut don't worry, if photo after photo of that rich guy's mega yacht becomes too much to bear, the same blocking option found on most free sites exists here too.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC:\n\nRead more at CNBC:\n\nWar on Ebola: Vaccines and treatments in the works\n\nHoliday boost may not help these three retailers\n\nGoogle Street View straps camera on camel to explore Liwa desert", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Rich and looking for an online destination to socialize privately with other rich peop", "title": "A Facebook Exclusively for the Super Rich", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/08/Facebook-Exclusively-Super-Rich", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10122013_Russian_Millionaires.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/08/Facebook-Exclusively-Super-Rich", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10122013_Russian_Millionaires.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Rich and looking for an online destination to socialize privately with other rich peop", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5c1\"", "article_summary": "\"Technically the site isn't different than a standard social network site,\" said Touchi-Peters.\nRich and looking for an online destination to socialize privately with other rich people?\nIt's a new fee-based social network for \"people with more money than time,\" according to the site.\nMembers get a site that promises to never sell their data and to remain ad-free.\n\"What I don't understand is why you wouldn't just do like the rest of us and purge your friend's list?\""}
