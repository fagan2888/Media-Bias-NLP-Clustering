More than 500 of the country's 6,400 or so urgent care centers are in the Lone Star State, possibly due to Texas' population growth and its residents' limited access to primary care. Nationwide, about 500 new urgent care centers open every year, according to the article.\n\nThe clinics are attractive tenants for developers who want to draw people to declining retail facilities, according to the article. Indeed, many retail clinics have been known to set up shop in mall spaces once occupied by non-medical businesses, such as RadioShack, FierceHealthcare has reported. But NextCare Holdings, the owner of 122 urgent care clinics in 11 states, prefers to build new clinics in already-strong retail centers \"with a big anchor tenant\" such as Target, Jeff Gerlach, NextCare's senior vice president of business development and strategic growth, told the Express-News.\n\nTarget itself has also gotten into the urgent-care game, as its California stores have joined forces with Kaiser Permanente to offer urgent care services in-store, Retail Dive reports. The retail giant is in good company, as CVS, Rite Aid, Wal-Mart, Walgreens and even Whole Foods have also started or planned a \"major expansion\" of their clinical health services, according to the article.\n\nUrgent care centers are increasingly popular among patients because of their convenience and affordability, thanks to tactics gleaned in part from the fast-food industry. Rather than fight the trend, many traditional providers have instead chosen to either partner with existing clinics or roll out their own.\n\nStill, this ever-growing industry is not without its challenges and detractors. Some states' refusal to expand Medicaid and the Supreme Court's looming decision in the King v. Burwell case could affect many Americans' healthcare spending habits, according to Retail Dive. And some provider groups also have shown skepticism of urgent care centers' impact on the quality of care.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Express-News article\n\n- here's the Retail Dive article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals must respond to urgent care evolution\n\nDo urgent care centers hurt patients?\n\nRetail clinics seek mall space to reach wider patient base\n\nWhat hospital leaders should know about urgent care centers\n\nUrgent care clinics use fast-food industry tactics to deliver affordable, efficient healthcare\n\nConsumers turn to retail clinics for convenience, affordability", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rise of retail health has proven to be a major disruptor in the healthcare industry, and recent reports indicate that its power will not dissipate anytime soon.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The rise of retail health has proven to be a major disruptor in the healthcare industry, and recent reports indicate that its power will not dissipate anytime soon.", "title": "Urgent care centers proliferate as popularity of retail health heats up", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/urgent-care-centers-proliferate-popularity-retail-health-heats/2015-06-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,consumerism,CVS,Kaiser Permanente,Marketing,Operations & Business Management,retail health,Rite-Aid,Target,Urgent Care Centers,Wal-Mart,Whole Foods", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Marketing,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the Express-News article- here's the Retail Dive articleRelated Articles:Hospitals must respond to urgent care evolutionDo urgent care centers hurt patients?\nAnd some provider groups also have shown skepticism of urgent care centers' impact on the quality of care.\nRetail clinics seek mall space to reach wider patient baseWhat hospital leaders should know about urgent care centersUrgent care clinics use fast-food industry tactics to deliver affordable, efficient healthcareConsumers turn to retail clinics for convenience, affordability\nNationwide, about 500 new urgent care centers open every year, according to the article.\nUrgent care centers are increasingly popular among patients because of their convenience and affordability, thanks to tactics gleaned in part from the fast-food industry."}
