Mae Beavers\u2019 bill to block Obamacare, \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is constitutional. State laws cannot trump federal laws.\u201d\n\nJacob Gershman at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Law Blog suggested the same before having to retract shortly after.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction of many \u201cexperts\u201d is to claim that \u201cfederal laws trump state laws when they conflict\u201d whenever they write about a bill designed to take action against a federal act.\n\nMany of them don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nTHE LEGISLATION\n\nThe bills in question are not coming into \u201cconflict\u201d with federal laws at all; they seek to direct state agents and employees to stop participating in the enforcement of various federal acts.\n\nIn Washington State, for example, House Bill 2272 would ban all public employees from participating in any actions which aid the National Security Agency in its mass surveillance programs. While this would immediately ban the use of warrantless data in court proceedings in the states, it has even more significant impact in a state like Washington, because there is a physical NSA facility there which relies on third parties, such as state agencies, to provide electricity or water to stay operational.\n\nA similar bill has been introduced in Tennessee, where the NSA\u2019s encryption-breaking facility at Oak Ridge resides. And another is expected to be introduced soon in Utah, where the new NSA data center requires as much as 1.7 million gallons of water every day to cool the super computers. That water is being supplied by the state of Utah.\n\nIn a rallying cry which sounds surprisingly simple, supporters know that no water = no NSA data center.\n\nBack in Tennessee, Senate Bill 1888 states, in part, \u201cNo state entity shall establish or administer, or assist in establishing or administering, any specific regulatory scheme to operate the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or any subsequent federal amendment to such act, in this state.\u201d\n\nSimilar bills have been introduced in Georgia, Indiana, Oklahoma, and elsewhere.\n\nAnalyzing such state bills, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano considered them an effective strategy against the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf enough states do this, it will gut Obamacare because the federal government doesn\u2019t have the resources\u2026to go into each of the states if they start refusing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Florida yesterday, a bill was introduced in the state house to ban the entire state from enforcing or assisting in the enforcement of federal gun control measures \u2013 all of them \u2013 past, present, or future.\n\nNapolitano last year urged states to do just this, suggesting that the federal government simply does not have the manpower to carry these measures out. Such a bill in a single state, he said, would make \u201cfederal gun laws nearly impossible to enforce.\u201d\n\nTHE LEGAL DOCTRINE\n\nIs this legal?\n\nIn short, absolutely, the state laws do not come into conflict with federal laws in any legal sense.\n\nAll of these proposals are based on the widely-accepted legal principle known as the \u201canti-commandeering doctrine.\u201d\n\nThis means the federal government cannot require a state to carry out federal acts. The federal government can pass a law and try to enforce it, but your state isn\u2019t required to help them.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed anti-commandeering, relevant court cases being:\n\n1842 Prigg : The Court held that states weren\u2019t required to enforce federal slavery laws.\n\n: The Court held that states weren\u2019t required to enforce federal slavery laws. 1992 New York : The Court held that Congress couldn\u2019t require states to enact specified waste disposal regulations.\n\n: The Court held that Congress couldn\u2019t require states to enact specified waste disposal regulations. 1997 Printz : The Court held that \u201cthe Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.\u201d\n\n: The Court held that \u201cthe Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.\u201d 2012 Sebelius: The Court held that the federal government could not require the States to expand Medicaid, even under the threat of losing federal funding.\n\nAs constitutional scholar Randy Barnett told National Journal recently, \u201cState governments are free to refrain from cooperating with federal authorities if they so choose. In general, states cannot attack federal operations, but that\u2019s not the same as refusing to help.\u201d\n\nThese noncompliance bills do not run afoul of the Supremacy Clause, even if one were to claim that all federal laws are supreme, instead of just those made \u201cin pursuance\u201d of the delegated powers in the constitution.\n\nClaiming they do is like claiming people who are boycotting a business are actually setting fire to it instead of just choosing not to shop there.\n\nIt\u2019s just as absurd. Saying no to participation is far different than a physical standoff, both legally and practically.\n\nCAN IT WORK?\n\nSimply put, the federal government cannot force state or local governments to do the bidding of the federal government. Such a tactic is an extremely effective way to stop a federal government busting at the seams.\n\nEven the National Governors Association admitted the same recently when they sent out a press release noting that \u201cStates are partners with the federal government in implementing most federal programs.\u201d\n\nThat means states can create impediments to enforcing and implementing \u201cmost federal programs.\u201d\n\nJames Madison, the \u201cFather of the Constitution,\u201d advised this very tactic. Madison supplied the blueprint for resisting federal power in Federalist 46. He outlined several steps that states can take to effective stop \u201can unwarrantable measure,\u201d or \u201ceven a warrantable measure\u201d of the federal government. Anticipating the anti-commandeering doctrine, Madison called for \u201crefusal to cooperate with officers of the Union\u201d as a method of resistance.\n\nThis same process was used effectively by Northern Abolitionists in resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. And in Colorado, the whole world is able to see first-hand just how effective the states can be when they refuse to go along with federal \u201claws\u201d\n\nWe should follow their courageous path against every other unconstitutional federal act as well.\n\nMoving forward, burning up the phone lines to your state house, asking legislators to introduce bills to refuse to participate in federal acts like Obamacare, the NSA, or gun control, can turn the tide towards liberty.\n\nRecognizing that many, if not most, federal programs rely heavily on this kind of cooperation, by enacting anti-commandeering laws on various issues around the country, they can have the effect of a practical nullification \u2013 rendering federal acts \u201cnearly impossible to enforce.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "By employing the widely-accepted anti-commandeering doctrine, states can bring unconstitutional federal acts down", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "By employing the widely-accepted anti-commandeering doctrine, states can bring unconstitutional federal acts down", "title": "Stop DC by refusing to comply: Anti-Commandeering to Nullify | Tenth Amendment Center", "url": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/01/29/stop-dc-by-refusing-to-comply-anti-commandeering-to-nullify/", "image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/12112013_madisons-advice.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/12112013_madisons-advice.png", "description": "By employing the widely-accepted anti-commandeering doctrine, states can bring unconstitutional federal acts down", "card": "summary", "title": "Stop DC by refusing to comply: Anti-Commandeering to Nullify | Tenth Amendment Center"}, "fb": {"pages": 143173285763}, "keywords": "anticommandeering,nullification,anti-commandeering,commandeering,printz,nullify,michael boldin\\'s column", "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/tenthamendmentcenter", "tag": "michael boldin's column", "published_time": "2014-01-29T13:49:58Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T13:49:58Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In short, absolutely, the state laws do not come into conflict with federal laws in any legal sense.\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed anti-commandeering, relevant court cases being:1842 Prigg : The Court held that states weren\u2019t required to enforce federal slavery laws.\nState laws cannot trump federal laws.\u201dJacob Gershman at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Law Blog suggested the same before having to retract shortly after.\nAnalyzing such state bills, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano considered them an effective strategy against the Affordable Care Act.\nThe knee-jerk reaction of many \u201cexperts\u201d is to claim that \u201cfederal laws trump state laws when they conflict\u201d whenever they write about a bill designed to take action against a federal act."}
