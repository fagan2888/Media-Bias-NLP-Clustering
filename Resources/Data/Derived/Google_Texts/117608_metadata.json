Nolan of Greenwood, S.C., became the second skiing fatality at Telluride in 10 days, according to a news release from the San Miguel County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nNolan was skiing with his daughter-in-law on the single black diamond Coonskin run around 3 p.m. Saturday when the accident happened. His daughter-in-law told sheriff\u2019s deputies that Nolan was slightly behind her but then passed her as he was sliding headfirst on his side. One ski was missing, the news release said.\n\nA ski patrol member riding a lift told deputies she saw the man sliding fast with both skis missing when he fell from the top of the Coonskin pitch into some trees, according to the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nTelluride ski patrollers reached Nolan within minutes, but he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. CPR was unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by this tragic loss, and our thoughts are with the family,\u201d Sheriff Bill Masters said in the news release.\n\nNolan is survived by his wife, Phyllis Nolan, two sons and a brother. He and his wife are co-owners of a business management firm in Greenwood, a town of 23,000 about 1\u00bd hours from the state capital of Columbia.\n\nOn March 9, William Scott Elligott of Colorado Springs died after losing control on steep terrain and tumbling into a steep wooded area at Telluride. He was with his 20- year-old daughter, according to the San Miguel sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "South Carolina man dies in Telluride skiing accident", "title": "South Carolina man dies in Telluride skiing accident", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/south-carolina-man-dies-in-telluride-skiing-accident/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__telluridep1.jpg", "height": 527}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__telluridep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T18:58:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:33:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd356a\"", "article_summary": "A 69-year-old man from South Carolina died while skiing at Telluride when he apparently crashed into trees.\nTelluride ski patrollers reached Nolan within minutes, but he was not breathing and did not have a pulse.\nNolan was skiing with his daughter-in-law on the single black diamond Coonskin run around 3 p.m. Saturday when the accident happened.\nHis daughter-in-law told sheriff\u2019s deputies that Nolan was slightly behind her but then passed her as he was sliding headfirst on his side.\nGeorge A.
