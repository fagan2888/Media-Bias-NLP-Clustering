Sen. John Barrasso on Sunday added to his criticism of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ handling of the ObamaCare website, saying she is now the “laughingstock of America.”

The comments by Barrasso, R-Wyo., who last week called for Sebelius’ resignation, follow NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” comedy show in which the opening skit featured an actor pretending to be Sebelius talking about the site and its problems.

Barrasso is just one of dozens of congressional Republicans who have called for the resignation of Sebelius, whose agency has handled the development and Oct. 1 rollout of the site.

Thirty-three House Republicans, separately, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to ask for the resignation. They appeared to be joined Sunday in the call by Tennessee GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who said Sebelius will testify on Capitol Hill this week "before she's out the door."



"The incompetence in building this website is staggering," Blackburn told "Fox News Sunday."

Sebelius last week fought back against calls for her resignation, saying she doesn’t work for the people asking her to resign and that “no one is getting fired” over the glitches.

Barrasso made his comments Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” and was followed on the show by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who said he thinks Sebelius should stay.
