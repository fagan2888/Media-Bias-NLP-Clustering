Paul LePage celebrates his re-election bid on Nov. 5, 2014, in Lewiston, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2013Maine GOP Gov. Paul LePage Wednesday reacted strongly, and with a personal note, to news that President Barack Obama was soon to announce his plan to take executive action to shield millions of immigrants from deportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very shameful,\u201d said Mr. LePage, who said he had followed existing immigration procedures to spend 11 years and $80,000 to secure a green card for a young Jamaican, now 29 years old, who he calls his adopted son.\n\n\u201cI should have just told him to go to Mexico and jumped the fence,\u201d said Mr. LePage, who was here attending the semiannual meeting of the Republican Governors Association.\n\nAmong the other Republicans there who criticized the impending Obama move was Gov-elect Larry Hogan of Maryland who said the White House should not be setting immigration policy unilaterally. \u201cYou should really get the input of Congress and the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback also criticized the move, saying that Mr. Obama would be wiser to move piecemeal immigration law changes through Congress. \u201cThe way to do this is to go for narrow shots,\u2019\u2019 such as expanding agricultural worker or high technology worker visas, Mr. Brownback said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to work with Congress.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the president was demonstrating \u201carrogance,\u201d and he should work with Congress on changes to immigration laws.\n\n\u201cI hope there will be Democrats of conscience who will stand up and say this is wrong,\u201d Mr. Jindal said about unilateral action. \u201cThe president can\u2019t simply choose to ignore the law. There is a separation of powers for a reason.\u201d\n\nMr. Jindal said that more needs to be done to secure America\u2019s borders, while efforts should also be made to assist those who want to come to the U.S. legally.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Maine GOP Gov.
