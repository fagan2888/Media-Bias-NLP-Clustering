The Mayo Clinic

Healthcare ratings service Healthgrades last week named its Top 100 hospitals for 2015, basing their ratings on a host of clinical outcomes for treating major health issues, including sepsis, pneumonia, heart attack, heart failure, respiratory failure and stroke.

The selected hospitals are spread across 28 states. California scored the highest with 21 top hospitals, according to Healthgrades.

The company said it compared data from 2011-2013 to determine which hospitals earned a spot on the annual list, and praised the hospitals for taking measures that regularly save lives. In fact, Healthgrades claimed that nearly 173,000 lives could have been saved in that two-year span if all hospitals across the country performed like the facilities on their list.

The list actually includes more than 100 hospitals, since several health systems have multiple campuses that were honored.

On Tuesday, a report in Health Affairs showed how hospital rankings across major “Top Hospitals” lists vary widely based on the criteria used to determine honorees. For example, lists by Leapfrog and Consumer Reports focus heavily on patient safety, while Healthgrades puts the greatest emphasis on patient outcomes.

These lists also have different criteria for eligible hospitals, the report said. Leapfrog excludes hospitals that do not participate in the inpatient prospective payment system run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Healthgrades, on the other hand, focuses on outcomes related to 27 common procedures using data from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review. However, the report said Healthgrades also requires that hospitals have earned a Distinguished Hospital Award from its own agency in the past four years to be considered, which narrows the field.

Here’s the full list from Healthgrades:
