Neil Patrick Harris effectively stole the 2014 Tony Awards with his performance of “Sugar Daddy” from Hedwig and the Angry Inch. During the song, Harris ventured into the audience at Radio City Music Hall where he proceeded to take off Samuel L. Jackson’s glasses and lick them before grinding on the laps of Sting and Kevin Bacon.

Harris capped thing off the show-stopping number by leaning off the front of the stage and planting a passionate kiss on his husband, David Burtka, who was seated in the first row.

ESPN viewers may have been shocked when something very similar happened on live TV during the NFL draft, but no one watching the Tonys should have been too surprised by this public display of affection.

Shortly after the performance, Harris took home the award for Best Actor in a Musical, thanking Burtka and their two children.
