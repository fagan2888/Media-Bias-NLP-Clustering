1MDB said in a statement that the fund, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), had agreed to assume its interest payments on a bond but one such payment due on Monday had not been paid due to a dispute between them.

"1MDB wishes to make clear that it and its group entities will meet all of their other obligations under any other financing arrangements and have ample liquidity to do so," it added.

IPIC had said earlier in a filing to the London stock exchange that 1MDB was in default of obligations worth $1.1 billion.

(This version of the story removes the reference to "$1.75 billion bond" in paragraph 1)
