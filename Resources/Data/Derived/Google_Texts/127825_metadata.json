Bernie Sanders, call for such a repeal, is believed to be motivated in part by opposition to the tax among labor unions, a key constituency for the Democratic Party. Unions are largely against the tax because health-care benefits are among the most valued parts of negotiated labor contracts.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, usually no friend to unions, also is strongly against the tax. And Republican politicians have lined up against the tax.\n\nBut the letter sent Thursday to the Ways and Means and Finance committees of both houses of Congress underscores the fact that repealing the Cadillac tax won't come without a cost. That letter cited the tax's role in both controlling rising overall health-care costs, and generating tens of billions of dollars of revenue for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe letter from 101 economists and policy analysts noted that the tax was included in the Affordable Care Act to address the \"economically inefficient and regressive\" tax policy that allows the \"unlimited exclusion of employer-financed health insurance from income and payroll taxes.\"\n\nAmong the signatories were MIT's Jonathan Gruber, an architect of the ACA who gained notoriety last year when it was revealed that he publicly cited \"the stupidity of the American voter\" as one of the factors that led to Obamacare getting passed into law.\n\nThe group wrote that the tax \"will help curtail the growth of private health insurance premiums by encouraging employers to limit the cost to the tax-free amount.\"\n\n\n\nThey also said that the tax will discourage insurance that is so generous to workers that they \"have little incentive to insist on cost-effective care, and providers have little incentive to provide it.\" A key theory behind the tax is that if workers are forced to pay more directly for medical services, they will be smarter consumers and less apt to get treatment that is unnecessary, or which could be obtained at a lower cost.\n\nThe economists and analysts wrote that \"as employers redesign health insurance plans to hold costs within the tax-free amount, cash wages and other fringe benefits will increase.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, repealing the Cadillac tax would add directly to the federal budget deficit, an estimated $91 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation,\" the economists wrote.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Many companies at risk of a tax on high-cost health plans intend to avoid the levy by making changes to those plans.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Many companies at risk of the tax on high-cost health plans intend to avoid the levy.", "title": "Obamacare Cadillac tax: Who wants it, who doesn't", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/01/obamacare-cadillac-tax-who-wants-it-and-who-wont-pay.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/02/102468485-GettyImages_464680276.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many companies at risk of the tax on high-cost health plans intend to avoid the levy.", "title": "Obamacare 'Cadillac tax'\u2014who wants it, and who won't pay", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/01/obamacare-cadillac-tax-who-wants-it-and-who-wont-pay.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/02/102468485-GettyImages_464680276.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, US: News, Politics, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-10-01T15:24:39-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T15:24:40-0400", "tag": "Bernie Sanders"}, "pageNodeId": 103044112, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Cadillac Tax, Clinton, insurance, dodging, avoid, repeal"}, "article_summary": "\"Furthermore, repealing the Cadillac tax would add directly to the federal budget deficit, an estimated $91 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation,\" the economists wrote.\nEarlier this week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, called on Congress to repeal the Cadillac tax, and \"to fully pay for the cost of the repeal.\"\nBut the letter sent Thursday to the Ways and Means and Finance committees of both houses of Congress underscores the fact that repealing the Cadillac tax won't come without a cost.\nThe economists and analysts wrote that \"as employers redesign health insurance plans to hold costs within the tax-free amount, cash wages and other fringe benefits will increase.\"\nUnions are largely against the tax because health-care benefits are among the most valued parts of negotiated labor contracts."}
