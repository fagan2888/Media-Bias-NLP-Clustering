The state lost 7,500 jobs in April. Its unemployment rate rose from 4.4 percent to 4.7 percent. And for the first four months of the year combined, the state has lost 6,400 jobs, figures show.\n\n\"It's really been a roller coaster ride,\" said James W. Hughes, an economist at Rutgers University. \"It's a head-scratcher to figure out why it's jumping around so much.\"\n\nThe monthly unemployment report is made up of a survey employers to measure the number of jobs and a survey of households to measure the jobless rate. The employment figures are preliminary and will be revised next month.\n\nMORE: NJ job growth; slow might be 'new normal'\n\nBig gains and losses\n\nThe state after spending more than a decade in the doldrums showed signs of life last year when it added 81,600 jobs. But the beginning of 2016 has included not only a record gain of 22,000 jobs in March, but also a steep loss of 15,700 jobs in January.\n\nFor perspective, the U.S. added 769,000 jobs the first four months of the year. Since New Jersey accounts for about 3 percent of the nation's labor force, it should have gained 23,070 jobs.\n\nEconomists caution not to put too much stock in monthly job reports. But it often seems like a futile plea. Policymakers and lobby groups are watching closely as they debate whether New Jersey should lower its estate tax, raise its gasoline tax, increase the minimum wage as high as $15 an hour, and find ways to close an $843 million budget deficit.\n\nMORE: Would $15 minimum wage cost 70,000 NJ jobs?\n\nIn April, New Jersey lost 10,800 private-sector jobs and gained 3,300 public-sector jobs.\n\nSectors with the biggest gains: Trade, transportation and utilities added 1,300 jobs; manufacturing added 1,100 jobs; and financial activities added 800 jobs.\n\nSectors with the biggest losses: Professional and business services lost 6,700 jobs; and construction, information and leisure and hospitality all lost 1,800 jobs.\n\nMORE: Here's how scammers try to rob job seekers\n\nStill, employers are hiring at the Shore.
