Tonight, one senator wants to honor him for his work off the field.\n\nLucroy, 28, will attend the State of the Union address as a guest of Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a recognition he told ESPN was a \u201chuge honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do something not a lot of people get to do. I\u2019m going to do something or see something that a lot of people won\u2019t be able to watch or see,\u201d said Lucroy.\n\nJohnson said in a statement that Lucroy wasn\u2019t invited for his play on the field, but because he is \u201can even bigger hero off the field: He is using his baseball fame to highlight some great Wisconsin charities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Lucroy\u2019s charitable service illustrates [American] ideals by shining a light on the good work Wisconsinites are doing for their communities. It is an honor to in turn honor Mr. Lucroy,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Lucroy is a frequent visitor to Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin, and has volunteered for organizations like the Muscular Dystrophy Association and Brewers Community Foundation.\n\nLucroy told ESPN that military and veterans\u2019 charities became particularly important to him after one of his best friends, John Coker, was injured during his service in Afghanistan. The Lacrosse Tribune reports that he helps raise funds for Milwaukee\u2019s Fisher House and invites veterans to Brewers games.\n\nOne of the military charities he works with is the Honor Flight Network, an organization that brings veterans to Washington to visit the war memorials on the National Mall.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about that, it became personal to me,\u201d Lucroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that I take it serious. I take it personal. I want them to feel important. I want them to feel good.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Tribune, in November, Lucroy volunteered to travel with 41 World War II and 47 Korean War veterans to Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThe thing about World War II and Korean War veterans, they\u2019re getting up in age and they won\u2019t be around for much longer. Any time I can spend with them I will treasure for the rest of my life,\u201d Lucroy told the Tribune.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonathan Lucroy, 28, will attend the State of the Union address as a guest of Sen.
