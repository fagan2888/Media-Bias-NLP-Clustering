Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin declared Saturday, "The GOP establishment in Congress is our abuser. We can’t hide the black eyes any more."

Well, this is one hell of an analogy.

In a guest column Saturday on Breitbart, Sarah Palin likened GOP lawmakers backing the federal spending bill to domestic abusers battering their wives.

"The GOP establishment in Congress is our abuser," the former Republican Alaska governor wrote of the relationship between Republican lawmakers and conservative voters. "We can’t hide the black eyes any more. The whole neighborhood knows ... But like a battered wife, we keep going back because every four years they bring us flowers, beg our forgiveness, and swear they’ll never hit us again."

The head-scratching comparison comes after Congress avoided another government shutdown Friday by reaching an agreement on a $1.8 trillion spending bill. Much to Palin's dismay, the bill secured funding for Planned Parenthood, the Affordable Care Act, tax benefits promoting renewable energy and protections for refugees.
