REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS MILITARY) - RTX13ESZ\n\n4013236\n\nThe pending budget deal brokered by Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray has upset many conservatives. While Bill Kristol argues it\u2019s \u201ca good deal for conservatives and Republicans\u201d and the Wall Street Journal says it\u2019s \u201cthe least bad budget deal,\u201d many others are voicing concern.\n\nIt is viewed by many as not only a betrayal, but as almost a non sequitur \u2014 yet another example of the GOP voluntarily grasping defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nNot perfect by any means, the sequester has done what nothing else could: it actually cut spending. And that\u2019s an almost impossible task. \u201cI am old enough to remember when the GOP said not to worry about it caving on Obamacare funding because, by God, it would hold the line on sequestration,\u201d writes Erick Erickson over at RedState.\n\nErickson\u2019s not alone. FreedomWorks and AFP also oppose it. Last night, Sen. Marco Rubio came out against the deal. And Heritage Action\u2019s Michael Needham argued it was \u201ca step backward,\u201d noting that \u201cit represents an immediate increase in federal spending\u201d and \u201crelies upon promises of future cuts that the demise of the sequester vividly illustrates cannot be counted on.\u201d\n\nSo far, this sounds like we are reverting to the lines that were drawn during the \u201cdefund ObamaCare\u201d debacle, when conservatives feuded over different strategic visions.\n\nBut, in this battle, the grassroots conservative coalition is growing. This morning on Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn said he was \u201creal disappointed in the deal.\u201d (Scarborough and Coburn were both opposed to the defund strategy, but both are now voicing concern about this budget deal.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t terribly surprising. It\u2019s one thing to push for an audacious and unachievable defund strategy; it\u2019s quite another thing to simply want to maintain status quo sequester spending levels.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives should be reflexively opposed to cutting a deal. Conservatives might be willing to give in on the sequester in favor of real entitlement reform. But the notion of abandoning discretionary spending cuts based on the promise of future cuts is a bridge too far.\n\nRegardless, the danger is that Republicans will now change the subject from Obama\u2019s failures (see his recent poll numbers). Ironically, Republican supporters of the deal believe this is the best way to avoid that fate. We shall see.\n\nYou can watch Sen. Coburn on Morning Joe below.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
