The federal government is sued all the time over wildlife decisions by every variety of interest group, and usually wins.\n\nBut not always \u2014 which is why it was good to see Colorado and Gunnison County each file a notice of intent to sue Fish & Wildlife in recent weeks over its unnecessary move to list the sage grouse.\n\nThe notices must be accompanied by explanations of the grounds for the pending lawsuits, and these too were encouraging. The state and county are not just quibbling over the odd procedural misstep by the federal government. They\u2019re disputing the scientific judgments the agency used as the foundation for its decision.\n\n\u201cIn making the listing decision, FWS improperly analyzed the required factors to make its determination that the Gunnison sage-grouse is threatened; failed to rely on the best available science; and failed to give adequate weight to the extensive conservation efforts undertaken by state and local governments and private landowners,\u201d the state\u2019s notice said.\n\nGunnison County similarly declared that Fish & Wildlife is flatly wrong about the sage grouse being threatened. The population of the Gunnison Basin, where 86 percent of the species live, is growing, the county points out, and the Rangeland Conservation Plan \u201cestimates that the likelihood of the species becoming extinct in the next 50 years is less than 0.5 percent.\u201d\n\nThe most interesting parts of the county\u2019s brief, however, have to do with the extensive measures officials have taken over the years to protect the species, not only in the main basin but increasingly in the counties that have \u201csatellite\u201d populations of the bird, too.\n\nThe county maintains that a federal representative attended 69 meetings of the Gunnison Basin Sage-grouse Strategic Committee from September 2006 through December 2012 and yet never indicated those efforts \u201cwere inappropriate, insufficient or otherwise unacceptable.\u201d\n\nTo the contrary, \u201cDirector Ashe commented at a public meeting at Western State Colorado University that the conservation efforts are \u2018inspirational.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInspirational, huh?\n\nIt will be interesting to see what a federal judge makes of all this.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Suing the federal government over sage grouse", "title": "Suing the federal government over sage grouse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/suing-the-federal-government-over-sage-grouse/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__OP04SAGEGROUSEp1-1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__OP04SAGEGROUSEp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T12:48:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:27:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e9a\"", "article_summary": "Gunnison County similarly declared that Fish & Wildlife is flatly wrong about the sage grouse being threatened.\nFish & Wildlife director Daniel Ashe was in The Denver Post\u2019s offices in November, he was exceedingly confident about his agency\u2019s chances of prevailing if the state sued over its decision to list the Gunnison sage grouse as threatened.\nThe federal government is sued all the time over wildlife decisions by every variety of interest group, and usually wins.\nThe state and county are not just quibbling over the odd procedural misstep by the federal government.\nBut not always \u2014 which is why it was good to see Colorado and Gunnison County each file a notice of intent to sue Fish & Wildlife in recent weeks over its unnecessary move to list the sage grouse."}
