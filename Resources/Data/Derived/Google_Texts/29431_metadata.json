Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, left, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., right, say they have lost confidence in DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, center. AP Photos\n\nNearly two dozen lawmakers serving on the House oversight committee say it\u2019s time for leadership change at the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe current DEA administrator, Michele Leonhart, infuriated committee members Tuesday with her testimony about agents who repeatedly attended sex parties with prostitutes that were funded by drug cartel members.\n\nNone of the misbehaving agents were fired. Seven of them were punished with suspensions of between one and 10 days. The Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general reported on the wild overseas escapades last month.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said after the hearing that Leonhart should resign or be fired.\n\n\n\n[FLASHBACK: Pro-Pot Congressmen Denounce DEA Administrator]\n\nIn a remarkably bipartisan Wednesday afternoon declaration, Chaffetz, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and 20 other members said they have no confidence in Leonhart.\n\nRepublicans Justin Amash of Michigan, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina signed on alongside Democrats Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, Gerry Connolly of Virginia and Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cAfter over a decade of serving in top leadership positions at DEA, Administrator Leonhart has been woefully unable to change or positively influence the pervasive \u2018good old boy\u2019 culture that exists throughout the agency,\u201d the committee members said.\n\n\u201cFrom her testimony, it is clear that she lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their position,\u201d they said. \u201cMs. Leonhart has lost the confidence of this Committee to initiate the necessary reforms to restore the reputation of a vital agency.\u201d\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Leonhart Fumes About White House Playing Softball With Pot Legalizers]\n\nA DEA spokesman said the agency needed to digest the development before offering comment.\n\nLeonhart was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010. She had been acting administrator of the DEA since 2007.\n\nUntil now, Leonhart's most vocal critics had been drug reform advocates, who she memorably infuriated at a 2012 congressional hearing by declining to say if marijuana is less harmful than crack cocaine or heroin.\n\nLast year, supporters of more liberal pot laws urged Obama to fire her for insubordination after she criticized him for saying smoking pot is less harmful than drinking alcohol. In a speech to sheriffs she fumed about White House staff playing softball games against a team of pot reform advocates and said the lowest day in her career was when a hemp flag fluttered above the U.S. Capitol on July 4, 2013.\n\n\n\n[MORE: DEA Says Cartels Now Smuggle U.S. Pot Into Mexico ]\n\nRep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., told U.S. News last year he found Leonhart \u201ccompletely incompetent and unknowledgeable\" and Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., urged her to \"assume a Japanese posture and resign\u201d so Obama could appoint someone more in line with his priorities. A petition from the Marijuana Policy Project urging her ouster attracted more than 45,000 signatures.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Leonhart\u2019s future.\n\nIn addition to @JasonintheHouse and @RepCummings, these House oversight cmtee members want DEA's Leonhart to go pic.twitter.com/Y77zusXkLp \u2014 Steven Nelson (@stevennelson10) April 15, 2015\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "DEA's Leonhart Doomed?
