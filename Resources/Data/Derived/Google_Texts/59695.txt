Republicans predicted that enacting Obamacare would have a chilling effect on the job market with workers fired, hours slashed and hiring slowed. The catastrophic economic outcomes have not materialized yet, but that doesn’t mean they won’t.

The Washington Examiner pointed out that the improved economy has minimized a negative impact on jobs. While more American are working fewer hours, there hasn’t been a significant reduction in employment. Hourly cuts because of Obamacare is a fact, but a small one:

More Americans are working just under 30 hours a week and fewer are working just over that threshold compared with mid-2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The shift isn’t large: the percentage of people working 25 to 29 hours a week increased about 1.5 percent while those working 31 to 35 hours declined by a similar amount.

NBC’s Chuck Todd confronted House Speaker John Boehner on his jobs prediction (earlier, he stated Obamacare would “destroy” jobs) during an episode of “Meet the Press” in early May:

“ObamaCare made it harder for employers to hire people. The economy expands and as a result, you are going to have more employees because businesses have to. But if you ask any employer in America and ask them whether Obamacare has made it harder for them to hire employees, they’ll tell you yes. Because it’s a fact.”

Boehner might have a point, as the upturn in the economy could be ending. MarketWatch reports that hiring slowed in April:

The Federal Reserve’s index of labor market conditions fell to -1.9 in April from -1.8 in March, the first time the gauge has been negative for two months in a row since the middle of 2012.

In addition to hiring pressures that small businesses might be feeling, critics of the Affordable Care Act point out that the law has not been fully implemented. The employer mandate won’t go into effect for businesses with 50 to 100 employees until January of 2016.

Though, according to Kaiser Family Foundation, almost 96% of companies this size already offer health benefits to full-time employees.

It is impossible to know what kind of lasting significance Obamacare will have until the end of next year. Less full-time jobs and reduced hours still loom as potential problems, even with an improved economy.
