Two years later, Crownpoint, New Mexico residents Malanie Begay and Kristofferson Martin were the first to earn the degree after previously completing NTU\u2019s Associate of Applied Science degree in Environmental Science.\n\n\u201cWith the shortage of Native Americans in the STEM fields, graduating students with an Environmental Science and Natural Resources degree will not only have an impact locally but nation and state-wide as well,\u201d said NTU Dean of Instructional Services Dr. Casmir Agbaraji. \u201cIt is a tremendous accomplishment by both students and we look forward to producing more graduates in the future.\u201d\n\nAgbaraji noted that those with a baccalaureate degree have an advantage in the job market as those with a baccalaureate degree or higher have an unemployment rate near 3.7 percent as compared to 7 percent for those who hold an associate degree. \u201cThere are more job opportunities in STEM fields, and having a baccalaureate degree is an advantage,\u201d Agbaraji explained.\n\nIn addition to the four-year Environmental Science and Natural Resources degree, NTU also conferred two Bachelor of Applied Science degrees in IT \u2013 Computer Science to Justin Bennally of St. Michaels, Arizona and Thale Goodluck of Crownpoint. With the four degrees, NTU has now conferred 12 baccalaureate degrees since 2013\u2014all of which have been in STEM fields.\n\nThe fall commencement was the first graduation to take place in NTU\u2019s new Comprehensive Wellness Center\u2014five months after the university opened the building\u2019s doors for the 2014 Navajo Nation Presidential Forum. Senator Benny Shendo Jr. (NM-22) and Navajo Nation Poet Laureate Luci Tapahonso served as the commencement speakers for the graduation and American Indian Higher Education Consortium Student Congress President Dwight Carlston gave the student address.\n\nTwenty-one associate degrees and 78 certificates were also issued during the commencement, which were distributed by Tapahonso, Senator Shendo, Dr. Guy and the NTU Board of Regents. In total 103 degrees and certificates were conferred.\n\nNavajo Technical University became a university in 2013 after developing nine accredited baccalaureate degrees and the Navajo Nation\u2019s first master\u2019s degree program in Din\u00e9 Culture, Language & Leadership. This past fall the university had a record high enrollment of 2,250 students across its three locations in Crownpoint and Teec Nos Pos and Chinle, Arizona.\n\nFor more information about Navajo Technical University visit NavajoTech.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Among the more than 100 degrees conferred by NTU on December 12 were the first two in BS degrees in Environmental Science and Natural Resources.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/01/ntu-confers-first-degrees-environmental-science-and-natural-resources-program-158502", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/navajo-technical-university-dwight-carlston-address.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "NTU Confers First Degrees in Environmental Science and Natural Resources Program"}, "abstract": "Among the more than 100 degrees conferred by NTU on December 12 were the first two in BS degrees in Environmental Science and Natural Resources.", "keywords": "Navajo Technical University, Native American Education, Native American students, Navajo Nation", "dc": {"title": "NTU Confers First Degrees in Environmental Science and Natural Resources Program"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/01/ntu-confers-first-degrees-environmental-science-and-natural-resources-program-158502", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-01-01T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "NTU Confers First Degrees in Environmental Science and Natural Resources Program"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe6b\"", "article_summary": "With the four degrees, NTU has now conferred 12 baccalaureate degrees since 2013\u2014all of which have been in STEM fields.\nIn addition to the four-year Environmental Science and Natural Resources degree, NTU also conferred two Bachelor of Applied Science degrees in IT \u2013 Computer Science to Justin Bennally of St. Michaels, Arizona and Thale Goodluck of Crownpoint.\nTwo years later, Crownpoint, New Mexico residents Malanie Begay and Kristofferson Martin were the first to earn the degree after previously completing NTU\u2019s Associate of Applied Science degree in Environmental Science.\nMore than 100 degrees and certificates were conferred at Navajo Technical University\u2019s fall commencement on December 12, 2014 and among them were NTU\u2019s first two degrees in its Bachelor of Science program in Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\u201cThere are more job opportunities in STEM fields, and having a baccalaureate degree is an advantage,\u201d Agbaraji explained."}
