A fired reporter fatally shot two journalists, seen above in an undated photo, as they made a live broadcast in Virginia. Before killing himself, he posted a video of the attack that went viral, a disturbing twist in the age of constant sharing.\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Apparently, what comes down must go up. U.S. stocks zoomed back up after days of volatility, partly because a Federal Reserve official said the case for raising interest rates had become \u201cless compelling.\u201d\n\nThe Dow and S.&P. 500 closed almost 4 percent higher, and the Nasdaq almost 4.25 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. But the cause of the market uproar \u2014 worries over China\u2019s economy and other troubles \u2014 raised the prospect of a real threat to the American economy. Apple, whose Beijing store is pictured above, has made a big investment in the Chinese market.\n\nPhoto\n\n4. The 19-year-old accused of rape at a boarding school in New Hampshire took the stand, portraying himself as a well-meaning high achiever who halted the encounter with his accuser, three years his junior, before intercourse could occur. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been a good move to have sex with this girl,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Marcy Borders, a survivor of 9/11 whose dust-covered picture became an enduring image of the day, died of stomach cancer. She suffered depression, addiction and financial trouble after the attacks.\n\nPhoto\n\n6. Latino media are lashing out at Donald Trump, particularly after he had a prominent Univision reporter, Jorge Ramos, ejected from a news conference. Mr. Ramos had interjected a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s call to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Hillary Rodham Clinton began a swing through Iowa, unveiling ideas to increase investment in rural areas and ethanol plants, of particular benefit to the state\u2019s farmers. \u201cThe affordability of our food, the independence and sophistication of our energy supply, and the strength of our small communities all depend on a vibrant rural America,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\n8. Ten years ago this week, Hurricane Katrina\u2019s storm surge broke through levees and submerged four-fifths of New Orleans. A Times special report concludes that a vibrant recovery for richer parts of the city has left many old inequities barely touched.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n9. The U.S. Open begins next week, but tennis stars are already on parade for business reasons. Rafael Nadal played strip tennis on Tuesday in Manhattan as part of his contract with Tommy Hilfiger, and Serena Williams is rolling out her Serena Greatness collection for Nike.\n\nPhoto\n\n10. Africa needs vultures, but between accidental poisonings and deliberate eradication, entire ecosystems are going out of whack. \u201cThe overall global picture for vultures is abysmal,\u201d said one expert.\n\nVideo\n\n11.
