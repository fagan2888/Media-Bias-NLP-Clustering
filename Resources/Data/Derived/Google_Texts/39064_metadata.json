According to PHI (formerly the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute), in 2020 the direct care work force \u2014 by that point, about 5 million strong \u2014 will become the largest occupation in the United States, surpassing the number of retail salespeople.\n\nPHI\u2019s projections draw on the Labor Department\u2019s figures but include caregivers hired directly by consumers \u2014 a group that the government doesn\u2019t track.\n\nWhere will all these new workers come from? After all, these are low-paid, demanding jobs with high rates of injury and, frequently, no benefits.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a big increase in the work force that typically fills these jobs \u2014 poorly educated, low income, usually minority women \u2014 over the next 10 years,\u201d said Joshua Wiener, director of the aging, disability and long-term care program at RTI International, an independent research institute.\n\nUsually, big demand and a limited supply would drive up prices in the labor market. But in this case, experts question whether that will occur.\n\nOne reason: About 75 percent of services provided by home care agencies are paid by Medicaid and Medicare. Financial pressures on both programs are enormous, making it unlikely that significant wage increases are in store.\n\nAnother reason wages will likely remain relatively stagnant: Most middle-class families simply can\u2019t afford to pay for these services and will do without, experts said.\n\nNationally, agencies charge a median $18 an hour for personal care aides and $19 an hour for home health aides, according to the latest survey by Genworth Financial. (Aides take home about half that amount.)\n\nSince both the Affordable Care Act and the national Commission on Long-Term Care failed to come up with a national financing program for long-term care, little help is available to most families needing to pay caregivers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get the sense that anyone in Washington feels a great urgency to step back into the long-term care debate and come up with a new solution,\u201d said Steven Edelstein, national policy director for PHI.\n\nWhat can be done about the impending caregiver crisis? Organizations that represent direct care workers argue that these jobs need to be made more attractive with better supervision and training, more opportunities for advancement, and, yes, higher wages.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s decision last fall to extend the federal Fair Labor Standards Act to direct care workers \u2014 a move that guarantees them minimum wage and overtime pay \u2014 is \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but it doesn\u2019t go far enough, Mr. Edelstein said.\n\n\u201cThe direction of Medicaid policy is to provide more services to frail seniors in the home and fewer in institutions,\u201d he said. Yet this won\u2019t be possible unless steps are taken to create a more stable, better trained work force.\n\nFilling paid caregiving jobs with immigrants is another option \u2014 indeed, already one in five direct care workers today is foreign born. But there is strong political opposition to increased immigration, which may limit the number of potential caregivers. Cultural and language differences can also complicate the caregiving relationship.\n\nLynn Feinberg, a senior strategic policy adviser at AARP, has two interesting suggestions. Family members who had previously looked after loved ones could be recruited and trained to become paid caregivers, she proposed. Or retired nurses, social workers and other health care professionals could be encouraged to see this as valuable part-time work once their full-time careers are over.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140226143047, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 26, 2014", "keywords": "Elder Care,Labor and Jobs,Medicare,Nursing Homes,Wages and Salaries,News & Research", "GBLC": "News & Research", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/A Shortage of Caregivers ( 20140226 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Judith Graham", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Judith Graham", "byl": "Judith Graham", "twitter": {"description": "Recent estimates suggest that demand for paid caregivers will far outstrip supply over the next decade.", "title": "A Shortage of Caregivers", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/a-shortage-of-caregivers/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/02/26/health/caregivers_noa/caregivers_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002736473, "description": "Recent estimates suggest that demand for paid caregivers will far outstrip supply over the next decade.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 26, 2014", "article": {"tag": "News & Research", "published_time": 1393443047, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T19:30:47-05:00"}, "utime": 20140226193047, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140226, "pdate": 20140226, "des": "Elder Care;Labor and Jobs;Medicare;Nursing Homes;Wages and Salaries", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/02/26/health/caregivers_noa/caregivers_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Recent estimates suggest that demand for paid caregivers will far outstrip supply over the next decade.", "title": "A Shortage of Caregivers", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/a-shortage-of-caregivers/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/02/26/health/caregivers_noa/caregivers_noa-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/a-shortage-of-caregivers/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Shortage of Caregivers", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/02/26/health/caregivers_noa/caregivers_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc522\"", "article_summary": "Since both the Affordable Care Act and the national Commission on Long-Term Care failed to come up with a national financing program for long-term care, little help is available to most families needing to pay caregivers.\nTopping the list of occupations expected to grow between 2012 and 2022 are personal care aides, in the No.\nFamily members who had previously looked after loved ones could be recruited and trained to become paid caregivers, she proposed.\nFilling paid caregiving jobs with immigrants is another option \u2014 indeed, already one in five direct care workers today is foreign born.\nPHI\u2019s projections draw on the Labor Department\u2019s figures but include caregivers hired directly by consumers \u2014 a group that the government doesn\u2019t track."}
