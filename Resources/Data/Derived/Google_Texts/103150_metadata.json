That is where registered nurse Natalie Smith comes in as she answers calls on REMSA\u2019s nurse health line at 775-858-1000.\n\n\u201cPeople can call in if they are having non-emergent health care needs,\u201d said Elaine Messerli with REMSA.\n\nThe program was started with nearly a $10 million grant from the federal government due to the Affordable Care Act. It is an effort to stop non-emergencies from clogging up hospital emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cThe nurses assess and triage callers over the phone to get them to the right level of care,\u201d said Messerli.\n\nThe service is free and REMSA started taking calls last September just in time for flu season.\n\n\u201cWe average about 2,000 calls a month,\u201d said Messerli. \u201cOver the last month we have noticed a lot of fevers, flu and cold-like symptoms, abdominal pain, those types of things.\u201d\n\nThe nurse health line is intended to point the caller in the right direction. They do not refill prescriptions or give medication guidance as many callers tend to ask about. However, the feedback from hospitals so far has been positive.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals, the urgent care centers and the physicians' offices that we work with seem very happy with our service,\u201d said Messerli.\n\nAfter the grant money runs out in July of 2015, REMSA hopes local hospitals and the community will continue to support the Nurse Health Line.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Averaging 2,000 calls a month in part to a bad flu season.", "language": "english", "author": "Paul Harris", "og": {"url": "http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/REMSA-Nurse-Health-Line-Calls-Increase-288351541.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*600/REMSA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Averaging 2,000 calls a month in part to a bad flu season.", "title": "REMSA Nurse Health Line Calls Increase"}, "keywords": "REMSA Nurse Health Line Calls Increase", "fb": {"pages": 39225221502}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "0ZhUa7TQ_r1sSB7AzH3l8tpd9Mq-KDKQRH7qc8HMudg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "REMSA Nurse Health Line Calls"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc133\"", "article_summary": "That is where registered nurse Natalie Smith comes in as she answers calls on REMSA\u2019s nurse health line at 775-858-1000.\nAfter the grant money runs out in July of 2015, REMSA hopes local hospitals and the community will continue to support the Nurse Health Line.\n\u201cPeople can call in if they are having non-emergent health care needs,\u201d said Elaine Messerli with REMSA.\n\u201cOver the last month we have noticed a lot of fevers, flu and cold-like symptoms, abdominal pain, those types of things.\u201dThe nurse health line is intended to point the caller in the right direction.\nThe service is free and REMSA started taking calls last September just in time for flu season."}
