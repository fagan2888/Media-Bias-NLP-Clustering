With this case, their insurance bills hang in the balance.\n\nWhile most people in Maine don\u2019t use Healthcare.gov, relying instead on plans provided through their jobs or on Medicaid and Medicare, costs for everyone will jump if the subsidies vanish, some experts say.\n\nAbout 61,000 Maine residents \u2014 or nearly 90 percent of those who enrolled through Healthcare.gov \u2014 rely on the subsidies granted to individuals and families with low to moderate incomes.\n\nTheir premiums would shoot up 383 percent without the subsidies, the fourth highest percentage increase among the 34 states using Healthcare.gov, Kaiser found.\n\nThe average premium in Maine with a subsidy was $88 this year, according to Kaiser. If the Supreme Court rules against the subsides, premiums for Mainers with Healthcare.gov plans would jump to $425 per month, based on Kaiser\u2019s analysis. On average, each Maine enrollee was awarded $337 in tax credits.\n\n\u201cIf people lose their subsidies because of this case, it\u2019s going to be devastating in every state that it impacts, but clearly Maine really is at some serious risk,\u201d said Emily Brostek, executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, an Augusta advocacy group that supports the health reform law.\n\nPeople who can\u2019t get affordable health insurance through their jobs and earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 between $23,850 and $95,400 per year for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for subsidies.\n\nNationally, 6.4 million people would lose financial assistance worth $1.7 billion if the court rules against the subsidies, Kaiser found. Enrollees would pay 287 percent more a month on average if they have to shoulder the full cost of coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem created by this president and the previous Congress,\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a likely Republican candidate for president in 2016, said Tuesday, the Washington Post reported. \u201cIt\u2019s something that requires a solution at the federal level. States didn\u2019t create this problem, the federal government did. And they should fix it.\u201d\n\nHealth policy experts say consumers wouldn\u2019t have to repay any subsidies because the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t be retroactive. But loss of the financial help could make health insurance unaffordable for millions of people.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that anything that people have received in tax credits so far, you\u2019re not going to have to pay back,\u201d Brostek said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is exactly when those subsidies would go away.\u201d\n\nThe Urban Institute estimates the number of uninsured Mainers would rise by 50,000 without the subsidies. That would affect even people who buy their own health insurance without subsidies, because premiums would increase if insurers lose young and healthy members who offset the costs for older, sicker members, experts say.\n\nHospitals also would be left scrambling to cover the costs of caring for more patients who can\u2019t pay their medical bills, jacking up overall health spending, researchers have found. That strain on the health care system ultimately raises costs for everyone, experts say.\n\nIn Maine, hospitals would be forced to absorb nearly $146 million in costs to treat patients without insurance, the Urban Institute found in another study. Much of that would result from uninsured patients turning up in costly emergency rooms.\n\nMaine Attorney General Janet Mills has urged the Supreme Court to uphold the subsidies. A ruling in the case, King v. Burwell, is expected in late June.\n\nMaine lawmakers are bracing for the ruling to go either way, advancing a failsafe measure that would leave the subsidies in the pockets of consumers who buy individual insurance. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Linda Sanborn, D-Gorham, technically would set up a state marketplace to satisfy the legal requirements but still rely on Healthcare.gov and the federal government\u2019s call center.\n\nThe measure has attracted bipartisan support, winning unanimous backing by the Legislature\u2019s insurance committee May 14.\n\nAlyce Ornella of Harpswell told the committee the subsidies spared her family more than $100,000 in medical bills after her infant son, Sam, was rushed into surgery after his birth in February. Doctors discovered several rare congenital birth defects, repairing Sam\u2019s esophagus and developing a plan to treat his kidney and heart defects, she said.\n\n\u201cWe never expected such financially devastating medical costs,\u201d Ornella said, according to her testimony. \u201cThankfully, our baby is doing well precisely because we were finally able to get insurance through the ACA and premium tax credits. Our family is not shackled by hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills, and our child will not go without treatment he needs.\u201d\n\nThe bill is expected to move to the House in the next few days. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the subsidies, the legislation would be repealed.\n\nIn addition to offsetting premiums with tax credits, the health reform law also helps qualifying consumers to pay for out-of-pocket costs, such as co-pays. Those discounts won\u2019t be affected by the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation based its report on new enrollment data released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The data show how many Americans not only signed up for insurance under the ACA for 2015 but also paid their first premium.\n\nEarlier HHS data showed that 75,000 Maine residents signed up for health insurance through Healthcare.gov. After the government followed up to see how many paid their first premium, that number dropped by nearly 10 percent to 68,000.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand that more. \u2026 We\u2019re slowly getting a better picture of how many people are actually enrolled in plans,\u201d Brostek said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monthly premiums would skyrocket nearly 400 percent if Maine consumers who bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act lose subsidies that help them afford coverage, according to a new report.
