Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is expected to make it eight on Tuesday, and another dozen candidates of varying degrees of credibility are jostling each other at the edge of the pool, deciding whether or not to jump in.\n\nAsk Republican activists about the increasingly crowded field, and you\u2019ll hear happy talk about how \u201cwide and deep\u201d the GOP\u2019s bench is. But it\u2019s hard to believe that worries about an unwieldy primary field and visions of debate stages crammed with a dozen lecterns aren\u2019t haunting the dreams of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.\n\nRelated: Sanders Lumps Clinton with Koch Brothers and Adelson\n\nThe 2012 Republican primary was, by all accounts, significantly damaging to the eventual candidate, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. He was forced further to the right than he probably wanted to go, and had to endure weeks of internecine warfare that cost a lot of time and money.\n\nPriebus has already pledged to assert more control over the debate process this time around. Back in January, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that candidates looking to participate in the nine-to-12 debates sanctioned by the RNC would need to hit certain polling thresholds to earn a spot on the debate stage, and that the field would be culled that way.\n\nThe obvious subtext was that the RNC desperately wants to avoid a repeat of 2012, when \u201cclown car\u201d analogies frequently accompanied discussions of the GOP field. But the expanding roster of GOP candidates seems to be driving the party in exactly that direction.\n\n\u201cYou have the potential for it to become a circus up on the debate stage,\u201d said Republican campaign strategist Ford O\u2019Connell. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to avoid that.\u201d\n\nRelated: BridgeGate Closes a Lane for the Christie Campaign\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The presidential map is a tough one for the Republicans. The Democrats start with a huge Electoral College advantage when you divide up the states that reliably vote for each party. That means winning will require keeping all solidly Republican states red, and convincing multiple swing states that have recently gone to the Democrats to vote Republican instead.\n\nDoing that, in turn will require scraping together as many votes as possible. But if the GOP wants to drive turnout, it also needs to avoid offending voters in the early going by barring their chosen candidates \u2013 or at least candidates who speak directly to their concerns \u2013 from even getting a place on the debate stage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem right there,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cTo win the presidential election what Republicans have to do is increase their appeal to Hispanic voters, bring every white working class voter into the tent, and try to stop the bleeding with single women under 50.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, the party has to engage its traditional base of establishment Republicans, its vocal Tea Party minority, as well as independent-minded Libertarians and social conservatives.\n\nRelated: Where Hillary Stands on Taxers, Trade, Deficit, Wall Street\n\nBecause no individual is likely to emerge as the consensus choice of all these various groups, the task for the GOP is to run a nominating process that doesn\u2019t alienate groups such as social conservatives or Tea Partiers, by not even giving them a voice during the debates.\n\nAnd there are other concerns as well. What if Carson and Fiorina, he the only African American and she the only woman currently running, fail to hit the arbitrary cutoff number? Is it worth adding a couple of extra microphones to the podium to avoid the prospect of a Republican field made up solely of middle-aged white men?\n\nWhen he announced the preliminary debate schedule earlier this year, Priebus said, \u201cThe 2016 cycle is underway, and I can tell you it will be a landmark election for Republicans. By constructing and instituting a sound debate process, it will allow candidates to bring their ideas and vision to Americans in a timely and efficient way.\u201d\n\nLike a lot of construction projects, though, this one looks likely to be more complicated than it looks, and \u2013 politically speaking \u2013 to be more expensive than anybody wanted.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The RNC desperately wants to avoid a repeat of 2012, when \u201cclown car\u201d analogies frequently accompanied discussions of the GOP primary field.
