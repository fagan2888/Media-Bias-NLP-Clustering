(Amanda Lucidon/White House Photo)\n\nA long-simmering dispute over how the Obama administration applied the Affordable Care Act to members of Congress and some of their staff has been revived and could hang up the confirmation of a new federal personnel chief.\n\nIn advance of the scheduled Thursday confirmation hearing for Beth Cobert to become director of the Office of Personnel Management, Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) raised the prospect of putting a hold on her nomination.\n\n[interstitial_link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/10/obama-wants-to-take-acting-off-beth-coberts-title-as-opm-director/\"]Obama wants to take \u2018acting\u2019 off Beth Cobert\u2019s title as OPM director[/interstitial_link]\n\nCobert has been OPM\u2019s acting director since last summer, having been detailed from the Office of Management and Budget after the resignation of the prior director following disclosure of the massive cybertheft of personal information from two OPM databases. She has spent much of the time since dealing with the fallout of those breaches; the dispute over health insurance policy also predates her arrival at OPM.\n\n[interstitial_link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/21/opm-to-federal-agencies-we-got-hacked-but-you-have-to-help-pay-for-the-response/\"]OPM to federal agencies: We got hacked, but you have to help pay for the response[/interstitial_link]\n\nVitter has been a leader among congressional Republicans who objected to how the administration interpreted a clause in the health-care law requiring that once the health insurance exchanges started in 2014, members of Congress and employees of their \u201cofficial offices\u201d would have to leave the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which covers the vast majority of federal employees.\n\nInterpretation of that provision was one of many controversial aspects of the ACA rollout, in part because the law did not define what Capitol Hill positions are within an \u201cofficial office.\u201d Nor did it address the status of the employer contribution to health insurance, which covers about 70 percent of the total cost of FEHBP premiums.\n\nUnder rules OPM issued in 2013, members of Congress designate the status of their staff positions annually for the following year. For those not eligible for the FEHBP but who enroll in a specific ACA option offered in the District, an employer contribution continues, equivalent to what FEHBP enrollees receive. The rules further specified that those forced out of the FEHBP could return to it when they retired, as long as they met standard requirements.\n\n[interstitial_link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2013/09/30/administration-moves-to-limit-but-not-end-health-insurance-subsidy-for-congress/\"]Administration moves to limit, but not end, health insurance subsidy for Congress[/interstitial_link]\n\nVitter has sent several letters to OPM since then, asking for details of how that decision was reached and arguing that the rules violate the intent of the law.\n\nHe said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cany potential OPM Director needs to explain the unnecessarily secretive process that protects Members of Congress from the burden they imposed on American citizens. Congress should be required to live under the same health care laws they imposed for the rest of the country. That\u2019s just commonsense.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Cobert dated Tuesday, he again asked \u2014 \u201cin order for your nomination to move forward\u201d \u2014 for a full explanation of how the rules were written and the justification behind designating Congress as a small business in order for enrollees in the District-based plan to continue qualifying for an employer contribution.\n\n\u201cSuch a subsidy is not available to other Americans who purchase their health insurance on a federal or state-based exchange as the ACA mandated. Therefore this amounts to a special exemption for Congress,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe added, \u201cShould you or anyone within the Executive Office of the President wish to see the nomination move forward, I will be happy to oblige and help facilitate upon a complete and full response to the requested information now pending for over two years.\u201d\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena to Cobert for documents related to the computer security breaches.\n\n\u201cOPM, under Ms. Cobert\u2019s leadership, is not cooperating with the Committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the panel\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cWe made a commitment to the American people to ensure a hack of this nature never happens again. The documents we\u2019ve repeatedly requested be provided to this Committee are essential to fulfilling that promise. Despite assurances of cooperation, I\u2019m disappointed Ms. Cobert is not working in good faith with the Committee. I will use all available remedies to obtain the information needed to conduct a thorough and meaningful investigation.\u201d\n\nOPM said in a statement that it \u201chas made every effort to work in good faith to respond to multiple congressional oversight requests,\u201d including document producing tens of thousands of pages of documents, testifying at public hearings and conducting classified briefings.\n\n\u201cTo be responsive to congressional requests, OPM has taken numerous steps to increase our previously limited capacity to respond to congressional inquiries of a large volume and sensitive nature. This includes hiring additional staff, bringing on detailees from other agencies, and obtaining document management tools that allowed the agency to respond more promptly and efficiently to Congress,\u201d it said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A long-simmering dispute over how the Obama administration applied the Affordable Care Act to members of Congress and some of their staff has been revived and could hang up the confirmation of a new federal personnel chief.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A long-simmering dispute over how the Obama administration applied the Affordable Care Act to members of Congress and some of their staff has been revived and could hang up the confirmation of a new federal personnel chief.", "title": "Affordable Care Act dispute could hang up confirmation of new federal personnel chief", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2016/02/04/affordable-care-act-dispute-could-hang-up-confirmation-of-new-federal-personnel-chief/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/files/2015/08/BethCobert.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2016/02/04/affordable-care-act-dispute-could-hang-up-confirmation-of-new-federal-personnel-chief/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "affordable care act, office of personnel management, congress, premiums, FEHBP", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, office of personnel management, congress, premiums, FEHBP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35f8\"", "article_summary": "(Amanda Lucidon/White House Photo)A long-simmering dispute over how the Obama administration applied the Affordable Care Act to members of Congress and some of their staff has been revived and could hang up the confirmation of a new federal personnel chief.\n\u201cSuch a subsidy is not available to other Americans who purchase their health insurance on a federal or state-based exchange as the ACA mandated.\nUnder rules OPM issued in 2013, members of Congress designate the status of their staff positions annually for the following year.\nShe has spent much of the time since dealing with the fallout of those breaches; the dispute over health insurance policy also predates her arrival at OPM.\nIn advance of the scheduled Thursday confirmation hearing for Beth Cobert to become director of the Office of Personnel Management, Sen.
