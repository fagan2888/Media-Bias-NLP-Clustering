The White Earth and Mille Lacs bands of Ojibwe are opposing attempts to build the $2.6 billion Sandpiper pipeline, which would snake across northern Minnesota on its way from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin.\n\nRELATED: Mille Lacs and White Earth Bands Fighting Pipelines That Threaten Wild Rice\n\n\u201cTribal governments throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin have significant concerns that the development of, and any release from, Enbridge Corporation\u2019s Sandpiper oil pipeline along its proposed route would have devastating impacts on unique spiritual and cultural resources, as the proposed pipeline route will cross directly through the most sensitive wild-rice producing lakes and rivers within the treaty-ceded territories in Minnesota,\u201d the NCAI resolution read, in calling for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to step up and advocate for tribes.\n\n\u201cThe NCAI calls upon EPA to engage with the Army Corps [of Engineers] immediately to stress concerns and advocate for the most thorough environmental review possible, including respect of tribal resources and environmental justice issues,\u201d the NCAI resolution said.\n\nFurther, the \u201cEPA must assist the appropriate Bands of Chippewa/Ojibwe to become designated as \u2018cooperating agencies\u2019 during NEPA review,\u201d NCAI said, and must \u201curge that a joint Federal-State Environmental Impact Statement be undertaken to enhance coordination around novel and complex tribal resource and environmental issues.\u201d\n\nBesides demanding the state-federal environmental impact statement, the NCAI wants the EPA to look into any other federal permits that might be required, designate a high-level official to serve as a liaison between the government and tribal governments \u201con all aspects of the Sandpiper project,\u201d and to meet with affected tribes and bands in the wake of the June 5 MPUC hearing.\n\nThe tribes, meanwhile, are continuing with action of their own. The environmental group Honor the Earth, founded and headed by activist and author Winona LaDuke, is planning its third annual Love Water Not Oil tour next month. It will wend its way nearly 250 miles from Madeline Island, Wisconsin to Bemidji, Minnesota, the route the pipeline would take.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new oil pipelines in northern Minnesota violate the treaty rights of the Anishinaabeg by endangering critical natural resources in the 1854, 1855, and 1867 treaty areas,\u201d said Honor the Earth in a media release on July 9. \u201cAll pipelines leak, and catastrophes like Enbridge\u2019s one-million-gallon spill in 2010 on the Kalamazoo River, the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history and still not cleaned up, are not unlikely.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Record Fine Proposed for Enbridge for 2010 Michigan Oil Spill\n\n\u201cThese pipelines threaten the culture, way of life, and physical survival of the Ojibwe people,\u201d LaDuke said in the Honor the Earth statement. \u201cWe will continue to work to protect our water and our rice, as our ancestors did before us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) resolution calls for full environmental impact statement on the Sandpiper pipeline through Minnesota rice", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/ncai-demands-environmental-review-enbridge-pipeline-through-wild-rice-lands-161063", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wildriceislandriverminnesota-doug_thompson_2.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "NCAI Demands Environmental Review of Enbridge Pipeline Through Wild Rice Lands"}, "abstract": "National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) resolution calls for full environmental impact statement on the Sandpiper pipeline through Minnesota rice", "dc": {"title": "NCAI Demands Environmental Review of Enbridge Pipeline Through Wild Rice Lands"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/ncai-demands-environmental-review-enbridge-pipeline-through-wild-rice-lands-161063", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "White Earth Ojibwe, Anishinaabe, White Earth Band, Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, Wild Rice, Manoomin, Honor the Earth, Winona LaDuke", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-14T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "NCAI Demands Environmental Review of Enbridge Pipeline Through Wild Rice Lands"}, "article_summary": "The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) has passed a resolution calling for a full environmental impact statement on a proposed oil pipeline that would cut through indigenous wild rice lands.\n\u201cThe NCAI calls upon EPA to engage with the Army Corps [of Engineers] immediately to stress concerns and advocate for the most thorough environmental review possible, including respect of tribal resources and environmental justice issues,\u201d the NCAI resolution said.\nIt will wend its way nearly 250 miles from Madeline Island, Wisconsin to Bemidji, Minnesota, the route the pipeline would take.\n\u201cWe will continue to work to protect our water and our rice, as our ancestors did before us.\u201d\nThe environmental group Honor the Earth, founded and headed by activist and author Winona LaDuke, is planning its third annual Love Water Not Oil tour next month."}
