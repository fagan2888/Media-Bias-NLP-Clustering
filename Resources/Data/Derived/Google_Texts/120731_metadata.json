The administration will then transmit it to the insurer, so that it can provide alternative forms of birth control coverage.\n\nHowever, the modification has not proved good enough for religious groups like the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has been at the forefront in the legal fight against so-called \u201cObamacare\u201d and its contraception mandate.\n\n\u201cEspecially after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent King v Burwell decision allowed the government to expand its healthcare exchanges, there is no reason at all the government needs religious employers to help it distribute these products,\u201d Becket Fund legal counsel Ad\u00e8le Auxier Keim said in a statement.\n\nRELATED: Obama\u2019s Good Republican Week\n\nThe government's move follows the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June 2014 to grant the request of a Christian-owned company (Burwell v Hobby Lobby), that \u201cclosely held\u201d corporations had the same religious protections as individuals, and were therefore not required to follow the contraception mandate.\n\nThe court's ruling, however, did not specify if the government had to modify the law, while public interest groups like American United for Seperation of Church and State warned that modifying the law will probably not calm down religious groups.\n\n\u201cAlthough I hope I\u2019m proven wrong, I fear that the religious right and its allies, the Catholic bishops, won\u2019t stop until they have denied access to safe and affordable birth control to as many women as possible,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, reverend Barry W.
