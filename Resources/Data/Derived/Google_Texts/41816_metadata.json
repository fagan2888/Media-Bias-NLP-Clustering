She says she\u2019s proof that \u201cthis can happen to the girl next door.\u201d Jill Brady/Staff Photographer Scarborough Police Chief Robert Moulton, right, and Officer John Gill talk about the impact of their department\u2019s Operation Hope initiative to secure treatment for drug addicts in Maine. The program served 109 people from Oct. 1, when it was launched, through the end of January. \u201cWe can say 109 people are still alive,\u201d said Gill, a coordinator for the program.

The lack of treatment capacity is largely rooted in the state\u2019s failure to expand Medicaid, said Steve Cotreau, director of the Portland Community Recovery Center, who is helping with the logistical effort to connect people to treatment.\n\nNot expanding Medicaid also restricts the type of treatment available, especially for those without insurance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone understands how hard it is to find beds for people,\u201d said Cotreau, whose recovery center does not provide treatment but serves as a social and support network for recovering addicts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nowhere in Maine to get help,\u201d said Scarborough police Officer John Gill, an Operation Hope coordinator.\n\nThere are currently no estimates of Maine\u2019s total treatment capacity, although the state lists more than 200 substance abuse providers. Most have zero or limited space for uninsured patients who can\u2019t pay out-of-pocket, experts say.\n\nDespite Operation Hope\u2019s difficulties in finding treatment and the severity of the heroin problem in Maine, police officials say it\u2019s having an impact. The program served 109 people from Oct. 1, when it launched, through Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cWe can say 109 people are still alive,\u201d Gill said.\n\n\u2018YOUR STORY ISN\u2019T OVER YET\u2019\n\nA tiny, windowless room inside the police station \u2013 barely large enough to hold three chairs \u2013 is where the addicts who come to Scarborough have received help to fight their addiction to heroin.\n\nA quote on the wall \u2013 \u201cYour story isn\u2019t over yet\u201d \u2013 offers encouraging words to those who choose to sign up and enter rehab.\n\nThe room \u2013 freshly painted baby blue and sporting a photo of a sunset \u2013 is where addicts seeking help start their journey. Many have just gone through a detoxification program before arriving at Operation Hope, while others have been able to abstain long enough, by effectively going \u201ccold turkey\u201d for some period, that they don\u2019t require detoxification.\n\nAfter staying in the room or the adjacent hallway for several hours, the next step for most is a plane ticket out of Maine.\n\nSeventy-seven of the 109 people in the program flew to Florida, California, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Texas or Connecticut for 60- to 90-day stays at rehabilitation centers. Those entering the program often wait at the police department for several hours while arrangements are being made.\n\nThe police department tries to find treatment for people quickly, and keep them at the station until they can go into a program. Those who leave the station are at risk of going home, using again and losing the motivation to get help.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a small window where we can help them. If we told them to come back in a few weeks or months, they could be dead,\u201d said Scarborough Police Chief Robert Moulton.\n\nAfter waiting to get accepted for treatment, patients immediately board a flight to what hopefully is a new life.\n\nSo far, only 30 percent of those connected to treatment through Operation Hope have received help in Maine \u2013 usually those who have insurance or can pay out-of-pocket for residential programs that can cost $10,000 to $20,000 a month.\n\nWhile those who have insurance can find treatment on their own and may not need Operation Hope as much as the uninsured, navigating the system is daunting, and addicts can lean on Operation Hope\u2019s expertise in connecting people to resources.\n\nSome addicts may qualify for MaineCare, the state\u2019s version of the Medicaid health care program for low-income people, but the administration of Gov. Paul LePage has tightened eligibility standards since he was elected in 2010, removing tens of thousands of adults from the program, especially those who have no children.\n\nThe administration has also rejected legislative efforts to expand Medicaid so that roughly 60,000 more people of different income levels or family status could be covered, and it has reduced reimbursement levels for medication-assisted addiction treatment. These steps have restricted the supply of treatment programs.\n\nTwo moderate Senate Republicans, Roger Katz of Augusta and Thomas Saviello of Wilton, are sponsoring another effort to expand Medicaid, highlighting the benefits expansion would provide in helping to alleviate Maine\u2019s heroin crisis. But the more conservative Republican governor remains adamantly opposed to Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not subsidize marketplace insurance for those earning less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nWhile there are more than 200 substance abuse providers in Maine, most either don\u2019t have slots for the uninsured, or have an extremely small number of available openings.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many uninsured heroin addicts there are in Maine, but substance abuse counselors have said it\u2019s a common problem because drug users in the throes of addiction have often lost their jobs and don\u2019t have enough money to purchase insurance on their own.\n\nWhile waiting to see what happens at the State House, Scarborough police scramble to find programs out of state willing to take on \u201ccharity beds\u201d for uninsured patients who most often can\u2019t afford to pay the out-of-pocket costs of treatment.\n\nHeroin overdose deaths in Maine have spiked in recent years, with 71 deaths through the first nine months of 2015. Meanwhile, the number of people seeking treatment increased from 1,115 in 2010 to 3,463 in 2014, according to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse, which defines \u201cseeking treatment\u201d as those who have signed up for a program that uses state tax dollars. Last year, Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook closed, as did Spectrum in Sanford, further restricting the supply of treatment. Both cited financial issues related to low reimbursements and Maine declining to expand Medicaid.\n\nFINDING A WAY PAST CHALLENGES\n\n\n\nDespite the problems, Operation Hope is finding a way to help people, organizers say.\n\nOne of the people receiving treatment through Operation Hope is Biddeford resident Morgan Palmer, 24, who spoke to the Maine Sunday Telegram shortly before being flown to Arizona to begin a 60-day treatment program.\n\n\u201cI kind of realized I didn\u2019t want to be a loser anymore,\u201d said Palmer, who has been using heroin since he was 17 before having an epiphany recently that he needed help getting clean.\n\nPalmer had insurance, but because it was through an HMO, no health care provider would take the insurance, said Jaime Higgins, a crime analyst at Scarborough police. The department struggled for two weeks to find a place that would take Palmer under his HMO plan, but finally gave up and located a charity bed for him in Arizona. Operation Hope normally tries to place people immediately, but made an exception for Palmer because of his insurance issues, Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said hacking through a maze of red tape is not uncommon when placing someone in a program. Police first look to see if insurance is possible, and if not, work their newfound out-of-state connections to find free care.\n\nThose without insurance are essentially begging for the good will of treatment programs operated in faraway states. At times, it can be a monumental task.\n\n\u201cEvery time we think we\u2019re done, and we can\u2019t place any more people, someone steps up and helps,\u201d Gill said.\n\nOperation Hope is not only challenged by the system, but also people\u2019s misperceptions about what it takes to get clean.\n\nGill said addicts are desperate for help, but police haven\u2019t been able to provide it to all of the 200 people who have walked in the door because some of them aren\u2019t mentally ready to step into a treatment program.\n\n\u201cA woman called me one time and said, \u2018If I tie up my grandson and throw him in the trunk of my car and bring him to Operation Hope, will you take him?\u2019 We said no,\u201d said Gill, explaining that the person has to be willing. People looking for treatment, for instance, only because they think they will avoid jail by doing so don\u2019t have the proper motivation.\n\n\u201cThis is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d said Moulton, the police chief.\n\nBut, Moulton said, the focus of the police department has changed since starting Operation Hope. Palmer freely admitted in front of police that he had done some low-level dealing to support his habit.\n\n\u201cA year ago, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to walk into this police station. Our approach to Morgan would have been to take criminal enforcement action against him,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve come to realize that he\u2019s not a criminal. He was dealing to support a habit because he\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\nUNSUSTAINABLE ON LARGER SCALE\n\nMoulton said the program has been an eye-opener for police, seeing people from \u201call walks of life\u201d coming to Operation Hope, including wealthy and upper-middle class people who have fallen into addiction.\n\nStudies show the heroin crisis has expanded nationally because of the overprescribing of prescription opioids. People start by abusing their prescription, and then fall into heroin use after they become addicted to pills. Heroin is a lot less expensive than buying pills on the street.\n\n\u201cYou have this sort of mental image of what a heroin addict looks like,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cThe mental image has not matched our experience.\u201d\n\nThe experience has left those running Operation Hope skeptical that the program could be replicated in many areas of Maine. They would all be competing for a limited supply of charity care beds in other states.\n\n\u201cThis is not sustainable on a much larger scale,\u201d Cotreau said. In fact, he said if Operation Hope grows much bigger, it\u2019s difficult to say whether they will be able to continue placing people into free care. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what our ceiling is. I wish I knew.\u201d\n\nCotreau said they\u2019ve been able to secure charity beds in other states mostly on the good will of the programs, and because it\u2019s their mission to help people.\n\nBut he said there\u2019s only a limited supply of such beds, and it\u2019s hard to tell when they will reach capacity.\n\nA program similar to Operation Hope is starting soon in York County, a combined effort between the Eliot and Kittery police departments. Cotreau said he wishes them well, but it will be a test of the system to see how many addicts they get, and whether they can be successful in placing them in out-of-state programs or whether the slots will dry up.\n\n\u201cIf our numbers got much larger, it would start to get really tough to place people,\u201d Gill said.\n\nThe type of treatment available is also an issue. People are being sent to inpatient, residential treatment centers that run abstinence-based programs, and research has raised questions about the effectiveness of this method.\n\nSanford Police Chief Thomas Connolly has written a 35-page booklet on heroin, has a master\u2019s degree in psychology and has extensively studied the available research on the heroin crisis. He said the only research-proven method of successfully treating opiate addictions is with the assistance of medication, such as methadone or Suboxone.\n\n\u201cWe know that 12-step sobriety-based programs don\u2019t work,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of taxpayer money. How long are we going to do this before we finally realize we\u2019re doing the wrong thing?\u201d\n\nCotreau disagreed that sobriety-based programs are ineffective, but said Operation Hope has no choice in where it sends addicts.\n\n\u201cNobody is offering charity beds that include Suboxone and methadone,\u201d Cotreau said. \u201cThey do not exist.\u201d\n\nCotreau said he \u201csees lots and lots of successes every day\u201d with abstinence-based programs, but he wishes that people without insurance and the means to pay for treatment had a choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do both medication-assisted and abstinence-based,\u201d Cotreau said. \u201cThe choice should be between the patient and their doctor.\u201d\n\nPROMISING SIGNS RESULT FROM HOPE\n\nDespite the logistical issues and frustrations with the treatment system, Gill and Moulton say the program has been worth the effort.\n\nOperation Hope is funded through Project Grace, a Scarborough-based nonprofit that pays for plane tickets and other grants. Police dedicate staff time within the department and at the Portland recovery center to the program. So far, excluding employee costs, the program has cost about $22,000, mostly for plane tickets.\n\n\u201cWhen we started this, we thought if we could help one person it would be a success, and we\u2019ve helped many people,\u201d Gill said.\n\nPeople who are in recovery are starting to return to Maine from treatment programs, and while some are not doing well, others are showing promising signs that they will stay sober, Cotreau said. The program is not formally tracking outcomes of patients.\n\nLiane, who was one of the first people to approach Operation Hope, has nearly completed her treatment program.\n\nShe asked that the newspaper not publish her last name because she will soon exit the program and doesn\u2019t want to hamper her job prospects. She said the program has given her a chance to turn her life around.\n\nNow 24, she said she tried heroin five years ago, stopped for two years and then fell into severe addiction when she turned to heroin again after her father died of cancer three years ago. Liane said she grew up in southern Maine, \u201cin a great town with a great family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt goes to show that this can happen to the girl next door,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life was a hot mess.\u201d\n\nLiane said she was homeless for about a year, but reached out to her family for help when she was stabbed in the hand during an incident in October. She said she didn\u2019t want to go into details about the stabbing, but it was related to her heroin use and required an emergency room trip to Maine Medical Center.\n\nThe stabbing was a turning point, the moment she decided she had to kick her heroin addiction.\n\nAfter having difficulty trying on her own to find treatment, Liane heard through the grapevine about Operation Hope and walked into the police station in October. Because she had insurance, she was able to stay in Maine and ended up in a 90-day program at Ginger\u2019s House, a sober living house that offers outpatient therapy. Liane said she\u2019s in the final stages of her therapy. She volunteers at the Portland Community Recovery Center and will soon enter the job market.\n\n\u201cOperation Hope is amazing. They have the most amazing, warm people and there\u2019s no stigma or shame in coming here,\u201d Liane said. \u201cIt\u2019s changing how society sees addiction. Addiction is a disease and people need help.\u201d\n\nMoulton said he became tired of seeing an endless cycle of heroin addicts being in jail for a few days, only to be back on the street a few days later scoring another \u201cbag of dope.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody aspires to be an addict,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cPeople are coming in, asking for help. They don\u2019t want to live their lives that way anymore. This program has allowed our police officers to take a step back and see a more complete picture of people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scarborough police have connected 109 addicts with treatment since Oct. 1, often by finding beds in states as far away as California", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Scarborough police have connected 109 addicts with treatment since Oct. 1, often by finding beds in states as far away as California", "title": "Operation Hope helping addicts, but treatment depends on the charity of out-of-state programs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/809745_834758-20160126_Op_HOPE_3.jpg", "height": 725}, "updated_time": "2016-02-27T23:28:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/02/28/operation-hope-helping-addicts-but-treatment-depends-on-the-charity-of-out-of-state-programs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scarborough police have connected 109 addicts with treatment since Oct. 1, often by finding beds in states as far away as California", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/809745_834758-20160126_Op_HOPE_3.jpg", "title": "Operation Hope helping addicts, but treatment depends on the charity of out-of-state programs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2016-02-28T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-27T23:28:40-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Liane, who was one of the first people to approach Operation Hope, has nearly completed her treatment program.\nOperation Hope is not only challenged by the system, but also people\u2019s misperceptions about what it takes to get clean.\nOperation Hope is funded through Project Grace, a Scarborough-based nonprofit that pays for plane tickets and other grants.\nBut, Moulton said, the focus of the police department has changed since starting Operation Hope.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nowhere in Maine to get help,\u201d said Scarborough police Officer John Gill, an Operation Hope coordinator."}
