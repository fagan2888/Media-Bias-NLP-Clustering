The research is partly funded by NASA.\n\n\u201cThis greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,\u201d said Scott Gaudi, professor of astronomy at Ohio State. \u201cHalf the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems. We had no idea if Earth-like planets in Earth-like orbits could even form in these systems.\u201d\n\nThe study provides the first evidence that terrestrial planets can form in orbits similar to Earth\u2019s, even in a binary star system where the stars are not very far apart.\n\nAlthough this planet itself is too cold to be habitable, the same planet orbiting a sun-like star in such a binary system would be in the so-called \u201chabitable zone\u201d \u2014 the region where conditions might be right for life.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "earth,homepage,nasa,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/new-frozen-worlds-435.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "A newly discovered planet in a binary, or twin, star system located 3,000 light-years from Earth is expanding astronomers\u2019 notions of where Earth-like -- and", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "NASA Discovers Frozen World In Binary Star SystemBy NASA.gov // July 6, 2014Loading the player ...star system located 3,000 light-years from EarthABOVE VIDEO: Newfound frozen world planet OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb orbits in binary star system located 3,000 light-years from Earth.\nAt twice the mass of Earth, the planet orbits one of the stars in the binary system at almost exactly the same distance at which Earth orbits the sun.\n\u201cThis greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,\u201d said Scott Gaudi, professor of astronomy at Ohio State.\nA newly discovered planet in a binary, or twin, star system located 3,000 light-years from Earth is expanding astronomers\u2019 notions of where Earth-like \u2014 and even potentially habitable \u2014 planets can form, and how to find them.\nAlthough this planet itself is too cold to be habitable, the same planet orbiting a sun-like star in such a binary system would be in the so-called \u201chabitable zone\u201d \u2014 the region where conditions might be right for life."}
