Minnesota’s health-care exchange is asking about 1,000 applicants to reapply so they can receive insurance premium subsidies.

MNsure had issues computing those subsidies earlier; the problem only applies to those who applied for insurance but didn’t enroll and don’t have a family member on a government health program such as Medicaid. The exchange is calling this group to inform them that they must reapply.

Meanwhile, the exchange’s website, which recently eliminated a security vulnerability, was down Monday for people applying for new coverage. The deadline to apply for coverage beginning January 1 is December 23, only five days away.
