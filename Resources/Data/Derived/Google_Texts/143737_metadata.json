It's hard to know, so people respond by hedging investment and hedging employment.\"\n\nParts of the law requiring employers to provide healthcare for their workers was delayed earlier this fall until 2015 by the White House, though it remains unclear if that will be made permanent.\n\nBroadly, U.S. companies remain concerned about taxes on so-called \"Cadillac\" health care plans, premium plans which many offer to employees, as well as efforts to cut costs of medical services, which could boost insurance premium costs for companies and employees, McNerney said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that many in the American business community are concerned about the impact of Obamacare on their healthcare costs,\" he said.\n\nThe 7.3 percent U.S. unemployment rate has ticked down from a recent high, and data released on Wednesday showed U.S. private sector hiring rose in November at the fastest pace in a year even as the service sector slowed.\n\nCEOs also remain concerned about pending carbon emission regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and increased oversight from the U.S. Department of Labor, he said.\n\nBeyond Obamacare, U.S. CEOs believe the economy is modestly improving, with sales, capital spending and hiring all expected to rise in the next six months.\n\nIronically, McNerney said healthcare companies themselves stand to benefit from Obamacare spending.\n\n\"Certainly it does bring some additional revenue to companies that participate in the healthcare world,\" he said.\n\nThe Business Roundtable's CEO Economic Outlook Index rose to 84.5 for the fourth quarter from 79.1 in the third quarter.\n\nA reading above 50 indicates economic growth is expected.\n\nCEOs' expectation for 2013 gross domestic product growth was 2.2 percent, unchanged from the last quarter.\n\nThe Roundtable surveyed 120 members between November 4 and November 21.\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Gerald E.
