Corrington Ave. early on the Saturday morning of Feb. 7, 2009. They may have been after something other than the Woodruff High School graduate's life, but they took it, nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThat knowledge, combined with the fact that Mario McGee's murder remains unsolved, amounts to \"torture,\" the elder McGee said.\n\n\n\n\"We know what we know, but under the law, there's nothing that can be done at this time,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAuthorities are highlighting the homicide this month as part of a push to gather new information on cold cases through Greater Peoria Area CrimeStoppers. Anyone with knowledge of Mario McGee's death is urged to call 673-9000 or text an anonymous tip to 274637 with \"GPCS\" at the beginning of the message.\n\n\n\nMario McGee had reported being shot at as recently as the Thursday night before the slaying. Authorities learned of the killing from his distraught mother.\n\n\n\nShe woke early that morning to sounds of shattering glass and a struggle in her kitchen. Two men had broken into the home before 5:50 a.m. One had Mario McGee pinned to the floor, the other grabbed the mother and started beating her.\n\n\n\nMario McGee's last words included a plea for his mother's safety.\n\n\n\nHe was shot in the head as he lay on the floor. His mother's life was spared.\n\n\n\nJust as he tried to protect his mother in his final moments, his son also worked in his daily life to provide for others, Marcus McGee Sr. said.\n\n\n\n\"Marcus flocked to the unfortunate. He was the kind of guy who would give \u2014 he would give everything he had,\" the father said. \"He was a giver, a lover, and he would do anything in his power to help those in need.\"\n\n\n\nThat very willingness to help people in need may have contributed to the situation that lead to his death, Marcus McGee Sr. added.\n\n\n\nDetective Shawn Curry with the Peoria Police Department said it wasn't clear whether the assailants escaped with anything from the house, but muddy footprints in Mario McGee's bedroom indicate the men searched at least part of the house before fleeing.\n\n\n\n\"What type of person would do this to another human being in front of their mother?\" Curry asked. \"The demented people who did this have forfeited their right to walk free, and we need to take that right from them.\"\n\n\n\nMatt Buedel can be reached at 686-3154 or mbuedel@pjstar.com.
