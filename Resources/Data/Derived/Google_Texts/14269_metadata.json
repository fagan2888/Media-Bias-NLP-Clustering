But Valor, which has won five consecutive championships, has demanded players across the state pick up their games or get blown off the field.\n\nOnce upon a time, from 1982-96, Cherry Creek was believed to be too big, too rich and too powerful to be beaten. In 1996, the Bruins won their eighth state title by 15 points, whipping an Arvada West team then coached by Dave Logan.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game. There was more than 1,100 yards in offense. We were behind 41-33 with three minutes to go in the fourth quarter. But we could not get a stop,\u201d said Logan, whose day job includes duties as a play-by-play commentator and talk-show host for KOA. \u201cAfter the loss, I had a guy call up on the radio and really rail on Creek about unfair advantages and all this stuff. I stopped him on the air. I said: \u2018What we have to do is raise our expectation level. We have to get better as a program. It\u2019s not about anyone having unfair advantages. That idea to me, with respect to an unhappy caller, was a loser\u2019s mentality.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn 1997, Arvada West came back and won the state championship. Mission accomplished.\n\nTimes change. Dynasties fall. Cherry Creek has failed to win a championship since it beat Logan 18 years ago. Maybe that\u2019s a major reason the Bruins recently hired Logan to give the program new-found glory.\n\nSince 1983, the year Elway and I moved to Colorado, prep football has never been much to write home about. Oh, there have been outstanding players, from Scott Lockwood to Jeff Byers, but never enough local preps to be the foundation for winning teams at CU or CSU.\n\nAgainst howls from jealous detractors, Valor raised the bar by winning five state title games by an average margin of 32 points. But I would argue the Valor program might have actually gained more respect by losing to Grandview and Cherry Creek during the 2014 regular season, which reminded how hard it is to go undefeated.\n\n\u201cThe name on the helmet isn\u2019t enough to win football games,\u201d Logan said.\n\n\u201cOr in our case,\u201d agreed Valor coach Rod Sherman, \u201cit\u2019s more than a letter on the helmet.\u201d\n\nV is for victory. \u201cBut it takes more than that,\u201d said Logan, who toppled the Creek dynasty during his stint at Mullen, where he owned a 13-1 record against the once-mighty Bruins.\n\nIt has never required more of a prep team to be No. 1, which has encouraged teenage athletes to rise before dawn to lift weights and elevate the level of football throughout the state with every drop of sweat.\n\n\u201cIn high school sports, it\u2019s really, really good to lose,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWe use Scripture as the foundation on our team. You look back at Scripture, and the Lord didn\u2019t use smooth sailing to teach lessons. He used the storm. That\u2019s when you get a chance to really see what you\u2019re made of and grow and improve.\u201d\n\nWhen the Class 5A title game kicks off Saturday, there will be players and parents with allegiances to other schools cheering for Creek, the fallen prep bully, to take down Valor, a private-school behemoth with all those unfair advantages.\n\nYes, Cherry Creek. Now playing the role of lovable underdog.\n\nWho would\u2019ve thunk it?\n\nCount it as another little miracle created by the magic of Valor football.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Don\u2019t pick on Valor Christian football; praise it", "title": "Kiszla: Don\u2019t pick on Valor Christian football; praise it", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/27/kiszla-dont-pick-on-valor-christian-football-praise-it/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017_055059_valor.jpg", "height": 402}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017_055059_valor.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-27T17:43:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:09:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Prep football"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf850\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn high school sports, it\u2019s really, really good to lose,\u201d Sherman said.\nCount it as another little miracle created by the magic of Valor football.\nSince 1983, the year Elway and I moved to Colorado, prep football has never been much to write home about.\n\u201cThe name on the helmet isn\u2019t enough to win football games,\u201d Logan said.\nValor Christian did not kill prep football in Colorado."}
