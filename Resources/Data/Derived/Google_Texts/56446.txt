In an interview, Attorney General Eric Holder is once again complaining that, like Rodney Dangerfield, he can't get any respect.

I would hope that my successor would not have to endure some of the things that I did. And I say “endure” only because I think I've shown respect where, perhaps, I haven't been given any.

The question is why does Holder believe that he's particularly entitled to respect?

We've been hearing this line from Obama and his cronies for a while now. People are disrespecting Obama by not calling him president (but calling Bush, Bush, was just fine).

The issue isn't respect. It's the law.

You aren't entitled to respect commensurate with your position. That's how it works in feudal societies. The respect you are entitled to is based on how you comport yourself in that position.

When you disrespect the entire nation by calling it a "nation of cowards" then why should you expect to exchange disrespect for respect?

But respect or disrespect isn't the point. What Holder calls disrespect mainly consists of attempts to hold him accountable for blatantly violating the law and obstructing justice.

Holder considers that disrespectful.

And that's the problem here. This isn't about respect. It's about doing the right thing.

You can't hijack the government, violate the law, lie about it, obstruct justice, get people killed and then complain that you aren't getting enough respect.

Respect is a form. If everything else is in working order, it's there. If isn't, then there's no place for respect either.
