The court is expected to announce later in the week which cases it will hear during the term that begins on the first Monday in October and ends in June.\n\nLater this year, the justices are due to decide whether to hear a major case involving Republican-backed restrictions on abortion access under Texas law. The court has not decided an abortion case since 2007.\n\nBefore the court recessed for the summer, it had already picked several high-profile cases for the new term. They include a challenge to racial preferences in higher education admissions and a bid to prevent public sector unions from collecting fees from non-members.\n\nIn the insider trading case, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has asked the high court to throw out a December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that reversed the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson.\n\nThe ruling marked a major setback for an insider trading crackdown underway since 2009 by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office brought charges against 96 people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Later this year, the justices are due to decide whether to hear a major case involving Republican-backed restrictions on abortion access under Texas law.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-29 07:17:47 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Later this year, the justices are due to decide whether to hear a major case involving Republican-backed restrictions on abortion access under Texas law.", "title": "With Next Term Looming, Supreme Court Justices Mull New Cases", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-term_us_56092116e4b0af3706dcba0b", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/560921821800002b00831100.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/560921821800002b00831100.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "With Next Term Looming, Supreme Court Justices Mull New Cases", "description": "Later this year, the justices are due to decide whether to hear a major case involving Republican-backed restrictions on abortion access under Texas law.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-28 07:17:47 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56092116e4b0af3706dcba0b", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Supreme Court, supreme court justices,supreme court term,texas abortion law", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Supreme Court, supreme court justices,supreme court term,texas abortion law", "published_time": "2015-09-28 07:17:47 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-28 13:38:43 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Before the court recessed for the summer, it had already picked several high-profile cases for the new term.\nIn the insider trading case, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has asked the high court to throw out a December ruling by the 2nd U.S.\nIn an important case the justices may consider, the U.S. government is seeking to overturn an appeals court decision that threw out two major insider trading convictions secured by federal prosecutors.\nLater this year, the justices are due to decide whether to hear a major case involving Republican-backed restrictions on abortion access under Texas law.\nDuring their private meeting, which starts at 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the justices will review hundreds of cases that piled up over their summer recess."}
