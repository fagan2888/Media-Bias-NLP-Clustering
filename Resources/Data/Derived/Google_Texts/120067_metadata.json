Yet it\u2019s also as political a subject as any.\n\nBeth Dooley explores this intersection of the dinner table and the soapbox in her latest book, \u201cIn Winter\u2019s Kitchen\u201d (Milkweed Editions, 288 pages, $25), a collection of essays that reflect her deep commitment to the issues behind those good-tasting foods that appear in the cookbooks she has written.\n\nWhile all of them celebrate the local harvest, this new volume gives voice to many of the farmers and food advocates she has encountered during her 36 years in Minnesota. That\u2019s the political end of her book.\n\nShe offers up the personal with a tale of her growing interest in food over those same decades, from discovering \u201cDiet for a Small Planet\u201d and \u201cThe Moosewood Cookbook\u201d in her college years to picking apples at her sons\u2019 school and weeding vegetables at a local farm.\n\nThe Thanksgiving meal serves as the framework for her story. After packing up a U-Haul in New Jersey, she made an offer to her family that they couldn\u2019t refuse: to host them at the next Thanksgiving meal in her new home. It was an invitation that was pure Dooley, a challenge she would embrace with exuberance, fearlessness and a ready smile.\n\nQ: I love that Thanksgiving shapes your book with chapters on cranberries, potatoes, turkey and the like. What prompted this?\n\nA: Thanksgiving is the quintessential American holiday, and we are the breadbasket of the country, if not the world, so it allowed me to focus on each of the iconic foods that we grow so well here and that are part of the meal. It seemed to make sense to try and look at all the themes of the book through these foods.\n\nI thought about how I could talk about everything I learned since we landed here in Minneapolis, and it really comes down to what our growers are doing that seems so right for the Thanksgiving meal.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I invited my entire family for Thanksgiving that first year. But it really showcased all the things I was beginning to discover, so that seemed like a good place to start as well.\n\nQ: What made a difference for you when you landed in Minneapolis?\n\nA: I thought the Minneapolis Farmers Market was overwhelming and exciting, and that was early on when people were talking about food. That was the \u201980s, and goofy things were going on with food then, too.\n\nI remember being fascinated with Julia Child, with Bon App\u00e9tit and Gourmet magazines. I would do things like spend all day going to the farmers market and finding everything I possibly could and making these elaborate meals and inviting people over for dinner.\n\nIt was great because I learned how to cook by doing those kinds of things.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take me long to realize \u2014 and I certainly wasn\u2019t the only one \u2014 that it\u2019s really not what you\u2019re doing to the food, it\u2019s the food itself that\u2019s so important.\n\nThe more I cooked and the more I looked for good food, the more I understood it had to do with where it\u2019s grown, how it\u2019s grown, how the soil is taken care of and those kinds of things.\n\nQ: What are you thankful for?\n\nA: I\u2019m thankful for connecting with all the people I\u2019ve written about in this book \u2014 and for the others who didn\u2019t quite fit in the pages. I\u2019m thankful for cooking and how it has connected me to people and to this place.\n\nI am most grateful seeing how many different ways people live really well. I\u2019m thankful for independent farmers and independent chefs because they are passionate and use the best practices. These are people making a good living, but not a great living [income-wise].\n\nI feel that if more businesses paid attention to values other than just being extremely profitable, then things would be different: that everyone\u2019s lives would be better and there would be more good food for everyone.\n\nMEET THE AUTHOR Beth Dooley will be at these book signings: Nov. 28, the Wedge Table, 2412 Nicollet Av.

Lake St., Mpls., 11 a.m.-1 p.m.\n\nQ: How do you get more people interested in the quality of their food?\n\nA: It\u2019s a hard message to convey, but it makes a difference when you work with the food itself. Going out to help on a CSA [Community Supported Agriculture] farm changes your appreciation of the value of food and the importance of it. Food tastes better when you are engaged that way. And you tend to care a little more about it.\n\nQ: Do folks today think too much about food?\n\nA: I have to confess that the older I am, the less interested I\u2019ve become in food as entertainment and athletic contest. What \u201cwows\u201d me these days is what Sean Sherman [who calls himself the Sioux Chef] can do with dandelion greens and cattails and the stuff we walk on. I suspect that\u2019s why chef Marshall Paulsen [Birchwood Cafe] is such a rising star, his nimbleness in responding to whatever is coming out of the fields.\n\nFollow Lee Svitak Dean on Twitter: @StribTaste", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Beth Dooley draws on years in the Twin Cities connecting the dots that make up the local food scene in \"In Winter's Kitchen.\"", "title": "Beth Dooley sings the praise of good food in new book of essays", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/beth-dooley-sings-the-praise-of-good-food-in-new-book-of-essays/351924511/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/beth-dooley-111.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/beth-dooley-111.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Beth Dooley draws on years in the Twin Cities connecting the dots that make up the local food scene in \"In Winter's Kitchen.\"", "title": "Beth Dooley sings the praise of good food in new book of essays", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/beth-dooley-sings-the-praise-of-good-food-in-new-book-of-essays/351924511/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/beth-dooley-111.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/beth-dooley-111.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Beth Dooley draws on years in the Twin Cities connecting the dots that make up the local food scene in \"In Winter's Kitchen.\""}, "article_summary": "MEET THE AUTHOR Beth Dooley will be at these book signings: Nov. 28, the Wedge Table, 2412 Nicollet Av.\nQ: I love that Thanksgiving shapes your book with chapters on cranberries, potatoes, turkey and the like.\nIt seemed to make sense to try and look at all the themes of the book through these foods.\nIt was an invitation that was pure Dooley, a challenge she would embrace with exuberance, fearlessness and a ready smile.\nDec. 6, Linden Hills Farmers Market, 3815 Sunnyside Av., Mpls., 10 a.m.-1 p.m. Dec. 9, Bockley Gallery, 2123 21st St., Mpls."}
