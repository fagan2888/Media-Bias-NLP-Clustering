So, who is David Brat? Here he is, in his own words. (Jackie Kucinich/The Washington Post)\n\nTea party challenger David Brat defeated the second-ranking Republican in the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). So, who is David Brat? Here he is, in his own words. (Jackie Kucinich/The Washington Post)\n\nDavid Brat, an economics professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., has just taught Washington \u2014 and one of its most powerful leaders \u2014 a lesson in humility.\n\nBrat was dismissed by many Republicans inside the Beltway and beyond. They saw an upstart without the brawn, dollars or organization to depose the second-most-powerful man in the House.\n\nHe did it by casting himself to the right of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on immigration and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and, more important, by giving pumped-up primary voters and conservative talkers, including Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, an opportunity to make an anti-establishment statement. Last month, Brat\u2019s tea party supporters booed Cantor at a key party meeting in his district. On Tuesday night, about 200 of them erupted in joy at a nondescript building in an office park in Glen Allen.\n\nIt was originally billed as a thank-you party for volunteers. But this was victory.\n\nBrat, who teaches Third World economics, sounded every bit the professor as he addressed his stunned supporters Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThe 10th Amendment is the big one; the Constitution has enumerated powers belonging to the federal government. All the rest of the powers belong to the states and the people,\u201d he said, getting huge applause.\n\nLaurie and Gregg Kalata of Midlothian were sitting on their couch in their pajamas after working the polls all day. When they realized Brat had pulled it off, they got up and came to the party.\n\n\u201cHe won because people don\u2019t want illegal immigration,\u201d Laurie Kalata said.\n\n\u201cThis was not a tea party election. This was a conservative Republicans\u2019 vote,\u201d said Gregg Kalata, who wore a homemade sign that read \u201c7th District GOP voters can\u2019t trust Eric Cantor.\u201d\n\nLike many candidates running long-shot races before him, Brat had spoken on the trail of a sense of momentum. That\u2019s what candidates say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting exciting \u2014 and I\u2019m not BS-ing you,\u201d Brat said in an interview last month. \u201cThis district is conservative and idiosyncratic, and they\u2019re not overwhelmed by the establishment and their millions. It\u2019s David vs. Rome.\u201d\n\nUnlike most similar seekers, he was right. Rome lost.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) gives his concession speech after a shocking upset to tea party favorite David Brat. (NBC 12 Richmond)\n\nBrat has a prominent photograph of Cantor standing beside President Obama on his Web site to embody his message that Cantor hadn\u2019t fought Obama\u2019s agenda hard enough. He summarized his own bid in a Twitter bio: \u201cI am running for Congress to be ERIC CANTOR\u2019S TERM LIMIT. Free Markets, Constitution, Liberty. No more Crony Capitalism!\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, Brat\u2019s team posted a picture of Ronald Reagan in a cowboy hat. \u201cDave pays tribute to President Reagan, and his vision for freedom, every time he says, \u2018I will make Washington, D.C., as irrelevant to your everyday life as possible.\u2019\u201d\n\nLarry Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said Brat\u2019s campaign grew from a dinner Nordvig had with filmmaker Ronald Maxwell, who directed the Civil War epic \u201cGettysburg\u201d and, more recently, \u201cCopperhead.\u201d They were hashing over ideas for good candidates to challenge Cantor.\n\nNordvig saw Brat speak at a fundraiser for E.W. Jackson, the conservative minister who nabbed the state GOP\u2019s nomination for lieutenant governor last year, only to be trounced in the general election by Democrat Ralph S. Northam.\n\n\u201cI asked him 45 minutes of questions afterward . . . about what would he do about deficit spending, what would he do about Obamacare, what would he do about amnesty . . . and he gave very satisfactory answers,\u201d said Nordvig, who described Brat as \u201cpresidential-looking\u201d \u2014 important in an era of televised campaigns. \u201cBetween his appearance and his bearing and his answers to tough questions, I knew we had the right man for the job.\u201d\n\nThe results Tuesday left him and the other supporters \u201ccrazy happy,\u201d Nordvig said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of, \u2018can\u2019t believe this has happened,\u2019 just a wonderful disbelief. Just absolutely thrilled.\u201d\n\nOn Fox host Sean Hannity\u2019s show after the victory, Brat said: \u201cI was blessed. I mean, it\u2019s a miracle. . . . God acts through people. And God acted through the people.\u201d\n\nBrat also cited immigration as a difference-maker in the campaign, saying politicians are beholden to the Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey want cheap labor, and that\u2019s going to lower wages for everybody else,\u201d he said.\n\nBrat has long reveled in poking the establishment, talking up battles against the \u201cintellectual elite\u201d while at Princeton, where he earned a master\u2019s degree in divinity, and against \u201cthe powerful elite\u201d at American University, where he received his PhD in economics.\n\nHis campaign bio points to his time as an economic adviser to Virginia governors, work that prompted an accusation from Cantor that Brat had been too chummy with former Democratic governor Timothy M. Kaine.\n\nAfter about a decade at Randolph-Macon, Brat took a more direct role in politics. In 2005, he took an unpaid position as an adviser to state Sen. Walter A. Stosch (R-Henrico), co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In that position, Brat researched higher-education initiatives, including a proposal to create a grant program allowing underprivileged students to move beyond high school.\n\n\u201cHe wanted some exposure to the legislative process, and I was glad to have him,\u201d Stosch said Tuesday. \u201cBoth of us have an interest in education \u2014 particularly in economically deprived young people who, without opportunity, would not be able to go beyond high school.\u201d\n\nStosch said Brat expressed an interest in entering electoral politics in the years he worked for him \u2014 at one point putting his name forward to fill a House of Delegates seat. But when Brat pursued his congressional run, he could not count on Stosch\u2019s open support: Cantor was also a friend and former aide to Stosch.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things where it was hard for me to become too actively involved,\u201d Stosch said. \u201cI was caught between my admiration and friendship with both of them.\u201d\n\nStosch on Tuesday said he was \u201csomewhat surprised\u201d by Brat\u2019s victory, recalling Cantor\u2019s political work ethic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perceptible anti-government mood,\u201d Stosch said. \u201cPeople are a little bit mad at Washington, and they express that in different ways.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis and Aaron Blake contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "eric cantor, virginia politics, dave brat, virginia tea party", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The economics professor from Randolph-Macon College preaches fiscal responsibility.", "title": "Meet David Brat, the man who brought down House Majority Leader Eric Cantor", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/meet-david-brat-the-man-who-brought-down-house-majority-leader-eric-cantor/2014/06/10/ed7f6406-f0fc-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikelaris"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "eric cantor, virginia politics, dave brat, virginia tea party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ed7f6406-f0fc-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The economics professor from Randolph-Macon College preaches fiscal responsibility."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc35\"", "article_summary": "Tea party challenger David Brat defeated the second-ranking Republican in the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).\n(Jackie Kucinich/The Washington Post)Tea party challenger David Brat defeated the second-ranking Republican in the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) gives his concession speech after a shocking upset to tea party favorite David Brat.\nLast month, Brat\u2019s tea party supporters booed Cantor at a key party meeting in his district.\nSo, who is David Brat?"}
