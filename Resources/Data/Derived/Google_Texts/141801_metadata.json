Well it could cost you a fortune.\n\nThe current average asking price for NLCS tickets is $1,325.93, making it the most expansive price for any League Championship Series ticket in history, according to TiqIQ.com, a tickets aggregation site. The price is for a game at Chicago's Wrigley Field.\n\nThe Cubs advanced to the NLCS when they eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-4, in Game 4 of the division series on Tuesday night.\n\nRelated: Baseball in 2015: Record High Revenues and a Shrinking Audience\n\nIt's the first time in 12 years that the Cubs will be playing in a league championship. It puts the Cubs just one step away from the Word Series, which they haven't won since 1908.\n\nDevoted Cubs fans have attributed the century-long drought to the \"Billy Goat\" curse. The superstition dates to Oct. 6, 1945, when a bar owner supposedly placed a hex on the club for booting his foul-smelling pet goat out of Wrigley Field, according to History.com. The Cubs lost, and haven't played in a World Series since then.\n\n\"Fans are definitely pretty excited this year,\" said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications at TiqIQ. \"They have a bunch of guys this year that have definitely stepped up and made this a pretty fun team to watch, regardless of who you root for.\"\n\nThe New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers play the deciding Game 5 on Thursday. If the Mets advance to face the Cubs, the average championship series ticket price listed on TiqIQ would be $1,084.31, by far a record. The previous NLCS record is $490.12, for last year's Cards-Giants series.\n\nThis article originally appeared at CNBC.
