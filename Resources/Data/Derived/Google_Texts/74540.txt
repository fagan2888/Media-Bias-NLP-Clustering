One person was injured in a shooting and carjacking at a Lauderdale gas station just around 6:40 Friday night.

It happened just off Highway 45 North at the Nixie #3 behind CEFCO on York Road. Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun says one person was shot twice. The victim has been released from a local emergency room and is recovering with non-life threatening injuries.

Authorities say a black male wearing a dark hoodie tried to rob the man and a passenger in his truck. The victims got out of the vehicle, and Calhoun says a struggle ensued, in which the driver was shot. He says the suspect got into the truck and drove away. The victim's vehicle was found abandoned with the doors open in the middle of a couple of miles down York Road near Kewanee Road.

"It's our understanding that the victim was there to meet with the individual. We believe at this point, based on our investigation that it was a type of set up and that he was there to rob them as well as take the vehicle," says Calhoun.

On scene, deputies were seen collecting several pieces of evidence. Calhoun says the gun the suspect used has been recovered, but deputies are currently searching for the suspect responsible.

"Investigators have developed some leads and hopefully we will be able to report and ask for the public's help or announce an arrest in the near future," says Calhoun.
