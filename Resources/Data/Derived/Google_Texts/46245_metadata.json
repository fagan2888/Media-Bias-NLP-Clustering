John Kirby outlined the goals that U.S. military planners expected to achieve.\n\nThat goal includes training and equipping the Syrian rebels in a foreign country over the course of about a year, according to Rear Adm. Kirby.\n\nMr. Obama had long resisted called to arm and train the rebels, pro-U.S. moderates who had been battling the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, belittling their ability to take on the government and to control the most extremist elements of the rebel coalition.\n\nThe U.S. military has already located a partner nation willing to host the training force, Rear Adm. Kirby said. Saudi Arabia has already indicated that it would play a key component in the Obama administration\u2019s training plan, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think that, now that we\u2019ve got a partner in the region to help us with the training, is that we could train more than 5,000 fighters over the course of one year,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that would be in phases. It would not be all at once. The training itself would not take a full year, but we think that we could get more than 5,000 done in one year.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon is still trying to work out details of that plan, such as how to vet and recruit those Syrian fighters who are qualified to train with U.S. military personnel, according to Rear Adm. Kirby.\n\nCongress has to approve the Obama administration\u2019s request for the funding before military personnel could proceed with their training plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pentagon has announced that it expects to train 5,000 Syrian rebels per year as part of President Obama's new campaign to battle Islamic State militants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Pentagon has announced that it expects to train 5,000 Syrian rebels per year as part of President Obama\u2019s new campaign to battle Islamic State militants.", "title": "U.S. to train 5,000 Syrian rebels to fight militants", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/13/us-train-5000-syrian-rebels-fight-militants/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/02/us-somaliajpeg-06a66.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/02/us-somaliajpeg-06a66.jpg", "description": "The Pentagon has announced that it expects to train 5,000 Syrian rebels per year as part of President Obama's new campaign to battle Islamic State militants.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. to train 5,000 Syrian rebels to fight militants"}, "Author": "Maggie Ybarra", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Rear Adm John Kirby, US Military, Pentagon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb902\"", "article_summary": "The Pentagon has announced that it expects to train 5,000 Syrian rebels per year as part of President Obama\u2019s new campaign to battle Islamic State militants.\nThat goal includes training and equipping the Syrian rebels in a foreign country over the course of about a year, according to Rear Adm.
