Two Charlotte County cases of Caribbean origin were also reported earlier this month.\n\nThere have been at least 50 reported cases of chikungunya in Florida in 2014, all of them acquired outside the United States. That number has more than doubled in the past month. The outbreak in the Caribbean, thought to have affected tens of thousands, was first noticed in December 2013, and the spread to Florida escalated in May.\n\nThe virus most commonly causes a high fever, joint pain and swelling, back pain and a rash, but as many as 28 percent of infected people have no symptoms. It is rarely fatal, but the symptoms are described as miserable and debilitating. As with other viral infections, newborns and elders are at the greatest risk.\n\nFrom 2009 through 2013, according to an April state report on the \u201cemerging threat,\u201d 68 percent of the Florida cases were contracted in the Caribbean region, 26 percent in Latin America, and the rest in Asia and Africa. There has only been one other diagnosis of chikungunya in Sarasota County, in December 2013, contracted by a person who had traveled to Asia.\n\nAlthough this disease has not been traced to any infection acquired in Florida, it is possible for it to spread from infected humans to mosquitoes, and back again to humans. Health officials are urging Floridians to be conscious of this possibility as the summer rainy season gets underway.\n\n\u201cAvoiding mosquito bites is key to preventing chikungunya and other mosquito-borne diseases,\u201d said William Heyman, Sarasota medical director for the health department. \u201cThe typical summer rain pattern increases mosquito activity. Residents and visitors are urged to take precautions to reduce sources of standing water which serve as mosquito breeding sites, and to prevent mosquito bites.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/08/mosquito.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "There have been at least 50 reported cases of chikungunya in Florida in 2014, all of them acquired outside the United States.\nThere has only been one other diagnosis of chikungunya in Sarasota County, in December 2013, contracted by a person who had traveled to Asia.\n\u201cAvoiding mosquito bites is key to preventing chikungunya and other mosquito-borne diseases,\u201d said William Heyman, Sarasota medical director for the health department.\nTwo Charlotte County cases of Caribbean origin were also reported earlier this month.\nFour cases of chikungunya fever in Southwest Florida are among the rapid recent increase in Florida of a mosquito-borne illness imported mostly from the Caribbean, according to the state Department of Health."}
