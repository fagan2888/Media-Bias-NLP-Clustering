Or will it just toss him into the briar patch he wants? After all, there are two things we know about Barack: one, he has an infinite capacity for self-delusion, and two, he hates both Clintons.\n\nSo here\u2019s a prediction: if Clinton gets indicted, Michelle Obama gets the Obama team\u2019s nod for the nomination.\n\nCan Barack and Michelle pull such a thing off? No, but the point is that they will think they can. Remember the confidence, one might even say arrogant confidence, with which they flew off to Copenhagen in order to get the Olympics for Chicago and how flummoxed they were when the IOC gave them the back of their hand? Remember how confident he was that his eighty-something speeches around the country would produce a groundswell of public opinion in favor of Obamacare? How certain he was his Cairo apology would have the Middle East running to learn at his knee? How certain she was of sainthood for insisting upon \u201chealthy\u201d school lunches? Indeed, just look at how both he and Michelle drip sticky condescension on any of the lesser minds who disagree with them.\n\nThe fact is that Obama and the self-appointed dietary majordomo he\u2019s married to just don\u2019t operate in the real world at all, and so Hillary going down in flames they\u2019ll see as an opportunity to offer the vast gushing majority of the little people, fans who for the most part now exist only in their own minds, another chance to cheer their greatness.\n\nBecause in truth, their attitude toward the American people is much like the Dickensian landlord who was convinced that the commoners prayed each Sunday morning:\n\nGod Bless The Squire And All His Relations And Keep Us In Our Proper Stations\n\nA mindset so out of touch with where the country is at this point that it would trigger a lot of good theater inside the Democratic Party.\n\nKeep your fingers crossed.\n\nThomas Lifson adds:\n\nI agree that Michelle-for-presidfent is delusional but would note that a Michelle presidency offers a solution for a looming problem that has to be on Barack O\u2019s mind: what to do with his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson. To an astonishing extent, the fact that the president is sharing the White House with his mother-in-law receives almost no media attention.\n\nBut the White House is very large and has an even larger staff, creatuing plenty of room for maneuver. So the opportunities for friction are minimized. No matter how large the speaking fees, bestselling book royalties, and other lucre available in his post-presidency, ex-president Obama is unlikley to have as much insulation from Mrs. Robinson, assuming she continues to live with him and Michelle. And if she doesn\u2019t, then that will raise awkward questions about kicking her out.\n\nThe prospect of continuing to share the White House certtainly offers an advantage in postponing those issues.\n\nRichard F.
