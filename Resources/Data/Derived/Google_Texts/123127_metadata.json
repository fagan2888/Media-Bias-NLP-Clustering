In these cooler climates, the birds now live in man-made communal nesting boxes, a common fixture in Eastern backyards.\n\nWestern purple martins still nest in natural crevices, but there\u2019s precedent for human assistance with their life cycle: Native Americans in California historically encouraged the birds to nest inside of prepared gourds, perhaps because the purple martins devoured insect pests \u2014 or were simply nice to look at.\n\nOn a recent Friday, eight volunteers for the Open Space District made the winding trek up the mountain in drizzly conditions to help erect the first bird boxes for the Mount Umunhum population.\n\n\u201cThis is such a special mountain, and people have been watching it for years,\u201d said volunteer and Half Moon Bay native Lynn Jackson of the new efforts to open up the summit, as she took a break from the damp business of setting up bird boxes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing all this in order to have a place for the birds,\u201d said Jackson, approvingly, as she watched two volunteers mix cement, while others looked over the new, custom-made cedar boxes that will provide the martins with man-made lodgings.\n\nA former Air Force controlled area, the site where the birds live was purchased for redevelopment into a nature preserve in 1986. But there were no funds to clean it up. The buildings that used to host a small community of Air Force families were full of dangerous asbestos and lead paint, although occasional, uninvited urban explorers passed through the area.\n\nThat all changed in 2009, when the site\u2019s public affairs manager finally secured a $3.2 million federal appropriation to clean up the old infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhen that old infrastructure was up there, it was dangerous,\u201d said Meredith Manning, interim planning manager for Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.\n\nNow with the hazardous cleanup done, the management of Mount Umunhum is looking ahead to a considerably more pristine future.\n\nA combination of taxpayer funding and a $1 million grant from the Coastal Conservancy will provide means to construct recreational trails and interpretative areas at the summit for public usage.\n\nBay Area residents will likely be allowed into the site as early as the spring of 2017.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "bird,birds,Environment,Faine Greenwood,Mount Umunhum,Purple Martin,Purple Martins,rare birds,Santa Cruz Mountains,Science & Tech,Features,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured,Parks & Recreation,Politics & Gov", "description": "Environmentalists hope the discovery of the rare birds will boost public interest in the site, as officials complete its transformation from a former Air Force\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3efe\"", "article_summary": "Now with the hazardous cleanup done, the management of Mount Umunhum is looking ahead to a considerably more pristine future.\nPurple martins are native to both the East and West Coasts of the United States, but are much more common back East.\n\u201cWhen that old infrastructure was up there, it was dangerous,\u201d said Meredith Manning, interim planning manager for Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.\nOn a recent Friday, eight volunteers for the Open Space District made the winding trek up the mountain in drizzly conditions to help erect the first bird boxes for the Mount Umunhum population.\nIn these cooler climates, the birds now live in man-made communal nesting boxes, a common fixture in Eastern backyards."}
