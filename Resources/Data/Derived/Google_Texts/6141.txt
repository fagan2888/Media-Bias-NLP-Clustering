John Oliver is the latest replacement for Stephen Colbert in the Smug Liberal Idiot that other liberal idiots watch genre of television. And in what will surely be described as "John Oliver Destroys Supreme Court" on HuffPo or Salon, he offered his misunderstanding of government.

John Oliver weighed in on the case during Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight. Likening the tax benefits that come along with a company’s decision to provide health care to employees to a salad bar, Oliver argued that Hobby Lobby should not be able to use government as an “à la carte” system. What Hobby Lobby’s owners are arguing, according to Oliver, is that “the sincerity of their beliefs should allow then a line-item veto over federal law.” But, he added, “government is not an à la carte system where you can pick and choose based on your beliefs. Taxation is more of an all-you-can-eat salad bar. You don’t get to show up and say, ‘Look, I know it costs $10.99, but I’m only paying $7.50 because I have a moral objection to beets.” As Oliver explained, when it comes to taxation, “everyone has their own version of beets,” that one thing you just don’t agree with but are forced to pay for anyway, be it abortion, war or even a shrimp running a treadmill.

Government is very much à la carte when it comes to moral objections.

It's why pacifists could be conscientious objectors or why numerous religious groups are already exempt from ObamaCare and why the Amish are exempt from compulsory school attendance. Catholics and Orthodox Jews were allowed to buy wine for religious use during Prohibition. There are numerous other examples.

The Amish don't pay social security. So we actually do go à la carte because this isn't Cuba or China. Or the UK which is where John Oliver comes from.

And that's a good thing.

There's a word for "one size fits all" government. It's tyranny.
