Also, she had reservations about how quickly hospitals turn to medical and surgical interventions, which come with their own health risks; and she knew that if something happened, the midwives at her birth center, The Midwife Center in Pittsburgh, have admitting privileges at a nearby medical center. Plus, she\u2019d been going there for well-woman visits for years before planning to become pregnant \u2013 the atmosphere was more homey and she felt more listened to than with past doctors.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re pregnant, there\u2019s a lot going on physically and otherwise,\u201d says Criss. \u201cI liked that the care was more comprehensive and whole-person centered, and they don\u2019t treat it like you\u2019re just a uterus.\u201d\n\nCriss says she was happy with her experience at The Midwife Center, and she\u2019s glad she had that option. Now, thanks to Obamacare, it\u2019s a choice available to more women.\n\nMore women choosing birth centers and midwives\n\nAdvocates for birth centers say that care is more personalized, and the midwives who staff birth centers spend more time talking (and listening) to patients than obstetricians. Perhaps most importantly, they place an emphasis on seeing the expecting mother as part of the healthcare team.\n\n\u201cOne thing I felt going through the Pittsburgh Midwife Center, is that they put a lot of ownership to you as the person having the baby,\u201d says Criss. \u201cYou\u2019re participating, instead of it just being something happening to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring your birth, you are in control of what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers, describing the birth center model. \u201cYou can choose to be in a tub, you can choose not to be in a tub, you can move around if you want. And throughout the whole process the midwives are monitoring to make sure that a birth center is still the appropriate place to be.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because most birth centers aren\u2019t set up to perform surgical procedures, like C-sections and epidurals. The birth center model is designed for the 75-80 percent of pregnancies that are considered low-risk \u2013 meaning risk factors like gestational diabetes, chronic high blood pressure, etc. aren\u2019t present \u2013 and stay low risk all the way to term. Of women who plan to give birth at a birth center at the start of labor, about 16 percent end up being transferred to a hospital, usually for pain management, and fewer than 2 percent are transferred for emergency reasons.\n\n\u201cHospitals are set up to treat people who are sick,\u201d says Christine Haas, director of the Pittsburgh Midwife Center. \u201cMost pregnant women are not sick.\u201d She says that midwives and birth centers try to avoid unnecessary interventions, using them as needed and not as routine.\n\nResearch shows the effectiveness of this approach. According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Midwifery and Women\u2019s Health, the C-section rate for U.S. women who choose a birth center was just 6 percent \u2013 compared to a C-section rate of 27 percent for low-risk pregnancies nationally.\n\nNot only is this a better health outcome, it also saves money. There were 15,774 birth center pregnancies in the study\u2019s sample, meaning 3,000 unnecessary C-sections were prevented, saving $4.5 million. Births outside of hospitals are still relatively rare \u2013 98 percent of the almost 4 million births a year in the United States happen in hospitals and more than 85 percent are delivered by medical doctors.\n\nIf more women opted for birth centers, it could save billions on unnecessary C-sections alone. Stays are shorter after birth too. Families are typically discharged after six to eight hours instead of days, and babies stay with their mothers instead of going to a neonatal nursery. Altogether, according to AABC, delivering at a birth center typically costs half as much as an uncomplicated birth at a hospital.\n\nHow Obamacare offers access to more birth options\n\nThere are a number of ways that the Affordable Care Act helps ensure pregnant women have more choices for how they\u2019ll give birth. Most obvious is the provision saying that all insurance plans have to cover pregnancy as an essential health benefit. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, maternity care was available in just 12 percent of plans on the individual market.\n\nBut the ACA also says that plans can\u2019t discriminate against any provider, \u201cwho is acting within the scope of that provider\u2019s license or certification under applicable state law.\u201d Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs), who are trained in both nursing and midwifery, are licensed, independent healthcare providers in all 50 states, and some states recognize Certified Midwives (CMs) and Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs) as well. This means that across the country insurance plans can\u2019t exclude midwives \u2013 they have to at least offer network participation to midwives on the same terms as doctors.\n\nThe ACA also took steps to ensure that midwives are paid fairly. Before the ACA, Medicare only paid midwives 65 percent of what doctors received for the same services; the ACA increased midwives\u2019 reimbursement to 100 percent. That may not sound like a big deal, since the program serves mainly the elderly, but it really is an important change. Medicare covers pregnancies for some younger women with disabilities, but just as significantly, many private insurers use Medicare rates as the basis for what they providers. It\u2019s common for insurance plans to negotiate rates of \u201cMedicare plus [some percentage],\u201d so increasing the Medicare reimbursement will likely mean higher reimbursements for midwives under private plans as well.\n\nThere were also important changes to Medicaid. Section 2301 of the ACA says that Medicaid has to cover state-licensed birth centers, providing a facilities fee to the birth center along with payments for midwives and other birth attendants who provide care there. Given the sheer number of births covered by Medicaid \u2013 it pays for nearly half of all births in the United States \u2013 the change should put birth centers on a better financial footing, and allow them to serve more low income women.\n\nCurrently there are 316 birth centers in the U.S.; 116 of them have opened since the ACA was passed in 2010 \u2013 a 60 percent increase. The growth isn\u2019t all due to the ACA \u2013 recent documentaries like The Business of Being Born have brought birth centers more mainstream attention, and social media has made it easier for women to explore and discuss choices for childbirth than in say the 1970\u2019s, when the first U.S. birth centers opened, or 1980\u2019s, when skyrocketing liability insurance rates forced half of them to close. Still, Bauer says, the ACA has been an important factor.\n\n\u201cThere are birth centers in more areas of the country, providing access to more women, and reaching women of different backgrounds,\u201d says Bauer. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that birth centers in rural and urban areas in particular can serve more women than before the ACA.\u201d\n\nSome barriers still remain\n\nOf course, the passage of the ACA hasn\u2019t fixed every issue facing midwives and birth centers. Haas says that high deductibles and fees are still hard for a lot of women they see, and the Pittsburgh\u2019s Midwife Center has to devote a fair amount of staff time to looking up what services are covered by each patient\u2019s insurance and making sure they understand any out-of-pocket fees.\n\n\u201cLarge hospitals can just write off that money if it\u2019s not paid. As a small nonprofit, we can\u2019t afford not to collect it,\u201d says Haas. \u201cBut we also work with people so they\u2019re prepared. A lot of people leave the hospital and have to wait until they get the bill, after just guessing how much they\u2019ll owe.\u201d\n\nAlso, even though the ACA mandates Medicaid coverage of birth center services, many states still haven\u2019t implemented this change. The main stumbling block is that it hasn\u2019t been clear that managed care companies, which administer Medicaid in many states, have to comply. AABC has been meeting with CMS officials, asking them to release guidelines clarifying that the mandate does apply to Medicaid managed care companies.\n\nDespite these issues though, the Affordable Care Act has still played a big role in giving more women more options for their pregnancies. Haas says it makes sense that Obamacare provides support for places like The Midwife Center. \u201cWe fit well with the philosophy of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she says. \u201cWe achieve high quality care while lowering costs, which is what the ACA is supposed to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare's coverage of pregnancy as an essential benefit was just the beginning of vastly improved access and expanded choice in healthcare providers.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Obamacare's coverage of pregnancy as an essential benefit was just the beginning of vastly improved access and expanded choice in healthcare providers.", "title": "How Obamacare delivered more birth options", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2016/03/08/how-obamacare-delivered-more-birth-options/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2016/03/obamacare-birth-options-1560x816.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "birth centers, midwives, pregnancy", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-08T16:41:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "More women choosing birth centers and midwivesAdvocates for birth centers say that care is more personalized, and the midwives who staff birth centers spend more time talking (and listening) to patients than obstetricians.\nAltogether, according to AABC, delivering at a birth center typically costs half as much as an uncomplicated birth at a hospital.\n\u201cYou\u2019re participating, instead of it just being something happening to you.\u201d\u201cDuring your birth, you are in control of what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers, describing the birth center model.\nThere were 15,774 birth center pregnancies in the study\u2019s sample, meaning 3,000 unnecessary C-sections were prevented, saving $4.5 million.\nHaas says it makes sense that Obamacare provides support for places like The Midwife Center."}
