(Source: Arizona Department of Public Safety)\n\nOfficers are investigating a second deadly pile-up along Interstate-10 related to an earlier wrong-way driver accident near Quartzsite, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.\n\nI-10 was closed eastbound at milepost 44 for most of Saturday morning while officers conducted their investigation. It re-opened at around 11:30 a.m.\n\nShortly after 5:30 a.m., a semi-trailer truck failed to slow for traffic congestion tied to an earlier four-car collision that killed a woman and injured several others.\n\nThe big rig then rear-ended another semi along eastbound I-10 at milepost 44, west of Quartzsite , DPS said. Two other commercial semi-trailer trucks were also rear-ended due to the initial impact.\n\nThe first semi burst into flames, killing the driver, DPS officers said.\n\nInvestigators said it\u2019s not clear why the driver failed to slow down for traffic congestion. Fatigue has not been ruled out, DPS said.\n\n[READ: Wrong-way driver kills woman, causes multiple injuries]\n\nLate Friday night, one person was killed and another critically injured when a wrong-way driver plowed head-on with another vehicle within the I-10 eastbound lanes of traffic at milepost 63, east of Quartzsite , DPS said.
