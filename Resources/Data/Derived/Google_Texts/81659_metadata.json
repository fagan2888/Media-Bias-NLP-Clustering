But, he told the crowd, addressing them will require political will.\n\n\u201cWho will stand up and say: \u2018Send me. I\u2019ll fight for that\u2019?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for any of us in the peanut gallery. We have to be on the field and playing.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s remarks were about motivating young leaders to become more involved in politics and policy. \u201cThe Age of Participation\u201d is the theme of this weekend\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative University conference held on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University. But as with everything the Clintons say and do these days, the former president\u2019s comments will be interpreted vis-a-vis Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s deliberations about running for president in 2016.\n\nFor the past two days, Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have held forth on a campus stage using their star power to motivate some 1,200 millennials to foster change in their communities and the world. In one session, Hillary Clinton looked out on a sea of young people and said they were \u201copen-minded and tolerant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure the millennial generation really is the participation generation,\u201d she said Friday night.\n\nAlthough the three-day conference centers on altruism \u2014 on Sunday morning, the Clintons will join former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, in a community service project to beautify a part of nearby downtown Phoenix \u2014 current events entered into the discussions.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging family interview Saturday night with late-night talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel, Hillary Clinton said she hoped the millennial generation commits to making climate change \u201ca voting issue\u201d as powerful as other issues.\n\n\u201cThis is not just some ancillary issue,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. \u201cThis will determine in large measure the quality of life in so many places around the world. I\u2019m hoping that there will be this mass movement that demands political change.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, Bill Clinton went on an extemporaneous riff about deficit issues. He blamed debt problems on Republicans, whom he said have campaigned irresponsibly since the 1980s on promises never to raise taxes. He said they were \u201cjust like a child who likes to eat candy every day and never go to the dentist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton also condemned the state of U.S. politics and the growing power of super PACs to negatively define candidates.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t always depend on a billionaire spending a fortune to run television ads against you to tell everybody how un-American you are,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is a new thing in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a bipartisan basis,\u201d Clinton added, \u201cwe need to reject it.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier session, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joined Clinton for a panel discussion. Fifteen years ago, McCain voted twice to impeach Clinton after he lied about his extramarital affair with a White House intern. But on Friday night, all that seemed far in the past as the two men hammed it up like old buddies. They talked about the serious (Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine) and the silly (tweets from reality star Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi), and they showered each other with high praise.\n\nIntroducing McCain, Clinton called the senator \u201ca good friend of Hillary\u2019s and mine, although we permit him to deny it at election time.\u201d McCain in turn congratulated Clinton on two terms in office and credited him with intervening in Bosnia to end ethnic strife there. \u201cI think you made the right decisions,\u201d McCain told Clinton.\n\nThe bipartisan geniality underscored the close relationship McCain and Hillary Clinton developed when she was a senator, as well as the narrow daylight between the two on foreign policy.\n\nThe warmth also illustrated McCain\u2019s own recent political journey. Four years ago, McCain was running for reelection as an embattled incumbent struggling to prove his conservative bona fides and beat back a tea party challenger. The McCain of 2010 may not have so warmly welcomed the Clintons to Arizona.\n\nYet here was the senator, explaining to Clinton his experiences with Twitter \u2014 a medium the former president called \u201ca staggering instrument of potential.\u201d When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, McCain recalled, he received a tweet from someone named Snooki. \u201cI don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Snooki, Mr. President,\u201d McCain said, eliciting knowing laughter from Clinton.\n\nMcCain said the very bronzed star of MTV\u2019s \u201cJersey Shore\u201d sent him a tweet complaining that the health-care law included a tax on tanning beds, to which McCain replied that he would never tax her tanning bed.\n\nClinton and McCain also discussed the situation in Ukraine. Referring to a conversation he had backstage earlier with Clinton about Russia\u2019s president, McCain said: \u201cVladimir Putin is not a democrat. He\u2019s an old KGB colonel, and Vladimir Putin wants to restore what was once the Russian empire.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former president Bill Clinton made no mention of his wife, but in his rallying cry to some 1,200 college students at Arizona State University\u00a0Saturday one could hear a succinct rationale for her to run for president.The country faces long-", "title": "Bill Clinton to millennials: Get involved in politics", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140323/bill-clinton-to-millennials-get-involved-in-politics", "image": {"width": "640px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140323/NEWS/140329743/AR/0/AR-140329743.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "435px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Bill Clinton to millennials: Get involved in politics"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Former president Bill Clinton made no mention of his wife, but in his rallying cry to some 1,200 college students at Arizona State University\u00a0Saturday one could hear a succinct rationale for her to run for president.The country faces long-", "title": "Bill Clinton to millennials: Get involved in politics", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140323/bill-clinton-to-millennials-get-involved-in-politics", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140323/NEWS/140329743/AR/0/AR-140329743.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Politics", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bill Clinton, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe21\"", "article_summary": "Referring to a conversation he had backstage earlier with Clinton about Russia\u2019s president, McCain said: \u201cVladimir Putin is not a democrat.\n\u201cThe Age of Participation\u201d is the theme of this weekend\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative University conference held on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University.\n\u201cThis is not just some ancillary issue,\u201d Hillary Clinton said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Snooki, Mr. President,\u201d McCain said, eliciting knowing laughter from Clinton.\nFor the past two days, Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have held forth on a campus stage using their star power to motivate some 1,200 millennials to foster change in their communities and the world."}
