And it has recently announced its endorsement of the Convention of the States (COS) Project.\n\nConcerning the announcement, the COS Project said, \u201cBoth organizations [AMAC and COS] share a common commitment to renewing conservative philosophies and the Constitution to strengthen the nation. The endorsement is a natural extension of both organizations leading the charge to restore the nation\u2019s heritage, culture and values; together becoming a powerful voice for millions of Americans who want to rein in the power the federal government has amassed in recent years.\u201d\n\nMark Meckler, the cofounder of the COS Project, said that he and AMAC consider the Article V Convention \u201cthe \u2018emergency button\u2019 the Framers gave us for exactly a time such as this. AMAC is a principled, rapidly-growing, mission-based membership organization, serving as an organizing counter-force against entrenched interests working to consolidate power in an ever-growing central government.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution of the United States provides two methods for proposing constitutional amendments. One is the method that has been used all 27 times the Constitution has been amended, in which amendments are proposed by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress. Ratification then comes from approval of three-fourths of the states, either through their state legislatures or special state conventions.\n\nThe other method to propose changes to the Constitution, which has not been used since our current Constitution was ratified, is for the states to call for a national convention to propose amendments. Any such amendments proposed would then have to be approved by three-fourths of the states, as with any other proposed change to the Constitution.\n\nProponents of the Article V \u201cConvention of the States,\u201d such as Michael Farris of Patrick Henry College, claim that the states, not the Congress, will control any convention process. Ironically, Patrick Henry himself expressed deep concern about the 1787 Philadelphia convention, which produced the present Constitution of the United States. \u201cI smell a rat,\u201d Henry said, and Henry\u2019s concern is certainly relevant to the present discussion. The 1787 convention was called by the Confederation Congress for the \u201csole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\u201d Considering that convention could not be limited has led many conservatives to express concerns similar to Henry\u2019s about a modern-day COS .\n\nOn the AMAC website, some members expressed outrage at the organization\u2019s decision to support the COS. AMAC member Charles, for example, said, \u201cWho in their right mind would think changing the Constitution would result in conformance by the political class?... If they don\u2019t follow it now they surely won\u2019t follow a revised version.\u201d\n\nMember Ivan Berry posted similar views. \u201cIt is not the Constitution that needs fixing, it\u2019s the voting public and the states that accept all these so-called Federal bribes.\u201d Berry no doubt was referencing how states give in to federal control over areas that the Constitution makes \u201creserved powers\u201d of the states, in exchange for federal grant money.\n\nIn an effort to win enough support to get the new Constitution ratified, leading supporters of the Constitution, such as James Madison, promised they would push through amendments to the Constitution in the first congressional session designed to restrict the ability of the new federal government to encroach upon the rights of the states and individual American citizens. Ten of the twelve amendments sent to the states were adopted in 1791, and are known to us as the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe First Amendment stated very clearly that Congress would have no power to make any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. Yet, only seven years later, Congress enacted the Sedition Act, a law that did abridge freedom of speech and freedom of the press. At the time, Representative Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina expressed wonder that Congress could pass such a law in clear violation of the First Amendment.\n\nCurrent supporters of the call for a national convention contend that such a gathering would \u201crein in\u201d an out-of-control federal government. Perhaps. But even if such a convention was limited to such a noble cause, one must wonder what would make today\u2019s politicians obey a constitutional amendment. They certainly ignore the clear wording of several parts of the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment. Passing one or more new amendments would simply give those who ignore the Constitution even more parts to ignore.\n\nIt must be asked, is any possible good that would come from such a convention worth the grave risks involved?\n\nThe Congressional Research Service published a report in 2011 by Thomas Neale to provide Congress with some guidance, should enough states actually call for a COS. According to the report, conservative organizations have promoted the COS, but there are also well-known leftist organizations, such as MoveOn.org and Occupy Wall Street, that have mentioned the idea.\n\nIn the report, Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig contended, \u201cAn Article V Convention would be equally attractive to the political left and right, because assuming that it would be an open convention, the delegates could consider, and conceivably propose, amendments from the agendas of both ends of the political spectrum.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "AMAC, Association of Mature American Citizens, Convention of States, COS, Constitution, amendments", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/19265-amac-endorses-constitutional-convention", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/2d0a6f44bf82f6db7503967da236d714_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) has recently announced its endorsement of the Convention of the States (COS) Project. by Steve Byas", "title": "AMAC Endorses Constitutional Convention"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/2d0a6f44bf82f6db7503967da236d714_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4a7\"", "article_summary": "And it has recently announced its endorsement of the Convention of the States (COS) Project.\nConcerning the announcement, the COS Project said, \u201cBoth organizations [AMAC and COS] share a common commitment to renewing conservative philosophies and the Constitution to strengthen the nation.\nProponents of the Article V \u201cConvention of the States,\u201d such as Michael Farris of Patrick Henry College, claim that the states, not the Congress, will control any convention process.\nIronically, Patrick Henry himself expressed deep concern about the 1787 Philadelphia convention, which produced the present Constitution of the United States.\nBut even if such a convention was limited to such a noble cause, one must wonder what would make today\u2019s politicians obey a constitutional amendment."}
