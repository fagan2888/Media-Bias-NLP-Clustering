Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium continues to be a Mile High City hot spot when the University of Denver men\u2019s lacrosse team is on display.\n\nIn the 27th consecutive home sellout dating to the 2014 season, the defending NCAA champions and No. 1-ranked Pioneers treated their fans to a 15-6 victory over Ohio State amid a stiff, cold wind. Denver, which outscored the Buckeyes 8-1 in the fourth quarter, extended its winning streaks to 20 overall and 19 at home.\n\nCoach Bill Tierney is now 46-6 at Barton Stadium, which seats 2,000 spectators. The Pioneers (7-0) were playing at home after winning consecutive overtime games at perennial national powers North Carolina and Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cIt was not one of those games where the score was indicative of the game. That was a tough lacrosse game,\u201d said Tierney, whose team trailed 2-1 after the first quarter but outscored the Buckeyes (5-4) 4-0 in the second. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the guys, really proud of how they came through. It didn\u2019t start out well. Second quarter was really good \u2014 and the fourth, obviously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just proud of these guys for fighting through and some of the older guys for carrying some of these younger guys that we\u2019re putting out on the field every game as we continue to get better.\u201d\n\nAttackmen Jack Bobzien and Connor Cannizzaro each had a hat trick and Cannizzaro also had an assist for a team-high four points. Midfielder Zach Miller had two goals and an assist and freshman Colton Jackson of Highlands Ranch had two goals in his first career start at midfield.\n\nFaceoff specialist Trevor Baptiste won 15-of-23 draws and defenseman Pat Karole had five groundballs. Off the bench, freshman Nate Marano and sophomore Brendan Bomberry combined for five points.\n\nDU took a 7-5 lead into the fourth quater after Cannizzaro scored off a Miller pass late in the third. Miller then assisted on Bobzien\u2019s goal early in the fourth quarter as the Pioneers rolled. DU scored the game\u2019s final six goals between the 8:34 and 1:33 mark of the final frame, many with reserves.\n\n\u201cWe talked about all week, when we get up to not let up like we have in the past couple games against Notre Dame and UNC,\u201d Cannizzaro said. \u201cSo when we got to the fourth quarter we really focused on stepping on them and not letting them back in the game. When our twos and threes got in the game we were really excited to see how well they played.\u201d\n\nDenver plays Penn State in Dallas next weekend before visiting Georgetown and Villanova in Big East Conference play.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Defending champion DU turns it on to beat Ohio State at Barton Stadium", "title": "Defending champion DU turns it on to beat Ohio State at Barton Stadium", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/defending-champion-du-turns-it-on-to-beat-ohio-state-at-barton-stadium/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__DU_lacrossep1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__DU_lacrossep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T16:54:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:21:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the guys, really proud of how they came through.\nDenver, which outscored the Buckeyes 8-1 in the fourth quarter, extended its winning streaks to 20 overall and 19 at home.\n\u201cSo when we got to the fourth quarter we really focused on stepping on them and not letting them back in the game.\nMiller then assisted on Bobzien\u2019s goal early in the fourth quarter as the Pioneers rolled.\nDU took a 7-5 lead into the fourth quater after Cannizzaro scored off a Miller pass late in the third."}
