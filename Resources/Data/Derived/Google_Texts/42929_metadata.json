The tree was missing tons of branches and it had unseemly shape.\n\nThe AP explains:\n\n\"Now a group led by the city council president is raising money to buy and decorate a more impressive replacement. The current tree is topped with a lighted pretzel, a nod to the area's many bakeries. \"The puny pine was a last-minute stand-in taken from a city park. The city had planned to get its tree from a farm, but the owner wouldn't let the crews drive on the wet ground when they went to pick it up. \"Officials are hoping to have a do-over tree lighting ceremony next weekend.\"\n\nOne resident told WFMZ-TV that not even a squirrel looking for a home would pick that tree.\n\nWe'll leave you with WFMZ-TV's report:\n\nAnd a lesson from Charlie Brown:\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
