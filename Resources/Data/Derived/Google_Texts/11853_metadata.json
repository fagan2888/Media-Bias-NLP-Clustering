Aziz says the gunmen handcuffed the Christians and drove away with them.\n\n\u201cThey were 15 armed and masked men who came in four vehicles. They had a list of full names of Christians in the building. While checking IDs, Muslims were left aside while Christians were grabbed,\u201d Aziz said, adding that he survived simply because he didn\u2019t open his door.\n\n\u201cI heard my friends screaming but they were quickly shushed at gunpoint. After that, we heard nothing,\u201d said Aziz who said he has three relatives among the hostages. \u201cI am still in my room waiting for them to take me. I want to die with them,\u201d he added.\n\nAbu Makar, a Coptic priest in the workers\u2019 hometown of Samalout in southern Egypt, confirmed the abduction took place. He said seven other Coptic Christians from Samalout were taken while trying to escape Sirte a few days earlier.\n\nSirte has become a safe haven for extremist Islamist groups like Ansar al-Shariah, blamed for the September 2013 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\nThe abduction came on the heels of the killing of a Coptic couple \u2014 who used to work as doctors in Sirte\u2014 and their daughter.\n\nThe Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it is following up on the case, urging Egyptians in the city to stay indoors until the government can facilitate a safe return home. Ministry Spokesman Badr Abdel-Atti said that Egypt can\u2019t send a diplomatic mission to Libya because \u201cmany of the regions are out of state control.\u201d Egypt closed its mission in Tripoli last year and withdrew its ambassador after his own abduction at the hands of militiamen, disgruntled at the arrest of a top Islamic militia commander in Egypt.\n\nIn March, the bodies of seven Christian Egyptians were found in the eastern city of Benghazi, killed by gunshots to the head while handcuffed.\n\nIn March 2013, dozens of Coptic Christians were tortured inside a detention center run by a powerful militia in Benghazi. The men, who were suspected of proselytizing, were rounded up in a market by gunmen who checked their right wrists for tattoos of crosses, a common mark worn by many Egyptian Christians.\n\nIslamic extremist militias have been targeting Christians, women, journalists, refugees and those considered former loyalists of Moammar Gadhafi, who was toppled and killed in Libya\u2019s 2011 civil war.\n\nEgyptians became a top target for the militias after the Egyptian government began supporting the Libyan army battling Islamic militants.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing a pattern of persecution against Christians in Egypt; I fear for the lives of the hostages,\u201d said Magdi Malak, a Cairo-based activist involved in the case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Masked gunmen in central Libya kidnapped 13 Coptic Christians on Saturday after seven were abducted days earlier, said a witness and a priest, in a new wave of assaults against Egypt's Christians working in the war-torn North African nation plagued with Islamic extremists.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Masked gunmen in central Libya kidnapped 13 Coptic Christians on Saturday after seven were abducted days earlier, said a witness and a priest, in a new wave of assaults against Egypt\u2019s Christians working in the war-torn North African nation plagued with Islamic extremists.", "title": "Libyan gunmen kidnap at least 20 Christians: \u2018They had a list of full names\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/3/least-20-christians-kidnapped-gunmen-libya/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/15/9ea27f5c6d978028620f6a706700c5be.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/15/9ea27f5c6d978028620f6a706700c5be.jpg", "title": "Libyan gunmen kidnap at least 20 Christians: \u2018They had a list of", "description": "Masked gunmen in central Libya kidnapped 13 Coptic Christians on Saturday after seven were abducted days earlier, said a witness and a priest, in a new wave of assaults against Egypt's Christians work", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Religion Belief, Egypt, Libya, Sirte"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d87\"", "article_summary": "In March 2013, dozens of Coptic Christians were tortured inside a detention center run by a powerful militia in Benghazi.\nHe said seven other Coptic Christians from Samalout were taken while trying to escape Sirte a few days earlier.\nAziz says the gunmen handcuffed the Christians and drove away with them.\nThey had a list of full names of Christians in the building.\nEgyptians became a top target for the militias after the Egyptian government began supporting the Libyan army battling Islamic militants."}
