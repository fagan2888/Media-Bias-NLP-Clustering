Vanderbilt University legal expert James Blumstein says the true issue surrounding the King v. Burwell case is separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThe court is being asked not to trump the political branches, which was the issue in the earlier constitutional challenge to the ACA\u2019s individual mandate,\u201d says Blumstein. \u201cThe court is also being asked to vindicate the right of Congress to determine whether the ACA, as drafted, got the policy right or not.\u201d\n\nTHE CASE\n\nKing v. Burwell challenges the IRS\u2019s authority to extend tax subsidies to federally run health care exchanges. About three dozen states are using the federal government\u2019s insurance exchange system through www.healthcare.gov rather than setting up their own state exchanges.\n\nSection 1311 of the ACA requires states to establish an exchange. But the federal government cannot force states to set up exchanges from a constitutional perspective.\n\nIn what Blumstein describes as an \u201coops\u201d provision, section 1321 of the ACA provides that the federal government must set up an exchange in any state where the state has not established \u201csuch\u201d exchange.\n\nOVERREACHING AUTHORITY\n\nBy allowing these states to receive tax subsidies from the IRS, Blumstein believes the Obama administration overreached its authority.\n\n\u201cThe lower court ruled for the federal government, basically on the theory that the ACA intended to subsidize those income-qualified purchasers who buy insurance on all exchanges,\u201d explains Blumstein. \u201cBut the issue is not some abstract question of what Congress intended, but what Congress actually did. And about that there can be no serious dispute.\u201d\n\nLEGISLATIVE GAPS\n\nBlumstein believes that the power to fill legislative gaps belongs to Congress, the legislative branch, not the IRS through the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court should rein in the IRS by invalidating its regulation to the contrary.\u201d\n\nBlumstein is University Professor of Constitutional Law and Health law and policy and professor of management.\n\nMedia Inquiries:\n\nAmy Wolf, (615) 322-NEWS\n\namy.wolf@vanderbilt.edu", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a lawsuit challenging the Obama Administration\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
