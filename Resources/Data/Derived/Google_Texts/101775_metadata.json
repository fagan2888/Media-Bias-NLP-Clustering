The schools superintendent, Chuck Ledbetter, said Perry will retire at the end of the school year.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents. It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.\u2019\n\nAccording to th e Daily Mail, a 12-year-old boy brought the complaint against the teacher to his father, Jimmie Scott. Then Scott met with Perry at a parent-teacher conference. He said she showed him some \u201cinternet propaganda\u201d and commented, \u201cSee, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they\u2019re coming through the birth canal.\u201d\u2018\n\nAlthough it could be argued that Perry\u2019s statement was inappropriate considering the setting, her comments about Obama weren\u2019t completely unfounded. From taxpayer funding of abortions in America and around the world, to the stacking of the Supreme Court and federal courts with hardcore abortion advocates, Obama has been a relentless support of abortion-on-demand.\n\nFor example, earlier this year, President Obama\u2019s administration issued a veto threat concerning the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect babies after 20-weeks from abortion based on the concept that they can feel pain.\n\nAnd in 2013, he praised Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion business and said he wanted God to bless them.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we\u2019ve got to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you\u2019ve also got a president who\u2019s going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way,\u201d said Obama. \u201cThank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in 2009, president Obama promised the American people that Obamacare would not fund abortion. He made this promise because he knew that the religious and pro-life community was concerned that Obamacare would make them pay for the killing of children through abortion. Now, we know for sure their concerns were valid because in 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that identifies 1,036 ObamaCare plans that cover abortion on demand and receive taxpayer subsides.\n\nACTION: Contact the Dublin Board of Education to support Perry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teacher Forced to Resign After Calling Pro-Abortion President Barack Obama a \u201cBaby Killer\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In Georgia, veteran middle school teacher Nancy Perry has been forced to resign after telling her students that President Barack Obama is a baby killer.
