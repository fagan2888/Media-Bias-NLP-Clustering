NFL owners arrived in Boca Raton, Florida on Sunday for the start of the league’s annual meeting, which runs until Wednesday. The competition committee will review 19 proposals to modify the playing rules — which includes nine from the committee and 10 from various teams.

Perhaps the biggest change that could be coming? A player will be ejected if they are penalized twice in the same game for specific types of unsportsmanlike conduct.

If the new proposal is adopted, a player would be ejected if they are penalized twice for any of the following infractions:

* Throwing a punch, or a forearm, or kicking at an opponent, even though no contact is made.

* Using abusive, threatening, or insulting language or gestures to opponents, teammates,

officials, or representatives of the League.

* Using baiting or taunting acts or words that engender ill will between teams.

The committee will also seek to make all chop blocks illegal and proposes to permanently move point-after attempts to the defensive team’s 15-yard line following the one-year trial that took place in 2015.

The Washington Redskins proposed three rule changes, including one which would eliminate overtime in preseason games. The other two, which involve instant replay, are as follows:

* Subject personal fouls to instant replay review.

* Give each team three challenges instead of two, which would eliminate the requirement that a team be successful on each of its first two challenges in order to be awarded a third.
