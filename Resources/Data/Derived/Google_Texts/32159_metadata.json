He had done the math, and he told me that [the rules] are going to completely wipe out his profit,\u201d Juanita Duggan, NFIB president and CEO told FOX Business Network\u2019s Neil Cavuto on Tuesday.\n\nThe new rules, a final set of which are expected to be announced by the Department of Labor later this week, are the answer to a long-awaited overhaul of overtime pay regulations in the United States. In the current business environment, the nation\u2019s employers are only required to pay overtime to an employee who works more than 40 hours in a work week and earns less than $23,660 in a single year.\n\nHowever, the new rules under President Barack Obama, would expand those guidelines and allow employees making as much as $50,440 in a year to become eligible for overtime wages. The president said the expansion would benefit as many as five million workers in the first year of the new rules alone.\n\nBut critics of the president\u2019s plan say the widened guidelines would hurt small businesses, and put more pressure on the retail sector.\n\nDuggan argued that it\u2019s a no-win policy for America\u2019s smaller businesses and business owners.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPeople who were previously upwardly mobile within small businesses are now going to become hourly wage earners, and they won\u2019t be on the management track,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really bad for workers.\u201d\n\nShe said combined with a slew of other regulations in the pipeline concerning American business, including efforts to mandate a higher minimum wage \u2013 a discussion that\u2019s routinely discussed on the 2016 campaign trail \u2013 as well as paid leave regulations and higher health care costs, small business will bear the brunt of the pain.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have armies of lobbyists, lawyers and compliance officers to help them with this kind of compliance\u2026they\u2019re very pessimistic. Our optimism index is now at very low levels. We\u2019re looking at levels that were during the 1990s recession. Clearly small business has not shared in the recovery,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed the NFIB\u2019s small business optimism gauge rose to 93.6 in April from a reading of 92.6 in March. The number of firms with intentions to hire rose to 11% from 9%, while the number of businesses raising net compensation rose to 24% form 22%.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said in a note Tuesday the trend for small business optimism, despite the monthly rise, has been a lower trajectory since the start of 2015, and they attribute it largely to a divergence between selling prices and labor costs.\n\n\u201cWeak output prices have not prevented firms from raising worker compensation, which has given way to a dynamic that is negative for profit margins,\u201d the analysts\u2019 note read.\n\nHowever, they said as the headwinds subside, those businesses should find it easier to raise prices that are more in line with their costs in an effort to preserve profitability.\n\nDuggan said, though, more regulation on American businesses won\u2019t help their efforts to attract talent, and hold onto their profit margins. Instead, she said it will continue to sock small businesses. She pointed to policies from Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, who she said appears to be more pro-businesses than any other candidate remaining in the field.\n\n\u201cSome of the top-line things [Trump] has discussed are things that have been the NFIB\u2019s position for years,\u201d she said pointing to his opposition of the Affordable Care Act, one of President Obama\u2019s hallmark pieces of legislation.\n\n\u201cHe has said he\u2019s not a fan of Obamacare, and NFIB was the organization that tried to overturn Obamacare in the Supreme Court. We remain opposed to it\u2026these are not growth policies for small business,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS,/FOX
