To view the database, click here.\n\nThe searchable format lists employees from all departments and shows regular, overtime and other pay as well employer-paid retirement amounts. The database includes a handful of agencies that aren\u2019t included in Sonoma County\u2019s budget, but whose payroll is handled by the county, such as SMART and the Sonoma County Law Library.\n\nAll told, 5,295 people worked for the county or related agencies in 2014, up about 5 percent from the year before. The numbers include about 1,200 part-time and temporary employees.\n\nTotal payroll was about $330 million or about 1 percent over 2013.\n\nMany new employees were hired in response to two state mandates \u2014 the shift of state prison inmates to county jails and the Affordable Care Act, said David Sundstrom, the county\u2019s auditor-controller.\n\nThe Human Services and Health departments did the majority of hiring followed by the Sheriff\u2019s Office and Probation Department, he said.\n\nHe said the increases were modest and remain below previous staffing levels before the economic downturn in 2008. He said the county cut 200 positions in that period.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re coming back from a recession you\u2019re going to have metered growth,\u201d Sundstrom said. \u201cThe Board of Supervisors and the county administrator make departments jump through hoops to add positions. It\u2019s not easy. The justifications have to be very strong and they are closely scrutinized.\u201d\n\nBut government watchdogs criticized the hiring, saying the county can\u2019t afford it. Ken Churchill, director of the group New Sonoma, which urges overhauling government pensions, said more employees will increase retirement obligations.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time understanding why the supervisors are adding people considering where we are financially,\u201d Churchill said. \u201cIt seems to me they should be cutting.\u201d\n\nAs for salaries, employees being paid more than $100,000 dropped to 885 from 956 in 2013, while those getting more than $200,000 rose to 24, up from 22 the previous year.\n\nOf those in the over-$200,000 group, 11 work for the Sheriff\u2019s Office. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies made more than $100,000 in overtime alone.\n\nDeputies Mark Provost and David Berges each exceeded $200,000 in total pay, eclipsing water agency head Grant Davis and Sundstrom, who had $226,000.\n\nMental health director Gary Bravo was next followed by County Counsel Bruce Goldstein. The 10th-highest paid employee was Julia Wyne, the county\u2019s retirement administrator, with $220,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The highest-paid Sonoma County government employee doesn\u2019t run for office every four", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The top earner on Sonoma County's payroll wasn\u2019t its sheriff, a county administrator or a department head.", "title": "Who are the highest-paid workers on Sonoma County's payroll?", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4449612-181/who-are-the-highest-paid-government", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=0KcHMllMNsicv6Fayj4GGc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtxWWi4rPmwi3LM7mvEvf$bWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-09-09T12:11:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb28e\"", "article_summary": "The database includes a handful of agencies that aren\u2019t included in Sonoma County\u2019s budget, but whose payroll is handled by the county, such as SMART and the Sonoma County Law Library.\nThe highest-paid Sonoma County government employee doesn\u2019t run for office every four years or oversee a large department.\nThe 10th-highest paid employee was Julia Wyne, the county\u2019s retirement administrator, with $220,000.\nKen Churchill, director of the group New Sonoma, which urges overhauling government pensions, said more employees will increase retirement obligations.\nDeputy Gerald Turney made $15,000 more than the next-highest paid employee, Farhad Mansourian, general manager of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, and $40,000 more than Veronica Ferguson, county administrator."}
