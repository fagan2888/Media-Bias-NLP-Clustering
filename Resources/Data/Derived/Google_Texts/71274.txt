More than 20,000 people including actor Chuck Norris marched the streets of Alabama to bring awareness and raise funds for persecuted Christians in the Middle East.

Attendees marched chanting "All Lives Matter" from Kelly Ingram Park to Birmingham City Hall on Saturday morning. Other signs held during the march read "Justice" with a picture of Abraham Lincoln.

Conservative personality Glenn Beck co-organized the march with Bishop Jim Lowe. Both led the march with Alveda King, a niece of Martin Luther King Jr., in the front row and Norris trailed them from two rows behind. The march was a part of Beck's "Never Again is Now" campaign for his initiative. Around 10,000 registered to attend a "Restoring Unity" rally at the BJCC Legacy Arena on Saturday.
