Starting Nov. 1, consumers can sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and for the first time, all 95 Tennessee counties will offer in-person assistance to help people through the process.

"Our goal is to simplify how to enroll," Mary Hunt, Get Covered Tenn program coordinator for Family and Childrenâ€™s Services, said Wednesday.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was designed to reduce the number of people who don't have health care. The law created online marketplaces where members of the public can shop for coverage plans.

Get Covered Tennessee, a statewide nonprofit effort to help Tennesseans understand and enroll for insurance via the Affordable Care Act, recently got a $1.6 million federal grant to help provide help to uninsured Tennessee residents.

The organization has a hotline that people can call to get help and find out how to get in touch with someone who can provide in-person assistance.

Hunt said that the organization's goal is for it to become common knowledge where people can get help navigating Obamacare marketplaces over the next couple of years. People are more likely to sign up if they get in-person help, Hunt also said.

Assistance will be available in every county at places such as public libraries and health clinics.

Open enrollment lasts three months, and under the Affordable Care Act, most everyone is required to have health insurance or face a monetary penalty.
