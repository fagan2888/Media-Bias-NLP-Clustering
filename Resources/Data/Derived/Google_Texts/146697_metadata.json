Harvey was told about MHD's event where free vaccines are provided for children.\n\n\"We are able to provide vaccines for children who are on Medicaid or who have no insurance at all. We are not able to provide vaccines for children who have private insurance,\" said Jill Radowicz, from the city of Milwaukee Health Department.\n\nYoung Corey's hesitance for getting shots changed once he realized the repercussions of not having them. He said he would miss learning his favorite subject, math -- and the beginning of basketball season.\n\nSo with cheerleaders by his side, he put on a brave face and powered through it and was finally able to breath a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Yes, it was very worth it,\" said Corey.\n\nIf you missed the special clinic and can't get in with your primary care provider, you can still get your child vaccinated.\n\nThe health department has vaccination clinics available just about every day of the week.
