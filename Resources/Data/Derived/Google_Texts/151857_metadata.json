So I drove all the way to the Review-Journal to call him, and was never happier to hear his voice.\n\nTurns out Reveen, a former stage performer and Lance Burton\u2019s longtime manager, was in the early stages of the dementia that led to his death last year.\n\nIt\u2019s still good to talk to Johnathan (Szeles), even if he is sharing bad news. The cardiomyopathy he\u2019s battled for years is getting worse.\n\nHis heart is \u201cbeating at 12 percent right now. At 10 percent you\u2019re dead,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says he isn\u2019t a transplant candidate because he also has diabetes. The blood thinner that helped a few years ago \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be doing the trick like it did last time.\u201d\n\nThe doctor said that unless things improve, he might have only a year to live. \u201cHe could be wrong. I don\u2019t feel bad; I feel normal,\u201d he says.\n\nSo Johnathan is booking himself out of town for a weekend or two every month, doing the warped comedy-magic he performed for 13 years in Las Vegas. He performs in a defibrillator vest. \u201cI can stand there and do the show. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing Cirque du Soleil stunts.\u201d\n\nTicket sales have been strong, leading to dark jokes about bands that do \u201cfarewell\u201d tours. \u201cIt is good for business, but usually it\u2019s not because you\u2019re dying when you do that,\u201d he says.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mind me asking if people believe all this. Here\u2019s the guy who made room in his show to plug a book of practical jokes, and who announced on Facebook last month a new venture to sell \u201ccompletely original high end practical jokes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s ever faked their death in the history of entertainment and come back. My whole dream was to be the first one to do that,\u201d he acknowledges. He even consulted attorneys, and \u201cfound out why nobody does it. First they hit you with tax evasion for the years you were gone, then people hit you with emotional distress lawsuits.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s not a joke. But he is getting married in June, to Anastasia Synn. That\u2019s no joke either, even if he says \u201cthe key word here is pre-nup.\u201d They are planning \u201ca comedy wedding, the funniest wedding ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019s gonna happen?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived a pretty hard life, did what I wanted to do and definitely no regrets over it.\u201d His heart problems began with a childhood virus, but recreational drugs didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the way I lived has contributed to it somewhat. I\u2019m not shocked by it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m from the \u201970s. What can I say man? I just happen to be still alive.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Mike Weatherford at mweatherford@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0288.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Amazing Johnathan has already cheated death a few times, one Sunday afternoon in particular.", "parsely-tags": "Blog_Neon,Shows,Mike Weatherford", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/entertainment/amazing-johnathan-works-around-health-problems", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-854516"}, "author": "MIKE WEATHERFORD LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Amazing Johnathan works around health problems", "twitter": {"description": "The Amazing Johnathan has already cheated death a few times, one Sunday afternoon in particular.", "title": "Amazing Johnathan works around health problems", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/entertainment/amazing-johnathan-works-around-health-problems", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_amazing-johnathan_1.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=975699", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=975699", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "MIKE WEATHERFORD LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Neon,Shows, Mike Weatherford,", "parsely-section": "Blog_Neon", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-02T00:28:19-08:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "The Amazing Johnathan has already cheated death a few times, one Sunday afternoon in particular.", "title": "Amazing Johnathan works around health problems", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/entertainment/amazing-johnathan-works-around-health-problems", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_amazing-johnathan_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_amazing-johnathan_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-02T08:28:19Z"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing Cirque du Soleil stunts.\u201dTicket sales have been strong, leading to dark jokes about bands that do \u201cfarewell\u201d tours.\nThe Amazing Johnathan has already cheated death a few times, one Sunday afternoon in particular.\nIt\u2019s still good to talk to Johnathan (Szeles), even if he is sharing bad news.\nSo I drove all the way to the Review-Journal to call him, and was never happier to hear his voice.\nA few years ago, I showed up for a get-together at comedy-magician Nick Lewin\u2019s house in Henderson, only to learn that Peter Reveen had just dropped by to inform everyone the Amazing Johnathan had died."}
