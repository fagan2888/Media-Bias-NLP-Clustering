Now, the Obama administration is using its final 10 months to bolster the consumer experience on the Web portals, part of a broader push to promote enrollment and mitigate insurers\u2019 losses.\n\nMr. Slavitt said the administration is cracking down on \u201cbad actors\u201d by requiring consumers to submit proof of life events that qualify them for special enrollment periods outside the regular signup season, so they don\u2019t just enter the marketplace once they become sick.\n\nHe said insurers, too, play a role in making sure their plans are attractive enough to retain enrollees.\n\n\u201cThe exchange is still in its early stages. Consumers are still getting educated about what their coverage means. I think the health plans, to be fair, are still experimenting with how to offer the best products and services. And for our part, we\u2019re watching closely, looking at the data and making sure that we operate an exchange that continues to work,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said.\n\nWhile it may be a long-term project, the law faces short-term expectations on Capitol Hill.\n\nGOP critics eyeing repeal with a White House ally in 2017 have pointed to UnitedHealth Group and other insurers who have worried aloud about their financial prospects on the exchanges, saying they are losing money as sicker than expected customers sign up.\n\nThey say premiums are going up in many places \u2014 not down \u2014 while out-of-pocket costs tied to some offerings leave enrollees \u201cfunctionally uninsured.\u201d\n\nAlso, congressional budget scorekeepers had projected that 21 million people should be using the exchanges at this point, compared to the 13 million that actually signed up. GOP critics say that\u2019s proof that enrollment is \u201cstalling out,\u201d though the administration says the initial projection was wrong.\n\nMr. Slavitt said the 2010 law is already working, extending coverage to 20 million Americans who didn\u2019t have it.\n\nBeyond the exchanges, officials in 31 states and D.C. have expanded their Medicaid programs, while young adults can remain on their parents\u2019 plans until 26.\n\n\u201cIt may be one of the most significant things that any of us have been through or go through in our careers in health care,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said. \u201cThe question is, what happens next?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man in charge of implementing Obamacare rallied insurers to the cause Tuesday, saying there is a viable path forward for the law's insurance markets so long as health plans stay affordable and meet consumers' demands.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The man in charge of implementing Obamacare rallied insurers to the cause Tuesday, saying there is a viable path forward for the law\u2019s insurance markets so long as health plans stay affordable and meet consumers\u2019 demands.", "title": "Top Obamacare official eyes stability on exchanges, a $40 billion market", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/8/top-obamacare-official-eyes-stability-exchanges-40/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/21/Andy-Slavitt-Portrait.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/21/Andy-Slavitt-Portrait.jpg", "description": "The man in charge of implementing Obamacare rallied insurers to the cause Tuesday, saying there is a viable path forward for the law's insurance markets so long as health plans stay affordable and mee", "card": "summary", "title": "Top Obamacare official eyes stability on exchanges, a $40 billion mark"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Andy Slavitt"}, "article_summary": "I think the health plans, to be fair, are still experimenting with how to offer the best products and services.\n\u201cBigger than the coffee industry,\u201d he told a conference hosted by America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry main lobbying group.\nMr. Slavitt said the 2010 law is already working, extending coverage to 20 million Americans who didn\u2019t have it.\nGOP critics say that\u2019s proof that enrollment is \u201cstalling out,\u201d though the administration says the initial projection was wrong.\nAndy Slavitt, acting director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Web-based exchanges have moved beyond their technological stumbles in fall 2013 and grown into a $40 billion industry."}
