Unified School District has directed its attorneys to consider legal action against the two companies\u2014Apple and Pearson\u2014contracted to provide iPads and accompanying curriculum for every student in the district. The mind-bogglingly expensive program proved to be a total catastrophe; no one knew what to do about lost or stolen iPads, and teachers struggled to implement the unreliable curriculum.\n\nAt this point, district officials just want to get their money back, according to The Los Angeles Time:\n\nL.A. schools Supt. Ramon C. Cortines \u201cmade the decision that he wanted to put them on notice, Pearson in particular, that he\u2019s dissatisfied with their product,\u201d said David Holmquist, general counsel for the nation\u2019s second-largest school system. He said millions of dollars could be at stake. In a letter sent Monday to Apple, Holmquist wrote that it \u201cwill not accept or compensate Apple for new deliveries of [Pearson] curriculum.\u201d Nor does the district want to pay for further services related to the Pearson product.\n\nMany L.A. taxpayers probably hope the lawsuit is successful\u2014it was their money, after all, and Pearson is a thoroughly unsympathetic crony-capitalist enterprise.
