Thom Tillis in Raleigh on Friday. (WNCN)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) \u2013 Sen. Thom Tillis has been in Congress for nearly a year. On Friday, he spoke with WNCN political reporter Beau Minnick to recap his time in the Senate.\n\nHe said he is \u201cproud of the work we\u2019ve been able to accomplish\u201d but said there is more to be done.\n\nHe serves on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees.\n\nHere is a summary of what he told Minnick:\n\nOn Veterans Affairs:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of fundamental changes that have to happen in the VA. Otherwise, we\u2019re just taking the pressure off momentarily but the same problems will persist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to provide veterans the choice when a VA facility can\u2019t see them, to provide another option so that they can get the care that they deserve.\u201d\n\nAbout threats facing the United States internationally:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in some of the most threatened times in generations and we need to take that seriously and put a strategy together.\u201d\n\nOn North Korea:\n\n\u201cThey need to know that the American people and those in uniform haven\u2019t forgotten about them. They think about them every day. We need to make sure that they\u2019re contained and don\u2019t represent a threat outside their borders.\u201d\n\nOn his eugenics bill:\n\n\u201cWhat it will do for someone who receives a restitution payment is to ensure that they get the full benefit of that payment. If they qualify for some other federal benefit today, like Social Security disability insurance, if we had not passed this bill and they were on disability insurance, the federal government would say you have to use this money before you continue to qualify for the benefit. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s consistent with the spirit of the restitution.\u201d\n\nOn how the political process works in Washington:\n\n\u201cNext year, I want to see regular order. I want to see appropriations bills brought up in the first half of next year to demonstrate to the American people that we\u2019re going to honor our promise, we\u2019re going to fulfill our promise, to get back to regular order.\u201d\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cOne thing we have to do this year i communicate that the worst of Obamacare is yet to be implemented.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it now, I guarantee you next year you\u2019re going to like it less. Fewer people are going to be able to afford their coverage. Fewer people who have coverage are going to be able to go to the doctor because it will be too expensive.\u201d\n\nOn a lighter note, he addressed why he grew a beard:\u201cI\u2019m keeping the beard until the Panthers win the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping the beard until the Panthers win the Super Bowl.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thom Tillis addressed a number of issues in a discussion with WNCN.", "application-name": "WNCN", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_4ef95b9ddabd80873ba6a8406f5bfa55", "og": {"site_name": "WNCN", "description": "Thom Tillis addressed a number of issues in a discussion with WNCN.", "title": "Sen.
