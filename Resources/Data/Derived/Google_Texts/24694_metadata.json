Then they tried to break into a parked car before taking off. That was when an officer spotted them and gave chase westbound on Atlantic Boulevard at speeds of over 70 mph. Police said eventually the duo ran out of options and tried to get away on foot. That's when the officer caught up with Howard.\n\nLater, Howard confessed to that robbery and also to helping rob five other homes the previous Saturday on South Fletcher Avenue. In those cases, the thieves ran off with more than $11,000 worth of flat-screen televisions, sound systems and other electronic devices. Police said the thieves also broke into at least two vehicles that night.\n\nThe second offender remains still at large, although detectives are actively working to make more arrests in this case.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
