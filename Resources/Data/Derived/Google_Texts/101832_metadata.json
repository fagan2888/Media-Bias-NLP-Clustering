It was the mere possibility, inspired by a survey last month showing that many students want one at JHU, that frightened our special snowflakes into recommending a ban preemptively \u201cin the best interest of a cohesive campus environment in which all students feel accepted.\u201d\n\nThe perfection of society cannot tolerate Chicken Deluxes, citizens.\n\n\u201cThe SGA does not support the proposal of a Chick-fil-A, in a current or future sense, particularly on any location that is central to student life,\u201d states the resolution passed by the student government, which noted \u201cvisiting prospective and current students, staff, faculty, and other visitors who are members of the LGBTQ+ community or are allies would be subjected to the microaggression of supporting current or future Chick-fil-A development plans.\u201d\u2026 [J]unior Andrew Guernsey, president of Johns Hopkins University Voice for Life, wrote about the recent decision on National Review, stating: \u201cThe JHU student government\u2019s vote this week to ban any hypothetical future Chick-fil-A outlet from campus because of the company owner\u2019s support for traditional marriage \u2026 sends a clear message that students who disagree with liberal orthodoxy are not welcome on the Hopkins campus.\u201d\u2026 In remarks delivered to the Student Government Association before its vote, Guernsey said: \u201cIn banning Chick-fil-A from campus for its CEO\u2019s views, the JHU student government would also set a dangerous precedent that could be used to give the boot to socially conservative religious groups on campus\u2026 The entire notion of keeping the university a \u2018safe space,\u2019 free from one side of a debate on hot-button issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, is absolutely antithetical to Johns Hopkins\u2019 stated commitment to the free and robust exchange of ideas.\u201d\n\nGive credit where it\u2019s due: The \u201cmicroaggression\u201d bit is a brilliant political flourish, exactly the sort of thing that an Orwellian impulse towards purging one\u2019s environment of thoughtcrimes deserves. Banning Chick-fil-A because you disagree with Dan Cathy\u2019s opposition of gay marriage seems petty, a gesture of spite at the expense of students who have no problem with it and enjoy the food. Banning it because some students feel somehow assaulted by the mere presence of a franchise on campus is shrewder. You\u2019re not being spiteful now; you\u2019re defending a historically persecuted group from an act of aggression. Who could be against that?\n\nHere\u2019s my prediction: Safe spaces will continue to spread across campuses. And from there, the colonization project will really begin in earnest. Public institutions, schools, and even the home. And colonization is the right word, because the logic of a \u201csafe space\u201d is entirely alien to traditional notions of liberty. How can you even object? Are you pro-trauma? Pro-denialism? You think kids should have their identities denied and be traumatized in the home?\u2026 The safe-space movement offers hysterics real power over their institutions and neighbors. And this is a power that denies itself as power, that grasps by wailing. If America is rapidly becoming more economically and politically unequal, it seems natural enough that the graduates of our elite credentialing institutions should feel the need to control the thought and speech of their inferiors.\n\nThe only way to make JHU a safe space for gay students is to keep the entire campus free of gay-hating waffle fries. In traditional Orwellian states, thoughtcrimes would sometimes be punished by accusing the guilty party of being mentally ill; that was a softer, more politically salable way to neutralize an objector, with the state intervening ostensibly magnanimously for his own benefit. It\u2019s interesting to me that today\u2019s petty campus fascists eschew that to present themselves as the fragile parties, at risk of being microaggressed or \u201ctriggered\u201d at any moment. I\u2019m not sure why it took until recently for that tactic to catch on as cause for purging ideological opponents. Probably it\u2019s a combination of the public being more aware nowadays of genuine hardships that some groups used to suffer in silence (e.g., gays in the closet, women raped on campus), the rise of \u201ctherapy culture,\u201d and the fact that as victimization writ large has lost its cultural stigma it\u2019s become a powerful political shield, placing anyone who claims it beyond certain types of political criticism. Deployed haphazardly as a way to keep your ideological headspace clear of \u201caggressive\u201d impurities though, it turns the old strategy on its head. When an objector was treated as mentally ill, it implied that he was too \u201cdelicate\u201d to function in wider society; now that it\u2019s the statists who are \u201cdelicate,\u201d it\u2019s they who need to be walled off from wider society. They\u2019re turning the campus into a sort of asylum. I hope they\u2019re ready for their release in four years.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Safe space.", "title": "Crisis averted: Johns Hopkins student government bans Chick-fil-A to prevent \u201cmicroaggression\u201d against gays", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/24/crisis-averted-johns-hopkins-student-government-bans-chick-fil-a-to-prevent-microaggression-against-gays/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T22:41:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T20:57:33+00:00"}, "keywords": "ban, cathy, Chick-Fil-A, gay, johns hopkins, LGBT, microaggression,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1bf\"", "article_summary": "Crisis averted: Johns Hopkins student government bans Chick-fil-A to prevent \u201cmicroaggression\u201d against gaysposted at 6:41 pm on April 24, 2015 by AllahpunditThere were no plans in the works to put a Chick-fil-A on campus.\nAnd colonization is the right word, because the logic of a \u201csafe space\u201d is entirely alien to traditional notions of liberty.\nThe only way to make JHU a safe space for gay students is to keep the entire campus free of gay-hating waffle fries.\nBanning it because some students feel somehow assaulted by the mere presence of a franchise on campus is shrewder.\nI\u2019m not sure why it took until recently for that tactic to catch on as cause for purging ideological opponents."}
