Over the next three years, a team of scientist led by University of Strathclyde\u2019s Anja Kuschmann will analyze verbal patterns, breathing, and intonation (\u201cprosody\u201d) in young people living with the diagnosis. Hopefully, the project will inspire new therapeutic strategies, and yield new insights into difficult disorder.\n\n\"The development of prosody in children with CP is currently not well understood. As a result, it is not certain whether prosodic difficulties in CP are due to muscular problems during speaking or the inability to build and store the correct prosodic information in the brain,\u201d Kuschmann explained in a press release. \u201cThis research will investigate the prosodic abilities in children with CP to determine the underlying nature of their difficulties. \u201cIt will contribute to the theoretical understanding of the causes of prosodic impairment in CP, and may help to improve diagnosis and therapy of prosodic difficulties in CP.\"\n\nIn the absence of a cure, CP is often treated through physiotherapeutic programs designed to boost independence and confidence. However, comprehensive therapy strategies are often ineffective, as the characteristics of the condition always vary from person to person. Kuschmann hopes that the new project will illuminate new ways to customize treatment and provide tailored assistance to every child living with CP.\n\n\"This research, which will involve the analysis of the speech patterns of around 40 children aged between seven and 16, will hopefully inform the assessment and interventions for children with CP,\u201d she said. \u201cBy looking at how breathing might be improved, for example, some children with CP may be able to use their speech alongside assisted technology -- such as voice synthesisers -- to communicate.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are confident that improvements in these areas will have tremendous bearing on the child\u2019s ability to form relationships, make friends, and participate in the wider community.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CP refers to a group of neurological disorders that impair the ability to maintain posture and balance. The agency estimates that about one in every 303 children is born with a variation of the condition, making it the most common childhood motor disability. Although the disorder is generally congenital, CP can in rare cases be acquired after birth, usually as a result of brain infections or severe head trauma during infancy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cerebral palsy treatment, cerebral palsy speech, university of strathclyde, anja kuschmann, children cp, congenital cp, acquired cp", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 3-year research effort will attempt to illuminate new strategies to treat cerebral palsy by mapping the speech patterns of children living with the motor disorder.", "title": "New Efforts To Treat Cerebral Palsy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-efforts-treat-cerebral-palsy-research-may-improve-speech-abilities-children-living-condition", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/cerebral-palsy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 3-year research effort will attempt to illuminate new strategies to treat cerebral palsy by mapping the speech patterns of children living with the motor disorder.", "title": "New Efforts To Treat Cerebral Palsy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-efforts-treat-cerebral-palsy-research-may-improve-speech-abilities-children-living-condition", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/cerebral-palsy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/cerebral-palsy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-09-04T23:29:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T23:32:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 3-year research effort will attempt to illuminate new strategies to treat cerebral palsy by mapping the speech patterns of children living with the motor disorder."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc45c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis research will investigate the prosodic abilities in children with CP to determine the underlying nature of their difficulties.\n\u201cIt will contribute to the theoretical understanding of the causes of prosodic impairment in CP, and may help to improve diagnosis and therapy of prosodic difficulties in CP.\"\nbrunosan / FlickrA recently announced research effort could eventually help children with cerebral palsy (CP) speak more clearly.\nOver the next three years, a team of scientist led by University of Strathclyde\u2019s Anja Kuschmann will analyze verbal patterns, breathing, and intonation (\u201cprosody\u201d) in young people living with the diagnosis.\n\"CP can affect speech because you need your muscles to control your tongue and lips to allow you to pronounce sounds properly,\" lead investigator Anja Kuschmann explained."}
