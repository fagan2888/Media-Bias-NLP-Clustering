The new roof will be made of a thick asphalt shingle and new material to protect it from leaks will be installed, Mr. Kadushin said.\n\nThe total cost to replace the roof is estimated at $3.4 million and repairs won\u2019t be finished until at least October, the city said. An original estimate to replace the roof, commissioned by the Bloomberg administration in 2012, was $2.1 million but that project wasn\u2019t finished, city officials said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. de Blasio said he has \u201cdefinitely seen the leaks\u201d and said he hoped the reconstruction effort would be swift.\n\n\u201cThe asbestos situation was discovered in the context of trying to figure out how to shore up the roof in general, so here we\u2019ll hopefully have a long term solution that will fix the roof, but also get the asbestos out,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during an unrelated news conference.\n\nGracie Mansion was built in 1799 by Archibald Gracie, a wealthy New York merchant, on a bend overlooking the East River. But financial problems forced Mr. Gracie to sell the house in 1823 and the city took ownership in 1896.\n\nFor decades, the mansion was used as a concession stand and as restrooms for a nearby park. It eventually became the first home for the Museum of the City of New York before it became the official mayoral residence in 1942.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor, never lived at Gracie Mansion during his 12 years in office and the de Blasios considered staying in their native Brooklyn before moving into the 216-year-old home after Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inauguration last year.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Gracie Mansion, the centuries-old home of Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family and one of Manhattan's oldest structures, is scheduled to undergo millions of dollars in roof repairs and asbestos cleanup, New York City officials said Thursday.", "title": "New York City\u2019s Gracie Mansion to Repair Roof, Remove Asbestos: Officials", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/09/new-york-citys-gracie-mansion-to-repair-roof-remove-asbestos-officials/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU813_NYGRAC_P_20150409152928.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "New York City\u2019s Gracie Mansion to Repair Roof, Remove Asbestos: Officials", "description": "Gracie Mansion, the centuries-old home of Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family and one of Manhattan's oldest structures, is scheduled to undergo millions of dollars in roof repairs and asbestos cleanup, New York City officials said Thursday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Gracie Mansion, the centuries-old home of Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family and one of Manhattan's oldest structures, is scheduled to undergo millions of dollars in roof repairs and asbestos cleanup, New York City officials said Thursday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-09T22:30:55-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/09/new-york-citys-gracie-mansion-to-repair-roof-remove-asbestos-officials/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22890", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Gracie Mansion, the centuries-old home of Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family and one of Manhattan's oldest structures, is scheduled to undergo millions of dollars in roof repairs and asbestos cleanup, New York City officials said Thursday.", "title": "New York City\u2019s Gracie Mansion to Repair Roof, Remove Asbestos: Officials", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/09/new-york-citys-gracie-mansion-to-repair-roof-remove-asbestos-officials/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU813_NYGRAC_P_20150409152928.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22890", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-09T23:08:04-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Gracie Mansion was built in 1799 by Archibald Gracie, a wealthy New York merchant, on a bend overlooking the East River.\nNew York City\u2019s Gracie Mansion The Associated PressGracie Mansion, the centuries-old home of Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family and one of Manhattan\u2019s oldest structures, is scheduled to undergo millions of dollars in roof repairs and asbestos cleanup, New York City officials said Thursday.\nBut financial problems forced Mr. Gracie to sell the house in 1823 and the city took ownership in 1896.\nAn original estimate to replace the roof, commissioned by the Bloomberg administration in 2012, was $2.1 million but that project wasn\u2019t finished, city officials said.\nThe roof will undergo several months of repair, in which masonry will be dismantled and a crumbling chimney will be replaced, officials said."}
