Japan\u2019s Olympic Minister Toshiaki Endo indicated that it may not be possible.\n\nIOC vice president John Coates told reporters Tuesday in Tokyo that he asked Japan\u2019s senior Olympic officials to meet the deadline in order to run a series of tests before the Games open in August 2020.\n\n\u201cThe stadium has to be available for ceremonies and rehearsals,\u201d Coates said. \u201cThey need to have the handover to the organizing committee by January 2020.\u201d He emphasized the timing word by word.\n\nEndo, who was appointed to the post just two months ago, said it may be difficult to meet that target because April was already a tight deadline. He said it was a \u201cheavy request\u201d that he could not accept immediately.\n\n\u201cI cannot easily say (yes to) January 2020,\u201d Endo said. \u201cI can only ask (contractors) to finish the construction as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nCoates said the IOC did not request an 80,000 capacity, the size Japan had set for the earlier design.\n\nThis design was scrapped in July following a public outcry over the 252 billion yen ($2 billion) price tag \u2014 which was nearly double the original estimate and would have made it the most expensive sports stadium ever.\n\nEndo said he hoped to keep the cost of the revised stadium below 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "IOC wants Japan\u2019s main Olympic stadium ready by January 2020", "title": "IOC wants Japan\u2019s main Olympic stadium ready by January 2020", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/25/ioc-wants-japans-main-olympic-stadium-ready-by-january-2020/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150715_105839_tokyo-olympic-stadium.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150715_105839_tokyo-olympic-stadium.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T08:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:01:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Endo said he hoped to keep the cost of the revised stadium below 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion).\nTOKYO \u2014 A top International Olympic Committee official has urged Japan to speed up the troubled construction of Tokyo\u2019s new national stadium for delivery by January 2020.\nThat gives Japan three months less than the planned April 2020 handover.\n\u201cThey need to have the handover to the organizing committee by January 2020.\u201d He emphasized the timing word by word.\nThis design was scrapped in July following a public outcry over the 252 billion yen ($2 billion) price tag \u2014 which was nearly double the original estimate and would have made it the most expensive sports stadium ever."}
