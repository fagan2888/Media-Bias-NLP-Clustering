In the past few years a number of laboratories have uncovered critical drug targets within disabled chemical pathways in the brain that might be restored with medication. At least two clinical trials are currently studying the effects of such treatments on people with Down syndrome. Now geneticist Roger Reeves of Johns Hopkins University may have stumbled on another drug target\u2014this one with the potential to correct the learning and memory deficits so central to the condition.\n\nDown syndrome occurs in about one in 1,000 births annually worldwide. It arises from an extra copy of chromosome 21 and the overexpression of each of the 300 to 500 genes the chromosome carries. \u201cIf you go back even as recently as 2004, researchers didn\u2019t have much of a clue about the mechanisms involved in this developmental disability,\u201d says Michael Harpold, chief scientific officer with the Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation. But all that has changed. \u201cIn the past six or seven years there have been several breakthroughs\u2014and \u2018breakthroughs\u2019 is not by any means too big a word\u2014in understanding the neurochemistry in Down syndrome,\u201d Reeves says.\n\nThis improved knowledge base has led to a series of discoveries with therapeutic promise, including the latest by Reeves. He and his team were attempting to restore the size of the cerebellum in mice engineered to show the hallmarks of Down syndrome. The cerebellum lies at the base of the brain and controls motor functions, motor learning and balance. In people with Down syndrome and in the Down mouse model the cerebellum is about 40 percent smaller than normal. By restoring its size, Reeves hoped to gain a clearer picture of the developmental processes that lead to anomalies in a brain with Down syndrome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent breakthroughs could lead to pharmacological treatments for the chromosomal disorder", "title": "New drugs may transform Down syndrome", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Recent breakthroughs could lead to pharmacological treatments for the chromosomal disorder", "title": "New drugs may transform Down syndrome", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/new_drugs_may_transform_down_syndrome_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_132703754.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Recent breakthroughs could lead to pharmacological treatments for the chromosomal disorder", "title": "New drugs may transform Down syndrome", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_132703754.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenni Laidman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, down syndrome, Drugs, John Hopkins University, neurology, Pharmaceuticals, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a9c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: down syndrome, Drugs, John Hopkins University, neurology, Pharmaceuticals, Scientific American, Innovation News, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanPeople born with Down syndrome have always been considered to be incurably developmentally delayed\u2014until now.\nBy restoring its size, Reeves hoped to gain a clearer picture of the developmental processes that lead to anomalies in a brain with Down syndrome.\nIn people with Down syndrome and in the Down mouse model the cerebellum is about 40 percent smaller than normal.\n\u201cIn the past six or seven years there have been several breakthroughs\u2014and \u2018breakthroughs\u2019 is not by any means too big a word\u2014in understanding the neurochemistry in Down syndrome,\u201d Reeves says.\nThe cerebellum lies at the base of the brain and controls motor functions, motor learning and balance."}
