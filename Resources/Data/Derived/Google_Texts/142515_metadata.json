Consumer watchdogs have been fighting against such mandatory arbitration clauses, arguing that they erode consumer protections and limit the rights of workers, investors, credit-card holders and mortgage borrowers, among others. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced in October that it was considering proposing a ban on arbitration clauses used by financial companies.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Avoid Identity Theft Online During the Holidays\n\nWhile the fight against forced arbitration has centered more on financial services products and labor laws, it touches on retail, too. The big-name online shopping sites that have forced arbitration clauses include Amazon, Ticketmaster, Starbucks (for its gift cards), Patagonia, H&M, Overstock.com, J.Crew, Sears, Under Armour, Walgreens, Lowes, L\u2019Oreal, Sephora, Lego and Dell, according to watchdog group Public Citizen.\n\n(Several companies did not respond to requests for comment about their use of arbitration clauses, or declined to comment.)\n\nMost legitimate e-tailers have policies that allow customers to return merchandise regardless of the reason, without any cost or fuss. If a product is faulty or doesn\u2019t function as promised, you can always sue the manufacturer directly. Unless you bought the product from the manufacturer, you probably didn\u2019t sign their arbitration agreement.\n\nOne major concern relates to credit and debit card use. If an online retailer was negligent in protecting consumers\u2019 confidential information, what recourse would one have through arbitration to recover any losses? After 70 million Target customers were hacked, the company paid victims $10 million in a widely publicized settlement.\n\nTrial lawyers, unsurprisingly, are riled up about the arbitration clauses. \u201cThey\u2019re in places where a typical consumer wouldn\u2019t even dream they exist. Most don\u2019t even know what a forced arbitration clause is, much less that they\u2019re agreeing to one,\u201d says the president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, Evan Goldberg.\n\nBy not reading the fine print and simply agreeing to these clauses, consumers are forced to take any claims to private arbitrators, who often rule on the side of the company, Goldberg says. He adds that class action suits, which he describes as \u201cthe great equalizers that hold big companies accountable,\u201d are no longer an option if consumers agree to those terms.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Online Shopping Can Drag Down Retail Profits\n\nWhile forced arbitration clauses and the warnings about them aren\u2019t new, they may merit renewed attention given the rise in online holiday shopping, which has eclipsed sales at brick and mortar stores. Black Friday sales in physical stores fell to $10.4 billion this year, down from $11.6 billion in 2014, according to early data from ShopperTrak. Meanwhile, online sales on the same day jumped 14.3 percent to $2.72 billion compared with $2.4 billion last year, Adobe found.\n\nGoldberg says that right now there aren\u2019t that many options for shoppers to protect themselves from these provisions \u2014 except for restricting online shopping and only buying from web retailers that don\u2019t have arbitration clauses. He advises that consumers do their shopping in stores, where nobody has to sign any contracts and \u201cno clicking goes on.\u201d\n\nWorth noting is that reputation is paramount for most of these big online retailers, and they work hard to protect their brands. Any stain on their name can lead to a loss in revenue, so they\u2019re not likely to be actively working against consumers. While it\u2019s true that some consumers have been hurt by forced arbitration clauses, for the most part these online retailers are working hard to please consumers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Most shoppers who forked over their share of the", "title": "The Hidden Risk in Online Holiday Shopping", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Hidden-Risk-Online-Holiday-Shopping", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11262013_Online_Shopping.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Hidden-Risk-Online-Holiday-Shopping", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11262013_Online_Shopping.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Most shoppers who forked over their share of the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 5 Ways Online Shopping Can Drag Down Retail ProfitsWhile forced arbitration clauses and the warnings about them aren\u2019t new, they may merit renewed attention given the rise in online holiday shopping, which has eclipsed sales at brick and mortar stores.\n(Several companies did not respond to requests for comment about their use of arbitration clauses, or declined to comment.)\nWhile it\u2019s true that some consumers have been hurt by forced arbitration clauses, for the most part these online retailers are working hard to please consumers.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced in October that it was considering proposing a ban on arbitration clauses used by financial companies.\nThe big-name online shopping sites that have forced arbitration clauses include Amazon, Ticketmaster, Starbucks (for its gift cards), Patagonia, H&M, Overstock.com, J.Crew, Sears, Under Armour, Walgreens, Lowes, L\u2019Oreal, Sephora, Lego and Dell, according to watchdog group Public Citizen."}
