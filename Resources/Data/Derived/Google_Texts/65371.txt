An 8-year-old boy in Colorado Springs reportedly was disciplined by his school for drawing a picture of a gun when he was asked to describe shapes in the clouds.

Kody Smith, a second-grader at Talbott Elementary in Widefield, was asked as part of an assignment to draw a picture of what he saw in the clouds.

“That picture is a gun,” Kody told a local CBS affiliate.

Kody’s teacher, disturbed by the drawing, then called him into the office and filed a behavior report, claiming he showed behavior that is disruptive to the entire learning community, the station reported.

“It hurts. It hurts that he was so scared for being penalized for his imagination,” said Kody’s father, Jeff Smith.

“He’s 8 years old. He was doing exactly what he was told to do for the assignment,” said his mother, Angel Rivers.

The Widefield School District said the behavior report will not be on Kody’s permanent record.

“Our primary responsibility as a school district is to ensure safety of all staff, students and community,” the district told KKTV in a statement. “We exercised an age-appropriate reaction to an incident. The student’s education was never disrupted nor is this incident on the student’s permanent record. Our response was in line with routine procedures focused on school safety.”
