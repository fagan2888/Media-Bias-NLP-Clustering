But it is time to pay attention.\n\nThe state will probably subsidize your health insurance for another year, rather than cut you off cold next Jan. 1, as Gov. Nathan Deal has proposed.\n\nAfter that, it may be time to polish up those pitchforks that your predecessors brought to the state Capitol some three decades ago.\n\nIn last week\u2019s $21.8 billion budget pitch, the governor recommended the elimination of a $103 million health insurance subsidy for 11,500 part-time school workers. Deal characterized the move as a matter of fairness \u2013 other part-time state workers don\u2019t get that benefit.\n\nFor all its fair-mindedness, the governor\u2019s recommendation may be the most politically unpopular proposal he\u2019s put forward this year. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable at all being on opposite sides with [the governor], except that everybody\u2019s on this side,\u201d said Jack Hill, R-Reidsville, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason Deal\u2019s hound won\u2019t hunt. It has everything to do with Jack Hill\u2019s daddy.\n\nBut before we go there, a confession is necessary: I have a small dog in this fight. The industrious Mrs. Insider works two jobs. A part-time bookkeeping position with the Cobb County school system provides her health insurance and the possibility of, someday, a small pension. Her second gig helps pay the bills.\n\nMany families play part-time school jobs the same way. \u201cAt home, my experience has been that these individuals work for the insurance,\u201d said Terry England, R-Auburn, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cThey knew the pay wasn\u2019t great, but they work for the insurance to raise their families.\u201d\n\nThe key to this fight can be found in Deal\u2019s point about fairness. Why do we view bus drivers and, by extension, other part-time school workers as something special?\n\nThe answer is Wilton Hill, a bus driver, grocer and state lawmaker during the 1950s. In retirement, he became president of the Georgia School Bus Drivers\u2019 Association. The organization still exists, though it isn\u2019t nearly as influential as it was when Hill commanded it.\n\nOver lunch this week, one former state senator described Wilton Hill as quiet but relentless, capable of packing the Capitol on several occasions with bus drivers and other workers. A man with a catchy farewell that played on his community\u2019s famous state prison: \u201cIf you come to Reidsville, stop by and see me. If you\u2019re sent to Reidsville, I\u2019ll stop by and see you.\u201d\n\nOver a period of several years in the 1970s and \u201880s, with the late great House Speaker Tom Murphy as a key ally, Hill persuaded the General Assembly and a pair of governors that part-time school workers were indeed worthy of something more than an hourly wage.\n\nWilton Hill\u2019s son still believes that. \u201cThese are unique positions that are valuable to everybody,\u201d Jack Hill said this week. \u201cTraditionally, there\u2019s been a unique relationship between school bus drivers and children. You don\u2019t want to be hiring one every week.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Senate budget committee offers this test: \u201cIf there\u2019s a school bus accident, that\u2019s the lead story in every news market in the state of Georgia.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, like his counterpart in the Senate, said he, too, has been inundated with calls from local school officials \u2013 who say insurance coverage lends stability to low-paying positions.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a purely hourly worker, you\u2019re going to have some issues,\u201d England said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have turnover. With the health insurance being attached to it, the individual has a buy-in. They have some ownership of the job.\u201d\n\nThis week, House leaders inserted into a budget document an endorsement of that sentiment, demanding \u201can examination of options to provide health benefits\u201d to \u201cessential\u201d part-time school workers.\n\nTranslation: We like the idea, but don\u2019t know how to pay for it.\n\nThe chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees, who control much of the budget process in the Capitol, are proposing that, next year, local school systems pick up a larger share of health insurance costs for part-time employees. Lower gasoline prices could help absorb the cost. The state subsidy would shrink to something like $35 million, but it wouldn\u2019t disappear. Not immediately.\n\n\u201cThen we have to have an adult conversation,\u201d England said.\n\nYou can see the trend. Ultimately, health insurance for part-time school workers could become a system-by-system decision. Poorer outfits may have to point their bus drivers, cafeteria workers, para-professionals and bookkeepers to Obamacare.\n\nSchool systems will have to be careful how they do that. A new Georgia law, enacted last year, bars state political units \u2013 including boards of education \u2014 from becoming cozy with the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/01/28/dear-school-bus-driver-dont-panic-over-health-insurance-loss-not-yet/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/012615-insurance-kdj051.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "If you\u2019re a bus driver, cafeteria worker or other part-time worker in a public school system, it may not be time to panic.
