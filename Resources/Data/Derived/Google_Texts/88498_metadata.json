They provided a meal with potatoes, turkey and all the fixings for close to 400 people.\n\nIt took two sittings to fit all the people who took part in the meal; both filled. Volunteers also delivered about 50 meals.\n\nThe Miller family from Mina helped serve.\n\n\"I try to teach my children that they should be generous in giving back,\u201d Don Miller said. \u201cI'm very pleased to announce that this year was my daughter's idea.\"\n\n\"It just feels really good, you know, to see how happy it can make people just to be around other people and have people to spend a holiday with,\" Maddie Miller said.\n\nThe tradition at the Aberdeen church started 15 years ago. The meal first targeted people who might not have family in town.\n\n\"They wanted it with the table cloths and the people to feel like it's a house setting and that it can be family style. Maybe you've never met that person before but this is part of your family today and you sit down and enjoy your meal,\" coordinator Jodi Schwan said.\n\nThat setting has remained the same but now it serves a variety of people, including some who are working retail and don't have time to prepare a meal as store opening times have moved into Thursday.\n\nPeggy Miller says she isn't too concerned about the big sales or whether her time here will keep her from any of them.\n\n\"Being here with family and helping others, that's what makes the day,\" Peggy Miller said.\n\nHer eighth grade son agrees. Still, he plans to stand in line for a good deal on a new TV.\n\n\u201cYeah for the man cave,\u201d Matt Miller said.\n\nBut he won\u2019t pursue that purchase until after his family's time volunteering for the holiday is done.\n\nCoordinators say they don't have trouble finding volunteers to help. In fact, the church even had more people offer to help than needed this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Hundreds of people received a Thanksgiving meal thanks to dozens of volunteers in Aberdeen Thursday.
