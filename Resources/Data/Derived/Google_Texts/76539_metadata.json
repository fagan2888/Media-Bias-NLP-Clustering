She got caught running alone for much of the race, and on a windy day with strong gusts, that was a bad place to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty disappointed,\u201d Cranny said. \u201cI definitely wanted to be in the top 10. The race was not how I thought it was going to play out. I was imagining the whole time committing to the pack and there never really was a pack. Then I kind of got stuck between two packs, which was a really bad scenario, especially when it\u2019s windy. I should have maybe stayed with that second pack for a little longer and tried to conserve some energy. There\u2019s a lot of things I need to work on.\u201d\n\nCranny was excited for the meet, especially because she was here with a team loaded with runners who hadn\u2019t been to the NCAAs before, but the finish left a sour taste.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a good learning experience,\u201d Cranny said. \u201cI don\u2019t like ending the season on something like that. Then I have difficulty looking back on the rest of my season because this is like the end.\u201d\n\nThe University of Colorado women\u2019s team finished seventh, led by sophomore Erin Clark (31st) of Eugene, Ore.\n\n\u201cErin was wonderful,\u201d coach Mark Wetmore said after his men finished first. \u201cThe women had a really, really good day. It\u2019s going to get a little lost in the men\u2019s hoopla, but seven good races out of (the women).\u201d\n\nThe next two CU finishers were Monarch High School graduates. Junior Maddie Alm placed 51st and freshman Kaitlyn Benner was 81st.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Niwot grad Elise Cranny places 12th in NCAA cross country meet for Stanford", "title": "Niwot grad Elise Cranny places 12th in NCAA cross country meet for Stanford", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/22/niwot-grad-elise-cranny-places-12th-in-ncaa-cross-country-meet-for-stanford/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__a39dfb49ec5f2c2d660f6a7067001a76p1.jpg", "height": 327}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__a39dfb49ec5f2c2d660f6a7067001a76p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-22T14:36:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:29:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5541\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe women had a really, really good day.\n\u2014 Stanford\u2019s Elise Cranny had a great finish for a freshman at her first NCAA cross country championships, but the Niwot High School graduate was disappointed with her 12th-place finish Saturday.\n\u201cThroughout high school and now here, I want to be competitive with whomever,\u201d said Cranny, who won two Class 4A cross country titles in Colorado.\nIt\u2019s going to get a little lost in the men\u2019s hoopla, but seven good races out of (the women).\u201dThe next two CU finishers were Monarch High School graduates.\nI was imagining the whole time committing to the pack and there never really was a pack."}
