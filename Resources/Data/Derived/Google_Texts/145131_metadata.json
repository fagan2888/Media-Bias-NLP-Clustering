Should she succeed, it likely would be a bit anticlimactic. We\u2019ve already had a girly-man president. More correctly, we\u2019ve had a valley girly-man president \u2013 an uppity little pampered princess who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, be bothered with things in which he has no interest, like terrorism or foreign policy.\n\nFor six years now we\u2019ve looked for an Obama doctrine. Finally we have one. Last April aboard Air Force One, he summed it up for reporters: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid s\u2013t!\u201d How very presidential! The only thing missing from that statement was \u201ctotally\u201d and \u201cwhatever!\u201d\n\nLast week, Obama admitted that he hadn\u2019t developed a policy on ISIS in Syria yet, even though Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey said it must be defeated there. So did Obama take advantage of the long holiday weekend to come up with a strategy? No. In true valley girl (I\u2019m privileged and don\u2019t have to work) fashion, he spent his time partying with socialites and high rollers at a series of lavish fundraisers and attended an extravagant wedding.\n\nObama told his guests at the event in Westchester County, New York, \u201c(Like) I promise you (like) things are (totally) much less dangerous now (I\u2019m so sure) than they were 20 years ago, 25 years ago or 30 years ago. (Rad!)\u201d Nor was Obama the least bit worried about the growing crisis with Russia in Ukraine. As if to drive home that point Obama added, \u201c(Like) this is not something that is comparable to the challenges we faced during the Cold War (Duh)!\u201d\n\nSpeaking to another group of affluent guests in Newport, Rhode Island, Obama assured those assembled that our post 9/11 security system \u201cmakes us in the here and now (like) pretty safe. (Chill!)\u201d He added that ISIS \u201cdoesn\u2019t immediately (like totally) threaten the homeland. (Duh! Whatever!)\u201d\n\nTuesday, as the world watched in horror as ISIS beheaded a second American in as many weeks, Obama\u2019s petticoat was showing, again. When the going gets really tough, a true valley girl gets out of town. Obama left on a four-day trip to reassure our NATO allies that things are (totally) cool and to deliver a stern message to (grody) Russia.\n\nBefore leaving, Obama said that part of his reason for stopping in Estonia is to \u201c(Like) let the Estonians know (I\u2019m so sure) that we mean what we say (totally) with respect to our (like) treaty obligations.\u201d He noted that we are under no such treaty obligations with (gag me with a spoon) Ukraine but added, \u201cWe do, however, (like) stand shoulder to shoulder with them. (Bonus!)\u201d\n\nAfter all that, Putin, quaking in his jackboots, boasted to one European official that he could \u201ctake Kiev in two weeks.\u201d\n\nOnce in Estonia, Obama called ISIS a \u201cmanageable problem\u201d if the \u201cinternational community\u201d will (totally) come together. (Rad!)\n\nMake no mistake, I have no problem with a woman president as long as it\u2019s a \u201creal woman\u201d with resolve like England\u2019s \u201cIron Lady,\u201d Margaret Thatcher.\n\nHillary (What difference does it make?) Clinton now wants us to believe that she had major problems with Obama\u2019s foreign policy, but that mean old president just wouldn\u2019t take her advice. Nevertheless, she was all smiles when she presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with that infamous \u201creset\u201d button.\n\nSo, Hillary and Obama skipped out on our friends in Iraq, abandoned our plans to put a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, dismissed the terror attack in Benghazi as a demonstration over a video, ignored Russian aggression, erased our red line in Syria, ignored China\u2019s hostile actions in the western Pacific and let Iran off the hook. Where does that leave us in the eyes of the rest of the world?\n\nAssuming that we have any friends left, we are now the \u201cfriend who cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\nRemember these words of Osama bin Laden, \u201cWhen people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.\u201d\n\nOver the long holiday weekend, the closest Obama came to work was a Labor Day speech in Milwaukee where he concentrated on the \u201crights of (illegal) immigrants\u201d and the minimum wage. With ISIS bent on our destruction and Russia gobbling up territory, that\u2019s tantamount to a valley girl chewing gum and doing her nails.\n\nHow many times has Obama bragged, \u201cThe war in Iraq is over. The war in Afghanistan is winding down. Al-Qaida has been decimated and Osama bin Laden is dead\u201d?\n\nOh, yeah, like whatever. Duh!\n\nMedia wishing to interview Jane Chastain, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/09/our-girly-man-president/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Hillary Clinton would like to become the first woman president.
