Rounding out the top five most expensive HAIs are ventilator-associated pneumonia at $40,144, surgical site infections at $20,785, Clostridium difficile infections at $11,285, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections at $896.\n\n\"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) account for a large proportion of the harms caused by healthcare and are associated with high costs,\" the authors note. \"Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention.\"\n\nThe researchers used the National Healthcare Safety Network to estimate annual incidences of HAIs and reviewed 37 years' worth of published medical literature, the American Medical Association noted in a research announcement.\n\n\"While quality improvement initiatives have decreased HAI incidence and costs, much more remains to be done,\" the authors concluded. \"As hospitals realize savings from prevention of these complications under payment reforms, they may be more likely to invest in such strategies.\"\n\nIn one such strategy implemented in California, regional peer-to-peer learning networks targeting infection-reduction practices saved 3,576 lives and an estimated $64 million in healthcare costs, according to a new report released in August from the National Health Foundation. Among the results, the rate for ventilator-associated pneumonia fell 57 percent in three years, central line bloodstream infections fell 43 percent and catheter-associated urinary tract infections fell 24 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the AMA announcement\n\n- check out the National Health Foundation report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital-acquired infections cause domino effect\n\nPatient education may be key to reducing hospital-acquired infections\n\nCoalition wants more funding for infection control tracking system\n\nMultidisciplinary approach drives down C. diff infections, associated deaths\n\nHHS updates infection-prevention action plan\n\nHospital-acquired infections rarely reported", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) cost $9.8 billion per year, with surgical site infections alone accounting for one-third of those costs, according to research published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) cost $9.8 billion per year, with surgical site infections alone accounting for one-third of those costs, according to research published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.", "title": "Hospital-acquired infections rack up $9.8B a year", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-acquired-infections-rack-98b-each-year/2013-09-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "C.diff infection,catheter-associtaed urinary tract infection,central line-associated bloostream infections,hospital-acquired infections (HAI),JAMA Internal Medicine,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,surgical site infections,ventilator-associated pneumonia", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Rounding out the top five most expensive HAIs are ventilator-associated pneumonia at $40,144, surgical site infections at $20,785, Clostridium difficile infections at $11,285, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections at $896.\nHospital-acquired infections (HAI) cost $9.8 billion per year, with surgical site infections alone accounting for one-third of those costs, followed closely by ventilator-associated pneumonia at 31.6 percent, according to research published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nAmong the results, the rate for ventilator-associated pneumonia fell 57 percent in three years, central line bloodstream infections fell 43 percent and catheter-associated urinary tract infections fell 24 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) account for a large proportion of the harms caused by healthcare and are associated with high costs,\" the authors note.\n\"Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention.\""}
