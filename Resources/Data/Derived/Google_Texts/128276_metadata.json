Then came Ebola\") is that it is stunning and a must-read look at the lives of those with the courage to walk the halls of hospitals and treat the sick and dying in Monrovia, Liberia. How, exactly, does one take careful interview notes when wearing a full-protection hazmat suit?\n\nRead it all. And make sure you remember the names mentioned at the very beginning:\n\nMONROVIA, Liberia -- They were among the only Liberians who could treat Ebola, and in a single morning, it felt as if they were being picked off one by one.\n\nFirst, before dawn on Thursday, Ebola killed Dr. John Tata. Then, hours later, Dr. Thomas Scotland tested positive for the virus. With only a few dozen Liberian physicians in a country facing the biggest Ebola outbreak in history, it was a crippling blow. One Ebola treatment center closed its doors. Several of its hygienists and clinicians quit. Others left their shifts early to weep quietly outside.\n\nAt the center of the story is Dr. J. Soka Moses and his team. As the Post report notes, Tata was his professor in medical school and Scotland was the main colleague helping fight the rising tide of death in JFK Hospital's improvised Ebola ward.\n\nSo the names start connecting very quickly. A hospital is crippled when there are no doctors and nurses willing or able to work there. Here is one long, but unforgettable, scene:\n\nMoses hoped Friday would be better. He prepared to see the 21 Ebola victims who remained at JFK. The clinic had closed its doors to new patients, but he decided he would continue to care for the ones already admitted, until they recovered or died.\n\nBut as he began putting on his protective gear, five hygienists, in charge of disinfecting the ward and its doctors, stormed out of the building.\n\n\u201cWe are risking our lives, and we\u2019re getting paid nothing!\u201d Grace Twaeh screamed as she stalked down the dirt road connecting the hospital to downtown Monrovia. \u201cEveryone is getting infected here. People are dying, dying, dying.\u201d\n\nOne of Moses\u2019s assistants chased after her.\n\n\u201cPlease, I beg of you, come back!\u201d he shouted.\n\nTwaeh and the other hygienists kept walking.\n\nMoses was near his desk in the storage room. Earlier in the morning, he had spoken with Scotland over the phone. He had told his friend that he would continue treating the patients. But as the hygienists left, he wondered whether that was possible.\n\n\u201cHow can I do my job without them?\u201d he asked.\n\nMoses decided to try. He and 11 other JFK employees finished putting on their protective gear. It is a process that requires extraordinary attention to detail, to make sure not only that no skin is exposed but that there are enough layers of protection to survive a charge from a disoriented patient. That happened at JFK last month. The nurse who was attacked contracted the disease and died.\n\nThis is the point, near the end of the story, when there is a religious reference that has caused some discussion online (and in emails to GetReligion). Here it is:\n\nWhen their gear was on, the men and women gathered in a circle and held hands. A physician\u2019s assistant, Lawrence Kollie, led them in prayer.\n\n\u201cLord, we are before your tomb of grace,\u201d he began.\n\nWhen they went into the ward, they saw a familiar scene. The healthier patients sat in the hospital\u2019s fenced-in back yard, next to the massive pile of trash and excrement. Inside, the sickest patients writhed on mattresses or lay unmoving next to pools of vomit. A nurse cradled an infected child whose parents had died.\n\nWhat is the question?", "article_metadata": {"description": "I have said this many times, but I have nothing but admiration for the \r\nreporters who work in war zones and in lands ravaged by disasters of all \r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nIt's hard enough for reporters, when covering complex issues, to do \r\nadequate background research and keep their facts straight -- even under \r\nthe best of circumstances.
