It's the time of Thin Mints, Somoas, Do-Si-Dos, and Tagalongs. It's Girl Scout cookie season.

Local Girl Scouts will be out at several locations for the next couple of months to sell one of America's favorite treats.

Don't have cash? Don't worry. New this year, the scout leaders will

have card readers available. All of the proceeds go back to the Girl Scouts, local charities, and even the military.

"We've always raised money for somebody in the community. We've done the Humane Society, we've also donated to the rescue mission," explained Pam Baldwin, a Girl Scout Leader.

"We're donating them to the troops that are overseas," said Emily, a local Girl Scout.
