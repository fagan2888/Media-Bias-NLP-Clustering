According to the Center, Michigan\u2019s state government is built on \u201can honor system with no honor.\u201d\n\nLocally, Virginia and Maryland both scored Ds, but each was credited with recent changes to deal with past problems.\n\nVirginia ranks 16th in the assessment of systems in place to deter corruption in state government. Maryland ranks 23rd.\n\nIn the wake of former Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s conviction on federal corruption charges, Virginia ranked 2nd in the country for procurement, 3rd in state civil service management, 4th in judicial accountability and electoral oversight.\n\nThe state legislature\u2019s passage of first limits on gifts for politicians and their family members, and establishment of an ethics council to collect and publish disclosure forms for all branches of government were cited as steps toward transparency.\n\nMaryland was criticized for its missteps in implementing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMaryland\u2019s disastrous health exchange roll out combined two elements \u2014 procurement problems and lack of transparency,\u201d according to the rankings.\n\nHowever, Maryland scored relatively well in lobbying disclosure, procurement, state budget processes, and electoral oversight.\n\nSee the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity\u2019s state-by-state breakdown here.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
