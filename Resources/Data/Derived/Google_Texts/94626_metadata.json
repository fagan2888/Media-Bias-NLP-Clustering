It has now become part of a new Republican effort to chip away at the legislative underpinnings of the law known as Obamacare.\n\nAides said the bill should eventually come to a vote. But it was unclear whether the measure would overcome potential blocking tactics by Democrats.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment. But Obama, who vowed in Tuesday's State of the Union address to oppose efforts to roll back his policies, would be expected to veto the measure. \u201cThe individual mandate is a line I can't cross,\" the president said at a news conference in November.\n\nAnalysts, insurers and healthcare reform advocates have long described the individual mandate as a vital lever for encouraging young healthy consumers to sign up for health coverage under Obamacare. Its loss, they say, could unsettle insurance markets and cause coverage costs to rise sharply.\n\nUnder the mandate, most Americans have been required to maintain health coverage since last year, or face an escalating annual penalty that is scheduled to top out in 2016 at 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per person, whichever is higher.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty stands at 2 percent of income or $325 per person.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted last March to delay the individual mandate's penalties for one year.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan;
