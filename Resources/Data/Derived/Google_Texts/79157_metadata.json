Aging, archaic IT systems at high risk for failing and are all but impossible to secure from modern cyberthreats. The government is paying billions just to keep them running, leaving precious few dollars to upgrade, modernize or adopt new technology.\n\nRelated: Government IT Is a $75 Billion a Year Disaster. What Can Be Done About It?\n\n\u201cI think we are facing a crisis that's bigger than Y2K,\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s IT chief, Tony Scott, told a panel of high-ranking agency officials and corporate CEOs at a meeting of the President\u2019s Management Advisory Board this week, adding, \u201cMuch of the government today runs on very old, outdated technology.\u201d\n\nNearly three-quarters of the $80 billion spent by the federal government on information technology each year goes toward keeping so-called legacy systems running. Some of them are woefully out of date. The government currently operates nearly two dozen information systems that date back to 1980 or earlier, according to congressional investigators.\n\nPersonnel familiar with these systems -- including the 1950s-era COBOL programming language and outmoded mainframe computers -- are increasingly nearing retirement age.\n\nNew college graduates may not be equipped to tackle the government\u2019s IT relics. A 2013 poll by Micro Focus found less than a quarter of college computer science programs worldwide still teach old-school skills like COBOL.\n\n\u201cThe people that understand it and who built it and are running it are leaving every day,\u201d Scott said, referring to agencies\u2019 legacy tech. \u201cWe're not building capacity with those skill sets. And just to do a lift and shift of those old architectures is the wrong answer.\u201d\n\n\u2018Headed for a Crisis\u2019\n\nGovernment watchdogs are similarly troubled by number of fossils in federal IT.\n\n\"We spend way too much on legacy operations, and that is headed for a crisis,\u201d said David Powner, director of IT management issues at the Government Accountability Office.\n\nRelated: More Senior Government Execs Raked in Higher Bonuses Last Year\n\nSince 2010, the amount of spending on the operation and maintenance of legacy systems has increased by about $5 billion, while the amount slotted for investing in developing new systems has declined by more than $7 billion, according to a GAO analysis presented to Congress earlier this month.\n\nA forthcoming report on legacy systems in government tallied up 28 systems at least 25 years old, Powner said. Eleven are at least 35 years old.\n\n\u201cAnd the question is . . . do we have a plan to replace those old, archaic legacy systems? Very few agencies do,\u201d Powner said, speaking at a Nov. 17 event on federal IT reform in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a newly released survey by MeriTalk of 150 federal IT managers, only about half of respondents said their agencies have a formal strategy for modernizing legacy applications.\n\nIncreasingly, aging federal IT infrastructure is seen as a security risk.\n\nThe clearest example is the Office of Personnel Management, which revealed this summer hackers -- purportedly as part of a Chinese-backed espionage operation -- had trawled through agency databases scooping up sensitive background investigation files on nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors. Social Security numbers stored on OPM\u2019s 1980s-era databases were not encrypted, officials said, because they were too old.\n\nRelated: Poker and Escorts on Government Credit Cards\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many other systems across government are essentially too old to secure. Sixty-two percent of respondents in the MeriTalk survey said failure to upgrade systems would eventually threaten mission-critical capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got architectures in various places and hardware and software that is indefensible no matter how much money and talent we put on it,\u201d said Michael Daniel, the White House cybersecurity coordinator, speaking at an information security conference in September.\n\nSecurity remains a \u201cbolt-on\u201d rather than something \u201cdeeply embedded into the product throughout the whole life cycle,\u201d Daniel said at the time.\n\nCongress is \u2018Quite Interested\u2019 in IT Management\n\nLast month, Scott\u2019s office released a long-awaited revamp of guidelines for purchasing and managing government IT systems. The guidelines were last updated in the dial-up Internet era.\n\nThey direct CIOs to keep track of aging information systems -- in particular those \u201ccannot be appropriately protected or secured\u201d -- reminding agencies that such systems \u201cshould be given a high priority for upgrade, replacement or retirement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent officials\u2019 newfound talk of a crisis in federal IT will spur action by Congress.\n\n\"As I've gone up to testify, it's quite clear that Congress is now quite interested in this topic of how IT is run in the federal government,\u201d Scott told the management board this week.\n\nPart of that is thanks to the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act -- approved by Congress late last year -- which gives agency chief information officers a stronger hand in managing their organizations\u2019 IT spending and major tech purchases.\n\nIn the past, though, Scott has discussed how the constraints of the congressional appropriations process -- and tight budget caps in recent years -- have often tied agencies\u2019 hands when it comes to upgrading outmoded technology.\n\nCIOs are told to keep costs down, \u201cand they cut the easiest thing there is to cut, which is spending on new application development and refreshing infrastructure,\u201d Scott told an industry crowd in August.\n\nThis story originally appeared at NextGov.
