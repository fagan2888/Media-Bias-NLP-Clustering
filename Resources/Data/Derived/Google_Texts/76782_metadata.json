But is it the success the president of the US would like us to believe? Joining me down the line is health economist Jane Sarasohn-Kahn.\n\nWorld Finance: Well Jane, the Affordable Care Act. Is it affordable?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: Well, it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, affordability! The one big thing the Affordable Care Act did was to cover people who had been refused insurance before, with pre-existing conditions. And if you live in the US, and you have a pre-existing condition, you would likely have fallen into financial ruin if you got sicker. Health costs are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US.\n\nIf you\u2019re young, however, and don\u2019t perceive any health risks, it seems quite unaffordable; and you might take the risk of not being insured, or being self-insured and take the penalty.\n\nWorld Finance: Where\u2019s the money coming from to cover the extra people?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: Right: so, it\u2019s $934bn. Almost half of that comes from cuts, or moving Medicare moneys from one pot to the Affordable Care Act. Some of that is moving money from our Medicaid plan \u2013 that\u2019s care for lower income American health citizens. Also the penalties for employers and individuals who do not get insured. And finally, revenues from health plans, medical device companies, and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWorld Finance: It\u2019s estimated that around 30 million people still don\u2019t have coverage at all; what happens to them, and wouldn\u2019t it just be cheaper if something does go wrong for the government to cover them from the beginning?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: It is a political will question. We have not had the conversation in the US that Beveridge had in your country in the 40s, when the NHS was established.\n\nWe really don\u2019t believe in healthcare for everyone in the US! If you look at our congress, there is not consensus about that.\n\nAs a health economist, my arithmetic tells me that it would be cheaper absolutely to cover people with a basic health plan, and that conversation I think will happen in the next year, two, or three, as more Americans are paying more out of pocket, and understand the true cost of healthcare.\n\nWorld Finance: So what problems has Obamacare alleviated?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: There\u2019s more prevention covered now; there\u2019s more mental health benefits covered, which typically have not been covered. The ACA also mandates that prices are not different for men versus women, and for the sick versus the not sick.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s starting to drive down the big problem we have in the US, which are racial and other health disparities: between rich and poor; black, white and hispanic.\n\nWorld Finance: People are still opposed to it; is that purely politically motivated then, and what alternatives are they calling for?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: President Obama has really created a whole new level of vitriol between people who don\u2019t like him, and people who do like him.\n\nHowever, the ACA naysayers haven\u2019t offered a really comprehensive solution; except for, maybe, health tax vouchers: premiums, as they\u2019ve done for schools. But that really doesn\u2019t solve our problem of high cost healthcare.\n\nWorld Finance: A big concern when it came out was that it would cost a lot of jobs; has this been the case?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: We\u2019ve had consistent job growth over the last couple of years, since the ACA has kicked in. In fact, last week a Bloomberg review came out on Bloomberg News, and they looked at a poll of employers in the US asking that very question. And it was kind of a big corporate shrug! So far, it\u2019s not made a material difference.\n\nWorld Finance: So, the goal was to get six million uninsured to be insured. But the cost to businesses has definitely increased to accommodate the rise in costs for those uninsured; so has the incremental cost in mid-to-large size businesses thwarted growth a bit, or at least delayed economic recovery or growth in the US?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: It\u2019s really had to parse out the direct effects of the ACA on economic growth.\n\nFor now, we\u2019re seeing the lower cost of energy improving consumer spending, we\u2019re seeing home sales going up; we have a lot of positive indicators now.\n\nBut again, hard to parse out the impact of these insureds, newly-covered, and the ACA impact on economic growth. So Ill say the jury is out on that so far.\n\nWorld Finance: Up until Obamacare begin its enrolment, American healthcare was run by multi-million dollar private companies, which sold health insurance policies for the most amount of profit they could make. What\u2019s happened to the insurance industry now, and the knock-on tax effect?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: If you look at the insurance industry, the big players, the big national players: United, Aetna, Cigna-Humana; many of the blue cross plans like Anthem; the profits are quite healthy.\n\nFrom 2014 they\u2019ve been living large based on the ACA new enrolees volume going up, with these newly insureds. And it\u2019s good to remember that the ACA was written heavily in parts by our insurance industry lobby AHIP, and the pharma industry lobby, PHRMA.\n\nNow, the pharma industry isn\u2019t faring so well \u2013 not necessarily due to the ACA \u2013 but the insurance industry has benefited from new volumes of people coming in.\n\nWorld Finance: So overall, Obamcare: has it cost the US, or saved it money?\n\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: Hard to say. Early days right now, and we are spending upwards of $900bn on it.\n\nWe do have to solve the problem which the ACA does not solve, or lowering the cost of care, and changing workflow, and how we deliver care in America. That\u2019s not in the ACA.\n\nHowever, the private sector, and the way we\u2019re starting to pay more on the basis of outcomes versus volume \u2013 that is, paying for everything we do \u2013 is going to shift that.\n\nSo I\u2019d say, call me in a couple more years and I\u2019ll answer that question.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sarasohn-kahn-we-dont-believe-in-healthcare-for-everyone.jpg", "description": "Obamacare was implemented in 2010 and is now in full swing, but is it the success the US president says or a black hole for money?", "title": "Sarasohn-Kahn: We don\u2019t believe in healthcare for everyone"}, "norton-safeweb-site-verification": "qd3lwrp4qsxqg755aiaq7akd47kyo8ze4aw2yuav9wgl06nnzqxj2uqhs85hdyj90vdfrjl6smk5ogx2ih-yh0ewc0p12-dbzln4yqdfpksjsyjplu4xj5h4ahrls1-a", "description": "Sarasohn-Kahn: We don\u2019t believe in healthcare for everyone | Obamacare was implemented in 2010 and is now in full swing, but is it the success the US president says or a black hole for money?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "thumbnail": "http://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sarasohn-kahn-we-dont-believe-in-healthcare-for-everyone.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7e0\"", "article_summary": "We really don\u2019t believe in healthcare for everyone in the US!\nWorld Finance speaks with health economist Jane Sarasohn-Kahn on how affordable the Affordable Care Act really is.\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: President Obama has really created a whole new level of vitriol between people who don\u2019t like him, and people who do like him.\nWhat\u2019s happened to the insurance industry now, and the knock-on tax effect?\nJane Sarasohn-Kahn: It\u2019s really had to parse out the direct effects of the ACA on economic growth."}
