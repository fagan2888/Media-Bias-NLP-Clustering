The Health Department received a grant of $1 million from the Illinois Department of Public Health and awarded grants to those organizations.The Health Department plans to leverage this strong network of social service providers to create a more robust opportunity for the nearly 87,000 county residents estimated to be eligible for health coverage under ACA, officials said.\n\n\n\nGrants were awarded to the following organizations: DuPage Health Coalition: Access DuPage, DuPage County Community Services, DuPage Federation on Human Services, DuPage PADS, Hamdard Center for Health & Human Services, Northwest Pediatric Services SC, Loaves & Fishes Community Pantry, Naperville Township, Outreach Community Ministries, People's Resource Center, Walk-In Ministry of Hope, Xilin Association, and YWCA Metropolitan Chicago.
