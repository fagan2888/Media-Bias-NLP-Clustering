"The Glamour & the Squalor,"7 p.m., Oriental Theatre, 2230 N. Farwell Ave.

Nirvana, Weezer, Death Cab for Cutie, Beck, Foo Fighters and Madison-born Garbage are all indebted to some extent to Marco Collins, the trendsetting radio personality, largely associated with KNDD-FM (107.7) in Seattle, who spent much of his life in the closet and struggled with a massive drug problem. Collins, director Marq Evans and producer Michelle Quisenberry are scheduled to attend.

Journal Sentinel music writer Piet Levy will conduct a Q&A with the filmmakers and Collins after Sunday's screening.

"The Seventh Seal,"4:15 p.m., Oriental

Ingmar Bergman's landmark meditation on death and faith, with Max von Sydow as a knight returning from the Crusades only to face the contest of his life. A rare chance to see this 1957 movie — one of the late 1950s foreign classics that opened the door to art-house cinema in the United States — on the big screen, in a 35-millimeter print. It's showing as part of the festival's Passport: Sweden program, with English subtitles.
