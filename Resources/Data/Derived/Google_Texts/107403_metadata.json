Around 250 infants will die this year in Kansas.\n\nThe national rate of infant mortality is 6.0 deaths per 1,000 births. Kansas is at a rate of 6.36 according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The 0.36 increase accounts for an additional 14 infants that are at risk of dying in Kansas.\n\nThere are higher counties in the state; Sedgwick, Johnson, Wyandotte and Shawnee are the highest according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. They account for over 50 percent of infant deaths.\n\nBreaking the numbers down to Sedgwick County, zip codes east of downtown Wichita and to the south east have a very high rate of infant mortality. According to KDHE statistics, zip code 67214 has a 14.1 rate of infant mortality, which is the second highest in the entire state.\n\nThere are multiple causes for infant morality, but the four most likely causes are congenital anomalies, prematurity, sudden unexplained infant death and maternal complications.\n\nDr. Barry Bloom is director of the newborn intensive care unit at Wesley, he says that there are ways to lower the rate of infant death. \u201cWe would love to see the day that we are not necessary, but we will always be here for sick babies,\u201d Dr. Bloom said, \u201cmany of the things that we have to deal with are preventable with changes in lifestyle.\u201d\n\nBloom says that a woman\u2019s health prior to pregnancy is very important during the pregnancy. Risk factors, like smoking, drinking and obesity, increase the chances of prematurity and abnormalities, even if the woman is not pregnant yet.\n\nThere are many other factors that cause infant mortality; they are very complex issues and sometimes out of the control of the mother.\n\nThe CDC ranks Kansas at 24th in the nation for infant mortality. That is down from years past.\n\nDr. Cari Schmidt is a research at the University of Kansas Medical School in Wichita. She has analyzed the data of infant morality over the past three years and has found that the areas inside the state with the highest infant mortality rates move around. One piece of information is driving her efforts in certain communities - African American babies in Wichita die at a rate three times higher white babies.\n\nBoth Schimdt and Bloom believe that the rates can be lowered and will be lowered. Their goal is to get Kansas below the national average of infant mortality.\n\nOne way to get the mortality rate down that has shown impact is to educate people about living a healthy lifestyle. Smoking, drinking and being obese increase the risk factors for problems during pregnancy. They also educate parents on safe sleep and how to take care of their infant in a safe way.\n\nOrganizations across the state are holding community baby showers, where parents and expecting parents get free information on how to help their baby be healthy.\n\nAny infant that ends up in the NICU (newborn intensive care unit) runs a very large medical bill. Bloom says that a parent can expect a minimum $50,000 bill. That is why he stresses the health of the mother during pregnancy in hopes that the infant is born healthy.\n\nOne rule to follow is the ABC rule. A \u2013 alone, always let the infant sleep along; B \u2013 back, always make sure the infant is sleeping on their back; C \u2013 crib, the infant needs to sleep in their crib. According to Schmidt, of all the infants that died of sudden unexpected infant death, all of them had unsafe items in their cribs. That is why she says to keep any loose blankets or bedding out of the crib. \u201cThey [parents] are adding those things to the crib because they want to comfort their infant and yet it becomes a hazard,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2007, there was a spike in the mortality rate in Kansas. Many committees were formed to try and decrease that rate. Christy Schunn of the Kansas Infant Death and SIDS Network says that the collaboration of doctors, community activists and government health care workers are what resulted.\n\nSchunn has found that woman as young as 12-years-old benefit from education about pregnancy and healthy lifestyle habits. \u201cThere is much we can do, we have excellent services, we have people are wrapped around this and digging deep,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think we are successful and we will continue to see this downward trend.\u201d\n\nIf anyone has any questions about resources available to try and prevent infant mortality, they can contact the Kansas Infant Death and SIDS Network at (316) 682-1301.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Kansas sits above the national average when it comes to infants mortality.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Kansas sits above the national average when it comes to infants mortality.", "title": "Infants die at higher rate in Kansas than other states", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Infants-die-at-higher-rate-in-Kansas-than-other-states-285028711.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/6FB/56F/6FB56FF568724A11962BE5B0DC2A09D5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/882/85F/88285F894FC1467288A6D0929C089F04.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Kansas sits above the national average when it comes to infants mortality.", "title": "Infants die at higher rate in Kansas than other states", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Infants-die-at-higher-rate-in-Kansas-than-other-states-285028711.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/infant7.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Infants die at higher rate in Kansas than other states", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Infants die at higher rate, in Kansas than other states"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23cd\"", "article_summary": "The infant mortality rate in Kansas is higher than other states.\nOne way to get the mortality rate down that has shown impact is to educate people about living a healthy lifestyle.\nAccording to Schmidt, of all the infants that died of sudden unexpected infant death, all of them had unsafe items in their cribs.\nChristy Schunn of the Kansas Infant Death and SIDS Network says that the collaboration of doctors, community activists and government health care workers are what resulted.\nIn 2007, there was a spike in the mortality rate in Kansas."}
