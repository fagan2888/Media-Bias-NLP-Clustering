A little "TLC"—and a good chunk of money—went a long way in getting uninsured people to enroll in Obamacare.

Telling uninsured people about subsidies available to them to help buy Obamacare insurance—worth an average of about $3,000 per enrollee—was the biggest single motivator in getting them off the dime to sign up for those plans, the leading Affordable Care Act advocacy group said Wednesday.

Enroll America officials also said that people without health insurance were significantly more likely to sign up if they received repeated contacts urging them to do so, and were offered in-person assistance to actually sign up.

African-Americans and Latinos, who were considered hard-to-reach groups by Obamacare volunteers, in particular were strongly motivated by both repeated "touches" from advocates encouraging them to enroll as well by help offered by in-person navigators and counselors, Enroll America said.

That group announced it had more than 5 million "consumer engagements" since the Obamacare health insurance exchanges launched last October, with the help of 27,000 volunteers and 22,000 outreach events. The group, which spent $7 million on its digital #GetCovered ad campaign, also assembled a list of 635,000 consumers, each of whom had one-on-one conversations with advocates.

Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, said all of that work paid off Tuesday, when President Barack Obama revealed that 7.1 million people had enrolled in insurance via government exchanges by Monday's deadline. That tally actually exceeded official estimates for sign-ups made last summer, before a technologically botched launch essentially crippled enrollment for the first two months.
