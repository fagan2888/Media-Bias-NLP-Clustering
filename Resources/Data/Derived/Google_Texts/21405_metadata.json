Philip M. Breedlove said in Brussels this weekend.\n\nRelated: Russian Ties to Ukraine Go Much Deeper than Gas\n\nBreedlove was speaking at the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Brussels Forum, an annual event that brings together the American and European elite. In recent years, the forum has focused on the European Financial Crisis. But this year, the forum played out like an event from the Cold War; nearly every speaker focused on how to counter Russia.\n\nAndrii Deshchytsia, acting foreign minister of Ukraine, said that the Ukrainian government was willing to engage diplomatically with Russia. \u201cThe Crimea is not lost for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s only through dialogue we can find a solution. We are ready to talk with Russians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Congressman Michael Turner, a member of the U.S. House Armed Service Committee, said that NATO needed to offer membership action plans to other former Soviet bloc states to check Russian aggression. \u201cThose are the types of responses that I think would have Putin looking at a world that's different than he had wanted or intended, but I think certainly it could be an outcome from his consequences.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the collection of great diplomatic and military minds in Brussels, there was little consensus on how to check Russian aggression. The United States and the European Union have put sanctions against some of Russia\u2019s most powerful people in place, but few expect them to influence Putin.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s End Game: Play the Trump Card\n\n\u201cNone of this has done much to shake Russian President Vladimir Putin. One reason is that, by all accounts, the country\u2019s powerbrokers are not yet in the United States\u2019 line of fire. Obama\u2019s executive orders, and yesterday\u2019s designations, have targeted only Russians who have stirred up trouble in Ukraine,\u201d Lee Wolosky, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner and a former member of the National Security Council staff under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, suggested in Foreign Affairs. \u201cThey have not touched the political-economic nexus that helps sustain Putin\u2019s power.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s only one person in Europe who can do anything to change this: German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nGoing After Gas\n\nThere might be only one way to substantially punish Putin - by cutting off gas supplies from Russia to Europe.\n\n\u201cThe reality today is that Russia supplies 31 percent of EU gas imports, 27 percent of crude oil imports, 24 percent of EU coal imports, 30 percent of total EU uranium imports, and is the EU\u2019s third-largest supplier of electricity,\u201d Edward Goldberg, a professor at Baruch College and the New York University Center for Global Affairs, said in a recent interview. \u201cIn turn, the EU is not only easily Russia\u2019s largest trading partner, but it is the market for 88 percent of Russia\u2019s oil exports, 70 percent of its gas exports, and 50 percent of its coal exports.\n\nRelated: Does Putin Want to Carve Up Ukraine and Take the Spoils?\n\nRevenue from these deals supplies 40 percent of Russian budgets.\n\nEurope has long given lip service to the idea of diversification of supply. However, Merkel and her government in Berlin have been reticent to do so. According to Olaf Boehnke, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, this is because the German government tends to base its decisions on pragmatism, not moralism. In other words, it\u2019s not whether an action is morally right or wrong, but whether that action helps advance German interests.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Russian state-controlled energy company Gazprom is building a pipeline that bypasses Eastern Europe and goes directly into Germany; this ensures Germany\u2019s supply security.\n\nMerkel has also proven to be Putin\u2019s closest diplomatic ally. She\u2019s served as an intermediary between Moscow and Washington and has helped to diffuse tension on issues from Syria to Iran.\n\nMerkel\u2019s Evolution\n\nFor some reason, this crisis is different. When Merkel reached out to Putin in early March in an attempt to bridge the gap between the Americans and the Russians, she came away clearly frustrated with Putin, telling President Obama that the Russian president was living \u201cin another world.\u201d\n\nSince then, Merkel has continued to push her one-time ally.\n\n\u201cAnd this will, without doubt, include economic sanctions,\u201d Merkel said last week, when asked what kinds of new punishments Russia would face if it did not back down in Ukraine. \u201cAs long as the political environment for such an important forum as the G8 doesn\u2019t exist, the G8 doesn\u2019t exist either \u2013 neither the summit nor the G8 as such,\u201d she added, referring to a planned G8 meeting scheduled in Russia in June.\n\nHowever, while Merkel\u2019s language might be stronger, she and other European nations have yet to articulate a policy in which they can wean themselves from Russian energy. Without this, Europe is playing with what NYU\u2019s Goldberg called \u201cpaper swords.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has the power to bring Vladimir Putin to his knees.", "title": "The Woman Who Could Bring Putin to His Knees", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/24/Woman-Who-Could-Bring-Putin-His-Knees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03182014_Putin_Merkel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/24/Woman-Who-Could-Bring-Putin-His-Knees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/03182014_Putin_Merkel.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has the power to bring Vladimir Putin to his knees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Putin\u2019s End Game: Play the Trump Card\u201cNone of this has done much to shake Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nGoing After GasThere might be only one way to substantially punish Putin - by cutting off gas supplies from Russia to Europe.\nAndrii Deshchytsia, acting foreign minister of Ukraine, said that the Ukrainian government was willing to engage diplomatically with Russia.\nThe United States and the European Union have put sanctions against some of Russia\u2019s most powerful people in place, but few expect them to influence Putin.\nRelated: Does Putin Want to Carve Up Ukraine and Take the Spoils?"}
