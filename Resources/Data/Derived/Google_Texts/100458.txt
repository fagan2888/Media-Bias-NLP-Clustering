Secretary of State Scott Gessler is one of four Republican candidates running for governor and a chance to unseat Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in November.

We asked the candidates to submit a Father’s Day picture to the Spot.

“Just a few minutes after our daughter Sofia’s birth, I got to hang out with our newborn in the delivery room,” Gessler said. “Right away, she reflexively wrapped her hand around my little finger. And I’ve been wrapped around her little finger ever since!”

Eric was born in January and his proud dad still made it to Hickenlooper’s State of the State speech the next day.
