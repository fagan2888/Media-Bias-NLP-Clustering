DiCaprio then stood behind him, wrapping his arms around Hill and nuzzling his cheek against the SNL host.\n\n\u201cAm I flying, Jack?\u201d Hill asked above the uproariously laughter and cheers of the audience.\n\nWatch the clip below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The Wolf of Wall Street star Jonah Hill hosted Saturday Night Live this week \u2014 but unfortunately for him, everyone wanted to talk about his costar Leonardo DiCaprio.", "title": "[WATCH] Leonardo DiCaprio recreates 'Titanic' scene with Jonah...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/01/Leonardo-DiCaprio-and-Jonah-Hill-on-Saturday-Night-Live-600x334.jpg", "height": 334}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/26/watch-leonardo-dicaprio-recreates-titanic-scene-with-jonah-hill-on-snl/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "titantic", "published_time": "2014-01-26T17:36:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-28T09:48:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAm I flying, Jack?\u201d Hill asked above the uproariously laughter and cheers of the audience.\nHe then asked DiCaprio if they could do the thing they used to do together on set to help the younger actor calm down.\nDiCaprio then stood behind him, wrapping his arms around Hill and nuzzling his cheek against the SNL host.\n\u201cYou were backstage?\u201d Hill asked nervously.\nDuring his opening monologue, Hill kept getting interrupted by audience members who wanted to know what DiCaprio is really like."}
