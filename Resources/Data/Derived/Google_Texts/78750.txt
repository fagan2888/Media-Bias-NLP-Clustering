The Iowa Insurance Division announced Wednesday that health insurance rate increases were approved for Wellmark, Coventry and Gundersen.



The companies asked for approval of the increases earlier this year due to rising costs.

The rate increases vary by plan and take effect on Jan. 1. Wellmark rates will increase an average of 17.6 percent for about 104,000 policyholders.

Wellmark also proposed a rate increase effective Jan. 1, 2016, of an average of 28.7 percent for about 3,000 policyholders.

A rate increase for Coventry Health Care of Iowa was also approved.



Coventry proposed a rate increase average of 17.8 percent initially and later asked for an additional 2 percent to cover new costs. The approved increase of 19.8 percent will take effect on Jan. 1.

The increase impacts about 35,000 to 47,000 Coventry policyholders.

Gundersen Health Plan proposed a rate increase effective Jan. 1 of an average of 9.4 percent for about 60 policyholders. A rate increase of 9.4 percent was approved.
