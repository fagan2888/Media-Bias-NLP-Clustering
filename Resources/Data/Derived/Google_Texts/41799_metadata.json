In a vote of 6-2, Council finally approved the sunset ordinance that would allow the organizers of seven events to halt streetcar service. The ordinance would be active through 2018, the first two years of the streetcar's operation, and would allow organizers of the Flying Pig Marathon, Taste of Cincinnati, the Opening Day Parade, Oktoberfest, the Thanksgiving Day 10k, the Heart Mini Marathon and the Health Expo to give the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority a 90 day heads up to stop the streetcar during their event. Mayor John Cranley said at the meeting yesterday that these longstanding events need time to adjust to the streetcar.\n\n\u2022 Last year, the big election issue for Cincinnati (and the rest of Ohio) was marijuana, oligarchies and a weird mascot named Buddy. This year it looks like it will be education \u2014 preschool, to be specific. Preschool Promise, the group working on a ballot initiative to fund two years of preschool for Cincinnati children, could be battling alongside Cincinnati Public Schools' own levy for a preschool expansion on the ballot. Preschool Promise has yet to specifically say what kind of tax levy it's planning on asking Cincinnatians to approve to fund its ambitious plan. The current options are a hike in the city's property tax or earnings tax, or a countywide sales tax. CPS will ask for a property tax levy. Preschool Promise director Greg Landman says the group is still in negotiations with CPS to figure out how to make sure kids will get their preschool, politics aside. But as the election draws closer, many details have yet to come out.\n\n\u2022 The number of Hamilton County babies who died because of unsafe sleeping conditions doubled in 2015, according to the annual report by nonprofit Cradle Cincinnati. According to its 2015 report, 14 babies died from sleep-related deaths, while just seven did in 2014. Hamilton County struggles with a higher than average infant mortality rate. The county's 2015 infant mortality rate was nine for every 1,000 babies born, while Ohio's was 6.8 and the national average was 5.8, according to the report.\n\n\u2022 Obamacare turned 6 on Wednesday. So, naturally, politicians and health care advocates took to social media megaphone platform known as Twitter to share their still very intense feelings on the issue. Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown praised parts of the law for axing \"pre-existing condition\" clauses and allowing kids to hold on longer to their parents' plans. Sen. Republican Rob Portman, who is running for re-election against for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, tweeted that it's not working and should be repealed. According to Enroll America, 1.3 million Ohioans were uninsured before the federal insurance marketplace started in 2013. Today, that number is 402,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parks Director could face trouble following Smale Park construction probes; preschool set to become big issue for this years local election; Obamacare turns six", "title": "Morning News and Stuff", "og": {"image": "http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/imgs/media.images/13530/to do_smale riverfront park-courtesy cincinnati parks.t2.jpg", "description": "Parks Director could face trouble following Smale Park construction probes; preschool set to become big issue for this years local election; Obamacare turns six", "title": "Morning News and Stuff"}, "revisit-after": "30 days", "msvalidate.01": "A40B96AC91DECC74360A38A60D37967B", "google-site-verification": "YN7Lbd8J9qJaEeGuJxxsrwwWSUY9ZHyth2KhbWjJtXw", "y_key": "bcee7a9e9ae576b2"}, "article_summary": "Preschool Promise has yet to specifically say what kind of tax levy it's planning on asking Cincinnatians to approve to fund its ambitious plan.\nPreschool Promise director Greg Landman says the group is still in negotiations with CPS to figure out how to make sure kids will get their preschool, politics aside.\nCPS will ask for a property tax levy.\nThe current options are a hike in the city's property tax or earnings tax, or a countywide sales tax.\nMayor John Cranley said at the meeting yesterday that these longstanding events need time to adjust to the streetcar."}
