Beloved \u201cindies\u201d wouldn\u2019t be muscled out by the studios (\u201cPhilomena\u201d and \u201cNebraska,\u201d this year), and crowd-pleasing favorites (\u201cGravity\u201d) could gain some respect that critics would rather see lavished on more intellectual films.\n\nRelated: The Worst Movies Starring the 2013 Oscar Nominees\n\nAfter Hollywood box office totals for 2013 actually finished strong, though, the need for an \u201cOscar Bounce\u201d is more about keeping the momentum going rather than saving a dying industry. This year\u2019s 9 Best Picture nominees have grossed a total of $642,105,936 so far (and latecomers \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cPhilomena\u201d have only just started their wide release theatrical runs). Last year\u2019s nine nominees have grossed $1 trillion since their releases.\n\n2014 Best Picture Oscar Nominees Picture Studio U.S. Box Office Gravity Warner Bros. $256,314,185 Captain Phillips Sony/Columbia $105,010,295 American Hustle Sony/Columbia $103,565,129 The Wolf of Wall Street Paramount $80,741,129 12 Years a Slave Fox Searchlight $39,002,295 Philomena Weinstein Company $22,324,543 Dallas Buyers Club Focus Features $16,769,169 Her Warner Bros. $9,900,985 Nebraska Paramount $8,477,367 Total Gross: $642,105,936 Average Gross: $71,345,104\n\nAdditionally, the studios will be hoping, as usual, that the films that are still in the theaters will attract new audiences based on their nominations. It\u2019s conceivable that \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d could double their total gross before the awards presentation on March 2, while smaller films like \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d will be hoping for a second-run spike based on the increased exposure.\n\nThat spike may not continue much after the awards are handed out (as you can see in the chart above from BoxOfficeQuant.com). But the box office totals here don\u2019t factor in the long-tail benefit of an Oscar nomination to secondary market revenue (DVD sales, broadcast and streaming rights) or the long-term value that such a place in the permanent record brings to a film. It\u2019s unlikely that the prestige films of previous decades (\u201cOut of Africa,\u201d \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient\u201d) would be much more than fleeting memories without the distinction that they were once Best Picture winners.\n\nIn the short term, though, the biggest winner is almost always\u2026the winner. While being nominated for the top prize does have a knock-on effect of increasing revenue for the selected films, it pales in comparison to the value of being labeled \u201cBest Picture Winner\u201d:\n\nSo that leaves the big question to be answered when the envelope is opened. Will the winner be \u201cGravity,\u201d the visually stunning crowd-pleaser light on plot and narrative? Will it be the brutal history lesson of \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d? The \u201870s con artists of \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d? Or will one of the dark horses give this a Hollywood plot twist?\n\nNo matter what the answer, the eventual winner is almost certainly guaranteed a bigger prize than a golden statue.\n\nOscars 2014: Complete List of Nominees\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Following a year in which Hollywood profits were actually strong, the need for an \u201cOscar Bounce\u201d is more about keeping the momentum going rather than saving a dying industry.", "title": "Oscars 2014: Hollywood\u2019s Golden Box Office Hopes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/16/Oscars-2014-Hollywood-s-Golden-Box-Office-Hopes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01162013_JLaw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/16/Oscars-2014-Hollywood-s-Golden-Box-Office-Hopes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01162013_JLaw.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Following a year in which Hollywood profits were actually strong, the need for an \u201cOscar Bounce\u201d is more about keeping the momentum going rather than saving a dying industry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe002d\"", "article_summary": "2014 Best Picture Oscar Nominees Picture Studio U.S.\nThis year\u2019s 9 Best Picture nominees have grossed a total of $642,105,936 so far (and latecomers \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cPhilomena\u201d have only just started their wide release theatrical runs).\nNo matter what the answer, the eventual winner is almost certainly guaranteed a bigger prize than a golden statue.\nThe thinking was that by increasing the number of films that could be labeled a \u201cBest Picture Nominee\u201d it would drive more viewership to a wider range of films.\nRelated: The Worst Movies Starring the 2013 Oscar NomineesAfter Hollywood box office totals for 2013 actually finished strong, though, the need for an \u201cOscar Bounce\u201d is more about keeping the momentum going rather than saving a dying industry."}
