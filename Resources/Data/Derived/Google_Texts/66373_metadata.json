Nashville mayoral candidate Bill Freeman's company holds several contracts with the Metro Development and Housing Agency, including one with Lenore Garden Apartments. (Photo: John Partipilo / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nThe Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency paid Freeman Webb, the real estate company co-owned by mayoral candidate Bill Freeman, $300,661 last year, public records show.\n\nThe public agency hired Freeman Webb to manage seven affordable housing developments and has allocated to the company 23 Section 8 vouchers, which the government uses to pay apartment owners to subsidize rent for poor residents.\n\nThe MDHA contracts represent a potential conflict of interest for Freeman if he\u2019s elected mayor. Nashville\u2019s top elected official appoints members to the agency\u2019s board of directors and oversees aspects of the MDHA annual budget.\n\nThe Tennessean reviewed public records with multiple Metro departments to examine how Freeman Webb, which owns and manages apartment buildings, interacts with local government and how Freeman would navigate those potential conflicts if elected mayor. Freeman would face far more potential for conflicts \u2014 and the appearance of conflict \u2014 than any of his six competitors because of his company\u2019s extensive real estate holdings.\n\nIn addition to the MDHA deals, other areas of potential conflicts include, according to public records:\n\n\u2022 Freeman Webb\u2019s nearly three dozen apartments in the city are subject to regular public safety and property standards inspections by Metro Codes, Metro Water Services and the Nashville Fire Department.\n\n\u2022 The company pays stormwater fees for its rental properties and is subject to stormwater regulations.\n\n\u2022 Freeman Webb pursues eviction proceedings by way of the Davidson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nIf elected mayor, Freeman would oversee or recommend budget allocations for each of those departments.\n\nFreeman said he is not running for mayor to enrich himself or his company, which he built after leaving his position as MDHA\u2019s director of development in the late 1970s. In an interview with The Tennessean\u2019s editorial board, Freeman said he would continue to make disclosures regarding his real estate interests and business dealings. He said he would put those investments in a blind trust, though he said he doesn\u2019t have the details for how that arrangement would work.\n\nFreeman, who is regarded as the frontrunner in the mayor\u2019s race based on a series of internal polls released by different campaigns, acknowledged his office would be the subject of scrutiny if he\u2019s elected. Freeman Webb has $1.2 billion in assets and is the largest owner and manager of rental properties in Tennessee. Freeman\u2019s financial disclosures included a $123 million statement of net worth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve disclosed tax returns, I\u2019ve disclosed financial information \u2014 I\u2019m the only candidate to do that,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nHe was the only candidate to release a total net worth statement for a recent story in The Tennessean.\n\n\u201cWe would continue to do disclosures. I would not have any interest in Freeman Webb and what the company does,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would put those assets in a trust \u2014 we haven\u2019t figured all that out yet.\u201d\n\nDick Williams, chairman for nonprofit government transparency watchdog group Common Cause Tennessee, said comprehensive disclosure is the critical component of tracking an elected official\u2019s potential conflicts.\n\nWilliams said that in most elections, a candidate\u2019s business often interacts with the government and that\u2019s why disclosure is so critical. Metro requires its top officials to file business disclosures and the state requires candidates for local office to file similar reports.\n\nWilliams said he didn\u2019t believe Freeman Webb\u2019s MDHA contracts would be problematic for Freeman as mayor, as long as those dealings are disclosed and kept at arm\u2019s length.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it completely shields them from the possibility of malfeasance but it at least is a step to say, \u2018Hey, I know this is a potential problem, but I don\u2019t think I ought to divest myself of things I built up over my career,\u2019\u201d Williams said of politicians who utilize blind trusts. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s an attempt to steer clear of conflicts.\u201d\n\nCompany has array of interests\n\nFreeman Webb has been selected as the best place to work by the Nashville Business Journal and been recognized as the property management company of the year by the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nOn its website, Freeman Webb lists 35 Nashville apartment complexes that it either owns and operates or manages on behalf of another owner.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve got a lot of assets scattered all over the county and everything the city does one way or the other will impact something that I might have an interest in,\u201d Freeman said in the editorial board meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this job or trying to get this job so I can somehow have our properties treated better than they are. We\u2019re delighted with the communities we\u2019re in, with how the economy is going, with how the city is doing.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Mayor Karl Dean worked as the city\u2019s director of law and the elected public defender before he ran for office. Before that, Mayor Bill Purcell had worked as a private practice attorney and served in the state legislature. In the 1990s, Mayor Phil Bredesen had accumulated wealth through his private health care management company Health America, but his business did not have direct dealings with Metro government.\n\nMDHA properties\n\nFreeman Webb was one of six firms in 2012 to bid to manage seven MDHA affordable housing developments. Freeman Webb manages the properties by providing maintenance and collecting rent.\n\nThe company is paid a combined $176,180 per year to manage those properties, according to the most recent records. The manner in which the company is paid varies, either a flat per-unit management fee or a percentage of rent revenue.\n\nFreeman Webb also received Section 8 vouchers \u2014 20 at Lenore Gardens apartments in East Nashville and three at Georgia Courts located west of downtown near 37th Avenue North \u2014 totaling $124,481 in the last fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the MDHA contracts, Freeman Webb is an expert at managing affordable housing, and as a result, competed for and won several contracts with Metro government to manage affordable housing units,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIf having my Freeman Webb holdings and MDHA contracts in a blind trust is not sufficient to alleviate concerns about a conflict of interest, then I will find a way to remove those contracts from my portfolio or take other steps as required.\u201d\n\nLike any apartment complex owner, Freeman Webb relies on city services and is subject to city regulations, especially Metro Codes, the Fire Marshal\u2019s Office, Water Services and stormwater. The Tennessean reviewed records and found the Freeman Webb properties to be in good standing with only rare codes complaints.\n\nThe company also utilizes the sheriff\u2019s office to initiate eviction proceedings. According to sheriff\u2019s office records, deputies have served 2,300 eviction-related warrants at Freeman Webb properties over a 10-year stretch.\n\nThose warrants are served at various phases during eviction proceedings and, because many tenants and landlords settle unpaid rent disputes amicably, the records do not represent the actual number of tenants kicked out of their apartments for unpaid rent.\n\nFreeman also said he expected scrutiny if the city proposes to fix a road near one his company\u2019s properties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll disclose everything \u2014 every interest I have in anything, which I\u2019ve already done,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to look at that, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m doing. If we\u2019re improving a road and I happen to own a property near that, it will be talked about and discussed. Frankly, it will probably be harder to get that road improved than if I don\u2019t own a property.\u201d\n\nCorker and Haslam used blind trusts\n\nPutting assets in a blind trust isn\u2019t uncommon for elected officials across Tennessee and is often used to help alleviate concerns over conflicts.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., put his extensive real estate holdings in a blind trust when he was mayor of Chattanooga. Gov. Bill Haslam put his investments other than his stake in the family owned Pilot Flying J truck stop chain in a blind trust. Haslam disclosed a list of stocks and other investments when he initially ran for governor in 2010, and then placed those investments in a blind trust, which is managed by a third party.\n\nFreeman said Corker is his friend and his idea of \u201ca great mayor.\u201d Corker owned real estate, including offices, in Chattanooga.\n\nFreeman isn\u2019t the only mayoral candidate who will have to confront potential conflicts if elected.\n\nCharles Robert Bone worked as the attorney for the city\u2019s Convention Center Authority. When he began running for mayor, Bone stepped away from that work, but his firm has continued handling the contract. Bone said his firm would give up the convention center contract if he\u2019s elected and would not do any city work while he is in office.\n\nDeborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, said it is important to note that Freeman Webb landed its MDHA contracts before Freeman began running for office.\n\n\u201cFrom an open government standpoint, the disclosure is important for anybody really,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cYou have disclosure requirements because we know these situations exist when people run for office. He has some direct contracts with the government, but he got those before. The question now is (if he wins), what happens after?\u201d\n\nReach Nate Rau at 615-259-8094 and on Twitter @tnnaterau.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1MBATKI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency paid Freeman Webb, the real estate company co-owned by mayoral candidate Bill Freeman, $300,661 last year, public records show.subsidize rent for poor residents.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency paid Freeman Webb, the real estate company co-owned by mayoral candidate Bill Freeman, $300,661 last year, public records show.subsidize rent for poor residents.", "title": "Bill Freeman addresses potential conflicts of interest", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/19/bill-freeman-addresses-potential-conflicts-interest/30379079/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency paid Freeman Webb, the real estate company co-owned by mayoral candidate Bill Freeman, $300,661 last year, public records show.subsidize rent for poor residents.", "title": "Bill Freeman addresses potential conflicts of interest", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aec52e729e30429a4fbd42c74301bf9e35483153/c=824-0-3966-3142&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Pilot Flying J", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Companies/Pilot Flying J", "title": "Bill Freeman addresses potential conflicts of interest", "author": "Nate Rau", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f4705aa3e3bab095ff9d15efe0f02d4193392a40/c=1217-0-3573-3142/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/76e0b8f766d05309548dc0beaabc7acb79acf73f/c=824-0-3966-3142/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57d352bb8fbacc936f322b39c88f49b9b65c5202/c=300-0-4489-3142/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d7c129ecff1c82e662b9901876fda466e892a94/c=0-224-4790-2918&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-19T10:10:42.690000-05:00", "shorthed": "Bill Freeman\u2019s potential conflicts", "articleid": 30379079, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d26b77baa73b4d6357a236cc79b106775dfead9e/c=0-224-4790-2918/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03819e333704d19a70a3bde7ada5c586a4a5f423/c=1512-0-3279-3142/local/-/media/2015/07/19/Nashville/B9318083159Z.1_20150719110245_000_GNNBC1F98.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Bill Freeman, Nashville mayor, Nashville mayor's race, bill freeman conflicts of interest, bill freeman nashville company, conflicts of interest nashville mayor race, freeman webb mdha contracts"}, "article_summary": "The MDHA contracts represent a potential conflict of interest for Freeman if he\u2019s elected mayor.\nIf elected mayor, Freeman would oversee or recommend budget allocations for each of those departments.\nFreeman Webb has $1.2 billion in assets and is the largest owner and manager of rental properties in Tennessee.\nThe Tennessean reviewed records and found the Freeman Webb properties to be in good standing with only rare codes complaints.\nThe Tennessean reviewed public records with multiple Metro departments to examine how Freeman Webb, which owns and manages apartment buildings, interacts with local government and how Freeman would navigate those potential conflicts if elected mayor."}
