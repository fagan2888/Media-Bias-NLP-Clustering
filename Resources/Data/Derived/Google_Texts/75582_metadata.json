[WISN-TV]\n\nAround 1,500 Madison, Wisconsin students ranging from middle school to college left their classes and held a demonstration at the state Capitol on Monday criticizing the fatal police shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson, WISN-TV reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 13-year-old boy. Five more years, I\u2019m 18, and I could be shot by a police officer,\u201d eighth-grader Tavion Wells said. \u201cSo it has to stop somewhere.\u201d\n\nAs ABC News reported, police said Officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson following a confrontation inside an apartment. Kenny allegedly followed Robinson, who was unarmed, into the apartment after responding to reports of a man \u201cyelling and jumping in front of cars.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Madison Capital Times, Police Chief Mike Koval apologized to Robinson\u2019s family while meeting with them separately on Monday night, and promised transparency during the investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe demonstration came on the heels of a march on Saturday to the area where Robinson was shot and killed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fighting for fairness,\u201d one speaker said on a megaphone during the demonstration. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting to be treated equally. It\u2019s still not happening yet.\u201d\n\nThe event was followed by a march to the local city hall, where members of Robinson\u2019s family asked Mayor Paul Soglin (D) if Kenny would be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna have that conversation in the hallway,\u201d Soglin replied.\n\nWISN also reported that Robinson\u2019s family criticized what they saw as an undue focus in media reports on Robinson\u2019s conviction last year on armed robbery charges.\n\n\u201cWe paint him as a human being, a 19-year-old, who made a terrible mistake at one point, which is completely, completely disassociated from this act,\u201d said his uncle, Turin Carter. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s very upsetting is that they try to associate his past with this act to try to paint a picture of the type of kid he was.\u201d\n\nWatch WISN\u2019s report, as aired on Monday, below.\n\n[h/t The Free Thought Project]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Protesters-gathered-at-the-Wisconsin-state-capitol-to-criticize-the-fatal-police-shooting-of-19-year-old-Tony-Robinson-on-March-9-2015.-WISN-TV-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Wisconsin students stage walkout and Capitol protest over Tony Robinson police shooting"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf676\"", "article_summary": "Protesters gathered at the Wisconsin state capitol to criticize the fatal police shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson on March 9, 2015.\n\u201cSo it has to stop somewhere.\u201dAs ABC News reported, police said Officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson following a confrontation inside an apartment.\n[WISN-TV]Around 1,500 Madison, Wisconsin students ranging from middle school to college left their classes and held a demonstration at the state Capitol on Monday criticizing the fatal police shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson, WISN-TV reported.\nWISN also reported that Robinson\u2019s family criticized what they saw as an undue focus in media reports on Robinson\u2019s conviction last year on armed robbery charges.\nThe demonstration came on the heels of a march on Saturday to the area where Robinson was shot and killed."}
