Now, it\u2019s at the center of a different real-world experience: a lawsuit.\n\nThe widow of a toy inventor said Hasbro and another inventor worked together to cut her out of $2 million in royalties and possibly much more from one of the most popular board games in history. The game has sold more than 30 million copies.\n\nLorraine Markham also said her husband, Bill Markham, has been denied his legacy of creating the game after the other man, Reuben Klamer, took full credit for it.\n\nMarkham is seeking a declaration from the U.S. District Court in Providence that her husband was the sole creator of the game and that the company he left her owns the game outright.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed last month, also seeks a complete accounting from Hasbro on what is owed.\n\nKlamer countersued Thursday, saying he is the sole creator and that Markham\u2019s widow has no right to any royalties.
