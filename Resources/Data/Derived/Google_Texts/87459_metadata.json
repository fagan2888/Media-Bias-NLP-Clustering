Asher's foot was pinned against the rocks by their damaged canoe. It took around six hours for authorities to reach and free Asher in the remote wilderness area.\n\n\n\nThe youth and his canoe-mates said in television interviews Friday that they kept praying for a miracle.\n\n\n\nAsher is now recovering at home in Rochester. His foot is swollen but expected to heal.
