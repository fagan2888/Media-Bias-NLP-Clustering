In what was a two-part interview, Dimon also touched on the 33rd annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThe more that employment is growing and companies are growing, you know, rates going up would be OK,\u201d Dimon said of the inevitable interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve expected in mid-2015. \u201cIt\u2019ll be volatile, it\u2019ll be a little scary, but it\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nDimon, speaking from the 33rd annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, said that rates will be increased above near-zero once \u201cthe fundamental economy is growing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the fed has been very clear that that\u2019s the only time they\u2019re going to raise rates,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to raise them if things are not going well. So, I take them at their word for that.\u201d\n\nAt the conference, more than 400 healthcare companies, most of whom stand to profit from their special deals in ObamaCare, are expected to make presentations this week in San Francisco. In fact, those personal crony relationships have already paid dividends. Dimon said the event started with 30 companies, which had a combined market value of $2 billion. However, now, companies in attendance at the conference are valued at a combined $4.6 trillion.\n\nDimon has established a personal affinity toward the sector. He was diagnosed with throat cancer last summer, but testing completed in December concluded he was now free of cancer, but he said he will be monitored for the next three years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually doing fine. I never stopped working, but I\u2019m mostly back to full health, back to working full time,\u201d he told Bartiromo. He said his health is \u201cas good as can be.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the health care industry boomed, enjoying its best year ever regarding mergers and acquisitions. The head of the nation\u2019s largest bank says he believes 2015 could be even better.\n\nDimon offered a relatively rosy picture of the U.S. economy, claiming that our greatest challenge comes from overseas markets weighing down international demand for domestic goods and services. However, Dimon\u2019s interpretation unsurprsingly ignored nil wage growth for the average American worker and real-world rising costs for food, shelter and healthcare.\n\nHe also claimed an allegedly \u201cbalanced\u201d housing market, despite long-term data trends showing quite the contrary. Recent reports on home sales, existing home sales and housing prices, all have shown the sector struggling to meet limited expectations. That\u2019s particularly concerning considering the amount of increase government intervention and risk is quietly working in the market.\n\nThe National Mortgage Risk Index (NMRI) for Agency purchase loans rose in November to 11.69 percent, up from the average of 11.29 percent for the prior three months (revised). The risk indices for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA, and the VA all hit series highs in November.\n\n\u201cThe increase in risk for all the major government agencies over the past two years is cause for concern,\u201d said Stephen Oliner, co-director of AEI\u2019s International Center on Housing Risk. \u201cThis is especially true for FHA loans, which would experience a tidal wave of defaults if we have another severe financial crisis.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that even the great Jamie Dimon is cheerleading the new normal.\n\n\u201cAmerica looks pretty damn good,\u201d Dimon said, claiming that \u201cnormalization is a good thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "In an interview Tuesday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon spoke with Maria Bartiromo on \u2018Opening Bell\u2019 to discuss his throat cancer diagnosis and the U.S. economy.", "title": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Gives Bartiromo Take On Economy, Cancer Battle", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/JP-Morgan-Chase-CEO-Jamie-Dimon.jpg", "height": 354}, "updated_time": "2015-01-13T11:54:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/economy/2015/01/13/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-gives-bartiromo-take-on-economy-cancer-battle/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an interview Tuesday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon spoke with Maria Bartiromo on \u2018Opening Bell\u2019 to discuss his throat cancer diagnosis and the U.S. economy.", "title": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Gives Bartiromo Take On Economy, Cancer Battle | People's Pundit Daily", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/JP-Morgan-Chase-CEO-Jamie-Dimon.jpg", "creator": "@PPDNews", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/economy/2015/01/13/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-gives-bartiromo-take-on-economy-cancer-battle/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/21481", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/21481", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "robots": "noodp", "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Economy", "tag": "JP Morgan Chase", "published_time": "2015-01-13T10:30:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T11:54:35-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "In an interview Tuesday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon spoke with Maria Bartiromo on \u2018Opening Bell\u2019 to discuss his throat cancer diagnosis and the U.S. economy."}, "article_summary": "In what was a two-part interview, Dimon also touched on the 33rd annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.comIn an exclusive interview Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon spoke with Maria Bartiromo on \u2018Opening Bell\u2019 to discuss his throat cancer diagnosis and the U.S. economy.\n\u201cThe increase in risk for all the major government agencies over the past two years is cause for concern,\u201d said Stephen Oliner, co-director of AEI\u2019s International Center on Housing Risk.\nI never stopped working, but I\u2019m mostly back to full health, back to working full time,\u201d he told Bartiromo.\n\u201cThe more that employment is growing and companies are growing, you know, rates going up would be OK,\u201d Dimon said of the inevitable interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve expected in mid-2015."}
