Those three are above and beyond the four abuses of dominance that the EU already has found. In turn, those four were more abuses of dominance than the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found in its earlier investigation.\n\nCanadian authorities allege Google is abusing its dominance by raising advertiser prices via forcing participation in Enhanced Campaigns, by foreclosing competition via exclusive Android deals, and by abusing YouTube\u2019s dominance to foreclose other mobile platforms.\n\nIn addition to the EU\u2019s four alleged search-related abuses of dominance, the EU has issued a Statement of Objections that Google-Motorola has misused mobile-phone standards-essential patents.\n\nMoreover, the EU is investigating Google-Android\u2019s anti-competitive behavior, and European publishers are charging that Google\u2019s search behavior is anti-competitive towards European media.\n\nGoogle\u2019s dominance is also not going away; it is proliferating at an accelerating rate. Google reached a billion users via searches in 13 years, Google Maps in 9 years, YouTube in 8 years, and Android in 5 years. Google+ will likely reach a billion users in an estimated 4 years.\n\nGoogle\u2019s rapidly spreading dominance and allegations of dominance abuse make it by far the largest, broadest, fastest-spreading, and potentially most harmful dominant firm in EU history. Never before has one company had more power to dictate what people find online, the value of Internet content, and which online businesses prosper or fail.\n\nGoogle\u2019s EU privacy and data protection abuses are also growing.\n\nMultiple EU nations objected to Google\u2019s secret Street View eavesdropping on private home WiFi signals. Many currently are fining, or preparing to fine Google for its privacy policy changes that flout EU data protection law.\n\nConcerning abuses of other EU laws, EU nations have found Google to be among the most aggressive companies in the world at evading EU taxes. And Google has earned more copyright and patent property infringement charges than any company in the world.\n\nSimply put, there is no other company that the EU has more law enforcement problems with than Google.\n\nIn that well-known context, it is astounding that the EU is even entertaining a Google-proposed absolution settlement that would require the EU to \u201cconfirm there are no grounds for further action.\u201d\n\nIf approved, the settlement would make many extraordinary unwarranted concessions to Google.\n\nThe EU would allow Google to continue illegally diverting traffic and preferring Google content.\n\nThe EU would absolve Google of any wrongdoing for abusing its dominance in four ways.\n\nThe EU would not conclude Google\u2019s greater-than 90 percent share is dominance even though the EU\u2019s standard dominance threshold for other companies is 39.7 percent.\n\nThe EU would exempt Google from any fine and the standard EU legal obligations of dominant firms, i.e., \u201cA special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market.\u201d\n\nThe EU would even permit Google to continue to extend its dominance into other markets without limit.\n\nIn sum, the EU\u2019s continued interest in settling with Google generates many more questions than it answers.\n\nWhy would the EU lean towards the most lenient process and treatment for the most dominant, and potentially the most abusive dominant, company the EU has ever investigated?\n\nWhy would the EU consider minimizing and not maximizing its law enforcement authority and deterrence when it knows the Google dominance abuse problem is not going away, but actually is spreading and getting much worse?\n\nHow would Google have much incentive to fully comply with the proposed settlement if the EU agrees to shut down its current investigations before, and not after, Google has fully complied with the proposed settlement?\n\nHow would a settlement deter future Google abuses of dominance when the proposed settlement does not conclude Google\u2019s 90 percent share is dominant; include an admission of, or responsibility for, wrongdoing, or preclude future illegal abuses?\n\nWhat part of Google\u2019s first two settlement proposals\u2019 delays, deceit, and deficiencies, inspire EU confidence that Google would promptly and fully comply with its proposed settlement?\n\nIn short, why isn\u2019t the European Commission prosecuting Google?\n\n[First published at the Daily Caller.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/the-european-commissions-google-antitrust-problems-are-not-going-away/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/google-spy.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The European Commission\u2019s Google Antitrust Problems Are Not Going Away"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Google\u2019s dominance is also not going away; it is proliferating at an accelerating rate.\nMoreover, the EU is investigating Google-Android\u2019s anti-competitive behavior, and European publishers are charging that Google\u2019s search behavior is anti-competitive towards European media.\nHow would Google have much incentive to fully comply with the proposed settlement if the EU agrees to shut down its current investigations before, and not after, Google has fully complied with the proposed settlement?\nWhy are European Commission antitrust authorities bending over backwards to settle with Google?\nWhat part of Google\u2019s first two settlement proposals\u2019 delays, deceit, and deficiencies, inspire EU confidence that Google would promptly and fully comply with its proposed settlement?"}
