On Dec. 30, 2014, the SEC approved a proposed rule change pursuant to which FINRA included in the New Rule a new background check obligation for member firms. The added obligation requires member firms to establish and implement written procedures to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the registered representative\u2019s initial or transfer Form U4 within 30 days after the Form U4 is filed. Those procedures must provide that the member firm, or a third-party service provider on behalf of the member firm, at least conduct a national search of reasonably available public records for the purpose of achieving that verification.\n\nIn addition to imposing this requirement, sub-paragraph (e) of the New Rule: (i) clarifies that the initial background investigation (including checking information concerning a proposed registered representative) shall be conducted before the member firm applies to register the proposed representative, (ii) clarifies that the acquiring firm within sixty days of the filing of the Form U4 must review the candidate\u2019s Form U5 (or other termination filings) if the proposed individual has previously been registered, (iii) makes other updating and conforming changes and (iv) adds Supplementary Material .15 to FINRA Rule 3110 establishing a temporary program to refund Late Disclosure Fees (subject to certain conditions). (The sixty-day period to check prior Form U5 filings allows for the right of the candidate\u2019s previous firm to take up to thirty days to make the U5 filing.)\n\nThe amendment to the New Rule becomes effective July 1, 2015. FINRA member firms must now begin to amend their written supervisory procedures to specifically address their new background check obligations and begin discussing with vendors how background searches will be effected and documented to be New Rule compliant", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Dec. 30, 2014, the SEC approved a proposed rule change pursuant to which FINRA included in the New Rule a new background check obligation for member firms.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Earlier in 2014, the SEC incorporated old NASD Rule 3010 (the &amp;ldquo;Prior Rule&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; related to employee supervision &amp;ndash; into The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rules as FINRA", "title": "New Background Check Obligations for Securities Broker-Dealers Are Coming Soon", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-background-check-obligations-securities-broker-dealers-are-coming-soon", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/whistle%20businessman.jpg?itok=XpXP6YA8", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "legal, business, government, labor, employment, SEC, FINRA Rule 3110, background check, NASD", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, labor, employment, SEC, FINRA Rule 3110, background check, NASD"}, "article_summary": "Those procedures must provide that the member firm, or a third-party service provider on behalf of the member firm, at least conduct a national search of reasonably available public records for the purpose of achieving that verification.\nOn Dec. 30, 2014, the SEC approved a proposed rule change pursuant to which FINRA included in the New Rule a new background check obligation for member firms.\nSunday, January 25, 2015Earlier in 2014, the SEC incorporated old NASD Rule 3010 (the \u201cPrior Rule\u201d) \u2013 related to employee supervision \u2013 into The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rules as FINRA Rule 3110 (the \u201cNew Rule\u201d).\nFINRA member firms must now begin to amend their written supervisory procedures to specifically address their new background check obligations and begin discussing with vendors how background searches will be effected and documented to be New Rule compliant\n(The sixty-day period to check prior Form U5 filings allows for the right of the candidate\u2019s previous firm to take up to thirty days to make the U5 filing.)"}
