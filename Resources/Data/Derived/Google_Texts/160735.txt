This is a man-made disaster. Southern California is an arid part of the world where droughts -- even severe droughts -- are commonplace, and knowing this, you'd think the government of California would have included this mathematical certainty in its disaster preparedness planning, but the government has done nothing, not even store rain, as the population has continued to grow.

Droughts are nothing new in California, but right now, 70 percent of California's rainfall washes out to sea because liberals have prevented the construction of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system over decades, during a period in which California's population has doubled. This is the classic case of liberals being willing to sacrifice other people's lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology.

The environmental groups did not expect to run everyone out of water, but they got greedy, shut down the whole system, and ran the whole damned state dry.
