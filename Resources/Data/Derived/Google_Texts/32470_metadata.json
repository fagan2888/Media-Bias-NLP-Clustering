Ojikutu, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Senior Advisor at JSI, and asked her to offer her reflections on some of the key ideas she\u2019s heard at the conference.\n\nAmong the highlights for Dr. Ojikutu was the presentation given by Ambassador Mark Dybul, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, who spoke about the need to focus HIV prevention efforts on the most at-risk populations, a theme that has resonated throughout the conference. As Dr. Ojikutu related, Ambassador Dybal emphasized the importance of making better, smarter investments in order to reach those who are most at risk.
