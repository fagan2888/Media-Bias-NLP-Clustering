A spokesperson says a live grenade was found among donated items at a Goodwill store in Winfield.

Processors at the store at 1908 E. 9th Avenue discovered the grenade as they went through items that were part of a large donation, NewsCow reports. Workers evacuated the store and called police.

The store remained closed for about four hours, until bomb squad personnel from Sedgwick County could arrive and remove the device. The grenade was determined to be live with explosive material inside of it.

It was safely removed, detonated and disposed of.

Goodwill does not track its donations and therefore the origins of the donation are not known, NewsCow reports. Goodwill says anyone making a donation should make arrangements with law enforcement to dispose of any item that appears to be ammunition.
