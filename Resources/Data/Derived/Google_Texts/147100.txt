Always eager to do a “solid” for President Obama, MSNBC decided to show the public how easy it is to sign up for Obamacare on Tuesday, the first day health care exchanges were available to the public.

MSNBC’s Mara Schiavocampo tried to demonstrate the sign-up process live on the air Tuesday, but runs into technical difficulties again and again.

After trying to use an online chat — “that didn’t go anywhere” — and calling the helpline twice, only to be put on hold for over 30 minutes, she called it a day.

“If I were signing up for myself, this is where my patience would be exhausted,” Schiavocampo said.

Talk about embarrassing.

Right on cue, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted: “Today is what #ACA is all about.” The irony being that the House Minority Leader had no idea just how true her comment was.
