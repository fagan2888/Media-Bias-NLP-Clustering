While Americans across the country are struggling to sign up for ObamaCare due to problems with the federal health care website, at least one enrollee has successfully gotten covered through a state-run exchange: a Colorado man\u2019s 14-year-old Yorkie.\n\nFort Collins resident Shane Smith told KDVR he received a letter last week informing his dog,Baxter, that a health insurance account had been opened for the pup through Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nSmith told the station he had to sign up for coverage through the state exchange because his health insurance plan was cancelled under ObamaCare. He isn\u2019t sure how Baxter wound up getting enrolled instead, but he said he did give Baxter\u2019s name as a security question as part of the registration process.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty funny. Typical ObamaCare, that they would insure your dog by mistake,\u201d Smith told KDVR.\n\nSmith said when he called Connect for Health Colorado they fixed the problem, but he is still wary of ObamaCare due to all the issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of headaches that\u2019s come from all of this,\u201d Smith told KDVR. \u201cAll the phone calls. All the nonsense. They ended up giving me good coverage I think, but who knows if they\u2019re going to take it away,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cAs long as Baxter\u2019s covered, that\u2019s all the counts,\u201d he joked.\n\nColorado runs its own health insurance exchange that is separate from the problem-plagued website Healthcare.gov, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Services. A Connect for Health Colorado spokesman told KDVR its system would never make up a name when generating a letter, but it works quickly to resolve the situation when mistakes are made.\n\nClick for more from KDVR.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Federal Relations", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:27:40 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Fort Collins resident Shane Smith tells KDVR he received a letter last week informing his 14-year-old Yorkie, Baxter, that a health insurance account had been opened for the pup through Connect for Health Colorado.", "twitter": {"description": "Fort Collins resident Shane Smith tells KDVR he received a letter last week informing his 14-year-old Yorkie, Baxter, that a health insurance account had been opened for the pup through Connect for Health Colorado.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/21/colorado-man-informed-his-dog-has-successfully-signed-up-for-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_otr_baxter_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Colo. man informed his dog has successfully signed up for ObamaCare", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Federal Relations\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Colo. man informed his dog has successfully signed up for ObamaCare\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_otr_baxter_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-21T11:30:50Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/21/colorado-man-informed-his-dog-has-successfully-signed-up-for-obamacare.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"a1a5a05f-8069-41ca-a579-bbbaa24b6438\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Fort Collins resident Shane Smith tells KDVR he received a letter last week informing his 14-year-old Yorkie, Baxter, that a health insurance account had been opened for the pup through Connect for Health Colorado.", "dc.identifier": "a1a5a05f-8069-41ca-a579-bbbaa24b6438", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "federal", "description": "Fort Collins resident Shane Smith tells KDVR he received a letter last week informing his 14-year-old Yorkie, Baxter, that a health insurance account had been opened for the pup through Connect for Health Colorado.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Colo.
