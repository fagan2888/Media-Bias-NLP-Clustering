It\u2019s an interesting question and one worth pondering as the 2016 Presidential campaigns kick off. Available data reveals that donors not only have disproportionate influence over politics, but that influence is wielded largely to keep issues that would benefit the working and middle classes off of the table.\n\nDo donors really rule the world? Recent research suggests that indeed they do. Three political scientists recently discovered that a 1 percent increase in donor support for a policy leads to a 1 percent increase in the probability the president supports the policy, if the president and donor are in the same party. On the other hand, they find no similar effect from general public opinion on presidential policies. In another study, Brian Schaffner and Jesse Rhodes find, \u201cthe roll call voting of members of Congress may be more strongly associated with the views of their donors (including outside donors) than with those of their voting constituents.\u201d So who are these donors?\n\nFirst off, donors are rich. Michael Barber performed a survey of about 2,870 donors who gave more than $200 in the 2012 election. The chart below shows the distributions of income and wealth, and donors are far richer. Fewer than 3 percent of donors reported an annual family income of less than $50,000 and more than 30 percent had an income greater than $350,000.\n\nDonors are also whiter than the general public. Research suggests that 90 percent of federal contributions greater than $200 in the 2012 general election came from majority white neighborhoods. A study of the 2009 New York City municipal election finds that, at the highest levels of giving, the donor pool is least diverse. A study of Seattle\u2019s 2013 election suggests that more than a quarter of contributions came from 391 contributors (0.07 percent of the population) who gave $1,000 or more. The research also shows that while Seattle is 67 percent non-Hispanic white, the neighborhoods from which more than half of contributions came from were 80 percent white. Other research suggests that donors are also disproportionately male.\n\nDonors are also more conservative than the general public. There are two ways to show this. First, we can examine the preferences of the hyper-rich who make up the vast majority of donors. Benjamin Page, Larry Bartels and Jason Seawright interviewed some of these individuals, who make up the richest 1 percent of the population. Within their sample, 21 percent had helped bundle for candidates, and 68 percent had contributed money to candidates (an average of $4,633 over the 12 months before the survey). As the charts below show, these donors are more likely to oppose government ensuring that all Americans have healthcare coverage. In addition, while majorities of the general public favor national health insurance and are willing to pay more in taxes to provide health coverage to everyone, majorities of the wealthy disagree.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research shows that the rich live in an alternate universe from the rest of us, and bend policy to their will", "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s twisted games: How they\u2019re distorting reality and diluting democracy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research shows that the rich live in an alternate universe from the rest of us, and bend policy to their will", "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s twisted games: How they\u2019re distorting reality and diluting democracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/the_1_percents_twisted_games_how_theyre_distorting_reality_and_diluting_democracy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/koch_bloomberg_candyland.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research shows that the rich live in an alternate universe from the rest of us, and bend policy to their will", "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s twisted games: How they\u2019re distorting reality and diluting democracy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/koch_bloomberg_candyland.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Campaign Finance, Conservatives, Economics, Research, The 1 Percent, The Economic", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc29b\"", "article_summary": "On the other hand, they find no similar effect from general public opinion on presidential policies.\nResearch suggests that 90 percent of federal contributions greater than $200 in the 2012 general election came from majority white neighborhoods.\nRecent research suggests that indeed they do.\nIn addition, while majorities of the general public favor national health insurance and are willing to pay more in taxes to provide health coverage to everyone, majorities of the wealthy disagree.\nOther research suggests that donors are also disproportionately male."}
