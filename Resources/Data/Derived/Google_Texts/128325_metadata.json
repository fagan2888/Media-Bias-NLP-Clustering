It\u2019s not your partner\u2019s snoring. And it\u2019s not the noisy neighbors. That would be too easy.\n\nThere are at least five reasons you toss and turn, wake up in a sweat in the middle of the night, or otherwise pop an Ambien before you call your mother. You know you\u2019ve had some of these fleeting, if not active thoughts in that twilight before you doze off.\n\nWe\u2019re all going to die of Ebola! Come on guys, the CDC has promised us that we have nothing to worry about. They\u2019ve dismissed suggestions that Ebola could gain a foothold in the U.S. even though it\u2019s killed over 5,000 people in Africa this year. After all, our borders are completely secure, our airports are like a vault in a few big city terminals, and infected people would never take a plane to, say, Toronto and then hop a train to New York. So relax! Go bowling \u2014 hop on a subway and don\u2019t worry about a pandemic wiping out a huge portion of the population.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t sleep\u2026Cancel your trip to Disneyworld so you\u2019re not locked in to a pressurized cabin with recirculated air at 35,000 feet with a bunch of strangers. And bring an extra pack of disposable Purell wipes.\n\nRelated: How to Protect Yourself from Ebola\n\n2. I\u2019m going to be killed by a terrorist! That would be true if you were Bashar Assad. Or if you were a Shiite, a Jew, or an American living in Iraq or Syria and trying to infiltrate ISIS to give intelligence to the CIA. But an American having lunch at Subway or standing in line at Chipotle is not a likely target. On the other hand, if you happen to see a lone wolf on the subway, and think to yourself, \u201cMy, what big teeth you have,\u201d get off at the next stop and call the FBI or better yet, call the ASPCA.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t sleep\u2026.\n\na. Join the \u201cFear Itself\u201d support group\u2014there are thousands in the U.S., and find a buddy who\u2019s more paranoid than you are.\n\nb. Do NOT Google \u201cISIS/graphics.\u201d You may never have a sound sleep again.\n\nc. Stop blogging about how much you want to boil every terrorist in oil or cover them with fire ants until their flesh is eaten. What goes around comes around!\n\nRelated: The Merger of ISIS and al-Qaeda Could Cripple the Civilized World\n\n3. I can\u2019t plan for the future since global warming will destroy the planet. You\u2019re right\u2014global warming could destroy the planet if people like you stop planning for the future! The best way to get over this fear is to confront it by doing something about it. Also, unless a ginormous asteroid hits the earth and throws us off our axis, chances are it will take a century or so for New York or L.A. to become Atlantis. So feed your 401(k), separate your garbage, and decrease your carbon footprint.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t sleep\u2026.\n\na. Join the Sierra Club or the National Resources Defense Council to commiserate with like-minded climate advocates.\n\nb. Move to Europe and join the Green Party.\n\nc. Go to Burning Man this year.\n\nRelated: Record Level of Greenhouse Gases Threaten Global Economy\n\n4. I\u2019m afraid my identity will be stolen\u2014and with it all my money. OK. Here\u2019s what you can definitely count on: Plan on being hacked multiple times\u2014email, social networks, credit cards at Home Depot, etc., but the hackers don\u2019t necessarily get past the firewall and into servers where the passwords are kept. That\u2019s really hard to do. You can still have your signature ripped off just by sending a check to pay a bill and having some clerk digitally reproduce the checking account and the signature, and then making out a payment to herself.\n\nSo yes, you\u2019re vulnerable no matter how you handle your money. The good news\u2014double verification for email, passwords, and other digital access is becoming ubiquitous. Credit card RFID chips (like the ones used in Europe) are also being implemented. Some don\u2019t fit in the \u201cswipe\u201d machines because the cards are thicker, so you\u2019ll save money\u2014even if you don\u2019t want to. Businesses and banks are taking more precautions to protect customers and themselves from cyber parasites, too.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t sleep\u2026.\n\na. Remember what it was like to stand on line at the bank to wait for a teller to deposit your paycheck.\n\nb. Think back to holiday shopping at only brick and mortar stores and never buying online from Amazon with free shipping.\n\nc. As an exercise, try booking a trip with a live travel agent. See how much time it takes.\n\nRelated: Runaway Identity Theft\u2014Could You Be Next?\n\n5. I\u2019ll never be able to pay off my student loan. We all used to say that. We have grandchildren, we\u2019re retired, and we\u2019re still paying off our student loans. Think of it this way--student loans were designed to keep you young. Like an expensive spa treatment, student loans make you look and feel young by taking you back to your salad days. The days of total abandon\u2014of drinking, partying, taking courses like \u201cWasting Time on the Internet\u201d at Penn, and paying over $40,000 a year for a degree in the humanities that could get you a good job as a barista at Starbucks--will be with you forever, along with your student loan. So embrace it!\n\nRelated: How to Really Fix Our Student Debt Crisis\n\nOn your 50th birthday, when AARP asks you to join the senior set, throw a \u201cHelp Me Pay Off My Student Loan\u201d party. Better yet, start a new site called \"KICKENDER,\" a new crowdsourcing platform for loans that exceed three decades.\n\n\n\nIf you still can\u2019t sleep\u2026. That\u2019s ok. Who has time to sleep anyway when you need to work around the clock so you can pay the bills?\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not your mattress.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your partner\u2019s snoring.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why You Can\u2019t Get a Good Night\u2019s Sleep", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/02/Here-s-Why-You-Can-t-Get-Good-Night-s-Sleep", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/iStock_000008787363Large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/02/Here-s-Why-You-Can-t-Get-Good-Night-s-Sleep", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/iStock_000008787363Large.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s not your mattress.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your partner\u2019s snoring.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "We have grandchildren, we\u2019re retired, and we\u2019re still paying off our student loans.\nLike an expensive spa treatment, student loans make you look and feel young by taking you back to your salad days.\nGo bowling \u2014 hop on a subway and don\u2019t worry about a pandemic wiping out a huge portion of the population.\nThat\u2019s ok.
