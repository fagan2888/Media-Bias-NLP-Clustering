Two caravans bearing young professionals in white coats roll up to the parking lot. Once inside, they loop stethoscopes around their necks, shuffle color-coded forms around the front desk, and smooth out paper bed covers on mattresses. One of them swings a sign stamped with the words \u201cClinic Open\u201d toward the front door. In the cramped back room, a senior medical student is giving a crash course to a second-year on the essentials of heart pharmacology. \u201cWhat do statins do?\u201d the senior student asks, pointing to a small square of text on a patient\u2019s intake form. The younger student pauses, sifting mentally through facts learned by rote memorization from textbooks and lectures. \u201cThey lower cholesterol,\u201d she says, hesitating. \u201cI think I remember that from cardiology.\u201d \u201cIf your comparator is an ideal situation, no, I don\u2019t think from a clinical point of view that a student-run free clinic is as good as \u2026 as an ideal.\" This is the University of Michigan Student-Run Free Clinic, a satellite medical operation that provides primary and preventive health services to uninsured patients in a low-income area of southeast Michigan. A student-run clinic is similar to a standard clinic in that it provides basic tests like urinalysis, bloodwork, and mammography free of charge, except it is almost completely staffed, operated, and led by medical students. \u201cI think this is where they teach medical students to be late,\u201d Ron, a grizzled convenience store clerk, cheerfully jokes to me in the waiting room. He spent months on the waiting list of another free clinic before the staffers there referred him to an alternative, student-run option. This is his second visit to the University of Michigan clinic, and so far he has no complaints about the quality of care he\u2019s been receiving.\n\nWhile interviewing for medical schools last fall, I observed a strange phenomenon: every institution I encountered would underscore its student-run free clinic as a major highlight of the medical education they could offer. First- and second-year students would speak rapturously about the experience they gained from clinic. Working there, they said, reminded them of why they wanted to become doctors in the first place. \u201cI feel like medical school can be really about yourself\u2014how much I can learn, how much I can do,\u201d says Chelsea Reighard, one of the student directors at the University of Michigan Student-Run Free Health Clinic. \u201cI really wanted to serve people and work with them to improve their health.\u201d The \u201cstudent-run\u201d modifier is not overstated. With the exceptions of official diagnoses and prescription signing, medical students are responsible for everything that goes on in clinic. They schedule patient appointments, take comprehensive health histories, and conduct physical examinations. Though M.D.-bearing physicians lurk in the background overseeing clinical decisions and assuaging liability concerns, the initiative remains a primarily autonomous affair. Free clinics are by no means a novelty on the medical landscape, tracing their roots to the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic movement of the 1960s. But historically, many of them have depended on religious institutions for funding and support. Then, in 1989, a group of first-year medical students in the UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program began providing free blood draws and screenings to the uninsured individuals who frequented a homeless drop-in center, and the free clinic model seriously began considering medical students as potential staffers. Today, the majority of all U.S. medical schools have at least one student-run free clinic under their auspices. Some, such as the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have up to four. The proliferation of these clinics can partially be attributed to a growing desire among the medical community to provide care to those who lack health insurance. Though the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is projected to extend healthcare coverage to 32 million more U.S. residents starting January 1 of next year, this still leaves about 30 million individuals uninsured and unable to pay for health services. What has increasingly begun to emerge is a healthcare \u201csafety net,\u201d a complex web of hospitals and community health centers that provide low-cost medical services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay.

A student approached Wozniak\u2019s desk after class and asked Wozniak to look at her tooth. Before Wozniak could respond, the student pried back her jaw to reveal a large crevice in the back of her mouth. Her tooth had completely rotted away.The student had apparently never been to the dentist in her life.\n\nProponents see the student-run free clinic as playing a small but vital role in the healthcare safety net. The clinic can help uninsured patients, many of whom suffer from complicated chronic diseases, secure care they otherwise would not be able to afford. And because a medical school affiliation gives student-run clinics a steady source of funding and supplies student volunteers eager to work, the student-run model may be more sustainable than its nonprofit counterpart. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without this place,\u201d Ron says to me before he is whisked away for his appointment. He\u2019s waited close to an hour for these doctors-to-be to see him, but feels it\u2019s a small price to pay for the time and attention he\u2019ll be receiving for his healthcare needs. Lately, \u201chealth disparities\u201d have become the in-word among the medical community, defined as gaps in quality of healthcare among racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups. Though measurements like infant mortality and lifespan have improved across the nation as a whole, the medical community has increasingly begun to identify minority groups that bear a disproportionately greater burden of preventable disease, death, and disabilities compared to the rest of the population. African Americans, for example, have an elevated likelihood of developing diabetes or hypertension that cannot be exclusively explained by their genetic makeup. Health experts believe that the reasons for these health differences lie within the medical system itself, whether it\u2019s because factors in these patients\u2019 lives prevent them from getting regular medical attention or because physicians are not asking the right questions during visits. People interested in eliminating health disparities do not just focus on diagnosing diseases and prescribing medications, opting to take more creative approaches to healthcare. For instance, the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA is funding bus ticket vouchers to make sure patients do not miss appointments, while the Joy Southfield Clinic in Detroit is sponsoring community gardens to promote healthy eating habits.\n\nA large part of the explosion of the student-run free clinic is attributable to this push to address health disparities. The thinking goes that if students are exposed to health disparities early in their training, they will be motivated to tackle those disparities on a deeper level in the future. A key feature of sustaining student interest in health disparities is letting them take charge of their own initiatives, says Dr. Brent Williams, associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. To Williams, true commitment to these issues can only be achieved if students take ownership of their projects, learning not just by observing, but by doing. As a result, the young volunteers in a student-run free clinic are allotted much more freedom than if they had been working at a standard, physician-operated clinic. \u201cOur job is to help eliminate barriers and let the students manage and really own it,\u201d says Williams, who also serves as an advisory board member of the University of Michigan Medical School Student-Run Free Clinic. \u201cIf you sit around at the advisory meetings, you\u2019ll see the dynamic constantly, as to what can we do to be sure that the students maintain genuine ownership, accountability, responsibility of the operations.\u201d Shannon Cramm, another student director at the Michigan clinic, agrees with the medical school\u2019s philosophy toward maintaining student ownership. \u201cIf you just get told to do something, it becomes something you have to do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when we\u2019re in charge of the clinic as a leadership group, it means that I will put in the extra hours because this is my big idea and I am excited about helping our patients in this way.\u201d For many of these volunteers, the student-run clinic marks the first time they ever conduct a physical examination on a real patient. Yet the \u201cstudent-led, student run\u201d philosophy has drawn ire from some individuals who are invested long-term in alleviating health disparities. The idea that students, not M.D.-holding physicians, are chiefly responsible for a patient\u2019s healthcare might compromise the care the patient ultimately receives, says Dr. David Buchanan, chief clinical officer of Erie Family Health Center and associate professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though some feel they compromise quality, student-run clinics are an option to provide care for the uninsured.", "author": "Jennifer Xu", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Though some feel they compromise quality, student-run clinics are an option to provide care for the uninsured.", "title": "Letting Medical Students Run the Clinic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/whitecoat_banner/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/letting-medical-students-run-the-clinic/281241/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf648\"", "article_summary": "Then, in 1989, a group of first-year medical students in the UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program began providing free blood draws and screenings to the uninsured individuals who frequented a homeless drop-in center, and the free clinic model seriously began considering medical students as potential staffers.\nWith the exceptions of official diagnoses and prescription signing, medical students are responsible for everything that goes on in clinic.\nAs a result, the young volunteers in a student-run free clinic are allotted much more freedom than if they had been working at a standard, physician-operated clinic.\nToday, the majority of all U.S. medical schools have at least one student-run free clinic under their auspices.\nProponents see the student-run free clinic as playing a small but vital role in the healthcare safety net."}
