Two people are behind bars in Russell County following a traffic stop that began with the report of bizarre reckless driving.

The Russell County Sheriff's Office says it happened Saturday when deputies received the report of two vehicles driving recklessly on I-70, eastbound from Hays. Witnesses reported seeing a white Toyota pickup and a grey VW Jetta with Pennsylvania plates driving side by side on the interstate and blocking traffic.

The witnesses also saw items being passed between the vehicles while they were moving. The pickup reportedly tried to run a witness off the road.

Deputies stopped the vehicle near Russell and were joined by a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper. Deputies and the trooper uncovered a large amount of marijuana inside of the pickup truck.

The driver and passenger of the Jetta were cited for reckless driving and allowed to continue home. The driver and passenger in the pickup were arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and reckless driving.

The pickup and marijuana were seized. The sheriff's office confirmed to KAKE News that the suspects were returning from Colorado, where the sale of marijuana became legal this year. However, it's not known how or where the drugs were purchased.
