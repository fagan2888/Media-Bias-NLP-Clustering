Growing economies tend to produce more jobs, better infrastructure, freer trade and greater international co-operation.\n\nAustralia is already leading by example, inking job-creating free trade agreements with Korea and Japan. Abbott took office just 14 months ago. Since then, Australia\u2014a country of fewer than 24 million\u2014has created 110,000 net new jobs. Meanwhile, gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate exceeding three percent.\n\nWhile the Abbott government actively pursues free trade, the Obama administration has dragged its feet. It blocked approval of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) negotiated in 2007 with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, then spent nearly four years renegotiating them. It has also dragged out negotiations for Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic FTAs, and made no attempt to push an FTA for Brazil. Its support of the pro-market \u201cPacific Alliance\u201d trade area of Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Peru has been lukewarm at best.\n\nOn the home front, President Obama has followed the EU mega-welfare-state model, ramped up government spending, and added onerous layers of regulation. In the latter area, the U.S. president has far outdone the Europeans.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute reports that the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)\u2014the \"codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government\"\u2014filled 175,496 pages by the end of 2013. In Brussels, the \u201cAcquis\u201d\u2014the European Union\u2019s rough equivalent to the CFR\u2014tops out at roughly 170,000 pages.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, under Obama the CFR has been growing. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, 63 Federal departments, agencies and commissions issued 3,659 rules last year, yet Congress passed and the President signed just 72 laws. That\u2019s a ratio of 51 new regulations for every new law! Overall, in his first five years in office President Obama added 17,522 pages of regulations to the CFR, an 11 percent increase in the size of the regulatory state.\n\nThe Abbott government, however, has gone in the other direction. Under its twice-yearly \u201cRed Tape Repeal Day\u201d it has now eliminated more than 57,000 pages of unnecessary red tape under a plan expected to save Australian taxpayers at least $2 billion per year. Although the mechanics of regulation are different in the U.S. and Australia, there can be no mistaking the starkly different approaches of the Obama and Abbott governments. Obama wants to grow the administrative state, while Abbott wants to rein it in.\n\nPerhaps PM Abbott\u2019s most exciting move to date has been his government\u2019s repeal of carbon and mining taxes. Such regressive taxes destroy jobs, retard economic growth, and fall most heavily on the poor. Even sadder, they don\u2019t make a dent in global greenhouse gas emissions and therefore have no noticeable impact on global temperatures.\n\nIn short, the Aussies are busily taking steps to grow their economy. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy remains hamstrung by the unworkable complexities of Obamacare, a heavy-handed, top-down approach to financial regulations, wrong-headed energy and environmental policies, and a whole host of other problems that have resulted from too much government.\n\nMuch of the EU faces the same problems, and for the same reasons. A voracious appetite for spending by EU governments is eating up nearly 45 percent of GDP.\n\nPrime Minister Abbott wants other G20 countries to send the same message to their citizens that he is sending to Australians, that the country is open for business\u2014not hostile to it.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s midterm elections, President Obama said that he had heard the message delivered to him by the American people.
