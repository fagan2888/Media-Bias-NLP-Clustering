Voters don\u2019t like the leaders of the Republican establishment, they don\u2019t trust them because they\u2019ve lied and failed to keep their campaign promises over and over and over again.\n\n\n\nWhat Donald Trump is doing is holding up a mirror to the failures of the Republican leadership.\n\n\n\nThe reflection isn\u2019t pretty \u2013 and Trump\u2019s poll numbers show voters sure don\u2019t like what they see.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is no movement conservative, but he\u2019s giving voters an alternative to the Republican establishment that they\u2019ve never had before and every attack from RINOs like Lindsey Graham and establishment Republican politicians like Rick Perry adds rocket fuel to Trump\u2019s rise.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "It\u2019s Not About Trump \u2013 It\u2019s About The Failures Of The Republican Establishment"}}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump is no movement conservative, but he\u2019s giving voters an alternative to the Republican establishment that they\u2019ve never had before and every attack from RINOs like Lindsey Graham and establishment Republican politicians like Rick Perry adds rocket fuel to Trump\u2019s rise.\nThe Republican establishment is in a panic about the rise of Donald Trump and how he has dominated the debate and set the agenda for the early stages of the Republican presidential nomination.\nAs I documented in my book TAKEOVER, the Tea Party movement came about as a rebellion against the Big Government Republican establishment and the entrenched leadership of the Republican Party.\nIt\u2019s about the failures of the Republican establishment, especially the GOP\u2019s Capitol Hill leadership, to do what they promised to do and fight Obama\u2019s policies with all the tools the Constitution gives them.\nWhat Donald Trump is doing is holding up a mirror to the failures of the Republican leadership."}
