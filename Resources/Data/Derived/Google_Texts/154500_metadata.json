In the so-called free-to-play world, it\u2019s hard to think of another game developer that has more successfully mastered the marketing coup that merges addictive game play with powerful incentives to regularly fork over cold, hard cash.\n\nWhat?! I have to wait 21 more minutes before I have access to those new lives that will allow me to keep playing? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me! Oh, but I can purchase another \u201csweet set of lives\u201d for a mere 99 cents? Sign me up! Please sir, bleed me some more.\n\nThe game itself isn\u2019t innovative in the least. But the business model is genius. And there is absolutely no question that it works. The No. 1 iTunes download for 2013, \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is reportedly clearing $1 million in profit every single day.\n\nSo yeah, you don\u2019t have to play a game like \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d very long before you start feeling bleak about how we\u2019ll spend our leisure time in the age of late capitalism, nitpicked to death by 99 cent fees. And that\u2019s even without having heard the news that King.com, the developer of \u201cCandy Crush Saga,\u201d is seeking trademark protection for the words \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201csaga.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true: On Jan. 15, the U.S. Trademark Office gave King.com, \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u2019s\u201d developer, preliminary approval; protection for the word \u201ccandy\u201d in the titles of video games and affiliated merchandise, including clothing.\n\nOn Tuesday, word began to spread that game developers were being asked to remove their Candy-named apps from the iTunes Store. Incredulity spread fast on Twitter, as it always does when a particularly egregious example of trademark overreach boils over. Most of the ire centered on the seeming absurdity of a business entity attempting to gain ownership of a word as commonly used as \u201ccandy\u201d \u2014 two syllables that trace their etymological ancestry all the way back to Sanskrit!\n\nBut there are deeper reasons to be annoyed by King.com\u2019s trademark-grab than just the specific question of whether a word like \u201ccandy\u201d can be legitimately pulled into the private domain. King.com\u2019s aggressive move is just one symptom of a deeper sickness permeating our entire structure of intellectual property laws, including not just trademarks, but also copyright and patents. We endanger our prospects for future prosperity when we clamp down too hard on the free expression of ideas. \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u2019s\u201d candy is at one end of a spectrum that, at its most extreme, includes the formation and capitalization of corporations whose sole purpose is to amass intellectual property so as to be able to sue other corporate entities for infringement. This is how an economy\u2019s arteries start to harden, how growth becomes stillborn.\n\nNow before anyone starts screaming about how intellectual property laws provide the necessary incentives for free market entrepreneurs to create great products that will improve all our lives in unimaginable ways \u2014 or how every unauthorized copy of anything is property theft punishable by hanging \u2014 let\u2019s make one the thing clear: The case for not going overboard on trademark or copyright or patent protection is not an absolutist information-wants-to-be-free argument.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s an argument about where to draw the line and how to strike the proper balance between what\u2019s good for society and what\u2019s good for individual (or corporate) creators. It\u2019s an argument concerned with technical questions about the optimal length for which a patent can be held; or how long copyright protection should last before a work enters the public domain; or how expansive a given trademark grant should be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The video game's makers want to trademark the word \"candy.\" Behold: The sorry state of intellectual property law", "title": "How \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is ruining the economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The video game's makers want to trademark the word \"candy.\" Behold: The sorry state of intellectual property law", "title": "How \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is ruining the economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/24/how_candy_crush_is_ruining_the_economy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/candy_crush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The video game's makers want to trademark the word \"candy.\" Behold: The sorry state of intellectual property law", "title": "How \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is ruining the economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/candy_crush.jpg", "creator": "@koxinga21", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Leonard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Candy Crush, Copyright Law, Economics, Editor's Picks, Google, innovation, Intellectual Property, intellectual property rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Trademark Office gave King.com, \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u2019s\u201d developer, preliminary approval; protection for the word \u201ccandy\u201d in the titles of video games and affiliated merchandise, including clothing.\n1 iTunes download for 2013, \u201cCandy Crush\u201d is reportedly clearing $1 million in profit every single day.\nTopics: Candy Crush, Copyright Law, Economics, Editor's Picks, Google, innovation, Intellectual Property, intellectual property rights, Innovation News, Technology NewsAnyone who has played the game \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d for more than a few minutes has probably, at least on a subconscious level, grappled with the bankrupt soul of modern video-game capitalism.\nAnd that\u2019s even without having heard the news that King.com, the developer of \u201cCandy Crush Saga,\u201d is seeking trademark protection for the words \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201csaga.\u201dIt\u2019s true: On Jan. 15, the U.S.\n\u201cCandy Crush Saga\u2019s\u201d candy is at one end of a spectrum that, at its most extreme, includes the formation and capitalization of corporations whose sole purpose is to amass intellectual property so as to be able to sue other corporate entities for infringement."}
