According to Aldrich, she didn\u2019t even notice the handwriting when the cake was first handed back to her. \u201cI looked [the employee] in the eye and said thank you before I even looked at the cake,\u201d Aldrich wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Aldrich was at the checkout counter that she noticed something different about the cake. However, according to Aldrich, the poor handwriting didn\u2019t really matter much to her. \u201cI thought people would think it was funny,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe cashier, however, did not share Aldrich\u2019s light-hearted sentiments toward the cake and called a manager over to assess the situation. It was then that Aldrich learned that the employee who had written on her cake was actually developmentally disabled.\n\n\u201cOne cashier put her arm on my shoulder and said \u2018the girl who wrote that has autism. Thank you for smiling and thanking her \u2014 even though she\u2019s not supposed to write on cakes, you probably made her day,\u201d explained Aldrich. \u201cSo I guess the moral of the story is that kindness is important.\u201d\n\nAldrich was assured that the employee who worked on her cake would not be reprimanded for writing on the cake and so far, the heartwarming Facebook post has been shared more than 107,000 times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "act, kindness, toward, meijer, grocery, store, employee, autism, quickly, goes, viral", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One woman's tale of patience and kindness with an autistic grocery store worker has quickly gone viral.", "title": "Act Of Kindness Toward Grocery Store Employee With Autism Quickly Goes Viral", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/act-kindness-toward-meijer-grocery-store-employee-autism-quickly-goes-viral-363600", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/12/02/happy-birthday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One woman's tale of patience and kindness with an autistic grocery store worker has quickly gone viral.", "title": "Act Of Kindness Toward Grocery Store Employee With Autism Quickly Goes Viral", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/act-kindness-toward-meijer-grocery-store-employee-autism-quickly-goes-viral-363600", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/12/02/happy-birthday.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/02/happy-birthday.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-02T14:16:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T14:16:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One woman's tale of patience and kindness with an autistic grocery store worker has quickly gone viral."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7f8\"", "article_summary": "A photo of a decorated birthday cake from a Meijer grocery store in Michigan has quickly gone viral for its heartwarming tale of kindness toward those with disabilities.\n\u201cI looked [the employee] in the eye and said thank you before I even looked at the cake,\u201d Aldrich wrote in a Facebook post.\nLisa Sarber Aldrich didn\u2019t think twice when she asked a grocery worker standing near the bakery section of her local Meijer store to write a special birthday message on a cake she was planning to buy.\nAccording to Aldrich, she didn\u2019t even notice the handwriting when the cake was first handed back to her.\nIt was then that Aldrich learned that the employee who had written on her cake was actually developmentally disabled."}
