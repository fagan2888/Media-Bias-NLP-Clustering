But what happens when parents themselves are steering kids in the wrong direction?\n\nMore than half of teens are actually talking with their parents when they\u2019re using their cellphones behind the wheel, according to a new study presented at this week\u2019s American Psychological Association\u2019s annual convention.\n\nCar crashes are the leading cause of death among teens, and distracted driving is often to blame, causing 10 percent of fatal crashes. Nearly all teens admit to using a cellphone while driving, but they\u2019re not the only group of drivers who try multi-tasking while operating a two-ton machine.\n\nStudies have found that parents use their cellphones while driving just as much as their kids. Just as in the \u201cLike Father, Like Son\u201d anti-smoking PSA from the \u201960s, mom and dad are modeling a driving behavior that at least quadruples the risk of crashing.\n\nThis new study, led by Parallel Consulting, finds that parents also promote distracted driving by calling and texting their kids to check in or catch up.\n\n\n\nThe researchers asked more than 400 teen drivers why they continue to talk and text while driving despite clear warnings of the risk.\n\nEvery teen in the study who reported talking on the phone while behind the wheel said they talked to their parents, while only 20 percent talked to friends.\n\nTexting was a different story: The study found that teens are much more likely to text their friends, with only 16 percent of older teens and 8 percent of younger teens texting their parents while driving.\n\nOne of the investigators, Dr. Noelle LaVoie, elaborated on the findings in the American Psychological Association\u2019s press release:\n\n\u201cTeens said parents expect to be able to reach them, that parents get mad if they don\u2019t answer their phone and they have to tell parents where they are,\u201d said Noelle LaVoie, PhD, a cognitive psychologist based in Petaluma, California. The teens also said that their parents use cellphones while driving and that \u201ceveryone is doing it,\u201d according to the research, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health. \u201cParents need to understand that this is not safe and emphasize to their children that it\u2019s not normal or acceptable behavior,\u201d said LaVoie. \u201cAsk the question, \u2018Are you driving?\u2019 If they are, tell them to call you back or to find a spot to pull over so they can talk.\n\nSo if parents can\u2019t check in with their teens while they\u2019re driving, how else can they make sure their kids are safe?\n\nThere are apps that allow parents to keep tabs on teen drivers without simultaneously distracting them. In addition to monitoring driving behaviors, several apps on the market can track the car itself and auto-respond to incoming texts and calls with a message like, \u201cI\u2019m driving. I\u2019ll respond later.\u201d\n\nSome of these apps can even disable the phone completely when the car reaches a certain speed, preventing any communication except emergency phone calls to pre-set numbers, like 911.\n\n\u201cInnovative technologies like mobile apps can help parents ensure their teens are driving safely without contributing to the problem of cellphone use while driving,\u201d says Jay A. Winsten, an associate dean at the Harvard School of Public Health who is working on a distracted driving campaign.\n\n\u201cBut parent and teen communication is only part of the larger issue of distracted driving,\u201d he says. \u201cThis study also underscores the tough challenge that lies ahead to stigmatize distracted driving and render it socially unacceptable. Changing social norms will require a combination of increasingly tough laws, strict regulation, and persuasive communication to break through people\u2019s willful denial of the risks involved.\u201d\n\nReaders, thoughts?
