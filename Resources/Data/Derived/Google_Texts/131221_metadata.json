It is an evil looking pepper\u2014a gnarled, lumpy pod with a sucked-up belly and a small tail reminiscent of wasp\u2019s stinger. When ripe it is a luscious Crayola red. Its looks are a carefully crafted marketing scheme that screams \u201cDanger: Do Not Eat.\u201d But it was those looks that immediately drew Ed Currie, a South Carolina chili pepper grower, to the Carolina Reaper, the latest and most controversial contender for the crown of world\u2019s hottest pepper. Like any human endeavor involving pride and money, the competition for the world\u2019s hottest pepper, especially in the United States, is cutthroat and, to make matters worse, there currently is no undisputed champion. \u201cIt is highly competitive and there is a lot of infighting,\u201d says Ted Barrus, a well-known reviewer of superhots\u2014peppers reaching over one million Scoville heat units (at least three times as hot as a typical habanero)\u2014famous for his YouTube videos under the moniker Fire Breathing Idiot. \u201cIt\u2019s a big money thing to have the world record.\u201d\n\nWhich pepper currently reigns supreme depends on who you ask. There are four different camps. According to the folks at Guinness World Records, the Trinidad Scorpion \u201cButch T,\u201d a Trinidad Scorpion chili pepper variant developed by The Chilli Factory in Australia, is the world\u2019s hottest at more than1.4 million Scoville units. But the majority of American chiliheads believe that pepper has been usurped by the Reaper, the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion, or any number of other peppers concocted by hobbyist growers. Two decades ago the Red Savina Habanero, then the world\u2019s hottest pepper, only topped out at around half a million Scoville heat units. Many thought that that was as hot as peppers would ever get. Then the Indian Bhut Jolokia, the first superhot pepper, was discovered by researchers in the West. Better known in the West as the Ghost Pepper, the Bhut Jolokia more than doubled the Red Savina\u2019s Scoville rating. The Ghost Pepper was crowned in 2007, but after the Butch T won in 2011, the title had changed hands three times in a little more than a year. Since then the title has remained static. More and more small growers are vying for the title of hottest pepper, often without any evidence to support their claims. Many think that Guinness simply can\u2019t keep up with the number of applicants, or is unwilling to crown a new champion because having so many changes so rapidly dilutes the value of the prize. With no other official source willing to evaluate the explosion of superhots, the last few years have turned into a free-for-all. Compared to England and Australia, two other chilihead hot beds, there is a lot of negativity and fighting among American growers, says Barrus. More and more small growers are vying for the title of hottest pepper, often without any evidence to support their claims, says Jim Duffy, a prominent chili grower from Southern California. \u201c(There are) lots of upstarts who are claiming they have the hottest and are getting people to buy their seeds without having any proof. So hobbyist growers are getting cheated out of 30 bucks or so when the seeds they bought don\u2019t come out how they were supposed to.\u201d\n\nDuffy has good reason to be upset, as a big name in superhots. The Chile Pepper Institute, a non-profit educational outreach and research center located at New Mexico State University, used his seeds for all the peppers in a comparative study of heat levels for several different strains of superhots. It was during that study that a Trinidad Moruga Scorpion pod unexpectedly broke two million Scoville heat units, the highest Scoville level currently on record. It was into this fray that Currie and his Carolina Reaper entered unaware, and he immediately made enemies including, at first, Jim Duffy. Currie was not part of the chilihead community, and he certainly didn\u2019t hang out on the community\u2019s message boards. He just ran a small seed shop and grew peppers mostly for use in cancer research. So it came as a shock when he received a call from Barrus, whom he didn\u2019t know, telling him that people were attacking him and his pepper on the Internet. Barrus told him he needed to defend himself. Currie\u2019s family has a history of heart disease and cancer. In college he decided he needed to figure out a way to avoid that fate and began researching which populations had the lowest rates of those diseases. He found they had several things in common, but what stuck him was that they all ate hot chilis with every meal. That is when he started growing peppers. It was by trying to grow a sweet pepper that Currie claims he accidentally created the world\u2019s hottest. Because chemotherapy patients often lose the ability to taste anything but \u201csweet,\u201d Currie hoped that patients could still taste a sweet pepper. They could. \u201cIt is the sweetest superhot out there,\u201d says Currie. \"God blessed me with a pepper that is just really, really, really hot.\" Currie knew he had something special as soon as he laid eyes on the Reaper\u2014it was the first pepper he\u2019d even seen with a stinger. Then when Currie\u2019s friend ate one on a dare he threw up from the heat. It was during this growing process that a grad student working for him posted some data on the Internet and claimed that the Reaper was the new record holder.\n\nDuffy initially thought Currie was just another fly-by-night operation that couldn\u2019t back up its claims. But Duffy and Currie eventually became friends and business partners, in part united by their Christian faith. \u201cThat is where all this came from, and God blessed me with a pepper that is just really, really, really hot,\u201d says Currie. \u201cI think that is another thing that pisses people off, because I say, \u2018It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s God.\u2019\u201d There are a few other things that piss people off about Ed Currie. There are vitriolic claims all over the chilihead community\u2019s message boards that the Carolina Reaper is unstable. As with any crossbreed, it takes generations of careful cultivation until its heirs consistently exhibit its desired traits. At best, critics accuse Currie of selling the Carolina Reaper before it was stable enough to produce a consistent crop, and at worst, they believe the pepper is inherently genetically unstable and incapable of ever producing a uniform crop. \u201cSome of us call it a witch burning party,\u201d says Barrus, who believes the Reaper is stable, \u201cbecause it was getting out of control the way they were attacking Ed Currie. I think it is human nature, this mob mentality to jump on it.\u201d Others accuse Currie of selling Reaper seeds and then retroactively declaring only authorized growers could use his pepper for commercial purposes. \"People are pretty much backstabbers. People are always trying to get a new seed.\" In one notorious incident, a grower named Robert Richard posted photos of the Carolina Reaper plants he was growing to sell on a Facebook group for chiliheads. The thread soon turned into a discussion about whether he was allowed to sell the peppers or not. Currie chimed in and asked for Richard\u2019s contact information so Currie\u2019s lawyers could contact him. Richard did not respond to interview requests. \u201cI have a whole legal team that takes care of that. I just like to grow peppers and let other people take care of that,\u201d says Currie. Currie is certainly protective of his creation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Searching for a winner in the cutthroat world of competitive chili pepper growing", "author": "Nicholas Hunt", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Searching for a winner in the cutthroat world of competitive chili pepper growing", "title": "So God Made the World's Hottest Pepper", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/reaper-peppers-2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/so-god-made-the-worlds-hottest-pepper/279749/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"God blessed me with a pepper that is just really, really, really hot.\"\n\u201cThat is where all this came from, and God blessed me with a pepper that is just really, really, really hot,\u201d says Currie.\nTwo decades ago the Red Savina Habanero, then the world\u2019s hottest pepper, only topped out at around half a million Scoville heat units.\nLike any human endeavor involving pride and money, the competition for the world\u2019s hottest pepper, especially in the United States, is cutthroat and, to make matters worse, there currently is no undisputed champion.\nMore and more small growers are vying for the title of hottest pepper, often without any evidence to support their claims."}
