The 2014 total of 4,020 reflects a 40 percent decline since 2007, when 6,649 abortions were performed in the state.\n\nThe drop in abortions is not mainly due to more pregnant women choosing to give birth, the new statistics suggest. In fact, Iowa\u2019s birth rate has remained fairly flat since falling during the recession starting in 2008.\n\nIn 2014, the number of babies born here crept up less than 2 percent, to 39,685, the health department says. The annual total remained nearly 3 percent lower than the 2007 total of 40,835.\n\n\u201cAbortion is going down because women are able to avoid unintended pregnancies,\u201d said Rachel Jones, a researcher for the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe abortion decline coincides with a continued plunge in the number of Iowa teens giving birth. It also has happened as access to abortion services has expanded.\n\nA controversial telemedicine system, which started in 2008, allows patients at small-town clinics to obtain abortion pills via a video linkup with doctors at urban offices at Planned Parenthood, which is the state\u2019s main abortion provider. Although Planned Parenthood has closed several of the rural clinics using that system, abortion services are available in several more Iowa towns today than in 2007.\n\nThe tumbling rates, including last year\u2019s 9 percent drop in Iowa, bring rare joint applause from activists on both sides of the debate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big number. It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction,\u201d said Jenifer Bowen, executive director of Iowa Right to Life. Bowen said she\u2019s always a bit skeptical of state abortion statistics, because they rely on reports from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. But she said figures nationally reflect similar shifts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a positive trend, no matter how you look at it,\u201d she said.\n\nBowen believes at least part of the reason for the decline is that more Americans are deciding abortion is wrong.\n\nPlanned Parenthood leaders say that while they vigorously support women\u2019s right to choose abortion, they also try to help women avoid having to make that decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard over lo these many years to prevent unplanned pregnancy,\u201d said Penny Dickey, chief clinical officer of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.\n\nRELATED: Iowa teen birth rate hits record low\n\nDickey said her Des Moines-based agency sees the falling abortion rate as a sign of progress. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if it dropped another 40 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fewer abortions women seek, the fewer abortions we\u2019ll perform. That\u2019s fine with us.\u201d\n\nJones, the researcher for Guttemacher, which supports abortion rights, said it\u2019s impossible to judge if Iowa\u2019s latest abortion decline is steeper than that of other states. The most recent data are from 2011, but abortion clearly is becoming rarer across the country, she said.\n\nSeveral experts credit increased use of long-term forms of birth control, such as intrauterine devices or hormone implants, for the abortion decline. Those methods can last for several years and are more foolproof than others, such as condoms or birth control pills, they said.\n\nBuy Photo A Nexplanon hormone implant can prevent pregnancy for up to three years.

The group, called the Iowa Initiative, used about $35 million in private grants to provide free long-term birth control devices to Iowa women between 2008 and 2012.\n\nAlthough the project has wound down, Kane said, it encouraged many clinics to be involved in helping women obtain the more reliable contraceptives. \u201cWe were curious to see if the interest would drop after the funding ended, but the interest really has continued,\u201d she said.\n\nLong-term contraceptives, including intrauterine devices, were dogged by safety concerns years ago. But Kane and others said modern versions are much safer and are increasingly popular. \u201cThey\u2019ve become really acceptable to women of all ages, including teenagers,\u201d she said.\n\nDickey added that more insurance plans, including private carriers and Medicaid, are covering such devices. The increased coverage is partly due to rules in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Insurance coverage is important, because the devices can cost up to several hundred dollars, she said.\n\nSome critics contend intrauterine devices essentially cause abortions by making the uterus an inhospitable place for a fertilized egg to implant.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how you define when life begins,\u201d said Maggie DeWitte, executive director of Iowans for Life. \u201cIn our definition, that\u2019s an abortion, because we define life as starting at conception.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Here are two types of intrauterine devices offered by Planned Parenthood.

However, she agreed with Bowen that if the new statistics are accurate, they could be good news. \u201cAny time the number of abortions is down, that\u2019s a win for everybody,\u201d she said.\n\nSupporters of IUDs dispute the notion that they mainly work by preventing implantation of fertilized eggs. They say the main effect of the devices is to prevent ovulation of eggs before fertilization.\n\nBowen said she hopes that when 2015\u2019s abortion rate is published, Iowans will see an even bigger drop. She noted the recent national controversy over Planned Parenthood, fueled by videos that opponents say show agency leaders dickering over prices for parts of aborted fetuses to be used for research.\n\nThose videos are making more women question the agency, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not comfortable with where Planned Parenthood is,\u201d she said.\n\nBowen also said she hopes to see results from a bill the Legislature passed last spring, requiring abortion providers to offer women the chance to see an ultrasound image before undergoing the procedure.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters say patients already were routinely offered the opportunity to see ultrasounds. They also say the undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials were heavily edited to falsely imply the agency was breaking the law instead of simply trying to cover the cost of retaining tissue for legitimate medical research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland, which is Iowa's chapter, says that while it supports such research, it does not provide tissue for it.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1LApuN0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Abortion rights supporters credit more use of long-term contraceptives.
