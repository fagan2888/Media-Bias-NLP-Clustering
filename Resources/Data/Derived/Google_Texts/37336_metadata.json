On Saturday, Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim hosts its 13th Super Surgery Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just an electric feeling in the air; the volunteers feel it, the patients feel it, the families feel it,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gabaldon, a Kaiser anesthesiologist and event organizer. \u201cI think it\u2019s the feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself, that you\u2019re a part of something that may change someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nEricka Waidley, executive director of Santa Ana-based Access OC, said the waiting list for surgery has about 200 people, some of whom have been waiting several years. They are referred through nonprofit community clinics.\n\n\u201cThese are the people that are the grassroots workers in Orange County, the ones keeping the mega resorts going, the beautiful gardens in people\u2019s homes, the nannies, the restaurant workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are so grateful. They are just amazed that this opportunity has presented itself. A lot of them had no idea that they\u2019d ever be pain-free or be able to go back to work 100 percent.\u201d\n\nWaidley said even though the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has resulted in more residents with coverage, she expects strong demand among underinsured patients who have lower-cost plans with high out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a large number of people that are either not eligible or still not able to pay because they can\u2019t afford the deductible for any kind of specialty care,\u201d Waidley said.\n\nSince the program started, more than 1,000 medical volunteers have provided 552 surgeries and colonoscopies. After Saturday, the 33rd free surgery day will take place June 7 at Mission Hospital.\n\n\u201cThere is no county hospital here in Orange County so they have nowhere to go at this point,\u201d Gabaldon said. \u201cWe hope we\u2019re able to catch a lot of these people and help them before they end up in the ER.\u201d\n\nTo learn more: 714-543-9400 or accessoc.org\n\nContact the writer: cperkes@ocregister.com 714-796-3686", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "life", "description": "Life: Free surgery day planned for Saturday in Orange County   | surgery, county, people, saturday, free, orange, able, feel, waidley, waiting, kaiser", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Uninsured Orange County residents have received more than 500 free surgeries worth $6.5 million since 2007, with 25 more scheduled for Saturday.", "title": "A round of free surgeries will barely dent waiting list", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/surgery-614477-county-people.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n5ncd9-b8868220z.120140515195833000g9a2701a.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n5ncd9-b8868220z.120140515195833000g9a2701a.10.jpg"}, "description": "Uninsured Orange County residents have received more than 500 free surgeries worth $6.5 million since 2007, with 25 more scheduled for Saturday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A round of free surgeries will barely dent waiting list"}, "content_author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/n5ncd9-b8868220z.120140515195833000g9a2701a.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "surgery, county, people, saturday, free, orange, able, feel, waidley, waiting", "publication_date": "2014-05-15", "access-type": "free", "section": "life", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "A round of free surgeries will barely dent waiting list"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2c0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere is no county hospital here in Orange County so they have nowhere to go at this point,\u201d Gabaldon said.\nUninsured Orange County residents have received more than 500 free surgeries worth $6.5 million since 2007, with 25 more scheduled for Saturday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just an electric feeling in the air; the volunteers feel it, the patients feel it, the families feel it,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gabaldon, a Kaiser anesthesiologist and event organizer.\n\u201cThese are the people that are the grassroots workers in Orange County, the ones keeping the mega resorts going, the beautiful gardens in people\u2019s homes, the nannies, the restaurant workers,\u201d she said.\nSince the program started, more than 1,000 medical volunteers have provided 552 surgeries and colonoscopies."}
