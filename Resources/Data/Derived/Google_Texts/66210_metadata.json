It\u2019s time to start afresh with your finances and lay out your financial goals for the new year. The most important thing is to make your goals realistic and achievable. Otherwise, you\u2019ll give up early.\n\nFor example, the wise move is to pay off the credit cards with the highest interest rates first. But if paying off the card with the lowest balance first gives you an immediate sense of accomplishment, then do it.\n\n\u201cWhatever financial goal you set for yourself in 2015, keep this phrase glued to your memory: Stay simple,\u201d said Rick Salmeron, certified financial planner at Salmeron Financial in Dallas.\n\n\u201cDo not go deep with your goals or radically alter any financial behaviors. Even the slightest fraction of a degree of change can make a very noticeable difference over a long period of time.\u201d\n\nSo here are some things to shoot for in the new year:\n\nHave a plan\n\n\u201cAs is the case with accomplishing most goals, getting on the path to financial security is easiest when you plan ahead and make a series of small, sustainable changes,\u201d says Donna Skeels Cygan, author of The Joy of Financial Security: The art and science of becoming happier, managing your money wisely, and creating a secure financial future.\n\nBe specific about your goals. For example, don\u2019t just say, \u201cI want to save more money.\u201d Instead, say, \u201cI want to have $1,000 in my savings account in six months.\u201d\n\nPay yourself first\n\n\u201cTake advantage of every opportunity to sock money away automatically before you are tempted to spend it,\u201d said Tom Murphy, certified financial planner at Murphy & Sylvest in Dallas. \u201cThis is why many successful people have a separate savings account used only for emergencies. \u2018Out of sight, out of mind\u2019 applies to a lot of things in life and can be used in your favor.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to get a raise this month, save a part of it.\n\n\u201cCommit to allocating at least half of that raise to help achieve your goals,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cFor example, if you have a 2 percent raise, increase your 401(k) contribution by 1 percent. Do it now before you are tempted to spend the money.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Cygan said, \u201cIf you are lucky enough to get a tax refund, send half of it to savings. If you pay off your car loan, send the amount of your former payment to savings each month.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to build up that all-important emergency fund. Murphy recommends putting aside funds equal to three months of expenses.\n\n\u201cThe enemy of financial success is temptation, not lack of investment prowess,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBreak it down\n\nIf you take baby steps to save and do it consistently, you\u2019d be amazed how much you can accumulate.\n\n\u201cIncrease your contribution [to your retirement plan] by at least 1 [percentage point] per year, 2 ... if you get a bigger raise,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBefore you know it you will be at the maximum, but don\u2019t stop there. Open an investment account and keep it up. Before you know it you will be painlessly saving a significant percentage of your income. The key is to not think about it.\u201d\n\nMake it automatic\n\n\u201cMany people save through their 401(k) or 403(b) at work, and the money is swept into the account before it ever appears in a paycheck,\u201d said Cygan, a certified financial planner. \u201cThis works great, and you can do the same thing with saving in a Roth IRA or a taxable account. Set your savings up so it is automatic, occurring on the first of each month or as soon as your paycheck is deposited into your checking account.\u201d\n\nAn automatic savings plan forces you to save because the money is withdrawn from your account before you have a chance to spend it.\n\nCut your expenses\n\n\u201cFind one simple area to reduce your expenses,\u201d Salmeron said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut your expenses in half or live like a miser to be successful. Realize that no savings is too small. They all add up.\u201d\n\nBefore you cut expenses, however, you first have to know how you\u2019re spending your money.\n\n\u201cA lot of our spending tends to happen while we\u2019re asleep at the wheel,\u201d Cygan said. \u201cWe sign up for expenses like cellphone plans and Internet services, and then forget about them.\n\n\u201cIs there a more affordable option out there? Are you paying for features you don\u2019t use?\u201d\n\nPay cash when you can\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that we spend roughly 15 percent more when we pay with a credit card as opposed to using cash,\u201d Cygan said. \u201cIf you have to reach into your wallet and count out bills in order to pay for a meal or an impulse buy at a retail store, you might just decide that it isn\u2019t worth the money after all.\u201d\n\nPay down debt\n\nThis takes on added importance this year, as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin slowly raising interest rates around midyear.\n\nAlthough the Fed is expected to take a go-slow approach, any rate increase isn\u2019t good if you\u2019re already carrying a credit card balance.\n\n\u201cExcessive debt creates stress, and getting rid of \u2018bad debt\u2019 is an important step toward financial security,\u201d Cygan said. \u201c\u2018Bad debt\u2019 is debt derived from actions that have no future benefit. For instance, credit card bills carried over from month to month are typically from vacations, eating out, gifts or clothing. The expenses were in the past, and there is no future benefit.\n\n\u201cContrast that with debt from a home mortgage. Your home provides long-term benefits and enjoyment. Home mortgage debt is \u2018good debt.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reward for being more financially disciplined is a sense that you\u2019re on your way to achieving your goals and peace of mind, knowing that you\u2019re controlling your finances instead of your finances controlling you.\n\nFollow Pamela Yip on Twitter\n\nat @pamelayip.\n\nHave a financial question?\n\nEmail moneyhelp@dallasnews.com.\n\nYour question will be sent to a member of the Financial Planning Association of Dallas-Fort Worth.
