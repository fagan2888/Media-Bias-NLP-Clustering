But, for all the technological innovations, the gap between doctor-patient understanding has often been wide.\n\nFor patients to better understand their diagnoses and how their doctors will treat them, there needs to be constant, effective contact. Apple held its yearly special event on Wednesday, unveiling all the new updates and additions to its iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch lines. Two apps in particular that were announced at the Apple event aim to bring the relationship between doctor and patient closer than ever before.\n\nAirstrip is a new app that brings health care professionals and patients closer together. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters\n\nA new app for your Apple Watch, Airstrip improves health care delivery by allowing patients and doctors to stay up to date about each other\u2019s statuses in real time. Doctors will be able to see their patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, pill schedule, diagnoses, lab results, and more with just a glance at their wrist and a swipe of the finger.\n\nAirstrip also allows pregnant women to keep their physicians up to date with how their baby is doing at any given moment. Using the Apple Watch\u2019s heart monitor and a Sense4Baby unit, which differentiates between the mother and baby\u2019s heart rhythm, a mother can actually record and hear her baby\u2019s heart rate in real time.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about sharing your information with a doctor over an app, fear not. The app complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law that strictly protects a patient's private health information.\n\n3D image from 3D4Medical, a new app announced today. 3D4Medical Press Kit\n\nLearning about anatomy has been limited in some sense to the 2D realm \u2014 in textbooks and posters \u2014 and clunky 3D models. Well, pretty soon, doctors and patients will have access to 3D images of muscles, ligaments, bones, and just about every facet of the human body, thanks to 3D4Medical.\n\nUsing anatomically correct models rendered on the new iPad Pro, doctors or physical therapists will be able to show their patients exactly how their quadriceps work. With the new Apple Pencil, they\u2019ll also be able to mark exactly where on the bone or muscle a tear, break, fracture or split occurred. Then, if you want to have a copy for yourself, they\u2019ll be able to send the image to your phone, email address, or wherever else you might want it.\n\nThe real-life animations of the app also show you how the body moves, and how its skeletal and muscular system move with it. This is crucial for doctors or physical therapists, who need to understand all of the human body\u2019s intricacies in order to be able to properly explain a patient\u2019s condition.\n\nAside from bringing health care providers and patients together through a better understanding of the human body and its conditions, these two apps may also be used as educational supplements, helping doctors and doctors-to-be thrive in the digital world.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "apple event apps airstrip 3d4medical", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two new medical apps, Airstrip and 3D4Medical, allow health care professionals and their patients to interact digitally, bringing them closer than ever before.", "title": "Tim Cook Unveils New Apple Watch Apps For Better Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/apples-tim-cook-unveils-two-new-medical-apps-apple-watch-bring-doctors-patients-351874", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/apps.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two new medical apps, Airstrip and 3D4Medical, allow health care professionals and their patients to interact digitally, bringing them closer than ever before.", "title": "Tim Cook Unveils New Apple Watch Apps For Better Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/apples-tim-cook-unveils-two-new-medical-apps-apple-watch-bring-doctors-patients-351874", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/apps.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/apps.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-09-09T18:03:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T18:17:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two new medical apps, Airstrip and 3D4Medical, allow health care professionals and their patients to interact digitally, bringing them closer than ever before."}, "article_summary": "Airstrip is a new app that brings health care professionals and patients closer together.\nBeck Diefenbach/ReutersA new app for your Apple Watch, Airstrip improves health care delivery by allowing patients and doctors to stay up to date about each other\u2019s statuses in real time.\nApple held its yearly special event on Wednesday, unveiling all the new updates and additions to its iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch lines.\nFor patients to better understand their diagnoses and how their doctors will treat them, there needs to be constant, effective contact.\nTwo apps in particular that were announced at the Apple event aim to bring the relationship between doctor and patient closer than ever before."}
