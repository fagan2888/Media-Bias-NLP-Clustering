I am very disappointed that this was reported in the news media. I have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nOn Monday, a School board member told News 9 that Neu was planning on leaving. Tuesday afternoon the district filed a notice of a meeting Thursday where board members will go into executive session to discuss his employment.

I think that\u2019s excessive,\u201d said Allen.\n\nHowever, News 9 obtained copies of Neu's contract and compared it side-by-side to the new Tulsa superintendent Deborah Gist and found no glaring differences.\n\nNeu is under contract with the district until June 30, 2017.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma City Schools Superintendent Rob Neu has responded to reports he is planning to resign.\u00a0 On Tuesday morning, Neu issued a brief statement to the media and emailed the same thing to staff, s...", "author": "Dana Hertneky", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31707104/superintendent-neu-i-have-not-resigned", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10314466_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma City Schools Superintendent Rob Neu has responded to reports he is planning to resign.\u00a0 On Tuesday morning, Neu issued a brief statement to the media and emailed the same thing to staff, s...", "title": "Superintendent Neu: 'I have not resigned'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10314466_G.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma City Schools Superintendent Rob Neu has responded to reports he is planning to resign.\u00a0 On Tuesday morning, Neu issued a brief statement to the media and emailed the same thing to staff, s...", "card": "summary", "title": "Superintendent Neu: 'I have not resigned'"}, "wnreadableurl": "superintendent-neu-i-have-not-resigned", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/04/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, OKCPS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, OKCPS"}, "article_summary": "Oklahoma City Schools Superintendent Rob Neu has responded to reports he is planning to resign.\n4/12/2016 Related Story: OKCPS Superintendent Rob Neu Says He Has Not Resigned\u201cWe didn\u2019t think he was going to have staying power in this district, you know?\nI think that\u2019s excessive,\u201d said Allen.\nOn Tuesday morning, Neu issued a brief statement to the media and emailed the same thing to staff, saying simply, \"I have not resigned.\nOn Monday, a School board member told News 9 that Neu was planning on leaving."}
