And he said he supported Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz\u2019s right to strip Rep. Mark Meadows of his chairmanship of a subcommittee.\n\n\u201cI think the chairman made the right decision. I made it clear to the members I supported that decision,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure the family conversation will continue.\u201d\n\nNot coincidentally, Meadows was among two dozen Republicans who opposed Boehner\u2019s bid for re-election to the speakership in January.\n\nIn another retaliatory move, Majority Whip Steve Scalise kicked three Republicans off his whipping team \u2014 the three just happened to oppose the trade bill.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, John Boehner", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/24/boehner-backs-punishing-rogue-republicans/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/26/Boehner.JPEG-066f7.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Boehner backs punishing rogue Republicans"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/26/Boehner.JPEG-066f7.jpg", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Boehner backs punishing rogue Republicans"}, "Author": "Joseph Curl", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38d6\"", "article_summary": "And when a committee chairman decided to punish one such rogue, House Speaker John Boehner says he has no problem with that.\nIn another retaliatory move, Majority Whip Steve Scalise kicked three Republicans off his whipping team \u2014 the three just happened to oppose the trade bill.\nAnd he said he supported Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz\u2019s right to strip Rep.
