Congressional candidate J.T. Smith of Phenix City is upset with the Republicans in Congress -- so much that he compared Republicans to the terrorist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and the the Levant, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

Smith, the Democratic nominee in Alabama's District 3, made the comparison on Labor Day, taking to Twitter to vent.

And Smith's timing will likely get his tweet more attention than it has already garnered on social media, as ISIL-ISIS reportedly beheaded a second American journalist on Tuesday. ISIS militants previously beheaded American journalist James Foley, on Aug. 19.

Smith wrote: "The greatest country on earth is being bullied from within. Actions of Republicans in congress are worse than #ISIL." (The tweet is below.)

It wasn't the first potentially incendiary tweet from Smith, who faces U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, in November.

On Sunday, Smith, an Iraq War veteran, tweeted that the fact that the GOP wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, proves that the Republicans see "seniors, women and children as prey."

Smith later took to Facebook to explain his Tweet.

"Twitter does not allow for context, but this does," Smith wrote on Facebook. "I am not saying that the republican party is beheading people in the streets, obviously. Here in America, because we are a civilized democracy, we do not use violence against each other as a means of control. The republicans have used the economy as a means to terrorize the people of this country."
