Groves, president and chief executive officer of Miners Bank, said Thursday.\n\nThe merger, which Mid Penn and Miners anticipate will be completed early in 2015, along with the planned acquisition of First National Bank of Minersville by The Gratz Bank, will leave Schuylkill County without a bank headquartered within its boundaries.\n\nMid Penn Bancorp Inc. is the parent company of Mid Penn, which has 14 offices and is headquartered in Millersburg. Miners Bank, whose parent company is Phoenix Bancorp Inc., has four offices \u2014 Frackville, Minersville, Tremont and Conyngham \u2014 and is headquartered in North Manheim Township.\n\nGroves said the merger is a necessary step for Miners, Mid Penn and their customers.\n\n\u201cThe economic environment for small banks is a very challenging one,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is harder for small banks to create revenue than it is for large ones, Groves said. In addition, the changes brought about the federal Affordable Care Act, greater competition and increased regulations also have made life more difficult for small banks, according to Groves.\n\nMiners Bank\u2019s customers will benefit from the merger, Groves said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have more products and services, especially on the consumer side,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, business customers will be able to borrow greater amounts of money as a result of the merger, according to Groves.\n\nWhile Miners will be merged into Mid Penn, Groves said its four offices will retain the Miners Bank name.\n\nGroves said Miners also will keep its headquarters office on Route 61 between Pottsville and Schuylkill Haven, and will operate as Miners Bank, a division of Mid Penn Bank.\n\nAccording to Mid Penn, Phoenix board Chairman Vincent J. Land and board members Robert Moisey and Noble C. Quandel Jr. will join its board after the merger is completed.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger, Phoenix shareholders will receive either 3.167 shares of Mid Penn common stock or $51.60 in cash for each share they own, according to Mid Penn.\n\n\u201cThe merger enables Mid Penn and ... Miners Bank to work together to bring the best in banking products and services to the communities in which we operate,\u201d Rory G. Ritrievi, president and CEO of Mid Penn, said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Mid Penn buys Miners Bank", "author": "BY PETER E. BORTNER", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "BY PETER E.
