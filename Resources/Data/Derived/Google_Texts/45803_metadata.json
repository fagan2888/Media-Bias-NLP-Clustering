Now, a new service from Nerdwallet is helping steer individuals with outstanding medical debt to medical billing experts, who can help reduce those bills.\n\n\u201cAccuracy is the first issue,\u201d according to Linda Adler, founder of Pathfinders Medical Advocacy & Consulting. Adler, who\u2019s also a patient advocate, says she and other medical billing experts look for errors, confirm the insurer is covering everything it\u2019s supposed to cover, and attempt to negotiate lower bills. \u201cThe thing about having a medical billing advocate is we speak the language (as the insurers.) We can make calls on your behalf.\u201d\n\nAdler and her team recently helped cancer survivor Marcus Rietema shave thousands off his outstanding bills. After contracting lymphoma, the father of three was facing about $60,000 in medical debt. Although crowdfunding helped him raise about $30,000, he and his wife realized they could use more help. \u201cI was really frustrated with the insurance plan,\u201d Kim Rietema told Consumerwatch.\n\nAnd help like that is getting easier to find. While you can search for a medical billing expert on your own, Nerdwallet recently introduced a service intended to match billing professionals with people who need help. Nerdwallet first offers a free evaluation to see if you\u2019re a good candidate. If you are, Nerdwallet makes the referral. \u201cOftentimes the outcome is several thousand dollars in savings,\u201d according to Nerdwallet\u2019s Christina LaMontagne. She says four out of five medical bills contain an error.\n\nMedical billing experts typically charge a fee for their services. It\u2019s usually a percentage of the amount they have reduced the bills, or an hourly rate. Adler donated her services to the Rietema\u2019s. Their debt is now down to $6,000, a sum they\u2019re chiseling away, according to Kim Rietema.\n\nNerdwallet\u2019s referral program is part of the site\u2019s new Nerdwallet Health Program. It also offers free advice and on-line forums for people with medical billing issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even people with health insurance can still rack up significant medical debt, particularly if they get a serious illness.
