The foundation has lost too much funding to continue, its founding president and chief executive Naomi Naierman told me in an interview. As a parting gift, however, Ms. Naierman \u2014 a hospice executive for more than 30 years \u2014 has passed along some consumer advice.\n\nEven as Americans make greater use of hospice care, families often don\u2019t grasp that in most places they have a choice of programs. And when the time comes to decide, many are in the middle of a health care crisis that makes researching the options difficult.\n\nMs. Naierman and her colleagues have come up with some key questions to ask when you\u2019re selecting a hospice (a more complete list appears on the foundation\u2019s website). The conversation below has been edited and condensed for space.\n\nPhoto\n\nQ.\n\nIn your decades with hospice, what are some of the changes you\u2019ve seen, positive or negative?\n\nA.\n\nThe growth of hospice is a positive trend. It\u2019s not only available in most communities, but in most urban areas, you have lots of options.\n\nOn the negative side, it started out with volunteers who really wanted to focus on care for the dying and has moved toward a big business, in some cases owned by very large corporations.\n\nFor a long time, we could assume that every hospice provided high-quality care. There came a time when that assumption was no longer safe.\n\nQ.\n\nSo families have to shop around for the best hospice care?\n\nA.\n\nYou have to become a very savvy consumer about what is likely to be the most important health care decision you make in your life.\n\nAs a foundation, we\u2019ve been advocating publicly available data. We are looking toward a \u201chospice compare\u201d tool, published by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Affordable Care Act requires public reporting on hospice care. And fortunately, there\u2019s been a tradition of hospices conducting evaluations by primary caregivers, who are intimately familiar with the care of the patient. But that data is not yet available to the public.\n\nQ.\n\nSimilar to Medicare\u2019s Nursing Home Compare site? When will that happen?\n\nA.\n\nIt\u2019s coming, but all too slowly. My guess is, it will be two to four years.\n\nQ.\n\nIn the meantime, how can families interview hospices about which services they provide?\n\nA.\n\nYou might find they\u2019ll come to your home to do an assessment of whether someone is eligible. That\u2019s a time to ask questions. Or you can call on the phone. How receptive a hospice is to these questions is the first signal of their quality.\n\nQ.\n\nYou advise asking how long a hospice has been in operation.\n\nA.\n\nHospices in some communities come and go. You want to be sure you\u2019re not signing up with one that\u2019s been around a few months or even a year. More established hospices are more stable, and more people can tell you about them. The physician you\u2019re working with may have heard about their reputations.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat else?\n\nA.\n\nResponse times. That\u2019s part of hospices\u2019 standardized surveys. They ask family members, after death, whether the staff was available on weekends and on evenings. It\u2019s one of many measures that aren\u2019t available to the public yet, but it\u2019s a fair question to ask: What can you tell me about your staff\u2019s response time should I need your services on the weekend or on evenings? How long will I have to wait in an urgent situation?\n\nQ.\n\nAren\u2019t all hospices that provide benefits through Medicare required to provide the same services?\n\nA.\n\nThere\u2019s a set of services that\u2019s standard, but how much, what the intensity is \u2014 that varies a lot. Consumers need to know that.\n\n\u201cContinuous care,\u201d for instance. There comes a time when you\u2019re actively dying, in your last hours of life, and that calls for continuous care, 24/7. You want to ask whether it\u2019s their practice to keep a nurse or another clinician in the home when a patient is actively dying. Does the family get support? Do they see the patient through death?\n\nYou would hope that in the last hours of life, a hospice would maintain its presence, especially if you\u2019re in your own home. But as the Washington Post just reported \u2014 and it was very disturbing \u2014 some hospices choose not to provide continuous care. In some states, a large percentage don\u2019t, which basically means that when you\u2019re actively dying, they don\u2019t stick around.\n\nAnother important question: Do you have an inpatient facility, in case my symptoms become complicated? Most hospices don\u2019t have their own facilities, but they can rent or manage a unit in a hospital or beds dispersed throughout a hospital or in a nursing home. The point is to have the capacity to manage your symptoms when they\u2019re not manageable at home.\n\nQ.\n\nRespite care is a required service, right? To give families a break if caregiving for the patient becomes exhausting?\n\nA.\n\nYes, but it\u2019s not specific, so it\u2019s also a good question to ask: What kind of respite care do you offer, under what circumstances? Would it be a nurse or aide who comes, or a volunteer? Do you provide it once a week or twice? For how long?\n\nQ.\n\nIt will be difficult for patients or families to undertake this research if they\u2019ve waited until a few days before death. It sounds like another argument for enrolling in hospice early. But then, patients can get bounced from hospice if they don\u2019t show measurable decline.\n\nA.\n\nYou have to assess your risk. If you\u2019re a cancer patient, the issue of being discharged probably won\u2019t come up. But if you have Alzheimer\u2019s or A.L.S., they\u2019re terminal diseases, but they can take years. You probably have to be prepared to go through reviews.\n\nSo you have to be realistic about how long hospice will take care of you. You\u2019ll be aware of it. You won\u2019t be surprised.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140617134319, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 17, 2014", "keywords": "Elder Care,Hospice Care,End-of-Life Care", "GBLC": "End-of-Life Care", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/How to Choose a Hospice ( 20140617 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Paula Span", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Paula Span", "byl": "Paula Span", "twitter": {"description": "The president of the American Hospice Foundation offers some questions to ask when selecting hospice care.", "title": "How to Choose a Hospice", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/how-to-choose-a-hospice/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/06/17/health/naierman_noa/naierman_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "description": "The president of the American Hospice Foundation offers some questions to ask when selecting hospice care.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 17, 2014", "article": {"tag": "End-of-Life Care", "published_time": 1403026999, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T17:43:19-04:00"}, "utime": 20140617174319, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140617, "pdate": 20140617, "des": "Elder Care;Hospice Care", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/06/17/health/naierman_noa/naierman_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "The president of the American Hospice Foundation offers some questions to ask when selecting hospice care.", "title": "How to Choose a Hospice", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/how-to-choose-a-hospice/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/06/17/health/naierman_noa/naierman_noa-superJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/how-to-choose-a-hospice/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How to Choose a Hospice", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/06/17/health/naierman_noa/naierman_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe483d\"", "article_summary": "Even as Americans make greater use of hospice care, families often don\u2019t grasp that in most places they have a choice of programs.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires public reporting on hospice care.\nSo families have to shop around for the best hospice care?\nAs a parting gift, however, Ms. Naierman \u2014 a hospice executive for more than 30 years \u2014 has passed along some consumer advice.\nBut as the Washington Post just reported \u2014 and it was very disturbing \u2014 some hospices choose not to provide continuous care."}
