Analysts polled by financial information provider SIX expected a net profit of 567.25 million kronor for the quarter.\n\nSecuritas, which provides security services like guarding and technology solutions, has set out to increase sales of security solutions and technology to a run rate of 18% by the end of 2015, up from 6% in 2012 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nHowever, it said the outcome of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. coupled with increased growth of guarding contracts means the target is now \"likely out of reach.\"\n\nThe company added that it is compliant with the Affordable Care Act and does not expect any negative impact on its results as it has fully mitigated the cost.\n\nSales in the quarter rose to 18.9 billion kronor, up from 16.73 billion kronor in the year-earlier period. Operating profit increased to 943.7 million kronor, from 791 million kronor a year ago.\n\nThe company said security solutions and technology sales amounted to 6.5 billion kronor in 2014 and grew with 28% compared to 2013 and that it expects this business area to deliver sales in at least the same range in 2015.\n\nOrganic sales growth was 5% in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago, and the improvement was reflected in all business segments, the company said.\n\nWrite to Anna Molin at anna.molin@wsj.com\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Anna Molin", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/securitas-net-profit-beats-expectations-2015-02-05", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Securitas net profit beats expectations"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Securitas net profit beats expectations", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-05T04:13:00-05:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Anna Molin", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/securitas-net-profit-beats-expectations-2015-02-05", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "66054EF9-571A-4DDA-984C-5D9D7612D57F"}, "article_summary": "Operating profit increased to 943.7 million kronor, from 791 million kronor a year ago.\nAnalysts polled by financial information provider SIX expected a net profit of 567.25 million kronor for the quarter.\nSales in the quarter rose to 18.9 billion kronor, up from 16.73 billion kronor in the year-earlier period.\nOrganic sales growth was 5% in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago, and the improvement was reflected in all business segments, the company said.\nSecuritas, which provides security services like guarding and technology solutions, has set out to increase sales of security solutions and technology to a run rate of 18% by the end of 2015, up from 6% in 2012 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014."}
