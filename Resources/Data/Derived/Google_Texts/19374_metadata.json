Cruz\u2019s opinion rubbed some of the audience members the wrong way, prompting a flurry of boos and a rebuke from Colbert.\n\nColbert brought up the topic following with a lengthy discussion with Cruz on how could argue that he is emulating Ronald Reagan while also opposing some of his approaches on amnesty and taxes. Colbert stated that marriage is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, to which Cruz reiterated his familiar view that under the 10th Amendment, such unmentioned matters should be left up to the decisions of the states, rather than the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s in the Bill of Rights, everything that\u2019s not mentioned is left to the states\u201d Cruz argued. He continued to explain himself, at which point, Colbert had to step in due to some audible booing from the audience.\n\n\u201cGuys, guys, however you feel, he\u2019s my guest so don\u2019t boo him,\u201d Colbert said, before allowing Cruz to continue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should entrust governing our society to five unelected lawyers in Washington,\u201d Cruz continued, arguing that the only way to properly decide on rules and issues was through elections.\n\nWatch below (starting at 3:10) via CBS:\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "During Ted Cruz's appearance last night on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert brought up his opposition to same-sex marriage.
