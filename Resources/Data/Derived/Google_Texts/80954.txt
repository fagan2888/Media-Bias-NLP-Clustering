Donald Trump’s popularity with Republican voters is a result of their frustration with the Republican party, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan said today.

“People are frustrated that, I think, they are frustrated that Republicans have not fought hard enough to stop some of the things that (President) Obama has done,” Jordan, R-Urbana, said in an interview.

Jordan represents Ohio’s 4th Congressional District, which includes Seneca County. He is in Findlay today to attend the memorial service for former U.S. Rep. Michael Oxley, who died Jan. 1.

Jordan said Republicans believe their representatives should have fought harder to prevent passage of Obamacare and other tax-and-spend legislation.

“60 percent of Republican voters feel that Republican leaders in Congress had betrayed them. Not just disappointed, not just not fighting hard enough. Betrayal,” Jordan said, citing a Washington Post poll conducted in September.

Republicans are looking for an outsider for president. That’s why in the Iowa Caucus this week, 29 percent favored U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; 25 percent favored Trump, nearly 10 percent favored physician Ben Carson and 2 percent favored former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Jordan said.

“About 65 percent of R’s in Iowa want guys from outside the establishment,” Jordan said.
