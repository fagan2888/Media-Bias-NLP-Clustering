They\u2019ve shown that everyone is guilty except the murderers. If you interview any of the prisoners at the Green Bay Correctional Institution, you will discover that just about everyone there is not guilty of the crime they are incarcerated for. They were framed, or are the victim of circumstances or their upbringing or environment or abuse.\n\nI believe the law says a person should get a fair trial, not a perfect trial. In dealing with people, none are perfect. Monday morning quarterbacks are in abundance.\n\nI do not believe the people on the jury that convicted Avery and Brendan Dassey are stupid people. They looked at all of the facts and decided on a verdict \u2014 guilty. Why not just accept their decision.\n\nRalph Gajefsky\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1Ty2CT8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Everyone who\u2019s in prison says they\u2019re innocent", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Everyone who\u2019s in prison says they\u2019re innocent", "title": "Accept jury\u2019s decision in Avery, Dassey cases", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/02/21/accept-jurys-decision-avery-dassey-cases/80698136/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Everyone who\u2019s in prison says they\u2019re innocent", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e20a9bf48f1cd4a646f3dc6f20cfe2c72ff3952/c=46-0-1154-1108&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/21/GreenBay/B9321027304Z.1_20160221080847_000_GC1DH7C4U.1-0.jpg", "title": "Accept jury\u2019s decision in Avery, Dassey cases", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey (Photo: AP)DE PERE - If the Steven Avery case is ever finally decided, you\u2019ll be able to print the paper on a post card.\nI do not believe the people on the jury that convicted Avery and Brendan Dassey are stupid people.\nI believe the law says a person should get a fair trial, not a perfect trial.\nIf the goal of \u201cMaking A Murderer\u201d was to get a lot of notoriety and make a lot of money, they have accomplished their goals.\nWhy not just accept their decision."}
