Madeline Stuart, an 18-year-old girl with Down syndrome, has been taking the modeling world by storm. Her latest win comes courtesy of this year's upcoming New York Fashion Week, where she'll be walking on behalf of the Christopher Reeve Foundation.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Madeline’s mother Rosanne said that her daughter has been booking shoots internationally, as well as fielding several modeling requests since her Facebook photos went viral earlier this year. In addition to booking the iconic catwalk, Stuart will also be the face of a new handbag line from EverMaya, which she herself has inspired. When Cosmo asked Rosanne if she felt the world was ready for a model like Stuart, Rosanne’s answer was a resounding yes.

“The world wants to be inclusive, it just hasn't had anyone on such a platform that they were able to do it easily… Imagine in 10 years what society will be like for people with disabilities," she said. "It's not going to be how it is now, it's going to be the norm."

As for Stuart's growing social media presence, Rosanne says it’s a result of her daughter's hard work and determination in spite of her disability; this is what truly catches people’s attention. “There hadn't been anyone who chased this dream, whereas Madeline really chased it," she said.

Ultimately, Rosanne said her daughter's modeling career is about so much more than just taking pictures. Instead, Stuart hopes she can spread a hopeful message, that anyone, despite their differences, can do exactly what she’s doing right now.
