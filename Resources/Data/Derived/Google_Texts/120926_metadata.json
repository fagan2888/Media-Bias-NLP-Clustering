He continues to criss-cross the country in an effort to drum up support for what is becoming increasingly an inevitable presidential bid. He\u2019s trying to present himself as a fresh new face to folks in places like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. But Marco Rubio has proven that he\u2019s not a leader with fresh ideas. He\u2019s a follower who is peddling a tired Republican playbook. At every turn, Marco has pandered to the Republican base instead of doing what\u2019s best for Floridians and folks across the country.\n\nUmm, does she not realize how hypocritical she is when she accuses Rubio of doing the exact same thing she does on a regular basis? Of course not.\n\nHis record makes clear that he has no new ideas and is simply a self-interested and opportunistic politician.\n\nWasserman Schultz lives by the Democrat playbook of divisive politics and has \u201cpandered\u201d to the liberal base of her party in her efforts to push President Obama\u2019s failed and dangerously un-American political, economic, and foreign policy agendas.\n\nHe was for his own immigration plan before he was against it. He abandoned his constituents in need of health care and helped Ted Cruz shut down the government in an attempt to de-fund Obamacare. A reckless move that cost our economy $24 billion.\n\nWhile Rubio and Cruz did the right thing by holding firm on defunding the \u201creckless\u201d Obamacare law, she\u2019s got a point about his flip-flop on immigration,\n\nHis tax plan hurts hard-working American families and slashes taxes for the wealthy and powerful corporations. And it does all of this while increasing the deficit \u2014 increasing the deficit. He wants to raise the Social Security retirement age. His so-called plan to replace the Affordable Care Act gets rid of Medicare as we know it. And he actually said that Medicare and Social Security have \u201cweakened\u201d us as a people.\n\nWasserman Schultz has praised all of Obama\u2019s across-the-board tax hikes that make it almost impossible for small businesses to grow. As far as Rubio wanting to get rid of Obamacare, bravo. The healthcare plan has proven to be nothing more than the \u201clargest job killer,\u201d as Cruz recently stated.\n\nMarco Rubio says he\u2019s a new type of Republican, but all he has done is champion the same failed GOP policies that the American people have repeatedly rejected time and again.\n\nThis is funny. In the 2014 election cycle, Americans came out to reject all of the failed Obama and Democrat policies that have stifled job growth and prosperity since 2008.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio once told his students at FIU that he and Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been good friends since their days in the FL Legislature.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Marco Rubio once told his students at FIU that he and Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been good friends since their days in the FL Legislature.", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz Really Isn't Marco Rubio's Friend - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Debbie-Wasserman-Shultz-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/27/debbie-wasserman-schultz-really-isnt-marco-rubios-friend/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio once told his students at FIU that he and Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been good friends since their days in the FL Legislature.", "creator": "@THESHARKTANK1", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Debbie-Wasserman-Shultz-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz Really Isn't Marco Rubio's Friend - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, democrats, DNC, Florida, Marco Rubio, Obama, obamacare, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,marco rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-03-27T20:58:54-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1559\"", "article_summary": "Wasserman Schultz has praised all of Obama\u2019s across-the-board tax hikes that make it almost impossible for small businesses to grow.\nAs Rubio ramps up for a potential run for president in 2016, Wasserman Schultz has also stepped up her criticism of Rubio.\nDuring a phone interview released by the Democrat Party, Wasserman Schultz laid into Rubio.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenator Marco Rubio once told his students at Florida International University that he and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D) had been good friends since their days in the Florida Legislature.\nBut Marco Rubio has proven that he\u2019s not a leader with fresh ideas."}
