Participants were questioned about their smoking habits and history, as well as asked to respond to the question, \u201cHow soon after you wake up do you usually smoke your first cigarette of the day?\u201d This was measured as \u201ctime to first cigarette\u201d (TTFC).\n\n\u201cAn individual smoker\u2019s risk for developing lung or head and neck cancer may be related to how dependent they are on nicotine,\u201d Dr. Michael B. Steinberg, editorial board member of HemOnc Today, said in an interview. \u201cAsking a question like \u2018How soon do you smoke in the morning?\u2019 may be a way of getting at that information and giving an individual their own risk for developing cancer.\u201d\n\nOut of the 3,249 smokers from the EAGLE study, 1,812 of them were lung cancer patients, and 1,437 were control subjects. The researchers found that the lung cancer risk was significantly higher in people who reported shorter TTFC. Interestingly, risk of lung cancer in relation to TTFC was higher in lighter smokers compared to heavy smokers. \u201cAssessing TTFC may improve lung cancer risk prediction and could be useful in lung cancer screening and smoking cessation programs,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nOther studies, such as one conducted in Japan last year, also found a link between time to first cigarette and lung cancer. So pay attention, smokers \u2014 even if you don\u2019t smoke one or two packs a day, but consider yourself an \u201coccasional\u201d smoker \u2014 the sooner you start inhaling tobacco in the morning, the more you\u2019ll increase your risk for lung cancer.\n\nOne study completed by Joshua Muscat of the department of public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine found a link between TTFC and both head and neck cancer. \u201cThere is clearly inter-individual variability in the way smokers regulate their nicotine intake per cigarette, with increasing frequency in a natural setting and in attempting to quit,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt is not feasible to measure how smokers regulate their nicotine uptake in studies of disease risk, but the TTFC is a behavior that is strongly associated with the level of cotinine per cigarette smoked. TTFC is a distinct nicotine dependence phenotype and was also shown to be an independent risk factor for lung cancer in the current study.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tobacco, cigarettes, smoking, time to first cigarette", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have identified the link between the amount of time people smoke cigarettes after waking up to an increased risk for lung cancer.", "title": "Don't Smoke In Bed: Your Morning Cigarette Ups Your Lung Cancer Risk Even More", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/time-first-cigarette-morning-associated-increased-lung-cancer-risk-289100", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/smoking-cigarettes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have identified the link between the amount of time people smoke cigarettes after waking up to an increased risk for lung cancer.", "title": "Don't Smoke In Bed: Your Morning Cigarette Ups Your Lung Cancer Risk Even More", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/time-first-cigarette-morning-associated-increased-lung-cancer-risk-289100", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/smoking-cigarettes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/smoking-cigarettes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-19T18:10:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T18:15:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have identified the link between the amount of time people smoke cigarettes after waking up to an increased risk for lung cancer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3bb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAssessing TTFC may improve lung cancer risk prediction and could be useful in lung cancer screening and smoking cessation programs,\u201d the authors conclude.\nOther studies, such as one conducted in Japan last year, also found a link between time to first cigarette and lung cancer.\nThe researchers found that the lung cancer risk was significantly higher in people who reported shorter TTFC.\nInterestingly, risk of lung cancer in relation to TTFC was higher in lighter smokers compared to heavy smokers.\nTTFC is a distinct nicotine dependence phenotype and was also shown to be an independent risk factor for lung cancer in the current study.\u201d"}
