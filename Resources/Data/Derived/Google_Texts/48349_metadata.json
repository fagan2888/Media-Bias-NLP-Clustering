My health insurance provider Blue Cross Blue Shield has confirmed that fact to me. Yet Express Scripts, a separate company my Blue plan uses for prescription coverage, insists that my Blue plan doesn\u2019t offer a zero co-pay for me. What\u2019s going on? I\u2019ve called and called and called. Where can I file a complaint against Express Scripts?\n\nA: You\u2019re definitely right in principle. Under Obamacare, women have been entitled to a range of preventive services for more than a year, including birth control products and services, all at no additional costs. Your health plan premiums cover those costs in full.\n\n\u201cStarting a year ago, women of all walks of life began to get both birth control and important well-women checkups at no cost for the first time,\u201d said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, recently. \u201cThis is the big story of the Affordable Care Act\u2014the steady, historic progress for women.\u201d\n\nHowever, not every particular contraceptive is covered under the law. The Affordable Care Act requires just one form or brand of each of the 15 or so birth control methods\u2014pills, rings, IUDs, implants, patch, injections and so on\u2014to be covered.\n\nSo it seems to me that you have a simple problem. The particular form or brand of birth control you are using is not on your Blue Cross plan\u2019s approved list. For example, your brand-name pill\u2014or even your specific generic\u2014may not be included.\n\nAs straightforward as that problem sounds, you\u2019re learning how tricky the solution can be.\n\nIn a rational world, you\u2019d think you could call Express Scripts and find out what specific pill or other form of birth control is covered.\n\nHowever, generally third-party providers like Express Scripts are set up to do is tell you whether the exact pill or form you\u2019re asking about pops up as approved on its computer screen. If it does, great! You\u2019re covered; Express Scripts fills your prescription at no extra cost. But when it does not\u2014as in your case\u2014Express Scripts just tells you that you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nBefore you look for a lawyer, go back to Blue Cross and get a supervisor to give you the full list of the contraceptive products and services your health plan covers, including brand names and dosages if applicable. Blue Cross should help sort this out for you.\n\nThen talk to your doctor. Ask whether there is an approved product or service that would be safe and effective for you. Chances are, you\u2019ll have several options, at no extra cost. And if you have special medical needs, your doctor should want to help you seek a waiver for your particular contraceptive from Blue Cross.\n\nIf you\u2019re still having trouble, go to the National Women\u2019s Law Center website at nwlc.org. That non-profit women\u2019s advocacy group has an excellent \u201ctoolkit\u201d for women who are denied the preventive services they deserve, including form letters for formal appeals and waivers.\n\nStudies done before the ACA became law have documented that birth control has been costly for women\u2014and the nation. Half of all women of reproductive age said they didn\u2019t use birth control because of the costs, which can climb to $1,000 or more a year for IUDs and implants, the most effective forms of contraception. And the high costs, in turn, contribute to the nation\u2019s 1.6 million unintended pregnancies a year at an estimated cost of $12.5 billion in public assistance.\n\nOver time, the ACA\u2019s birth control benefits should reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and the drain on the national budget.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, doctors, Frank Lalli, health, health care costs, healthcare, insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, medications, Obamacare, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, rx, save on prescriptions", "author": "Frank Lalli", "og": {"url": "http://parade.com/219546/franklalli/does-my-health-plan-cover-contraceptives-or-not/", "site_name": "Parade", "image": "http://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/birth-control-pill-ftr.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Does My Health Plan Cover Contraceptives or Not?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Q: Under the Affordable Care Act, I qualify for contraceptive services as part of my health plan at no extra cost.
