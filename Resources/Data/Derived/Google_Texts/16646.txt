Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that President Barack Obama was such a weakling, he let himself get “pushed around” by 60 Minutes‘ Steve Kroft.

Christie chalked up Vladimir Putin‘s military incursions in Syria to “the fundamental failure of Barack Obama’s approach to foreign policy. Because he thinks if you do nothing you can’t get in trouble. That’s what he thinks.”

The New Jersey governor said that Putin was “punching above his weight,” and if he were president, he would smack him down with a no-fly zone. “And my first phone call would be to Vladimir. And I’d say, ‘Listen, we’re enforcing this no-fly zone. And I mean we’re enforcing it against anyone, including you. So don’t try me. Don’t try me. Because I’ll do it.”

“And this weakling in the White House– who got pushed around last night, by the way, by Steve Kroft. We saw that. I mean pushed around by Kroft. I mean, when Kroft starts pushing the president around because he’s basically been his, you know, buddy for the last seven years…”
