Of those seven cases, Belmont Abbey College, The Catholic University of America, Thomas Aquinas College and several Catholic high schools would be immediately affected. Catholic colleges and high schools with open cases will also be affected once the decision trickles down through the courts.\n\nThe Newman Society was invited by the U.S. bishops to join the brief alongside the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance; World Vision, Inc.; Catholic Relief Services; Family Research Council; Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities; and the Thomas More Society.\n\n\u201cThe [Newman] Society serves many Catholic schools and colleges across the country which are subject to the HHS mandate, despite the fact that it conflicts with their sincerely-held religious beliefs,\u201d the brief stated. Furthermore, the Newman Society\u2019s own employee health insurance plan, The Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, is one of the petitioners included in the Little Sisters of the Poor lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d said Laird. \u201cThere are major public consequences if faith-based organizations cannot continue to minister in schools, colleges and universities; in hospitals; and in other faith-based organizations such as The Cardinal Newman Society.\u201d\n\nThe brief paid particular attention to the services provided by Catholic education \u201cthat government and other organizations cannot reproduce easily or at all, and whose effectiveness government and secular organizations cannot match,\u201d and what society risks losing by imposing the mandate on Catholic schools:\n\nFaith-based elementary and secondary schools make a distinctive contribution to the education of the Nation\u2019s children that public schools have been unable to match. In 2015, the combined average SAT score for students from religious schools was 1596 points, or 134 points higher, than the average score of 1462 for public school students. Students in religious schools are safer than students in public schools, as measured by fewer instances of violent crime and bullying. A higher percentage of students in religious schools report feeling safe from attack or harm in school compared to their public school peers.\n\nAdditionally, Catholic universities and colleges produce a \u201cdisproportionately high number of graduates,\u201d especially in areas of national need such as nursing and teacher education. Catholic higher education also \u201cretains students through graduation at a higher rate than those colleges and universities without religious affiliation,\u201d according ACCU data compiled in the brief.\n\nThe brief continued:\n\nAre we really to understand from the government that these and other faith-based institutions, and the faith that inspires them, are simply irrelevant to the common good? Must all organizations \u2014 even those founded upon and motivated by sincere religious convictions \u2014 either conform to the Executive Branch\u2019s views on sexual ethics or stop serving the public? Is this the price that has to be paid by American society simply for a religiously-affiliated organization to do good works?\n\nSeveral of the other arguments presented in the brief are:\n\nThat the current mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering compelling government interest.\n\nThat the mandate would do more harm than good by subjecting faith-based organizations (FBOs) to millions of dollars in fines for non-compliance, and requiring contraceptive coverage would lead to financial ruin for these organizations and their employees.\n\nThat the cost of replacing FBO services, which provide charitable services and aid valued in the billions of dollars, would be crippling to local and federal government and communities.\n\nThat the supposed \u201caccommodation\u201d is not \u201cjust a form\u201d but a formal cooperation which places a substantial burden on one\u2019s religious freedom and therefore is anything but accommodating.\n\n\u201cA recurring motif in this litigation has been the suggestion, by the government and even some courts, that the petitioners are required to sign \u2018just a form\u2019 and, for that reason, are not substantially burdened in their religious freedom,\u201d the brief stated, noting the language used in the decision issued by the 7th Circuit Court in University of Notre Dame v. Burwell.\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nAny such formal cooperation in signing the form could lead to further religious freedom issues down the road, the brief argued. While the case, as it stands, is only \u201ctangentially about contraception,\u201d the federal government could foreseeably force religious organizations to not only obtain drugs and procedures that violate religious convictions, but also require mandatory coverage of abortion \u2014 a step already taken in California \u2014 or mandate physician assisted suicide, which is now legal in at least four states, as necessary \u201chealth\u201d coverage.\n\n\u201cThat people throughout history have been willing to die for the sake of a religious obligation,\u201d the brief stated, \u201cis a testament to the seriousness, persistence and depth of religious conviction.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Society, along with the other petitioners and FBOs, now await the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in March with an impending decision likely in June.\n\n\u201cI have full confidence that the Court will support the petitioners and allow non-profit faith-based organizations an exemption from the HHS Mandate,\u201d said Laird.\n\nReprinted with permission from The Cardinal Newman Society.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "The amicus brief called on the Justices to reverse the decisions made by lower courts threatening the religious freedom of the Little Sisters of the Poor and other petitioners, including Catholic schools.", "title": "SCOTUS brief against HHS mandate defends Catholic education", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/scotus_brief.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/scotus-brief-against-hhs-mandate-defends-catholic-education", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "The amicus brief called on the Justices to reverse the decisions made by lower courts threatening the religious freedom of the Little Sisters of the Poor and other petitioners, including Catholic schools."}, "description": "The amicus brief called on the Justices to reverse the decisions made by lower courts threatening the religious freedom of the Little Sisters of the Poor and other petitioners, including Catholic schools.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe51aa\"", "article_summary": "Students in religious schools are safer than students in public schools, as measured by fewer instances of violent crime and bullying.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s \u201cHHS Mandate\u201d is the \u201celephant in the room\u201d threatening faithful Catholic education, said Bob Laird, vice president for program development at the Newman Society.\nCatholic colleges and high schools with open cases will also be affected once the decision trickles down through the courts.\n\u201cThe [Newman] Society serves many Catholic schools and colleges across the country which are subject to the HHS mandate, despite the fact that it conflicts with their sincerely-held religious beliefs,\u201d the brief stated.\nOf those seven cases, Belmont Abbey College, The Catholic University of America, Thomas Aquinas College and several Catholic high schools would be immediately affected."}
