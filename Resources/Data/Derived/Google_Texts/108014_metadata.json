The three amigos have been giddily prodding each other to boost bigger since grade school, competing in first amateur, then junior, and, most recently, professional halfpipe contests.\n\nThe game turned serious in 2011 when Yater-Wallace exploded, throwing progressive double-flipping tricks in the pipe and becoming the youngest athlete at age 15 to medal at the Winter X Games.\n\n\u201cThat really pushed Lyman and I to really get to where he was. Both Lyman and I, at that time, were setting our hopes higher when we saw our good friend doing well,\u201d said Blunck, whose baby-face masks an aggressive, predatory athleticism in the pipe.\n\nThose hopes are anchored in the most progressive tricks ever seen in the halfpipe. All three spin the gymnastic double-cork 1260; two backflips while rotating three-and-a-half times above a 22-foot wall of ice. Their creative fire fuels a technical, style-soaked trickery that elevated them to not just the country\u2019s first-ever Olympic ski halfpipe team, but as medal contenders for the sport\u2019s Olympic debut.\n\n\u201cWhen we started competing it wasn\u2019t even talked about that this would be an Olympic sport,\u201d said Currier, whose dad, David Currier, skied in the 1972 Olympics as a 19-year-old. \u201cAs soon as it got admitted as an Olympic sport in 2011, it was on all our minds. It\u2019s amazing to be here with two Colorado boys, representing Colorado the best we can.\u201d\n\nThe fellas are silly, as teenage pals usually are. Currier\u2019s Twitter handle is an unabashed \u201c@urmotherlovesme.\u201d Yater-Wallace likes to either wag his tongue or strike gangster poses when photographed. His first Tweet upon arriving in Sochi? Urging Emma Watson to respond because \u201cit\u2019s the only way I will medal at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThe three goof with each other, chase girls and generally act their age.\n\nElevating good times over gold medals is a lesson Yater-Wallace has imparted to his pals; something learned after two years as a teenage pioneer navigating under freeskiing\u2019s brightest spotlight.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from Torin is to just have fun at every competition and just be happy if you can put down a run that you are happy with,\u201d said Currier, whose first hit in the pipe is a double-cork switch 1080, one of the discipline\u2019s most difficult tricks. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to have one of my idols be younger than me.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t be fooled by the trio\u2019s it\u2019s-all-a-party facade. These guys are fierce competitors. Stone-faced atop the pipe, bobbing to their tunes, all three are more than capable of capturing the world\u2019s first Olympic gold medal in the ski halfpipe.\n\nBut first they have to get past David Wise, the experienced and often golden veteran, who at 23 plays the role of big brother to his ever-goofing underlings.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have some fun times on the road,\u201d said Wise, a husband and father who first qualified for the team two months ago after a red-hot streak of wins he hopes to carry into the pipe at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. \u201cBeing a teenager on the road is a pretty interesting experience but sometimes I have to be like \u2018Guys it\u2019s time to stop throwing bread at people, tone it down a little bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nWise feels the heat from his teammates, who, aside from heavy-hitting Canadians Justin Dorey and Mike Riddle, and Frenchman Kevin Rolland, represent his biggest obstacles to Olympic gold.\n\n\u201cHaving these guys around basically just ensures that I can never take a breather. No matter what I learn or how much I progress, they are right there behind me,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThat makes the sport more exciting.\u201d\n\nThe men compete in both qualifiers and finals for ski halfpipe on Tuesday Feb. 18.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ski halfpipe,Sochi Olympics", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Olympics", "description": "Torin Yater-Wallace, Aaron Blunck and Lyman Currier are Colorado's teenage triple threat for first-ever Olmypic medals in the debut of ski halfpipe", "title": "Yater-Wallace, Blunck, Currier Colorado vie for Olympic halfpipe medal", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2014/02/07/yater-wallace-blunck-currier-colorados-teenage-triple-threat-olympic-glory/26310/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2014/02/DSC_0521-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Torin Yater-Wallace, Aaron Blunck and Lyman Currier are Colorado's teenage triple threat for first-ever Olmypic medals in the debut of ski halfpipe", "title": "Yater-Wallace, Blunck, Currier are Colorado\u2019s teenage triple-threat for Olympic glory", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2014/02/07/yater-wallace-blunck-currier-colorados-teenage-triple-threat-olympic-glory/26310/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2014/02/DSC_0521-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Torin Yater-Wallace, Aaron Blunck and Lyman Currier are Colorado's teenage triple threat for first-ever Olmypic medals in the debut of ski halfpipe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2f9\"", "article_summary": "Boulder\u2019s Lyman Currier, 19, Aspen\u2019s Torin Yater-Wallace, 18, and Crested Butte\u2019s Aaron Blunck, 17, are Colorado\u2019s teenage triple threat for Olympic glory.\nA trio of high-flying teens from Colorado represent the country\u2019s best hope for an Olympic medal-harvest in the halfpipe.\nTheir creative fire fuels a technical, style-soaked trickery that elevated them to not just the country\u2019s first-ever Olympic ski halfpipe team, but as medal contenders for the sport\u2019s Olympic debut.\nStone-faced atop the pipe, bobbing to their tunes, all three are more than capable of capturing the world\u2019s first Olympic gold medal in the ski halfpipe.\n\u201cWhen we started competing it wasn\u2019t even talked about that this would be an Olympic sport,\u201d said Currier, whose dad, David Currier, skied in the 1972 Olympics as a 19-year-old."}
