An arrest is not a presumption of guilt.\n\nAt least 30 vehicles at one apartment complex in Marana have had their tires slashed, according to Sgt. Chris Warren, a spokesman with the Marana Police Department.\n\nDetectives are on scene at the Springs at Continental Ranch Apartments, 7901 N. Cortaro Road, investigating the incident.\n\nMarana police received several calls overnight about the slashed tires.\n\nDozens of people at the apartment complex woke up in the morning ready to go to work or even run errands but they were in for a big surprise.\n\nA driver with a nearby towing company said he has seen about 52 cars with their tires slashed.\n\nThe slashing appears to be random, as the suspect would slash one set of tires but not the car next to it, Warren said.\n\nJantzen Claybaugh said he noticed something was wrong when he left to grab a late-night snack.\n\n\"I get in my car, and it is all bumpy, and I'm thinking, 'What is going on?' And so I get out and check, and I notice three of my tires are flat, and it is just a terrible feeling,\" he said.\n\nMany others did not notice until Saturday, Feb. 27.\n\n\"It was very frustrating because I was running late to work. But thankfully I had my other car, so that was good. But it was extremely frustrating as I'm trying to get ready,\" said Joshua Stanback. \"It is just sad that someone would want to do this to people.\"\n\nThis is a serious crime, Warren said, and the person responsible for this could face felony criminal damage charges.\n\nAnyone with any information is asked to call the 88-CRIME anonymous tip line.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
