Too many will say: I am only one person. When asked why they do not exercise our constitutional right to vote for our governmental representatives they wonder if their one vote makes a difference.\n\nBut that is foolish as history has shown that \u201cone person\u201d can prevail.\n\nIt was one brave soldier standing alone during a mass protest who stopped a column of armed tanks in China on Tiananmen Square in 1989; one frail man named Mahatmas Gandhi who was the driving force behind banishing the British Empire from India; one conservative, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, who was the black community\u2019s conscience when it needed someone to articulate the horrors inflicted upon blacks by a racist Democratic South.\n\nEven before these 20th century [peaceful] activists, back in the 1860s, there was one conservative black Frederick Douglass. Douglas stood out as a champion of an enslaved people, the fight for their civil rights.\n\nFrederick Douglass made it his life\u2019s mission to rally others to join in with him in the liberation of his oppressed people. Born a slave, he died a millionaire in today\u2019s terms.\n\nLiberalism is no longer a closet philosophy for politicians\n\nOther men and women of courage, conviction and destiny have made a difference: Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Booker T. Washington, Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner.\n\nToday America is in need of such sons and daughters, born of virtue, courage and conviction to take the smallest action. They need to vote.\n\nMany see that the United States is drifting towards the edge of ruination. At the helm is a president who happens to preside over our moral and economic collapse while pressing on relentlessly with the left-wing agenda. Same-sex marriages, illegal aliens, an under-employed America and a potential $19 trillion deficit do not bode well for our future and this country\u2019s stability.\n\nBarack Hussein Obama has met with numerous world leaders, many of them not so friendly to this country, either then or now.\n\nYet, in his adopted home city of Chicago, where gangland shootings take place regularly, where body bags fill up, by the hour, where black on black crime runs rampant, this president has yet to seriously address the issue.\n\nAs the first black president, he could have met these gang leaders at a presidential sponsored summit to appeal to them on a personal level, and to impress upon them how dangerous and detrimental their life of crime is impacting their own neighborhoods in a negative way.\n\nHow bad is it in Chicago? Just over the Fourth of July weekend of this year, alone, 10 people were killed and 55 wounded by gunfire. Shootings rose by about 40 percent during the first three months of this year, according to March statistics released by Chicago Police Department. The mayor, Rahm Emanuel, seems clueless on how to decrease these figures.\n\nMake no mistake; this is largely black on black crime. Yet, when a white person, or a white cop, kills a black anywhere in America, the president cannot get to the podium fast enough to denounce it; neither can race baiters such as Jackson and Sharpton.\n\nThis is when the clueless come out with signs chanting \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d They ignore the subject of innocent black fetuses being aborted, thanks largely to the efforts of Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger and uninformed blacks who work for and support this organization.\n\nThough serving his last year in office, the president has opted to focus on, and press for, immigration reform. This is an agenda that will further impact the black community in a negative way in terms of employment opportunity.\n\nAfrican-Americans who have achieved higher-education degrees, a key investment leading to the middle class, still find themselves more likely to face long-term unemployment than their white, Hispanic and Asian counterparts, according to the Center for Popular Democracy.\n\nSome believe the president\u2019s end game is granting amnesty for over 30 million illegals and resettling hundreds of thousands of Muslims here in the United States. Not surprisingly, his party supports this president\u2019s efforts while the Republican leadership does not.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court \u2014 they have been missing in action for the past three years when it comes to defending, preserving and upholding the United States Constitution and the laws of the land.\n\nSo you ask, What can we do about it?\n\nAmericans can express their dismay and anger by voting in the next primary and election. Only then can we make a difference. History has shown that one man can effect positive change. Conservatives in this country number around 45 million strong, so if all would step up and vote, there\u2019s immense power in those numbers.\n\nUp until now, politicians, Sunday morning news pundits and Washington bureaucrats have an open microphone to sway voters, thanks to 24-hour news programs.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Americans to really listen to what is being said and recognizing what is unrealistic, not sell low-information voters a bad bill-of-goods.\n\nForbes writes (We\u2019ve Crossed The Tipping Point; Most Americans Now Receive Government Benefits):\n\n..perhaps 52 percent of U.S. households\u2014more than half\u2014now receive benefits from the government, thanks to President Obama. And Mr. Entitlement is just getting started. If Obamacare is not repealed millions more will join the swelling rolls of those dependent on government handouts.\n\nConservatives have long dreaded the day when the U.S. crossed the halfway mark because of all the implications for individual and fiscal responsibility. As Benjamin Franklin reportedly said, \u201cWhen the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\u201d They learned that from the 2008 election and turned out in big numbers again in 2012.\n\nOne popular agenda being pushed by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton is free college tuition \u2013 Bernie wants it at every academic institution, Clinton is calling for free public colleges.\n\nRemember what Franklin said above:\n\n\u201cWhen the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\u201d\n\nAnd college tuition is off the charts, most can agree. So maybe free college tuition is a great idea; however, no one is explaining who is going to pay for the professor\u2019s salary, buildings, campus maintenance, food, books and the necessary technology infrastructure necessary to support a child seeking the college experience.\n\nLook at the reasons parents choose private over public schools. They want a better eduction, higher test scores, smaller class size and more. If parents see that many [not all] public schools fail their children, why would we want to see college follow that same model?\n\nAnd how many of those students taking that free college will be looking not for education but a continuation of the high school experience and a delay of entering the work force. College should be something a student works for with grades, service participation, sports and learning to be a well-rounded person \u2013 a lesson that begins in the home.\n\nThe Democrats debate: \u2018Tax and spend. Here we go again\u2019\n\nNow it is our turn to voice our opinions at the ballot box, for conservatives, independents and libertarians to band together to make a difference in saving this republic. Even if the person presented by the GOP is not the person you want over others,\n\n\u2026we still need to vote for the party otherwise, liberals and progressives continue to rule the day.\n\nThe path will not always be smooth and easy. Most things worthwhile ever are. Just remember this.\n\nAs former military men, George Washington fought the good fight, Andrew Jackson fought the good fight, Ulysses S. Grant fought the good fight and Theodore Roosevelt fought the good fight while serving in the armed forces.\n\nProfessional military leaders such as Adm. Chester Nimitz and Gen. George S. Patton fought the good fight, as well, and all of these men did it against overwhelming odds and all of them prevailed.\n\nSome say, and truly believe, that the American political system is rigged, that the powers that be, like powerful fathom puppet masters, have often manipulated the results of elections so that it does not matter what the voter does, they still pull the strings.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who the president is when Valerie Jarrett is pulling the strings.\n\nThere is some truth in every urban legend, but it will take voters to weed out these myths and uproot these puppet masters and make the necessary changes to insure the integrity of our political system and our republic. We must all make a stand.\n\nLiberalism is no longer a closet philosophy for politicians\n\nThis is a nation with a history of breeding courageous fighters, and right now America needs fighters.\n\nThe next generation is counting on you showing up at the polls. including your children and grandchildren. Your decision to get involved and vote will impact their future in many ways.\n\nThat is why now is the time America.
