Deep in the heart of Lauderdale County, lies a patch of red dirt that excites rodeo fans twice a year. It's this dirt and the activities provided, that bring thousands to Lauderdale, for what has become known The Ralph Morgan Rodeo.

"We've been doing this rodeo for; it's the 79th semi-annual rodeo," Founder of the rodeo, Ralph Morgan stated. "The next rodeo will be 40 years that we've been doing this rodeo. We've always been successful, always have good crowds, good stock, and good food."

From young to old, the crowd is filled with spectators who have been coming for years all for various different reasons.

"Watching all the people rope," said rodeo attendee Jackson Pittman. "Ride the bulls, ride the horses. Me personally, I like chasing the cows, some of the funniest stuff ever."

"The cowboys, the cute cowboys," one attendee said.

While the summertime heat doesn't stop those from attending, many spectators agree on one thing, this years rodeo has been a stifling one.

"Too hot, way too hot," said one child.

"It's hot, really hot," exclaimed Pittman.

But that isn't stopping participators from wowing the crowds and continuing to follow their dreams.

"I did just do trail riding and then I went to a horse show and wanted to start barrel racing," Rodeo Participant Brooklee Smith said.

And as Mr. Ralph Morgan put it himself, you can expect the rodeo to be around for years to come.

"I asked my son, when I'm gone will he still have the rodeo," said Morgan. "His son Blaine, who is going to Mississippi State right now, said don't worry papaw, I'll carry the rodeo on if dad doesn't carry it on."

The final night of the 79th semi-annual rodeo is Saturday, August 8th. It kicks off at 7:30. Tickets are $10 dollars for adults and $6 for children.
