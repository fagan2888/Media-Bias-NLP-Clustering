Is there a stereotypical young demographic Obamacare advertising campaigns haven’t covered yet?

According to Conor Gaughan, one of the biggest barriers to getting gays signed up for Obamacare is its lack of sex appeal:

[...]December 23 is the final day to enroll in the health marketplace for coverage on January 1, 2014. The ACA’s impact on LGBT Americans is worth attention.

Qualifying for assistance, comparing plans and completing the application — it can be more time-consuming than holiday shopping. And, it’s a lot less sexy.

He’s thrilled to volunteer with Out2Enroll to help get the word out about the importance of enrolling in health insurance.

And to really get you in the spirit of an Obamacare Christmas, there’s this.

Again, not disgustingly stereotypical at all:
