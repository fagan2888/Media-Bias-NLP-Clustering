But even the most profound scientific knowledge won\u2019t solve world problems such as hunger, poverty and environmental damage if we fail to respect, understand and engage cultural differences.\n\nThe resistance to vaccine use is a prime example. The supposed link between autism and common childhood vaccines was based on fraudulent research published in the British journal The Lancet in 1998. After the fraud was uncovered the lead author was stripped of his medical license and the article was retracted. Subsequent investigations by the Department of Health in the U.K. and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in the U.S. as well as adefinitive study published in the August 2013 issue of The Journal of Pediatrics have all debunked the vaccine\u2013autism link. Yet the percentage of parents who delay or forgo immunization of their children has increased alarmingly in recent years and, partly as a result, measles, mumps and whooping cough are making a comeback.\n\nSimilarly, genetically modified organisms, global climate change and other scientific, medical and public health developments sometimes fail to gain public acceptance for reasons that lie far outside the realm of science. And that is not the fault of the public\u2014that is our fault as scientists. We have not been effective in explaining to the public the scientific method, the peer review system or the self-correcting nature of scientific research.\n\nWhen we can\u2019t make headway against misinformation campaigns based on bogus science or political agendas, clearly something more than the robustness of our data is at play. To use that classic line from the Paul Newman movie Cool Hand Luke, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got here is failure to communicate.\u201dScientists need not only to explain much more clearly and compellingly what we are doing but also to establish on social, cultural and emotional levels why our work is important. We need to respect cultural differences that lead to misunderstanding and even fear of science.\n\nToo often we also fail to respect opinions that differ from our own. Science is a process of iteration\u2014of back-and-forth\u2014and yet sometimes we scientists are guilty of promulgating our own biases. Our subsequent disagreements\u2014some based on differing data but many based on differing opinions\u2014make it that much more difficult for the public to know whom or what to believe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We can't begin to solve problems like poverty and climate change without understanding our cultural differences", "title": "Why scientists should embrace the liberal arts", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We can't begin to solve problems like poverty and climate change without understanding our cultural differences", "title": "Why scientists should embrace the liberal arts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/why_scientists_should_embrace_the_liberal_arts_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_103225520.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We can't begin to solve problems like poverty and climate change without understanding our cultural differences", "title": "Why scientists should embrace the liberal arts", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_103225520.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David J.
