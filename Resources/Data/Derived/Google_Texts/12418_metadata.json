The amount of money and the length of the reprieve is still being worked out, said a spokeswoman for Interfaith.\n\nOn Friday, weeks of mediation among Interfaith's unions, creditors, management and New York State officials appeared to have failed. The court was expected to file a closure order today. Interfaith would have started to shut operations on Jan. 7. The bankruptcy court already approved the transfer of some of Interfaith's outpatient facilities to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center.\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
