(Photo: Jay Pickthorn/AP)\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 Every day before sunrise, people stream through a nondescript door behind the county jail in South Dakota\u2019s largest city.\n\nWearing neatly pressed business suits, neon-green construction uniforms or even wrinkled pajamas, they\u2019re all here for the same reason: to prove they\u2019re not drunk.\n\nThese are participants in a South Dakota program that aims to reduce drunken driving and domestic violence by requiring offenders to prove twice a day that they have not been drinking.\n\nIn return, they stay out of jail.\n\nBolstered by South Dakota\u2019s success, the approach is now gaining momentum nationwide. North Dakota and Montana have started similar monitoring systems, and at least five more states are running or planning pilot programs. Other states are passing legislation to do the same.\n\n\u2018Blow hot,\u2019 go to jail\n\nSouth Dakota started the practice in 2005, offering those accused or convicted of an alcohol-related crime an alternative to jail. Participants are required to come to a testing site every morning and evening to blow into a Breathalyzer. Those who live farther away or who have trouble staying sober between tests wear alcohol-monitoring bracelets or have ignition interlock systems in their vehicles.\n\nParticipants who fail the test, or \u201cblow hot,\u201d are immediately jailed: 12 hours for the first offense, 24 hours for the second. If they fail a third time, they\u2019re incarcerated until a judge decides their fate.\n\nThose who run the program herald it as a common-sense solution to high rates of repeat drunken driving and domestic violence and a way to ease overcrowding in jails, which was why it was started in South Dakota.\n\nThe state once had one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of DUI arrests, and jail overcrowding was becoming a serious issue. That\u2019s when the program was created by then-Attorney General Larry Long.\n\n\u201cSimply warehousing people with chronic alcohol and drug offenses doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s never worked. And the key is changing behavior,\u201d said former Deputy Attorney General Bill Mickelson, who started working on the program in its infancy and now runs a consulting company that works to spread the idea to more states.\n\nMaking progress\n\nState officials are also quick to point out that the programs basically cost taxpayers nothing after they are up and running. Participants bear most of the financial burden, typically paying $1 to $3 per test.\n\nIn the past decade, more than 37,000 people have participated in South Dakota\u2019s twice-daily Breathalyzer program, compiling a pass rate of more than 99 percent.\n\nAt the Minnehaha County Jail in Sioux Falls, people of all stripes come during a three-hour window. Many stop on their way to work and again on their way home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been drinking for a long time,\u201d said Darryl Nave, a 52-year-old chef dressed in kitchen garb who\u2019s been in the program twice before. \u201cI blew hot a couple times, and then I did realize I can\u2019t lose my job. I need my job. I\u2019m supporting my family again.\u201d\n\nAn independent study released in 2013 by the RAND Corp., a nonprofit think tank, found that South Dakota\u2019s program cut the rate of repeat DUI arrests at the county level by 12 percent and domestic violence offenses by 9 percent in its first five years.\n\nIt was surprising at first that domestic violence offenses dropped by so much. But research has found that requiring large numbers of young to middle-aged men not to drink, even for a little while, can affect other behaviors, said Beau Kilmer, who conducted the study and continues to research the program.\n\nPilot programs\n\nIn Montana, the state started pilot programs in 2008 and expanded the system to 36 of its 56 counties. Preliminary research shows recidivism rates dropping by 40 percent to 70 percent.\n\nOne of the pilot programs is in Jacksonville, Florida, where authorities previously used ignition interlock systems. But studies showed that fewer than half of offenders ever got them installed, choosing instead to drive illegally or not at all.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, we didn\u2019t know if what works in South Dakota and some of these other states would really be the case in Florida,\u201d said Sue Holly, executive director of the Northeast Florida Safety Council, which oversees the program. \u201cBut we are seeing similar results. We are seeing people\u2019s lives changed.\u201d\n\nThe program isn\u2019t perfect. Administrators and participants at the Sioux Falls testing site acknowledged that some people still drink by calculating how much they can consume between tests without getting caught, but many are eventually busted.\n\nFor six months, Dan Fratze said he would drink vodka immediately after each test and be sober by the next one. It worked for a while.\n\nFratze, who said he has multiple DUIs, now wears an alcohol-monitoring bracelet that he said has helped him quit drinking. The bracelet monitors a person\u2019s \u201cinsensible perspiration\u201d every 30 minutes and alerts authorities if the device is tampered with.\n\nFor Eric Metcalf, a 21-year-old Sioux Falls man, the program has kept him accountable and sober at times when he said he needed it.\n\nIn March, he was arrested on suspicion of driving drunk and placed in the program, since it was his second DUI. Then in May, his brother was fatally shot in Rapid City, an act authorities believe was premeditated.\n\nAt the time, Metcalf said, he was depressed and worried he might do something he would regret. But he didn\u2019t, and now he plans to enter a substance-abuse program in Sioux Falls.\n\nThe regular tests, Metcalf said, \u201ckept me sober during that time. Being on the program helped save my life, I guess.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1KEhNnr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "States monitor alcohol offenders with twice-daily tests", "og": {"site_name": "Coloradoan", "description": "States monitor alcohol offenders with twice-daily tests", "title": "States monitor alcohol offenders with twice-daily tests", "url": "http://www.coloradoan.com/story/life/2015/09/27/states-monitor-alcohol-offenders-twice-daily-tests/72945434/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/coloradoan.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "States monitor alcohol offenders with twice-daily tests", "title": "States monitor alcohol offenders with twice-daily tests", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f52ae12ffdc97a2da50539d9d3046a4ae8aa4801/c=650-0-3250-2600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/27/FortCollins/B9319032149Z.1_20150927192522_000_GK3C29UDS.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@coloradoan", "site": "@coloradoan", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743847167", "fb": {"app_id": 140942715960163}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "But he didn\u2019t, and now he plans to enter a substance-abuse program in Sioux Falls.\nAt the Minnehaha County Jail in Sioux Falls, people of all stripes come during a three-hour window.\nAdministrators and participants at the Sioux Falls testing site acknowledged that some people still drink by calculating how much they can consume between tests without getting caught, but many are eventually busted.\nNorth Dakota and Montana have started similar monitoring systems, and at least five more states are running or planning pilot programs.\nAutumn Regimbal, 19, blows into a Breathalyzer in the wing of the county jail dedicated to the state\u2019s 24/7 Sobriety Program in Sioux Falls, S.D., on Sept. 21."}
