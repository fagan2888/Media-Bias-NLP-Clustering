While many officers are killed in the line of duty \u2013 27 in 2013 alone \u2013 the New York murders come after weeks of protests aimed at officers and encouraged by the president over the deaths of criminal suspects in Missouri and New York. And since the evidently deranged man who killed the officers seemed to have taken inspiration from the movement, there is a greater obligation for the president to speak forcefully. Another complicating factor: The New York killings come after two of the presidents\u2019 advisers on law enforcement issues, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and MSNBC host Al Sharpton, have spent weeks denouncing police misconduct. De Blasio even went so far as to say that he worried his own son, who is half African American, might be harmed by police. Obama has issued a written statement about the slain officers, but so far has not appeared publicly.\n\n\n\n[\u201cThis is an American problem. When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that\u2019s a problem. And it\u2019s my job as president to help solve it.\u201d \u2013 President Obama in public remarks on Dec. 3, the same day a New York grand jury declined to indict an officer for the death of Eric Garner.]\n\n\n\nPressure grows - By comparison, Obama spoke out in nearly real time about the grand jury decisions that helped nurture the protests of police tactics and alleged racism that have continued since the end of September. With police departments across the country on high alert for similar attacks and protests still ongoing, will Obama feel obliged to interrupt his winter break to offer some guidance on the subject? He broke away briefly from his summer vacation to make remarks about the beheading of an American at the hands of Islamist militants. The pressure is growing from police and their supporters for Obama to do the same for the slain officers. Can he resist?\n\n\n\nChristie, Martinez demand return of cop killers protected by Castro regime - Fox News: \u201cNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is urging President Obama to demand that Cuba return convicted police-killer Joanne Chesimard before he proceeds with efforts to improve diplomatic relations with that country. Chesimard was found guilty of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973 before escaping from prison and fleeing to Cuba. The 67-year-old Chesimard has since been provided safe haven by the Cuban government.\u201d\n\n\n\nKQRE: \u201cA militant accused of executing a New Mexico State Police officer, then hijacking a plane in Albuquerque may finally face justice if the Obama administration listens to a new plea from Governor Susana Martinez and State Police Chief Pete Kassetas.\u201d The case involves Charlie Hill who, with two other men, allegedly shot and killed New Mexico police officer Robert Rosenbloom and then hi-jacked a plane to Cuba in 1971. Governor Martinez has drafted a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Attorney General Eric Holder asking for the Obama Administration\u2019s help in pressing for Hill\u2019s return.\n\n\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS RUSH FOR DRIVERS LICENSES IN ARIZ.\n\nArizona Daily Sun: \u201cState transportation officials are anticipating a crush of customers Monday as \u2018dreamers\u2019' may flood Motor Vehicle Division offices to finally get licenses to drive. Beginning at 8 a.m. Monday, more than 22,000 Arizonans who have qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will become legally able to drive. But first they have to apply for and qualify for a license\u2026The rush comes following a preliminary injunction issued Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell prohibiting Arizona from refusing to license DACA recipients. These are individuals who arrived in this country illegally as children and meet other conditions\u2026ADOT spokesman Tim Tait said the licenses issued to dreamers will be identical to those given to other Arizonans who meet the requirements to drive -- with one significant difference: The licenses will self-destruct on a regular basis. That is because the DACA status -- and the employment authorization documents -- are currently good for only two years, though they are renewable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Toughest sheriff\u2019 gets first draw in Obama immigration fight- Bloomberg: \u201cMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is asking a federal judge in Washington today to suspend two of President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration directives until a ruling is made on whether he overstepped his authority.\u201d\n\n\n\n[According to the latest Gallup poll, President Obama\u2019s approval rating has inched up to a 7-month high at 47 percent.]\n\n\n\nImmigration, ObamaCare, taxes, energy top growing list of contenders for reconciliation vote - The Hill: \u201cRepublicans on and off Capitol Hill are rallying behind using a rarely-deployed budget tool next year to dismantle ObamaCare. But the issue of how to use \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d has divided Republicans, with some calling for it to be implemented to overhaul the tax code or to push through major energy reforms. The tool is useful because it could allow newly-empowered Senate Republicans to pass legislation with a 51-vote simple majority rather than the usual 60, greatly increasing the chances of moving legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. And while Obama is certain to veto anything that tries to roll back his landmark healthcare law, Republicans increasingly see reconciliation as an important messaging tool to help paint a contrast with Democrats on Obamacare ahead of 2016\u2026Republicans will likely settle on a strategy in mid-January when they map out their 2015 agenda at a joint House and Senate retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania. But Republicans are keenly aware that they\u2019ll have to navigate a series of hurdles before they can deploy reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Forbes reports on the ties both Republican frontrunner former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton have with Tenet Healthcare, a strong supporter for ObamaCare.]\n\n\n\nOBAMA SAYS SONY WRONG TO NOT INCLUDE HIM ON DECISION TO PULL MOVIE\n\nAfter a rebuke from the CEO of Sony Pictures over saying it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for the studio to not release a movie after terror threats from hackers believed to be in league with the Communist dictatorship of North Korea, President Obama doubled down on his criticism. In an interview with CNN, Obama said that the studio\u2019s failure to ask him to intervene with theater owners anxious about the possibility of an attack was their main failure. \u201cHad they talked to me directly about this decision,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what the story was.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cyber-vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously. We will respond proportionally, as I said.\u201d \u2013 President Obama on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nCar brands are named based on a variety of factors often including the name of the designer. But how did a decidedly German car end up with a decidedly non-German name like Mercedes. It was on this day in 1900 that Austrian car racer, Emil Jellinek became the first Mercedes owner. So eager for a sleeker and lighter car that would travel faster and win races easily, Jellinek went to the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft plant demanding the fastest car they could create. He negotiated a deal to purchase 36 vehicles and as part of the package, Daimler agreed to name the line after his then 11-year-old daughter, Mercedes. The car was such a hit that two years later the company legally registered the Mercedes name and Jellinek himself changed the family name to Jellinek-Mercedes in appreciation for his latest race cars.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

That is an awful lot of handshakes.\u201d ]\n\n\n\nHILLARY THINS HERD FOR CAMPAIGN MANAGER\n\nBloomberg: \u201cOne of the leading candidates to manage Hillary Clinton\u2019s expected campaign for U.S. president in 2016 has withdrawn from the running. \u2018I\u2019ve been a part of some great campaigns and worked for terrific people, but want to explore other ways I can be of service,\u2019 Guy Cecil said in an e-mailed statement. Cecil, the political director of Clinton\u2019s losing 2008 presidential race, was the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the past two election cycles. Democrats gained two seats in the 2012 election but lost control of the Senate in last month\u2019s midterms\u2026Cecil said he\u2019ll assist her from the outside if she runs. \u2018There is no one better prepared to be our next president than Secretary Clinton, and I hope she runs,\u2019 he said. \u2018I will help however I can.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n[In the latest ABC/WaPo poll, Hillary Clinton keeps her frontrunner status but loses ground against other potential Democratic candidates at 63 percent.

Kennedy III, left the door open for an endorsement of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: \u201cWhatever [she] wants to do she\u2019s going to excel at. She has been adamant that she\u2019s not running for president and I take her at her word for that. If things change, we\u2019ll see.\u201d In 2008, the endorsement of then-Sen. Ted Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy, now ambassador to Japan, for rival Sen. Barack Obama helped seal Clinton\u2019s fate.\n\n\n\nRAND, RUBIO STILL SPARRING ON FOREIGN POLICY\n\nThe Hill: \u201cThe foreign policy battle between Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) escalated Sunday on the political talk shows and Twitter, with the Florida lawmaker labeling Paul the \u2018chief cheerleader\u2019 of [President Obama\u2019s] foreign policy\u2026Paul struck back on Twitter a few hours after Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u2018This Week,\u2019 saying the Florida Republican had forgotten to mention his own \u2018support for Obama's funding of [the Muslim] Brotherhood, arming Islamic rebels, and Hillary's war in Libya.\u2019\u2026The bickering was just the latest in the bickering between the two lawmakers. In an interview earlier this week with Fox News\u2019s \u2018The Kelly File,\u2019 Rubio said Paul had \u2018no idea what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019 The Kentucky Republican fired back on the same program the following night, branding Rubio an isolationist and saying his criticism was \u2018rude and inappropriate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, [Rand Paul]-- if he wants to become the chief cheerleader of [President Obama\u2019s] foreign policy he certainly has a right to do that. I\u2019m going to continue to opposed the Obama-Paul foreign policy on Cuba, because I know it won\u2019t lead to freedom and liberty for the Cuba people, which is my sole interest here.\u201d \u2013Sen.

New penalties also make it virtually impossible for any state other than New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada to vote before the end of that month. The Southern states, which are preparing to lock in March 1 through a combination of legislative and executive actions, want to be first out of the gate afterward.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The Outlaws - Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has been the man pushing the plan.

But, they say he has a ton of work to do to convince Iowa conservatives that he\u2019s one of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nPEAK HIPSTER ACHIEVED\n\nIt takes a lot of hunger or chutzpah to actually eat what you hit with your vehicle, but what about wearing it? A Massachusetts woman is making bespoke, $1,000-per-item garments from what she calls \u201caccidental fur.\u201d Modern Farmer magazine profiled furrier Pamela Paquin who has used the remains of bears, foxes, beavers, raccoons, otters and fawns killed on highways and byways to make items including muffs, leg warmers and hats. Aside from her promise that the animals died by accident and provision of an American Indian ceremony for the disposal of the parts that cannot be made into accessories, Paquin provides her customers with a silver badge to wear on the fur so that any animal-rights activists encountered by the wearer will know that the garment was \u201csustainably\u201d sourced. From the magazine: \u201cAll animals are registered with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, and customers receive details about the animal\u2019s recovery as well as clues into the life it might have lived. \u2018Each animal has a story,\u2019 she says.\u201d\n\n|\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
