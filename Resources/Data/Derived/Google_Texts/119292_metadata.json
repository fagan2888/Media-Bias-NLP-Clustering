While the FSBA has done many beneficial things in the past, recently they've made some choices and decisions that have alienated conservative members; something must change.\n\nThe distinction between individually elected officeholders and members of elected boards is that the advocacy organizations that purport to represent us as bodies or units sometimes neither represent many of us individually nor do they represent the collective values of our individual constituencies.\n\nWorse, sometimes these very organizations actively work against what many of us want, yet we've no choice individually but to fund them.\n\nThis isn't $30 to NRA or $50 to AARP. For the Escambia board, FSBA's price tag is more than $20,000 yearly!\n\nWhile discussing my significant disagreement with FSBA's lawsuit (attempting to kill the tax-credit scholarship that benefits 70,000 primarily poor and minority students statewide), a powerful, statewide education leader simply, wryly, stated \"Why do you keep funding them, then?\"\n\nWhy do we keep funding them?\n\nFSBA didn't represent my views when they supported the class-size mandates that blew up the budget, destroying our ability to significantly raise teacher pay.\n\nFSBA didn't represent my views when they sought to block necessary tenure reform in Florida, yet I had no choice but to fund them.\n\nFSBA has ignored every conservative idea I have submitted for six years running for their statewide platform \u2013 and yet I had no choice but to fund them.\n\nTruly fiscal conservative school board members are a rare species in Florida. Therefore, even if we vote \"no\" to fund our \"advocacy\" organizations yearly, a majority vote will still pass, ensuring 100 percent of the money still goes to our \"advocates.\"\n\nThe only way to fix this problem is to change Florida statutes to allow all constitutional officers, including individual board members, the ability to allocate their portion (or withhold their portion) of the annual taxpayer-funded advocacy budget \u2013 individually.\n\nThis will force these \"advocates\" to listen to and respect the opinions of the minority dissenters, lest they lose their funding. It will make organizations compete. It will force associations to seek consensus, rather than status quo maintenance.\n\nThe Individual Freedom of Choice in Advocacy Act facilitates this \u2013 allowing each individual constitutional officer to allocate (or to not expend) his/her individual portion of a taxpayer funded board's yearly advocacy budget, assuring those constituencies holding minority views the chance to be fairly and accurately represented.\n\nJeff Bergosh is a member of the Escambia County School Board.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1Bfp8n4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Viewpoint: Some lobbyists work against what some school board members want.", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "Viewpoint: Some lobbyists work against what some school board members want.", "title": "Viewpoint: Disrupting the Iron Triangles", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/12/27/viewpoint-disrupting-iron-triangles/20940861/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Viewpoint: Some lobbyists work against what some school board members want.", "title": "Viewpoint: Disrupting the Iron Triangles", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c5c6492abd6cf63d11a23abba7b4ed05724ed17/c=0-276-904-1180&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Pensacola/2014/12/27/B9315564755Z.1_20141227140642_000_GSN9GP3KE.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd47b4\"", "article_summary": "As school board members, we send taxpayer funding for advocacy to the Florida School Boards Association.\nUnlike the individual officeholders mentioned above, however, our individual choice in advocacy for our constituents is handcuffed by a system that stifles individual officeholders' choice.\nJeff Bergosh is a member of the Escambia County School Board.\nTruly fiscal conservative school board members are a rare species in Florida.\nAs school board members, we are duly elected, individual constitutional officers \u2013 just like county sheriffs, elected superintendents of schools, supervisors of elections, tax collectors, property appraisers, etc."}
