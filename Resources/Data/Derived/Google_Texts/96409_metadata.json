Incumbent Jim Gray is running against former police chief Anthany Beatty and college professor Danny Mayer. One of those candidates will be eliminated and the two with the most votes will move on to the general election in November.\n\nIn addition, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell is set to defend his Senate seat against Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin, and three others. All the contenders campaigned across Kentucky on Monday. The winner will likely face Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes in the fall. She is the front runner in Tuesday's Democratic primary.\n\nFor more information on what you need to know before voting, you can go to the state voter information center at www.elect.ky.gov.\n\nIf you suspect fraud at your polling place, call the Vote Fraud Hotline to report any election violations at 1-800-328-VOTE.
