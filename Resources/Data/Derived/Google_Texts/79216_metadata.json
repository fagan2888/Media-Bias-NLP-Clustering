Michael C. Burgess, Texas Republican.\n\nPHOTOS: President Obama's favorite footstool: The famous Resolute desk\n\nThe administration said Mr. Obama was tapping his \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d in much the same way he did last year, when he said he had the power to unilaterally halt deportations of young illegal immigrants and instead granted them legal status and work permits.\n\n\u201cHHS will be using its enforcement discretion to allow for this transition,\u201d said an administration official briefing reporters ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement. \u201cEnforcement discretion can be used generally in transitions, as well as a bridge towards legislation. This is something that has been used, for example, with the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy, pending immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThat immigration policy, known by its acronym DACA, has proved controversial as well. Under it, Mr. Obama has determined that young illegal immigrants shouldn\u2019t be deported, even though the law calls for that.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama: \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid enough\u2019 to mislead on website\n\nThe president\u2019s claims of executive authority have irked conservatives ever since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, but Republicans said it has been particularly egregious when it comes to the health care law.\n\nMr. Obama already has unilaterally suspended the employer mandate requiring large companies to prove they are providing insurance coverage for their employees. His administration also ruled that members of Congress who are being pushed into the health care exchanges could continue to have taxpayers pay for most of their premiums, even though most people in the exchanges won\u2019t have that same benefit.\n\nIn this latest instance, Mr. Obama was moving to circumvent part of the law that bans health care plans that don\u2019t meet certain standards.\n\nThat has led to millions of consumers in the individual market receiving cancellation notices in recent months \u2014 and it has caused a major headache for Mr. Obama, who had vowed that those who liked their would be able to keep them.\n\nHouse Republicans have proposed a bill, which is set for a floor vote Friday, that would overturn Obamacare\u2019s requirements and let insurance companies continue to offer existing plans. Americans who purchase one of those plans would be considered to have met Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nThat bill had earned support of a growing number of Democrats, and Mr. Obama\u2019s move Thursday was an effort to try to head off an embarrassing no-confidence vote from his own party on the Republicans\u2019 proposal.\n\n\u201cWe put a grandfather clause into the law, but it was insufficient,\u201d the president said at a news conference Thursday, explaining his move.\n\nUnder the loophole, Mr. Obama will leave it up to state health insurance commissioners to decide which substandard plans still can be offered by insurance companies, and he has pledged that his administration won\u2019t penalize them for offering those plans even though they violate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe extension will last one year.\n\nLegal scholars have questioned whether Mr. Obama has that sort of broad authority on deportations, and Thursday\u2019s move reignited that debate.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the chief executive has some room to decide how strongly to enforce a law, and the timing of enforcement. But here, Obama is apparently suspending the enforcement of a law for a year \u2014 simply to head off actual legislation not to his liking,\u201d Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, said in a blog post at Volokh Conspiracy.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fix\u2019 amounts to new legislation \u2014 but enacted without Congress,\u201d Mr. Kontorovich said. \u201cThe president has no constitutional authority to rewrite statutes, especially in ways that impose new obligations on people, and that is what the fix seems to entail.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, however, said they believe he acted within his power and has done enough to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for a legislative fix for this issue,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat.\n\nRepublicans, though, counter that even if it\u2019s legal, Mr. Obama\u2019s fix is temporary and he could change it at any time \u2014 meaning insurance companies lack the kind of certainty they need to do business.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama turned to prosecutorial discretion yet again Thursday as he tried an end run around Congress, claiming unilateral authority to let companies continue to offer health care plans under Obamacare even if those plans violate his namesake law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama turned to prosecutorial discretion yet again Thursday as he tried an end run around Congress, claiming unilateral authority to let companies continue to offer health care plans under Obamacare even if those plans violate his namesake law.", "title": "Obama\u2019s prosecutorial discretion raises questions about executive authority", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/14/obama-enforcement-discretion-obamacare-changes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/14/obamajpeg-0665f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/14/obamajpeg-0665f.jpg", "description": "President Obama turned to prosecutorial discretion yet again Thursday as he tried an end run around Congress, claiming unilateral authority to let companies continue to offer health care plans under O", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s prosecutorial discretion raises questions about executiv"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8e5\"", "article_summary": "The move drew howls of disapproval from Republicans and ignited a legal debate over whether Mr. Obama has the executive authority he is claiming.\nLegal scholars have questioned whether Mr. Obama has that sort of broad authority on deportations, and Thursday\u2019s move reignited that debate.\n\u201cHHS will be using its enforcement discretion to allow for this transition,\u201d said an administration official briefing reporters ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement.\nUnder it, Mr. Obama has determined that young illegal immigrants shouldn\u2019t be deported, even though the law calls for that.\nIn this latest instance, Mr. Obama was moving to circumvent part of the law that bans health care plans that don\u2019t meet certain standards."}
