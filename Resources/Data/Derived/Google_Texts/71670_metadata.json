They are vying to replace Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., who announced his retirement after this term.\n\nEach candidate gave opening and closing statements, and the candidates were able to answer a few questions. Because there were so many candidates, there was only time for four questions.\n\nAnders called himself a \u201cregular average guy.\u201d After 16 years in the U.S. Air Force, he joined the Air Force Reserve as a master sergeant.\n\n\u201cI always want to make sure I serve my country in every way possible \u2026 this is just another step,\u201d Anders said. National security is a big priority for him.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, freedom is under assault,\u201d said Crane, who currently serves as state senator from the 28th District. \u201cGovernment is in our homes, government is in our businesses, now the government wants to get involved in the thing we hold most dear, our faith. To tell us what we can and can\u2019t believe. We have a government that is out of control and going out of its constitutional boundaries.\u201d\n\nFerguson, who served as the mayor of West Point until he qualified to run for the congressional seat, said he learned early on that service is a cornerstone of his faith. Ferguson said that he watched bad policies in Washington D.C. \u201calmost destroy my town of West Point for almost 20 years.\u201d Hope faded, businesses closed, schools failed, and there was generational poverty. \u201cI decided to stay and fight the good fight. We united a community and we rebuilt a city. We did it by coming together and getting government out of our way.\u201d\n\nFerguson helped bring the KIA plant to West Point and now the town is \u201can economic engine full of prosperity and success,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly believe I can lead the Third District down that same path. I need your help.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has $19.5 trillion in debt, and each American\u2019s share of that is about $58,000, said Chip Flanegan, who challenged retiring U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland multiple times over the past several years. \u201cIn my business life, in my person life, I\u2019m debt free.\u201d\n\nAmericans are facing economic chaos \u201ccaused by the Washington cartel that have bought and paid for our politicians. They\u2019re not listening to us. Washington is broken,\u201d Flanegan said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to save Social Security and keep from going over the fiscal cliff we\u2019re going to have to send people to Washington that know how to get us out of debt \u2026 it is not that hard but it takes fiscal responsibility. You have to be willing not to take the lobby money. I will not take the lobby money.\u201d\n\nRichard Mix said he is a small business owner, not a politician. \u201cI had no visions of sitting here in front of you three months ago\u201d until hearing about Westmoreland\u2019s retirement. \u201cI know that everyone in this country is working harder and harder for less and less.\u201d Though the country is heading in the wrong direction, \u201cI\u2019m still extremely optimistic about this country.\u201d\n\nPace said he\u2019s often asked why he wants to run for office. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. It\u2019s no different that the guys that boarded the Army buses after Pearl Harbor. They went because it was their duty. I\u2019m willing to go to Washington.\u201d\n\nPace said he wants to be able to \u201clook my grandkids in the eye and say \u2018I did everything I could to keep you safe.\u2019\u201d\n\nA congressman needs to be a hard worker with education and leadership, said Thomas. He\u2019s a Vietnam veteran, holds seven degrees, and was named president of his class at Georgia Southern University. Thomas said he will only accept $48,000 of the $174,000 annual salary for congressmen. He\u2019ll donate the rest to local food programs.\n\nThe candidates were asked their thoughts about Obamacare/the Affordable Care Act and on the state of the U.S. economy.\n\nAnders grew up in the United Kingdom, where his father, also in the Air Force, was stationed. He sees Obamacare leading to socialized medicine. \u201cI grew up with socialized medicine. While I\u2019m for every single American having access to health care, the Affordable Care Act is not that.\u201d The ACA needs to be repealed, Anders said.\n\nWhen it comes to discussing the economy, we need common sense \u2013 and that\u2019s lacking in our government, Anders said.\n\n\u201cPeople say we need to get government out. Of course. But what can we do with the system we\u2019ve got in place? We still have to work, somewhat, with that we\u2019ve got now,\u201d Anders said. The U.S. budget and economy is kind of like Common Core math, Anders said.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at budgets at work or at my house, it\u2019s about what\u2019s coming in and going out,\u201d Anders said. We need to stop spending money overseas, and look at the budget line by line. \u201cUntil we start doing that we won\u2019t see where we truly need to make the cuts.\u201d\n\nCrane said Obamacare has been an unmitigated disaster \u2013 as expected. Healthcare officials are \u201cfighting valiantly to provide quality care but it\u2019s a difficult road.\u201d\n\nThe state of Georgia spends $500,000 a year to provide documents to prove the state is compliant with the mandates of the ACA, Crane said. \u201cThat is not affordable. It\u2019s not effective and it does nothing to promote care at all.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, quality is diminished, access is more difficult and the costs are through the roof. Crane would like to see the ACA replaced and the healthcare system opened up to the free market.\n\nTo address the current economic malaise, we need to address the federal government\u2019s intrusion into \u201cevery single aspect of our lives,\u201d Crane said. There are special interest tax cuts and favors. Americans need to send people to D.C. who \u201chave a proven track record of saying no to exactly that.\u201dHe wants to see Congress \u201creclaim its authority\u201d through the appropriations process.\n\nObamacare has been a failure on all fronts, said Ferguson, a dentist. \u201cThe patient does not receive better quality care, it does not improve access to quality care.\u201d Access to insurance is \u201cnot the barrier it is described to be,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nThe current system needs to be replaced with a free market system. People should get to set up health savings accounts that match their deductibles and can roll over. He\u2019s worried Obamacare will morph into a single-payer system. The free market gives better results.\n\nThe economy is sluggish and the past four years, in particular, have been hard on many Americans, Ferguson said. Washington continues to strangle business. The federal tax rate needs to be lowered on individuals and corporations. Regulations add costs every day, as well, he said.\n\nThe ACA is not affordable and is not providing care, said Flanegan. \u201cWhy does government get into healthcare? Why is government providing you insurance?\u201d Flanegan said. In the \u201840s, the federal government implemented price and wage controls, and that\u2019s when companies began offering health insurance. The government doesn\u2019t get involved in our car insurance or homeowners insurance, Flanegan said.\n\nThe economy is improving and so is unemployment, Flanegan said. But government taxation \u201cis like a leech on the economy. Deficit spending also takes money away from businesses.\n\nPace said that working on wellness is a way to improve healthcare. But the only people working on wellness programs are insurance companies.\n\nThe economy is quite anemic, and the government will say the problem is business needs to be taxed more. Fifty-one percent of Americans are \u201con welfare or some government subsidies,\u201d Pace said.\n\nThe ACA has brought healthcare issues front and center, said Mix. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you I have all the answers but I have spoken with a number of insurance providers, underwriters. Nobody seems to be happy.\u201d Insurance companies, consumers, and doctors aren\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to argue that we don\u2019t want affordable healthcare,\u201d Mix said, but the ACA is \u201cbasically a big Ponzi scheme.\u201d He\u2019s seen a great program called Hope for Healthcare that helps with catastrophic care.\n\nThe economy is starting to improve, said Mix. He\u2019s opened four small businesses and thinks less taxes and regulation would help. Education is the critical piece, though.\n\nThe ACA \u201cjust doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Thomas said. But fixing the system has to start somewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw it out unless you\u2019ve got a new one.\u201d\n\nThe government needs to live within its means, Thomas said. But it\u2019s got to start from the bottom up.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "The Newnan Times-Herald", "description": "The seven Republican candidates for Georgia\u2019s Third District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives shared many similar opinions at Wednesday night\u2019s candidate forum, held at the Wadsworth Auditorium.", "title": "Republicans debate at congressional forum", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/04/republicans-debate-at-congressional-forum", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://cdn.nthstatic.net/static/global/og-logo-default.jpg", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://times-herald.com/", "description": "The seven Republican candidates for Georgia\u2019s Third District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives shared many similar opinions at Wednesday night\u2019s candidate forum, held at the Wadsworth Auditorium.", "title": "Republicans debate at congressional forum", "url": "http://times-herald.com/news/2016/04/republicans-debate-at-congressional-forum", "image": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/assets/photos/2016/republicans-debate-at-congressional-forum/_articlePhotoFull/6929/20160429-GOP-debate.jpg?mtime=20160429124145", "site": "@TimesHerald", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "fb": {"admins": "7027018, 100000783540613, 501100169, 100006595873641"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.nthstatic.net/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Local"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The government doesn\u2019t get involved in our car insurance or homeowners insurance, Flanegan said.\nThe current system needs to be replaced with a free market system.\nCrane would like to see the ACA replaced and the healthcare system opened up to the free market.\nParticipating in the forum were Sam Anders, Mike Crane, Drew Ferguson, Chip Flanegan, Richard Mix, Jim Pace and Arnall \u201cRod\u201d Thomas.\nWhy is government providing you insurance?\u201d Flanegan said."}
