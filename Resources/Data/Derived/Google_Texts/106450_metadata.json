It stepped off on Central Avenue just north of Montebello Avenue and made its way south to Camelback Road. It made a left turn, headed east to Seventh Street and then south again, finishing up just past Minnezona Avenue. (See map below.)\n\nThere were road closures in the area and parking was tricky.\n\nThe parade was free to watch. More than 100,000 spectators were expected to come out for the event.\n\nLongtime parade-goers said the intersections of Central Avenue and Camelback Road and Camelback Road and Seventh Street (where the parade makes turns) provided the best vantage points. Some people arrive as early as 6 a.m., a full five hours before the parade starts, to ensure good seats.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
