The decades-old idea of gathering the bulk of the nation\u2019s nuclear waste and burying it underground about 100 miles outside of Las Vegas has for years seemed like a pipe dream for the U.S. nuclear power industry.\n\nNow, in a surprise reversal of fortune, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a much-delayed report on Thursday on the site\u2019s suitability for vast shipments of spent nuclear fuel, saying it would be safe for storing nuclear waste. The 780-page staff report concluded the site \u201cwith reasonable expectation\u201d could satisfy federal licensing requirements.\n\nRelated: Obama Favors More Nuclear Power But Blocks Waste Storage Site\n\nThe NRC\u2019s findings triggered calls from GOP lawmakers to revive the project, which so far has cost the federal government and industry nearly $11 billion \u2013 and would cost substantially more if it\u2019s brought back from the dead. And if Republicans take control of the Senate in the November 4 midterm election and Reid is ousted as majority leader, which looks increasingly likely, then proponents of Yucca Mountain will be back in business.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AL), the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the NRC staff study demonstrates that the site is \u201ca safe, worthwhile investment\u201d that should be allowed to move forward, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nTimothy Frazier, a former Department of Energy official who now heads the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s nuclear waste program, said in an interview Friday that the new report \u201cdoes clearly state that the requirements are satisfied and Yucca Mountain technically is acceptable.\u201d However, Frazier cautioned that the study\u2019s findings don\u2019t guarantee that the project \u201cis back\u201d and that proponents face many political and legal obstacles to its completion.\n\n\u201cIf the Senate flips, that will allow at least some funding to show up in Senate appropriations for Yucca Mountain that will then marry up with some funding in the House appropriations, so you can actually get funding to continue work for Yucca Mountain,\u201d Frazier said, also noting that \u201cunless that funding is on some really big appropriations bill or continuing resolution,\u201d President Obama would probably not sign it.\n\nRelated: Billions Unaccounted for in Nuclear Waste Management\n\n\u201cWhile [the NRC report] is a step in the right direction for Yucca Mountain, it doesn\u2019t fix the opposition that is out there \u2013 at least within the administration and certainly in the state of Nevada,\u201d Frazier added.\n\nThe Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility was authorized by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments back in 1987. It was meant to be a deep geological storage site for civilian and military spent nuclear waste from power plants, nuclear submarines and weapons systems, and nuclear waste cleanup projects.\n\nIn 1984, the Energy Department began drilling a five-mile tunnel through the mountain to create the underground repository, and by 1997, the department began experiments to test what would happen if heat-generating nuclear waste was stored in metal canisters beneath the desert surface.\n\nThe project suffered a major setback in 2004 when the federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled on a suit brought against Yucca Mountain by the state of Nevada. The court ruled that the Department of Energy would have to prove the repository could safely hold the wastes for hundreds of thousands of years, and not just the 10,000 years called for in the Energy Department\u2019s plan.\n\nRelated: Nuclear Waste: Agency Racks Up $16B in Cost Overruns\n\nBut as The New York Times noted Thursday, the \u201creal blow\u201d came with the election of President Obama \u2013 who in his 2008 campaign vowed to kill the project, as well as from the relentless efforts by Reid to kill funding to continue to build the project and pursue a license to operate it. The Energy Department in 2010 shut down the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which had been running the Yucca project.\n\nThe overall estimated price tag of the project was $35.9 billion, said the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade organization. But only $10.8 billion of that had been spent before the project was put on hold. Without a centralized repository structure like Yucca Mountain, the nuclear power industry has had to store the waste onsite, in large cooling pools or in dry casks.\n\nThe NRC staff report was based on a safety review of a license application for Yucca Mountain submitted at the tail end of the GOP administration of President George W. Bush. The study focused on whether the natural geology of Yucca Mountain \u2013 coupled with a system of man-made barriers planned for the mountain \u2013 could prevent decaying radioactive particles from leaking into groundwater over periods of up to a million years.\n\nAfter assessing the relevant portions of the license applications, the NRC staff found it was reasonable to expect it \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d for long-term nuclear waste storage.\n\nBut proponents and opponents differ sharply over the risks in moving ahead. Environmentalists worry about long-term contamination of underground water or the water supplies from nearby communities. Critics fear the repository could be damaged by an earthquake. And public officials in Nevada and elsewhere are concerned about accidents or spills when the waste is transported by trains or trucks to the desert site.\n\nA revival of the project would almost certainly touch off an environmental debate that could eclipse concerns about building the Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nTom Kauffman, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in an interview before the NRC report was out that the Yucca Mountain project \u201cis not completely dead\u201d and could eventually be reinstated. \u201cIt\u2019s caught up in politics, and politics change. And there\u2019s still a lot of support for Yucca\u201d in Congress.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The multibillion-dollar Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project has languished for years in the Nevada desert because of opposition from the Obama administration, environmentalists and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).
