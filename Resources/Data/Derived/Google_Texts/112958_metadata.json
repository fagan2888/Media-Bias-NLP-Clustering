My reasons are both stylistic and substantive. It\u2019s hard to do anything interesting on such well-trod ground, and these labels, by their very nature, are relative and in constant flux.\n\nPut differently, the center in 2015 isn\u2019t where it was in 1980. And while politicians have a role in shifting the Overton window in one direction or another, they are mostly reactive creatures. To paraphrase Marx: Politicians can choose which ideological space to occupy within the politics of their era. But the era itself, that\u2019s no more up to them than it is to you or me. (I doubt that, say, Ronald Reagan would support gun control if he were running for office today.)\n\nThat said, though, the 2016 presidential campaign has already proven to be special, shall we say, in a few regards. And the one that\u2019s been on my mind lately has to do with this whole idea of what it means to be a moderate. Because while it\u2019s a little cheap \u2014 or at least unenlightening \u2014 to use the politics of a generation ago to slam a candidate as inconsistent or radical, I think it\u2019s a different thing if the timeframe isn\u2019t measured in decades but rather months and weeks.\n\nWhich brings me to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida currently seeking the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination. Despite at one point being seen as too right-wing to make it to the Senate (this was before the Tea Party really got going; a simpler, more innocent time) Rubio has been described throughout his presidential campaign as coming from the party\u2019s supposedly reasonable, establishment-friendly wing. He is, we\u2019re told, one of the \u201cadults.\u201d\n\nBack when the campaign was largely concerned with the issue of immigration, and when Donald Trump\u2019s rank demagoguery was the standard against which all the other Republicans were measured, this was a defensible characterization. But now that the campaign has, in the wake of the Paris attacks, become almost exclusively about ISIS and counter-terrorism, Rubio\u2019s moderate label is wholly undeserved. Moderate? He is anything but.\n\nRubio has always aligned himself with the \u00fcber-hawkish, neoconservative wing of the GOP when it comes to foreign policy. But while he\u2019s long been almost John McCain-like in his willingness to drop bombs on other people \u2014 even once going so far as to chide his fellow Republicans for not wanting to bomb Libya more \u2014 it\u2019s only lately that Rubio\u2019s generic militarism, which he happily unsheathed against countries as dissimilar as China and Cuba, has drifted toward outright Islamophobia.\n\nTake his response to Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about closing down mosques, for example. Whereas Rubio has halfheartedly attempted to steer Republicans away from demonizing Hispanic people, when it comes to Muslims, it appears, his goal is to one-up \u201cthe Donald.\u201d Rather than shoot down Trump\u2019s flagrant disregard for the basic small-l liberal principle of religious freedom, Rubio criticized Trump for not going far enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's portrayed as one of the few \"adults\" in the GOP race.
