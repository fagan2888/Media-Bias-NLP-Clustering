Nutritional experts recommend our mid-meal snack for the day contain anywhere between 100 and 200 calories. Dunkin’ Donuts CEO Nigel Travis is now saying its sandwiches are not meant to be a full lunch, but rather a snack to help get you through the day. Ranging from 360 to 680 calories, Dunkin Donuts’ sandwiches may not be your best option for a healthy snack, in spite of Travis’ recommendation.

"We're not moving into lunch. We're in snacking,” Travis said in an interview with the Associated Press. “We never talk about lunch."

In an effort to draw more business in during the afternoon, Dunkin’ Donuts recently started expanding sandwich options that are offered throughout the day. If you are heading to Dunkin’ Donuts for a snack, your best options include the Egg & Cheese Wake-Up Wrap, Egg White Turkey Sausage Wake-Up Wrap, and Egg White Veggie Wake-Up Wrap, all containing 150 calories and less than 9 grams of fat.
