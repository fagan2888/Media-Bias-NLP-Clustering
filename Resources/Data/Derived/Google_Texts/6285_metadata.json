But in the five months since the declarations of presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro that diplomatic relations between the two nations would resume, nothing substantial has actually happened. The two governments did agree that the process would indeed be a long one and that caution was in order on both sides. The most hopeful sign is that, so far, formal talks have been \u201crespectful,\u201d according to Cuban and U.S. diplomats.\n\nThere essentially are three levels of ongoing talks. Negotiations on logistics between the U.S. State Department and the Cuban Foreign Ministry began in January, alternating sites between Washington and Havana. Agenda items include the nuts and bolts of how and when to open embassies, ensuring the nature of agreements meet international standards and deciding what \u201cnormalization\u201d means for both parties.\n\nA second level is political and includes the recent meetings between high-level members of both governments, up to and including the two presidents. These talks eventually will cover higher-stakes issues, such as the 53-year-old trade embargo against Cuba, human rights and Guantanamo. One of the big hurdles in this arena \u2014 and of great importance to Cuba \u2014 was removal of Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror. Obama has put this in motion, and it is expected to become official at the end of May.\n\nA third level of dialogue deals with details of ongoing relations, such as trade agreements, cooperation in drug-trafficking interdiction, collaboration in disaster management and environmental protection, and arranging for migration. Discussion on migration will center on the controversial Cuban Adjustment Act, which stipulates Cubans arriving on U.S. soil are granted assistance and eventually permanent residence. That policy has encouraged illegal and unsafe migration from Cuba.\n\nKey to every conversation at any level, according to Cuba, is acknowledgement of Cuba\u2019s independence and sovereignty and noninterference in the country\u2019s internal affairs, as defined by accepted international norms. This is a sticky point. The U.S. is quite accustomed to applying its political and economic weight to influence governments throughout the world, especially in Central and South America.\n\nAmong the goals laid out in President Obama\u2019s Dec. 17 speech was \u201c to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.\u201d One wonders whether the distinction between Obama\u2019s \u201cpromoting our values\u201d and the Vienna convention\u2019s mandated \u201cduty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State\u201d is lost on U.S. diplomats.\n\nThe meeting in late March among high-level diplomats on the topic of human rights seemed to end abruptly after one day, even though the State Department had expected up to three days of talks. Perhaps the statement of head Cuban negotiator Pedro Luis Pedroso about \u201cconcerns regarding discrimination and racism patterns in U.S. society, the worsening of police brutality, torture acts and extrajudicial executions in the fight on terror and the legal limbo of prisoners at the U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo\u201d gave pause to U.S. negotiators.\n\nCuba also expressed a desire to include in the talks a \u201cbalance regarding civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights,\u201d such as rights to food security and health care. Both sides have agreed to an extension of talks on human rights, but no new dates have yet been announced.\n\nWhat does the U.S. hope to gain? Its long-term goals for Cuba are unchanged: an \u201copen\u201d free market economy, multiple-party political system and support for so-called pro-democracy activists. But aren\u2019t these matters for a sovereign state to determine on its own?\n\nWhat does Cuba hope to gain? As officials repeatedly have said, Cuba\u2019s goals are for an end to the U.S.-imposed trade embargo and its extraterritorial provisions, for return of U.S.-controlled Guantanamo territory, for an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act and for no more overt and covert U.S. subversion against the Cuban government. These all are areas over which only the U.S. has control.\n\nAs Castro stated at the Summit of the Americas in April, \u201cI think that everything can be on the table. \u2026 We could be persuaded of some things; of others, we might not be persuaded.\u201d\n\nFor now the two leaders have \u201cagreed to disagree.\u201d\n\nA Bangor Daily News editorial titled \u201cNeighborly Relations\u201d suggested \u201can opportunity [for the U.S. and its neighbor Cuba] to gain culturally and economically from each other.\u201d This was in 1994. Cuba-watchers have no choice but to remain patient.\n\nJudy Robbins of Sedgwick is a member of Let Cuba Live Committee of Maine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One might perceive change is happening apace in this new era in U.S.-Cuba relations.
