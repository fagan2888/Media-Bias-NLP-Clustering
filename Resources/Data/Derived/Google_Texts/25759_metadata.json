There have already been cases in which custody of a child was granted to the parent\u2019s former lover, against the parent\u2019s wishes. And a child\u2019s siblings are also important to family, but siblings shouldn\u2019t have the legal authority to make parenting decisions.\u201d\n\nIt is warned that the serious nature of this power grab should not be discounted by parents, whose authority is reportedly being undermined by the state.\n\n\u201cHaving a relaxed definition of family is fine at Thanksgiving and Christmas, but parents, not the government, should be the sole decision makers where their children are concerned,\u201d HSLDA Director of Federal Relations William A. Estrada, Esq. asserts. \u201cThis casual and open-ended (\u2018among others\u2019) definition of family sets up a slippery slope for parental rights and family freedom.\u201d\n\nEstrada insists that this usurping of parental control can currently be seen from coast to coast.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, parents whose children attend public schools are fighting desperately to protect their children\u2019s privacy from big businesses that are using and selling their children\u2019s personal data, as a result of Obama Administration regulations that opened the floodgates to corporate exploitation,\u201d the legal expert on government affairs argues. \u201cBut why should parents fight this data collection if the federal government is ready to cozy up to those businesses as \u2018family\u2019?\u201d\n\nIt is contended that the government is making its move to realign the divine order of the family unit in America.\n\n\u2018[T]hese statements reveal these agencies\u2019 true beliefs: that a child\u2019s God-given family does not matter,\u201d HSLDA attorneys contend. \u201cFamily is whoever or whatever the government says it is.\u201d\n\nIs there still time?\n\nWith the problematic document still being in its draft stage, the government has not yet created any new federal programs through the paper, but parents are advised to be on alert about future maneuverings.\n\n\u201c[T]he paper represents recommendations from the Early Learning Interagency Policy Board (IPB) regarding federally funded early education programs currently providing services to children from birth through age eight,\u201d HSLDA attorneys note. \u201cThe IPB has been established jointly by the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.\u201d\n\nEven though Congress still needs to approve the recommended policies, it is warned that their threat is very real.\n\n\u201c[T]he document is extremely telling: for once, federal policymakers are being honest about their beliefs and goals,\u201d Estrada informs. \u201cAnd their references in this draft document to families being \u2018equal partners\u2019 with government agencies (the term is used multiple times), and their casual and breathtakingly broad redefinition of the family, highlights the federal government\u2019s arrogance when it comes to education and family policy.\u201d\n\nNothing new\n\nThe continued power grab by the federal government is said to be indicative of the White House\u2019s latest advancement of its imposed \u201cculture of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, this document only underscores what we have observed for a while: the federal government is intent on taking more and more power from parents when it comes to their children\u2019s lives,\u201d Estrada maintains. \u201cWhether it was the big businesses that worked hand in glove with big government bureaucrats to push the Common Core on our nation, dangerous UN treaties that would elevate UN bureaucrats over parents, the Pentagon\u2019s attempt to track all military families by where their children are educated, former MSNBC host and Tulane University Professor Melissa Harris-Perry\u2019s claim that \u2018kids belong to whole communities,\u2019 President Obama\u2019s call in 2012 for all states to change their compulsory attendance statutes to keep kids in school until age 18, or his 2013 push to advance universal federally funded preschool, we see an intensifying movement of the federal government to consolidate control over all children from cradle to college.\u201d\n\nThe Christian legal defense firm based in Purcellville, Virginia, also reminds Americans that of the government\u2019s Trojan Horse of federal intrusion through Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe biggest advancement of this philosophy in recent years came in 2010 when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the nonprofit organization impressed. \u201cHSLDA opposed this bill because it created a program of (voluntary for now) government home visitation programs. Unfortunately, when President Obama signed the ACA into law, these federally funded home visitation and parent training programs \u2014 which had always been defeated before then \u2014 became a reality.\u201d\n\nWatch out\n\nThe group\u2019s legal challenges against the federal government\u2019s expansion of early childhood programs are just some of the battles it has engaged in on behalf of parents against the Obama administration in its war on children and the family.\n\n\u201cThere are already dozens of federally funded early education programs, most notably Head Start,\u201d Estrada points out. \u201cMany of these programs are deeply flawed and don\u2019t produce the intended results, but instead of cutting back, the federal government is doubling down.\u201d\n\nEstrada says that the proper development of children is not the goal of such controlling programs.\n\n\u201cAt its heart, these programs are not about education,\u201d he insists. \u201cThe research proves this. It is more about government babysitting.\u201d\n\nThe wary attorney indicates that just across the Atlantic, the writing is on the wall as to what will soon happen in America if parents continue to stand by and watch their parental rights continue to erode.\n\n\u201cAnd ultimately, it is about controlling parents and citizens,\u201d Estrada continues. \u201cThe example of Scotland \u2014 a nation which recently enacted legislation mandating state supervision of all parents and children \u2014 shows us the ultimate goal of this statist philosophy toward parents, children, and freedom itself.\u201d\n\nPlea to parents\n\nAccording to HSLDA, there is still time before the government\u2019s power grab of America\u2019s children gets out of control, but it warns that some families are more vulnerable than others.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that, for now, all of these programs are voluntary,\u201d lawyers at HSLDA announced. \u201cIt is why more families are choosing to homeschool, and leave a system that considers itself to be equal with parents. If your children are homeschooled or in private school, you are not affected. But this is not what we want for ourselves or our neighbors. It is a troubling and dangerous trend. This is why HSLDA is working so hard to enshrine parental rights in the U.S. Constitution through passage and ratification of the Parental Rights Amendment. We must do this before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys urge parents not to stand idly by as the federal government diligently works to undermine the constitutional rights parents have to choose what is best for their children.\n\n\u201cOur federal representatives need to know that we care about this,\u201d the legal firm insists. \u201cThey need to hear that instead of multiplying these programs, Congress must end federal involvement in early childhood programs. States and local governments, with more accountability from the people, should be making decisions about these issues. This draft policy statement shows that we cannot trust federal bureaucrats when it comes to raising and educating our children.\u201d\n\nHSLDA says that if parents don\u2019t stand up for their children, no one will.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of ordinary American moms and dads, the ones who truly can and do make the life-changing difference in their children\u2019s lives, we need to be the ones who stand up to the federal government,\u201d the legal firm declares. \u201cThat\u2019s why we choose to homeschool our children: we don\u2019t want the public school\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to education. We don\u2019t want the Common Core. We don\u2019t want help from Washington to raise our children.\u201d\n\nThe group appeals to a quote from the late President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: \u2018I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help,\u2019\u201d America\u2019s iconic president from the 1980s once said.\n\nHSLDA attorneys encourage parents to fight for liberty while they still can.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a stand for freedom,\u201d they conclude. \u201cAnd ultimately, loving parents who care, educate, and provide for their children, will make the difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is making it clear to parents through a recently released declaration that it is best suited to \u201chelp\u201d children and families.", "og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/education/2016/03/05/feds-to-parents-we-are-your-equals", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935948/hhs_emblem.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "The federal government is making it clear to parents through a recently released declaration that it is best suited to \u201chelp\u201d children and families.", "title": "Feds to parents: 'We are your equals'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935948/hhs_emblem.jpg", "title": "Feds to parents: 'We are your equals'", "description": "The federal government is making it clear to parents through a recently released declaration that it is best suited to \u201chelp\u201d children and families.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onenewsnowcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "HSLDA,parental rights,education,homeschooling,Home School Legal Defense Association,Michael F.
