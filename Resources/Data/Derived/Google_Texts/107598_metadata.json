It would have been hard to hope for better,\u201d Evans said after Saturday\u2019s 179-kilometre eighth stage from Foligno to Montecopiolo.\n\n\n\nEvans\u2019 fifth, eight seconds behind Italian dual stage winner Diego Ulissi of Lampre-Merida, allowed him to overhaul Australian Michael Matthews (Orica-GreenEDGE) as race leader.\n\n\"The Giro is long. Who do I have to look out for? Again, it's too early because there are plenty of good riders within two minutes,\u201d Evans said.\n\n\u201cThe one that goes down in history is the one that has it on the last day. You can win or lose the jersey on the last week.\u201d\n\nWith a rest day on Monday, Evans also knows that the battle lines in this year\u2019s 97th edition of the Giro have only just been drawn.\n\nHowever Sunday\u2019s stage nine was to unfold \u2013 and no matter if the race lead was to change - the Giro was destined for an aggressive two weeks as riders who have lost time start scrapping for time-gaining opportunities to improve their positions.\n\nEvans may be the old dog of the Giro peloton but he has his wisdom and streets smarts, especially his first-hand knowledge of the pitfalls that await anyone who dares to take their mind off the job during and in between stages.\n\nEvans knows how the third week of a three-week grand tour can turn the race on its head, and that many younger pups in the pack will see overall victory in their sight.\n\nThey include Uran, 27, and Quintana, 24, who are both great climbers; especially Quintana whose aggressive yet beautiful climbing style on the steepest roads could easily garner him several minutes in one mountain stage with the right attack.\n\n\u201cHe's a climber,\u201d Evans said of Quintana. \u201cWe are always watching him. We are on hard days [now], but I'm waiting until the Alps.\u201d\n\nHence, for Evans, any time gained now is vital.\n\nRupert Guinness will be covering the last 10 days of the Giro d'Italia as a guest of Eurosport.
