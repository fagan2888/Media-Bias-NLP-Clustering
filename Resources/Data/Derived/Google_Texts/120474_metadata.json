She\u2019s been unable to get one despite paying nearly $400 in premiums in December to the state\u2019s Nevada Health Link insurance exchange. Parker\u2019s coverage was supposed to begin Jan. 1, but her insurer says she\u2019s not in their system. Parker said neither she nor her husband, Robert, have gotten answers on their coverage status from Nevada Health Link or its contractor, Xerox.\n\nMeanwhile, Parker is looking at roughly $20,000 in out-of-pocket costs to determine whether she has cervical cancer, thyroid cancer or another condition that\u2019s causing her swollen lymph nodes.\n\n\u201cFrustrated doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how I feel,\u201d Parker said.\n\nParker is part of a class-action lawsuit filed by 200 plaintiffs who say they paid for exchange plans yet still have no coverage because of technical glitches. But Parker and nearly 10 other plaintiffs are gravely ill and need immediate medical attention, said their attorney, Matthew Callister of Callister, Immerman & Associates.\n\nSo Callister announced Wednesday that he will file a lawsuit for injunctive relief that would require the state or Xerox to provide immediate health coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is urgent and emergent. These patients are suffering life-and-death consequences now,\u201d Callister said. \u201cThe class-action system is simply not geared up for that kind of quick action. The urgency is now. I\u2019m so sick of seeing Cliven Bundy on TV that I want to vomit. That (issue) does not affect the lives of 7,000 people (who may have paid but lack coverage). These people paid for a plan. They did what the government said. Then they show up on our doorstep the day before they die.\u201d\n\nXerox said in a statement that it is concentrating on fixing Nevada Health Link\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cWe will await the appropriate legal venue to respond to any of the matters raised by Mr. Callister. We will let the facts of these matters come out at the appropriate time and place. In the meantime, we continue focusing our energies and resources on getting all aspects of the Nevada Health Link system right and helping as many Nevadans as possible get health insurance. \u2026 We will continue to work diligently with consumers, carriers and others \u2014 every day \u2014 to help Nevadans get access to healthcare through Nevada Health Link.\u201d\n\nA Callister spokesman said he expects the injunction to be filed Thursday morning. Callister said help for patients could come as quickly as 48 hours after the filing.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Aubry Domeikis was also weighing joining the motion for injunctive relief. Nevada Health Link erroneously funneled Domekis and her husband into Medicaid, even though the couple told customer-service reps that they made too much money to qualify for the state-run insurance program for low-income earners. The exchange realized its mistake in April, canceled the couple\u2019s coverage, and told them they weren\u2019t eligible for a private plan until June 1.\n\nBut based on regulations in the Affordable Care Act, which set up the state and federal insurance exchanges, the couple should have been eligible for a new plan on May 1, Callister said.\n\nMeanwhile, Domeikis is fighting a bone infection for which she needs daily antibiotic infusions. Right now, she\u2019s paying for the $800-a-week treatments out of pocket. She\u2019s taking only half of the dose her doctors have recommended because she can\u2019t afford the full regimen.\n\nExchange carrier Health Plan of Nevada told Domeikis Tuesday night that it would cover her effective May 1, but Callister said Domeikis \u201chas heard that before.\u201d\n\nOther plaintiffs pursuing immediate access to care include people with brain and skin cancer, Callister said.\n\nCallister called the coverage problems a \u201cbreach of the first order by Xerox.\u201d He released a May 7 email from Xerox representatives to local insurance broker Pat Casale saying customer-service reps \u201cdo not have the functionality (i.e., submit button)\u201d to confirm Domeikis\u2019 application and forward it to a carrier.\n\nThe technical flaw is the latest in a string of errors and problems that began when Nevada Health Link launched on Oct. 1. Despite posting well over 1 million unique page views, the website saw just 35,034 paid enrollments by May 10, as myriad software glitches kept people from applying or paying.\n\nThe exchange board had initially targeted 118,000 sign-ups in the website\u2019s first year.\n\nA special enrollment period for people who had trouble applying during the six-month open enrollment period runs through May 30.\n\nThe exchange board has scheduled a Tuesday meeting to discuss whether it will let Xerox, which has a $72 million contract, stay on as Nevada Health Link\u2019s contractor, or move to another state or federal exchange platform.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.
