It\u2019s been a very important thing to me,\u201d said Linda.\n\nLarry says he planned on being with Linda forever.\n\nHe promised to be by her side through sickness, health and her constant battle with epilepsy.\n\n\u201cWe have been at points and times where a good day was 10 to 15 grand mal seizures. I\u2019ve seen her go through brain surgery. We\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d said Larry.\n\nThe Social Security Administration doesn\u2019t allow a couple to make more than $1,100 when the income is not from wages.\n\nWhen Larry Drain decided to enter retirement, his check was less than his old paycheck but it was still too much.\n\n\u201cShortly after I took the retirement, Social Security called and told us we made too much money and they had a limit on unearned income. I said, \u2018How can my retirement be unearned income?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Legally it is,\u201d he said.\n\nLarry says his wife would have lost her SSI and her TennCare coverage if she continued to live with him.\n\nSo, Larry says they did what they needed to for her health.\n\n\u201cOn December the 26, after 33 years of marriage, we separated and Linda went to live with her mom,\u201d said Larry Drain.\n\nThe Drains say they make too little to qualify for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoth would have qualified for TennCare while still living together if Tennessee had expanded its Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cIn order to keep my wife alive, I can\u2019t live with her. Unless Gov. Haslam chooses to expand Medicaid, I\u2019ll never be able to live with her,\u201d said Larry.\n\nGovernor Haslam\u2019s office released the following statement:\n\n\u201cGovernor Haslam believes that more people having access to healthcare is a good thing, but you have to do it in a way that controls costs and provides for better outcomes. The governor and administration continue to have discussions with HHS and CMS about the Tennessee Plan, the governor\u2019s approach for a third path to real healthcare reform for Tennessee.\u201d\n\nThere was no response from TennCare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MARYVILLE, Tenn. - A Tennessee couple says governmental policies have forced them to separate after 33 years of marriage.
