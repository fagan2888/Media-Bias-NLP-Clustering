Illinois is mailing information to another 36,000 households in seven counties to promote health insurance enrollment in rural areas and small cities.

The Get Covered Illinois campaign launched the direct-mail strategy last month. Executive Director Jennifer Koehler says the mailings increased calls and website traffic from less-populated corners of the state.

This week, mailings go to McLean County in central Illinois and Madison County in southwestern Illinois. Later mailings will go to households in Knox, Stark, Bureau, Marshall and Woodford in northern Illinois.

The orange fliers say "Enroll now" and explain where to get free in-person help signing up for insurance. The mailings are part of a $25.6 million contract with St. Louis-based Fleishman Hillard to promote Affordable Care Act coverage.

The second sign-up season under the health law ends Feb. 15.
