FORT SMITH (KFSM) - For a "5NEWS This Morning" segment that aired Sunday (July 5), anchor Jay Plyburn spoke to Rep. Bruce Westerman about a number of controversial issues. He touched on the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark rulings when it came to keeping the health subsidies in place for the Affordable Care Act and legalizing same-sex marriage across the country.

He also talked about a bill he's hoping reaches the Congressional floor called "the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015."
