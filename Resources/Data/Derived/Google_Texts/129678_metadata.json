Vince Lewis said.\n\nJust before 1 p.m., Lewis said, \"We are not looking for any outstanding persons at this time.\"\n\n[RAW VIDEO: Sgt. Vince Lewis describes the investigation]\n\nThe shooting happened in the 2100 block of W. Poinsettia just after 5:15 a.m.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up I seen all the cops outside so and that was it and then they told me somebody had died,\u201d neighbor Gary Kelly explained.\n\nPolice received a call about an unwanted guest at the home in north Phoenix. About 30 seconds later, a second caller told police it was an emergency.\n\nA neighbor said she heard loud music and a gunshot ring out.\n\nA man who lives in the area said the gunfire was unsettling.\n\n\"First time we\u2019ve ever actually seen or heard anything like this. That\u2019s crazy. Like I said, this is a safe neighborhood. Weird. If you\u2019re going to scare us, no, no, no,\u201d the man said.\n\nA number of officers showed up.\n\n\"They conducted a protective sweep of the interior of the home and found one adult male victim with a gunshot wound to the stomach,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nOfficers said the victim and suspect knew each other and had gotten into an argument.\n\n\u201cApparently they met each other earlier in the night and came back here to continue a party,\" Lewis said. \"There was some type of argument and there was one gunshot heard.\u201d\n\nInvestigators recovered a shotgun inside the home. They detained two people for questioning - a man and a woman - who were in a bedroom.\n\nThe suspect lived in the home where the shooting happened.\n\nPolice detectives walked around the area knocked on doors in their quest for information and leads in the case.\n\n\u201cI guess I want to go in and lock up you know I don\u2019t want to be out here, that\u2019s for sure. Oh my. That\u2019s just too bad because this is always such a quiet area. We never hear anything, you know,\u201d said Becky Ockenfels, a neighbor.\n\nPolice aren't releasing the name of the victim until they can notify next-of-kin.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
