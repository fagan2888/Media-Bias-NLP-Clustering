It closed because of the approaching war.\n\nThe campus was opened with an undergraduate program in 1965 in downtown Uniontown followed by the first building at the location of the current campus in 1968.\n\n\u201cLocal business leaders raised $1.2 million for this land,\u201d said Bill Blaney, advisory board chairman.\n\nBlaney said the campus location was chosen because it's centrally located in Fayette County between Connellsville and Uniontown and has access to a major highway.\n\n\u201cThis is a hub for education and culture and enjoys a great partnership with the community,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nThe anniversary ceremony concluded with the unveiling of a new clock on the plaza.\n\nStudent activity fees paid for the project.\n\n\u201cNo student tuition money was used to purchase the plaza,\u201d said Angela Simmons, the outgoing president of the campus student government association.\n\nPatrick said the clock is one of several legacy projects for the plaza, which is right outside the community center.\n\nOrganizers said the clock has 250 bricks around its base that are for sale for memorials or dedications with the proceeds going toward student scholarships.\n\nMark Hofmann is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
