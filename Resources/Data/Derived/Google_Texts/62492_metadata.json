I think it\u2019s the same for this next one that I\u2019m going to have to watch it later. But I do, you know, I obviously will watch how each of the Republicans is out of touch and out of date in what they\u2019re saying and keep track of that, because clearly their front-runner gets most of the attention, but there\u2019s not any real difference in where they would take the country on so many of the important issues. Among them\u2014and I want to keep, you know, drawing those contrasts. So that not just Democrats but Independents, Republicans, Americans one and all can understand that electing any of the Republican candidates would be a dramatic u-turn.\u201d\n\nClinton continued, \u201cThey have all committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act. We would go back to, you know, where we were decades ago, and 16 million people would lose their coverage. They do not support, as I said today, equal pay for equal work or paid family leave or a lot of other tools that I\u2019m advocating for women to be successful and effective in the workplace. And clearly the economic policies are unsuccessful. They\u2019re failures. They want to go back to trickle down economics and absolutely the wrong direction for the country. So, I like to hear what they have to say and then draw the contrasts with each and every one of them.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary: All GOP Candidates 'Out of Touch, Out of Date' Like Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary: All GOP Candidates 'Out of Touch, Out of Date' Like Trump", "title": "Hillary: All GOP Candidates 'Out of Touch,' 'Out of Date' Like Trump - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-485410320.jpg", "height": 481}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/14/hillary-all-gop-candidates-out-of-touch-out-of-date-like-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary: All GOP Candidates 'Out of Touch, Out of Date' Like Trump", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-485410320.jpg", "title": "Hillary: All GOP Candidates 'Out of Touch,' 'Out of Date' Like Trump - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-09-14T12:27:09-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd157\"", "article_summary": "I think it\u2019s the same for this next one that I\u2019m going to have to watch it later.\nWe would go back to, you know, where we were decades ago, and 16 million people would lose their coverage.\nThey want to go back to trickle down economics and absolutely the wrong direction for the country.\nSo, I like to hear what they have to say and then draw the contrasts with each and every one of them.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nAmong them\u2014and I want to keep, you know, drawing those contrasts."}
