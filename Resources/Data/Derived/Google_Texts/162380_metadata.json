SSDI supplements the income of physically disabled workers and automatically enrolls them in Medicare after two years. The plan is funded by federal payroll taxes.\n\nWith more and more Americans turning to the program--and increasing evidence of billions dollars in fraud--the latest trustees\u2019 report projects that the fund\u2019s reserves will be depleted in late 2016. By law, Social Security can only pay benefits if there is a positive balance in the appropriate funds. Actually, there are two funds: one for old age and survivors\u2019 benefits (OASI) and the other for disability benefits (SSDI).\n\nAbsent those reserves, Blahous said, the only funds the government can use to cover disability claims is the incoming tax revenue. Unfortunately, there would only be enough to cover 81 percent of scheduled disability benefits.\n\nCongress is fast running out of time to address the brewing financial crisis. Legislation will be required during this session of Congress or, at the very latest, in a rush of activity early next year, to prevent large sudden benefit cuts. The House of Representatives recently passed a procedural rule to prepare for the coming legislative debate.\n\nRelated: The Government Entitlement Program That\u2019s About to Dry Up\n\nIf Congress fails to act, however, more than 10 million beneficiaries essentially will face a nearly 20 percent reduction to the scheduled benefits that they rely upon for financial wellbeing. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, here is a summary of the president\u2019s recommendations\n\nShore up the SSDI Trust Fund. Currently, employers and their workers each pay a total of 6.2 percent of their wages to the Social Security system: 0.9 percent is allocated to SSDI and 5.3 percent to OASI. Under Obama\u2019s approach, neither the overall tax rate nor the solvency of the combined trust funds would be affected. Instead, it would reallocate a few tenths of a percentage point of payroll tax revenue from the OASI fund to the SSDI fund, so that both trust funds would be sustained until 2033.\n\nTest early intervention strategies to keep people in the workplace. This proposal would experiment with early intervention approaches to help people with a potentially work-limiting disability to remain in the workforce. Those methods would include providing supportive services to those with mental impairments giving employers incentives to retain workers with disabilities, and incentivizing states to better coordinate the services that they provide.\n\nRelated: New Evidence That Disability Fraud Costs Billions\n\nHire More Administrative Law Judges. There is a huge backlog of more than one million workers waiting to appeal adverse rulings as they seek SSDI coverage. The president\u2019s budget proposes funding to reduce the backlog by increasing the number of administrative law judges and streamlining the appeal process.\n\nProvide a Mandatory Funding Stream for Continuing Disability Reviews\n\nObama believes that the government can save the SSDI program $32 billion over the coming decade by bolstering a program that reviews cases every three to seven years to determine whether a beneficiary\u2019s medical condition has improved.\n\nStop \u201cDouble Dipping\u201d into Government Coffers Obama proposes to offset an individual\u2019s entitled SSDI benefit in any month that they receive state or federal unemployment insurance benefits, a proposal also featured in last year\u2019s budget. For example, if someone was entitled to $1,000 a month from SSDI and already received $400 from unemployment insurance in a particular month, their SSDI benefit would be reduced to $600 for that month.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s $4 trillion budget blue print for fiscal 2016 has garnered a lot of", "title": "Obama Juggles the Numbers to Save Social Security Disability Benefits", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/Obama-Juggles-Numbers-Save-Social-Security-Disability-Benefits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212014_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/Obama-Juggles-Numbers-Save-Social-Security-Disability-Benefits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212014_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s $4 trillion budget blue print for fiscal 2016 has garnered a lot of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Actually, there are two funds: one for old age and survivors\u2019 benefits (OASI) and the other for disability benefits (SSDI).\nAccording to the Bipartisan Policy Center, here is a summary of the president\u2019s recommendationsShore up the SSDI Trust Fund.\nUnfortunately, there would only be enough to cover 81 percent of scheduled disability benefits.\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, neither the overall tax rate nor the solvency of the combined trust funds would be affected.\nBy law, Social Security can only pay benefits if there is a positive balance in the appropriate funds."}
