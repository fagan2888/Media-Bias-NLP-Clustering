Even though the GOP caucus in Congress stepped away months ago from its years-long assault on Obamacare, the top contenders for the Republican presidential nod appear to be doubling down.

Almost immediately after the Supreme Court issued its decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, every major Republican presidential candidate decried the ruling and called for the healthcare law to be repealed, replaced or both.

Here’s a sampling of the showdown Republican candidates are promising:

Sen. Marco Rubio

Despite the Court’s decision, ObamaCare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

I remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it... — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

Sen. Ted Cruz

Any candidate not willing to make 2016 a referendum on Repealing Obamacare should step aside https://t.co/6i4WzLFzKR #FullRepeal — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 25, 2015

I remain fully committed to the repeal of Obamacare—every single word of it. And, in 2017, we will do exactly that https://t.co/6i4WzLFzKR — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 25, 2015

The solution is for Congress to admit they screwed up, repeal the "nightmare of #Obamacare" & let states road-test real health care reforms. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015
