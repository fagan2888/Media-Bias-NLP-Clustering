First, there\u2019s the plan\u2019s immediate goal: significant decreases in the emissions in the U.S. between now and 2030. Second, the rule arrives as the world gears up for global emissions talks in Paris in December, and American action is seen as necessary to convince other countries to act. And third, Obama views the fight against climate change as an essential part of his legacy, alongside the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe\u2019re the first generation to feel the impact of climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it,\u201d Obama said at a press conference at the White House on Monday, repeating a line he\u2019s used before. The president emphasized the moral case for reducing emissions throughout the speech, invoking Pope Francis\u2019s call for action, and scolding \u201ccynical\u201d critics who charged his plan would hurt minorities and the poor. \u201cIf you care about low-income minority communities, start protecting the air they breathe and stop trying to rob them of their health care.\u201d\n\nIn brief, the Clean Power Plan puts limits on carbon pollution from power plants, mandating a 32-percent reduction by 2030, though based on 2005 levels, setting state-by-state standards for reduction. The rule is expected to lead to the closure of many coal-fired plants and prevent new ones from opening. The regulation was first proposed last year, and, after the EPA considered public comments, the final rule was released Monday. Experts described the rule as historic.

Gerrard said while the rule\u2019s impact would be important stateside, it was at least as important because of the role it will play in the global negotiations in Paris. Although China is now the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the U.S. has historically been larger, and American action is seen as essential to urging other countries to move on reductions. Following Obama\u2019s proposal in 2014, China announced new emissions targets. But international progress is fragile, and attempts at marshaling a global response to climate change have repeatedly foundered. \u201cIf these rules were to crash and burn before the Paris conference, that would likely have disastrous effects there,\u201d Gerrard said. The rule faces serious challenges in the U.S., too. A coalition of Republican politicians and energy corporations have lined up to oppose it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky is a major coal producer, has urged state governments not to comply. Even before the rule was finalized, challenges from coal companies and the state of West Virginia tried to stop it, but the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that a rule that hadn\u2019t been enacted couldn\u2019t be challenged. Those plaintiffs will likely return to the courts for a second chance. The final rule is similar to the proposal\u2014and in fact upgraded the target reduction from 30 percent to 32 percent. But it also makes several changes aimed at making the rule more palatable to states and more likely to win approval from judges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new EPA rule is designed to withstand legal challenges from Republicans while convincing world leaders to follow suit.", "author": "David A.
