But bear with me. Because two reports issued this week are a perfect illustration of why cancer screening is such a tricky topic.\n\nConsider them both and you\u2019ll have a better appreciation of the complexities of the issue. And why individuals and health policymakers need to think carefully about when to screen and what to do with the results.\n\nOne new report is about screening for thyroid cancer. It makes a strong case for why it\u2019s not a good idea.\n\nThe other is about screening for cervical cancer. It\u2019s an equally strong argument for why there\u2019s not enough.\n\nFirst, thyroid cancer screening. South Korea has gone in for it in a big way, as part of a national push for detecting all cancers for which there\u2019s a screening test \u2013 cancer of the breast, uterine cervix, colon, stomach and liver.\n\nSouth Korea is years ahead of the U.S in paying for cancer screening. Back in 1999, the government started providing free or very low-cost cancer screening, something that\u2019s only now happening, and more cautiously, under the U.S. Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Korean program doesn\u2019t include thyroid cancer in its screening program. But so many hospitals and doctors have ultrasound machines \u2013 which can detect tiny thyroid tumors with a quick neck scan \u2013 that thyroid cancer screening has become routine in recent years, for a fee of $50 or less. It\u2019s an easy sell, and an easy way to make money.\n\nAs a result, South Korea\u2019s rate of thyroid cancer has soared. It\u2019s 15 times higher than it was in the early 1990s, before routine ultrasound screening. No other cancer is diagnosed more often there, which is pretty striking considering that thyroid cancer is the 10th most common malignancy in the U.S.\n\nBut curiously, deaths from thyroid cancer in South Korea haven\u2019t gone down at all over the past two decades, according to an article in this week\u2019s New England Journal of Medicine. And reducing cancer death is, after all, the reason for screening. The logic is that cancers will be more curable if they\u2019re caught early.\n\nThe Korean story shows that\u2019s not true for all cancers. Thyroid cancer is the epitome of a malignancy that it\u2019s usually better not to find.\n\nDr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth and his Korean co-authors point out that autopsy studies dating back to 1947 show that many people have previously unsuspected thyroid malignancies at the time of death.\n\nResearchers estimate that at least one in every three people has a thyroid malignancy, \u201cthe vast majority of which will not produce symptoms during a person\u2019s lifetime,\u201d Welch and his coworkers write.\n\nUltrasound scans reveal this enormous reservoir of mostly harmless thyroid cancers. Welch et al call it an epidemic of \u201cover-diagnosis.\u201d They point out that the thyroid cancers being diagnosed in South Korea are almost always a slow-growing, non-life-threatening type that doesn\u2019t need to be treated.\n\nTreating them is not harmless. \u201cVirtually all the people diagnosed with thyroid cancer are treated,\u201d the New England Journal article notes. Surgeons usually remove the thyroid gland, totally or partially, and patients must take thyroid hormone supplements the rest of their lives, often with difficult side effects.\n\nMore than one Korean thyroid-surgery patient in 10 suffers damage to the nearby parathyroid glands, which causes difficult-to-treat abnormalities of calcium metabolism. Two in every 100 patients ends up with paralyzed vocal cords from surgical mishaps.\n\nBut clearly, South Korean doctors and patients find it almost impossible not to treat a cancer once it\u2019s diagnosed.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to long-running arguments in the U.S. and other countries about who should get mammograms to detect early breast cancer, or PSA tests to spot suspicious prostate tumors.\n\nWelch is no stranger to over-diagnosis debates. He co-authored a controversial article two years ago that claimed many of early breast tumors revealed by mammography don\u2019t need to be treated at all.\n\nMammography screening is a less clear-cut issue than thyroid cancer ultrasound. There\u2019s more evidence that mammography saves some lives. The controversy is more about who should be screened, how often, and what to do about a positive mammogram.\n\nScreening for cervical cancer is on the other side of the ledger. It\u2019s the epitome of a cancer that should be screened for, because the payoff is so clear.\n\nWhen the \u201cPap\u201d smear was introduced in 1950 (named after its inventor, Dr. George Papanicolaou), cervical cancer was the number-one killer of American women. Now it\u2019s not even in the top 10.\n\nNo malignancy is more preventable than cancer of the cervix. But more than 12,000 U.S. women still get it every year, and more than 4,000 die from it.\n\n\u201cNo woman should ever die from cervical cancer,\u201d Ileana Arias of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a Wednesday telephone briefing.\n\nBut a new CDC report shows that more than one woman in 10 isn\u2019t getting screened for cervical cancer.\n\nAmong women who lack insurance or a regular health care provider, one in four hasn\u2019t been screened in the past five years.\n\nIt\u2019s a fixable problem. A Pap smear every three years between the ages of 21 and 65 can spot cervical malignancies \u2013 and pre-cancerous abnormalities \u2013 in time to prevent life-threatening disease, or head off cancer entirely.\n\nUnlike thyroid cancer, over-diagnosis of cervical cancer is not a problem. Every abnormal result needs to be followed up by a repeat Pap smear in 6 to 12 months, and the most suspicious results justify a biopsy to determine if treatment is needed.\n\nA relatively new test that identifies women chronically infected with cancer-causing strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) adds another layer of early detection. It\u2019s for women over age 30.\n\nIncidentally, public health experts think that a vaccine against HPV, given to teenagers, could virtually eliminate cervical cancer along with cancer of the penis in men. But the CDC says 60 percent of adolescent girls and 86 percent of boys aren\u2019t getting vaccinated.\n\nTaken together, screening for thyroid and cervical cancer show that not all screening is equal. Like so much in medicine, it\u2019s complicated, and the pros and cons of each need to be weighed with care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thyroid cancer is the epitome of a malignancy that it's usually better not to find.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Thyroid cancer is the epitome of a malignancy that it's usually better not to find.", "title": "Catching Cancer Early: Be Careful What You Screen For", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/catching-cancer-early-be-careful-what-you-screen-for", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/11/Screen-shot-2014-11-06-at-2.51.53-PM-620x426.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/catching-cancer-early-be-careful-what-you-screen-for", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/11/Screen-shot-2014-11-06-at-2.51.53-PM-620x426.png", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Catching Cancer Early: Be Careful What You Screen For"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-06", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 06 Nov 2014 15:11:39 -0500"}, "article_summary": "Catching Cancer Early: Be Careful What You Screen ForBy Richard KnoxTrue or false: It\u2019s always better to catch cancer early.\nUnlike thyroid cancer, over-diagnosis of cervical cancer is not a problem.\nFirst, thyroid cancer screening.\nIncidentally, public health experts think that a vaccine against HPV, given to teenagers, could virtually eliminate cervical cancer along with cancer of the penis in men.\nNo other cancer is diagnosed more often there, which is pretty striking considering that thyroid cancer is the 10th most common malignancy in the U.S."}
