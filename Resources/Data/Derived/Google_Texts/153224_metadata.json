Ted Strickland and Portland Mayor Michael Brennan on Tuesday to call for an increase in the minimum wage, expansion of health care benefits and other steps they said would boost a shrinking middle class.\n\nThe \u201cPut the Middle Class First\u201d bus tour visited Portland on Tuesday morning, with a second Maine stop scheduled for Bangor in the afternoon. The campaign season bus tour is slated to visit 18 states in the month leading up to the Nov. 4 election, and on Tuesday, it aimed to rally support for Maine gubernatorial candidate Mike Michaud and U.S. Senate hopeful Shenna Bellows.\n\nMichaud, a six-term congressman locked in a three-way race for the Blaine House, pledged that on his first day in office, he would submit legislation expanding federal Medicaid benefits in Maine.\n\nMichaud\u2019s top rival for the governorship, incumbent Republican Gov. Paul LePage, has vetoed five attempts by Democratic lawmakers to expand Medicaid in the state to cover an additional 70,000 Mainers, a step made possible through President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act.\n\nMichaud and LePage also face independent Eliot Cutler, who has said he\u2019d support expanding Medicaid in Maine, in the gubernatorial race.\n\nLePage has argued the growth of Medicaid, distributed in the state under the MaineCare program, would force state government to pay millions more in administrative and health care costs that it can\u2019t afford.\n\nOn Tuesday, David Sorensen, spokesman for the Maine Republican Party, said that while the Democratic candidates claim to be working in the best interests of the middle class, the measures they\u2019re touting have unintended consequences that hurt the economy. An increase of the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, as Obama has advocated for, would drive up payroll costs for employers nationwide and result in the elimination of 500,000 jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Sorensen pointed out.\n\n\u201cI would warn Mainers against climbing aboard the Michaud-Bellows bus, because it\u2019s headed straight for a fiscal and economic cliff where jobs are destroyed, debt is ignored, and big government is the solution to everything,\u201d Sorensen said in a statement.\n\nStrickland \u2014 whose career arc of spending 12 years in the U.S. House before being elected Ohio\u2019s governor in 2006 matches the path Michaud hopes to follow this year \u2014 said in contrast that Republican reluctance to raise the minimum wage, among other steps, is just building greater profits for wealthy corporate heads and \u201csqueezing the middle class.\u201d\n\nStrickland said that between 2000 and 2012, average wages remained flat for U.S. workers, while costs of living \u2014 including child care, housing, health care and secondary education \u2014 rose by $10,000 per year.\n\nThe former Ohio governor added that 95 percent of all income gains during the economic recovery in the aftermath of the recent recession have been accrued in the top 1 percent of U.S. households.\n\n\u201cThe middle class is working harder and is falling farther and farther behind,\u201d Strickland told reporters on Tuesday in Portland.\n\n\u201cRight now, our state is being held hostage, being held back by a lack of leadership in the Blaine House,\u201d Michaud said.\n\nThat message likely resonated in Portland, considered one of the most liberal places in Maine and, thanks to Brennan, a place considering its own minimum wage increase to $10.68 per hour by 2017.\n\nThe federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, while Maine\u2019s minimum wage is $7.50 per hour.\n\n\u201cSomeone might ask why the mayor of a municipality is acting to increase the minimum wage,\u201d Brennan said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s what the state government is supposed to do. That\u2019s what the federal government is supposed to do. But neither the state government nor federal government is doing what they need to do.\u201d\n\nBellows, who faces an uphill battle in an attempt to unseat popular incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins, said on Tuesday that a cap on Social Security contributions above $117,000 in income should be lifted. Doing so would force those earning millions and billions of dollars annually to pay more into Social Security, and more resources would be available for seniors and to stabilize the fund moving forward, she said.\n\n\u201cOne in three Maine seniors are dependant solely on Social Security, and their payments aren\u2019t making it to the end of the month,\u201d Bellows said.\n\n\u201cThey are hiding that they are going without basic needs to protect their pride,\u201d said Diane Grandmason, 71, of Lewiston, a leader of the Maine Alliance for Retired Americans and speaker at Tuesday morning\u2019s bus tour stop.\n\nBellows, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, also called for a series of steps to make college more affordable, including lowering student loan interest rates, expanding student loan forgiveness opportunities and increasing federal investments in higher education to help drive down tuition costs.\n\nSorensen countered that those measures amount to \u201cforcing taxpayers to bail out students while ignoring the underlying problem of the skyrocketing cost of higher [education].\u201d\n\nBut Bellows suggested immediate steps are necessary: \u201cWe\u2019re literally mortgaging our young people. The student loan payments that some people are paying are staggering.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Democratic candidates for Maine governor and the U.S. Senate joined former Ohio governor and U.S. Rep.
