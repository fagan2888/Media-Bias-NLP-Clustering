Just take the lead right away and then hang on,\u201d Berian told assembled reporters afterward at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Ore. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel most comfortable racing, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to do. About 150 to go, I started feeling tightening up. Definitely the home crowd got me going.\u201d\n\nBerian, who was The Denver Post\u2019s boys track and field athlete of the year in 2011, ran an indoor personal best of 1 minute, 45.83 seconds, after blasting to the lead of the six-man field from lane five to grab control of the race.\n\nHe whipped through the first 200 meters in just under 24 seconds, and then hit the second of four laps in 49.73, his strides smooth and the field sitting back, figuring he had gone out too hard and would return. Berian gradually extended his lead over the next lap and then some, but started laboring with about \u00be of a lap to go. It appeared the field would catch him.\n\nBut with Antoine Gakeme of Burundi stalking close behind, Berian held as the Portland crowd rose to its feet and roared. Gakeme finished second in 1:46.65, and Erik Sowinski of the United States was third in 1:47.22.\n\nAsked by an NBC Sports reporter how he accomplished his remarkable turnaround during the last few months, Berian was succinct: \u201cWorking my (butt) off.\u201d\n\nThat Berian, who is not signed to a shoe contract, even made it to the final is lucky. He did not grab an automatic qualifying spot by winning his heat in the preliminary rounds \u2014 in fact, he was the last runner to make it into finals based on time.\n\n\u201cIt is an amazing story,\u201d his agent, Merhawi Keflezighi, told The Post on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s like a script from a movie. But it\u2019s real. Obviously Boris had a lot of talent, even when he was running at Adams State. He had run very well. So he had a lot of talent.\u201d\n\nHe had raced only a few times this indoor season, competing in Boston at the New Balance Games on Feb. 14 to win a 600. He then won the U.S. Indoor Championships last week on the same track in Portland.\n\nAfter graduating from Widefield High School in Colorado Springs, he went to Adams State and won the 800 at the NCAA Division II championships as a freshman. But he struggled in the classroom and dropped out by spring 2014. By the time he connected with coach Carlos Handler, he hadn\u2019t raced in two years. He got an offer to join Handler\u2019s Big Bear Track Club in Big Bear, Calif., and left for there in December 2014. In the span of a few months while there, he dropped his 800 best from 1:48 to 1:43, benefitting from structured training with fellow professional Brenda Martinez, who is married to Handler.\n\n\u201cSometimes no matter how talented you are, you need to be in the right environment. That\u2019s a proven training environment, and it\u2019s worked very well for Boris,\u201d Keflezighi said.\n\nAt the U.S. Outdoor Championships last year in Eugene, Ore., Berian had his worst race since returning to the track. He faded in the homestretch of the 800-meter semifinal and was clipped at the line for the last spot in the final, despite having run the No. 5 fastest time in the 800 in American history earlier that season.\n\nHis botched race meant that a promising turnaround story wouldn\u2019t have its fairytale ending \u2014 a spot representing the U.S.on the world outdoor team. It was a setback from which he could have struggled to recover. Now, Berian will focus on the Olympic Trials in July in Eugene in the hopes of making it to the summer games in Rio.\n\n\u201cHe learned that lesson,\u201d Keflezighi said. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably what I respect about Boris. Sometimes certain experiences make you or break you, and I think it\u2019s made him a smarter and more corageous runner.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or @danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boris Berian wins 800-meter gold medal at world indoor championships", "title": "Boris Berian wins 800-meter gold medal at world indoor championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/boris-berian-wins-800-meter-gold-medal-at-world-indoor-championships/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516584702p1.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516584702p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T20:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:42:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "He then won the U.S. Indoor Championships last week on the same track in Portland.\nOutdoor Championships last year in Eugene, Ore., Berian had his worst race since returning to the track.\nBut with Antoine Gakeme of Burundi stalking close behind, Berian held as the Portland crowd rose to its feet and roared.\nBerian gradually extended his lead over the next lap and then some, but started laboring with about \u00be of a lap to go.\nThat\u2019s a proven training environment, and it\u2019s worked very well for Boris,\u201d Keflezighi said."}
