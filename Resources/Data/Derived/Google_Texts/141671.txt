Syracuse, N.Y. -- The ripple effects of the planned shutdown of Health Republic of New York may be felt by a Syracuse company that processes the insurer's claims.

POMCO, headquartered in Eastwood, has hired about 125 people to handle claims for Health Republic. POMCO is one of the nation's largest independent benefits administrators.

Health Republic hired POMCO to be its claims administrator, customer service call center and medical management provider.

Donald Napier, the company's senior executive vice president, said POMCO learned today of the planned shutdown of Health Republic and hasn't determined yet what the impact will be.

The state ordered Health Republic to stop writing new policies because regulators expect the insurer to become financially insolvent.

Health Republic was established in 2013 to sell health plans on the New York health insurance exchange and capture business created by the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
