Jerry Brown\u2019s plan to hike the state minimum wage to $15 an hour \u2014 about $3.50 more.\n\nIncluding nonwage costs \u2014 payroll taxes, paid sick leave and ObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate \u2014 minimum compensation for a full-time worker could rise as high as $18.52 an hour by 2022, an IBD analysis finds.\n\nSocial insurance taxes would add $1.15 an hour to the $15 wage. Three days of paid sick leave now on the books in California would add another 19 cents. And the ObamaCare after-tax fine, now $2,160 per uncovered full-time worker and rising each year, will equate to roughly $2.18 an hour in pretax wages. Adding in workers\u2019 compensation insurance and unemployment insurance would push the total close to $19 an hour.\n\nOne big change from a $15 minimum wage has flown below the radar: Many low-wage workers would no longer qualify for Medicaid. For example, a single mom with one child who worked 32 hours per week would earn more than the 138% of poverty cutoff for expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare, though her child would still qualify. A single adult who works just three full days a week also would exceed the income threshold.\n\nShift Social Welfare To Fast Food\n\nTo no small degree, the $15 minimum-wage movement is asking low-wage employers to lift their workers up closer to the middle class and to provide a full menu of social benefits on top. It looks like a recipe for trouble, and even Brown may be wary about it, insisting that the governor retain authority to delay wage hikes if the state sees a fall in employment or retail sales, or if the state faces a budget deficit. Brown had little room for maneuver because a $15 wage initiative that qualified for the November ballot looked like a sure winner and would have provided no flexibility if the wage hike started backfiring.\n\nOne early-warning sign for California\u2019s wage experiment was Wal-Mart\u2019s (WMT) announcement in January that it would shutter stores in Oakland and Los Angeles and cancel two planned stores in Washington D.C., dealing a blow to three cities on the leading edge of the push for a much higher minimum wage.\n\nBefore Los Angeles put its minimum wage on a path to $15 an hour, the question of how city employers would respond to the simultaneous imposition of a health insurance mandate was simply ignored. An analysis of the wage hike\u2019s labor cost impact by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, explicitly excluded health insurance \u2014 or a mandate penalty. The authors explained: \u201cHealth benefits are excluded since \u2026 the costs of the benefits will not change if wages are increased.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office came to a different conclusion, finding that the ObamaCare employer mandate would exacerbate the impact of a minimum-wage hike. It estimated that a minimum-wage hike to $10.10 an hour could cost 500,000 jobs.\n\n\u201c(The) additional cost on employers for some low-wage workers who do not currently have employment-based health insurance \u2026 further boosts the likelihood that employers\u2019 savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,\u201d the CBO said.\n\nLabor-Saving Technology\n\nThose adjustment costs might include adding labor-saving technology.\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN) CFO Todd Penegor explained in an August earnings call, \u201cWe continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that\u2019s customer self-order kiosks (or) whether that\u2019s automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant.\u201d\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) and Yum Brands\u2019 (YUM) Taco Bell are among the restaurant chains promoting mobile ordering, which reduces the need for cashiers. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) is about to start testing mobile apps as well.\n\nSidestepping ObamaCare\n\nThe truth about the ObamaCare employer mandate is that it hasn\u2019t been nearly as much of a burden on businesses as feared, so they haven\u2019t had to cut workers\u2019 hours below 30 per week in a dramatic way. But the reason is hardly cause for celebration: Employers have figured out how to dodge liability by offering \u201caffordable\u201d coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay.\n\nThat\u2019s left millions of modest-wage, full-time workers without affordable coverage options. It\u2019s possible that California\u2019s embrace of a $15 minimum wage will add to their ranks. But the status quo of full-time workers thrown under the bus by ObamaCare may not hold. If the mandate ever becomes something that can\u2019t be easily dodged, minimum-wage employers in California will likely cut work hours in a big way, diluting the promise of a living wage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's more than meets the eye to California Gov.
