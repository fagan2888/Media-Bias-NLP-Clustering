All this, and comments by family members, suggest that Jenner is willing to be a role model and help educate the world on transgender issues.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to praise the stepfather to Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe Kardashian.\n\nAlso Read: Bruce Jenner's Transition to Woman Expected to Be Documented in E! Series\n\n\u201cGood for Jenner. All this is probably harder than the training for the Olympic decathlon \u2014 but more important, because transgender people face hate crimes and discrimination at an astonishing rate.\u201d\n\nWhile on \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d Gail King wrote:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been less conversation about the final scene in the movie, which shows the hero walking through his family home, where the kids are romping. He\u2019s carrying a handgun, which he points at his wife Taya, playfully telling her to \u201cdrop them drawers.\u201d Taya says she can see he\u2019s finally getting over his war traumas and back to his old fun-loving self. This is, by virtually any standard, insane behavior.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Jesse Ventura Vents More 'American Sniper' Criticism By Comparing US to Nazis, Communists: 'We Behave the Same Way Now'\n\nSome took to Twitter to voice their displeasure:\n\nStunning stupidity from liberal rag.
