It came in very tepidly initially and has not been very aggressive or interested in the exchanges,\u201d noted the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nLater, Emanuel said that UnitedHealth \u201conly had about six percent of the enrollees in the exchanges, so it\u2019s not really that big an upset for the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I think there\u2019s a lot more attention on it because it is the biggest insurer in the country, but again, it\u2019s never been a big player in the exchange world,\u201d Emanuel argued. \u201cSo I would not say that it\u2019s that big a deal.\u201d\n\nScarborough retorted, \u201cBut if the economics don\u2019t work for UnitedHealthCare, why do the economics work for any insurance company?\u201d\n\nEmanuel replied, \u201cWell, one reason the economics probably don\u2019t work for United is that they came in late, and they got a lot more sicker patients.\u201d\n\nFellow panelist and Spine specialist Dr. Dave Campbell cut in insisting, \u201cI disagree, because what we know that\u2019s happening with UnitedHealthCare is the same as the canary in the coal mine. This is the first of many insurers that will bail out of the exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already been stated by other insurers in their board meetings,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cEach insurer that is participating in the Affordable Care Act is losing money.\u201d\n\nCampbell went on to say that another insurer, BlueCross BlueShield is \u201cclose behind\u201d and that other insurance companies are merging.\n\nFollow Steve on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Guest", "description": "Dr. Zeke Emanuel claims that UnitedHealth was not successful in their Obamacare endeavor because \"they got a lot more sicker patients.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Dr. Zeke Emanuel, former White House adviser for health policy and the vice provost for Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that UnitedHealth was not successful in their Obama", "title": "Obamacare Adviser: UnitedHealth Is Pulling Out Because Patients Were Too Sick [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/22/obamacare-adviser-unitedhealth-is-pulling-out-because-patients-were-too-sick-video/", "image": {"width": 990, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Masked-Benjamin-Franklin-shutterstock_145263814-e1461336903816.jpg", "height": 425}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'They came in late'", "title": "Obamacare Adviser: UnitedHealth Is Pulling Out Because Patients Were Too Sick [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/22/obamacare-adviser-unitedhealth-is-pulling-out-because-patients-were-too-sick-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Masked-Benjamin-Franklin-shutterstock_145263814-e1461336903816.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SteveGuest", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-22 12:32:03", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Adviser: UnitedHealth Is Pulling Out Because Patients Were Too Sick [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "dave campbell,obamacare,unitedhealth,zeke emanuel", "sailthru.description": "Dr. Zeke Emanuel, former White House adviser for health policy and the vice provost for Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that UnitedHealth was not successful in their Obama", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Masked-Benjamin-Franklin-shutterstock_145263814-e1461336903816.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It came in very tepidly initially and has not been very aggressive or interested in the exchanges,\u201d noted the Washington Free Beacon.\n\u2026 First of all, United was a never big player in the exchanges.\nThis is the first of many insurers that will bail out of the exchanges.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been stated by other insurers in their board meetings,\u201d Campbell said.\n\u201cEach insurer that is participating in the Affordable Care Act is losing money.\u201dCampbell went on to say that another insurer, BlueCross BlueShield is \u201cclose behind\u201d and that other insurance companies are merging.\nFollow Steve on Twitter and Facebook"}
