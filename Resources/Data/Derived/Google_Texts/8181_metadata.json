MRSA staph infection rates have fallen in the last decade by more than 50 percent in hospital settings \u2014 one of the most common locations for the disease\u2019s infection.\n\nThe greater prevalence of MRSA infections in hospitals and other healthcare facilities stems largely from improper hand washing procedures among facility employees as they move from patient to patient. While the CDC\u2019s latest study cannot determine the cause of MRSA\u2019s seven-year decline, between 2005-2011, researchers point to the improvement in these sanitation procedures as marking antibiotics\u2019 greater success in staving off resistance.\n\n\"The good news is\u2026 the most serious kind of infection that lands people in hospitals and kills people is going down in the U.S.,\" Dr. Raymund Dantes, who led the study, said.\n\nDantes and his colleagues found 80,500 cases of MRSA infections in the United States in 2011. In 2005, that figure was up at 111,300. Rates among patients infected outside the hospital remained unchanged over the study period; however, the rates of hospital-acquired infection fell from about 9.7 infections per 100,000 people to about 4.5 per 100,000 people, Reuters reports. The team found infection rates among people who contracted the disease at home, after having just stayed in a hospital setting, fell 28 percent \u2014 from 21 infections per 100,000 people to about 15 infections per 100,000 people.\n\nStaph infections stand out among other infections due to their deadliness once inside the bloodstream. Staphylococcus aureus bacterium lives on the skin of close to a third of the U.S. population without consequence; if an open cut or scrape lets the bacteria in, the dangers are far more present. MRSA is unique because it is resistant to antibiotic treatment with methicillin, one of the several types of penicillin. There is also a methicillin-sensitive strain of the infection, called MSSA.\n\n\u201cAlthough methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are not necessarily more virulent than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains, some MRSA strains contain factors or genetic backgrounds that may enhance their virulence or may enable them to cause particular clinical syndromes,\u201d one 2007 study on MRSA pathogenesis states.\n\nPeople who are infected with the bacteria typically see red bumps appear on the skin, which eventually turn into larger sores. Within the body, the infection can attack bones, organs, and the bloodstream itself, making MRSA particularly lethal.\n\nDespite hospital settings seeing declines, similar community-based settings saw no change. Controlling these areas now sits at the forefront of the CDC\u2019s challenges, Dantes said.\n\n\"What's interesting about our study, we didn't see a big change \u2026 in the number of community-associated infections. So we haven't made as much progress getting those down,\" he said. \"Certainly there is more research that needs to be done to understand community-associated invasive MRSA infections. So that's an area we're looking into more.\"\n\nDantes conceded that fully understanding how MRSA spreads outside of hospitals is tricky. As a general rule, he advises people to make active, and proactive, efforts to ensure that they maintain sanitary conditions as much as possible, which includes washing their hands on a regular basis.\n\nPeople at higher risk for MRSA infections, such as those on kidney dialysis and people with diabetes, should take particular note of their hand-washing habits, according to Dr. Ghinwa Dumyati, an infectious disease physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center who worked on the CDC report.\n\n\"We're very optimistic,\u201d she said, as \u201cthere are now more and more ways to prevent the transmission.\u201d\n\nSource: Dantes R, Mu Y, Belflower R.
