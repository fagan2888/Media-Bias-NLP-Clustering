VA Software tops the historic list with a one-day jump of nearly 700 percent, according to Dealogic. Only a few of the stocks \u2013 Priceline.com, Akamai Technologies \u2013 have established themselves as something significantly more than one-day wonders.\n\nFor all the frenzy surrounding its first day of trading, Twitter (TWTR) doesn\u2019t even come close to making the list. In the context of dotcom mania, Twitter\u2019s first-day gain almost seems reasonable: The social messaging service\u2019s stock finished its first day of public trading at $44.90 a share, up 73 percent from its $26 IPO price. But then, those \u201890s Internet IPOs were far smaller than Twitter\u2019s, which raised as much as $2.1 billion. Among larger U.S. stock offerings \u2013 those that raised $500 million or more \u2013 Twitter\u2019s pop ranks as the sixth biggest, according to Dealogic data cited by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRELATED: A WARNING FOR WANNABE TWITTER IPO INVESTORS\n\nTwitter\u2019s first-day gain was also far higher than the average 17 percent \u201cpop\u201d for new U.S. stock listings this year and better than nearly all of the opening performances posted by the largest tech and Internet IPOs.\n\nTop 20 Tech IPOs Issuer Total Value $ including Non-Deal (m) Exchange Pricing Date % Change Price Offer/1 Day Facebook Inc. 16,007 Nasdaq May 12, 2012 0.6 Infineon Technologies AG 5,856 Frankfurt General, NYSE Mar. 12, 2000 100.4 Agere Systems Inc 4,140 NYSE Mar. 27, 2001 0.3 Tycom LTD 2,250 NYSE Jul. 26, 2000 12.5 Agilent 2,160 NYSE Nov. 17, 1999 48.3 Verisk Analytics Inc. 2,156 Nasdaq Oct. 6, 2009 23.7 Google 1,916 Nasdaq Aug. 18, 2004 18.0 Genuity Inc. 1,913 Nasdaq Jun. 27, 2000 -14.5 Semicondictor Manufacturing International 1,803 NYSE Mar. 12, 2004 -11.4 Freescale Semiconductor Inc 1,690 NYSE Jul. 16, 2004 7.9 EPCOS AG 1,633 Frankfurt General, NYSE Oct. 14, 1999 8.1 Yandex NV 1,435 Nasdaq May 23, 2011 55.4 Infonet Services Corp 1,238 NYSE Dec. 15, 1999 27.1 Alcatel Optronics SA 1,205 Nasdaq, Paris Oct. 19, 2000 -0.6 VMWare Inc. 1,101 NYSE Aug. 13, 2007 75.9 LG Philips LCD Co.

The pop prompted analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group to downgrade the stock to \u201csell\u201d shortly after it started trading. The shares, he wrote, would be fairly valued in the high $20 to low $30 range. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cwith a price that pushes into the high 30s and beyond, Twitter is simply too expensive.\u201d\n\nThe first-day jump also means that, for all the warnings about Twitter's lofty initial valuation and for all the reminders that the social messaging service has yet to post a profit, the company likely left a sizable chunk of change \u2013 more than $1 billion \u2013 on the table.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s IPO will go down as a successful one, and a sharp contrast to the problem-plagued debut of Facebook\u2019s stock last year. Now Twitter just has to prove that it can reward investors\u2019 enthusiasm.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Scrolling through a list of the biggest first-day \u201cpops\u201d for Internet and technology IPOs is like entering a time machine set for the go-go days of the dotcom boom.", "title": "How Twitter\u2019s First-Day Pop Compares to Other Tech IPOs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/08/How-Twitter-s-First-Day-Pop-Compares-Other-Tech-IPOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11082013_Twitter_IPO.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/08/How-Twitter-s-First-Day-Pop-Compares-Other-Tech-IPOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11082013_Twitter_IPO.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Scrolling through a list of the biggest first-day \u201cpops\u201d for Internet and technology IPOs is like entering a time machine set for the go-go days of the dotcom boom.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a55\"", "article_summary": "Among larger U.S. stock offerings \u2013 those that raised $500 million or more \u2013 Twitter\u2019s pop ranks as the sixth biggest, according to Dealogic data cited by The Wall Street Journal.\nBut then, those \u201890s Internet IPOs were far smaller than Twitter\u2019s, which raised as much as $2.1 billion.\nThe pop prompted analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group to downgrade the stock to \u201csell\u201d shortly after it started trading.\nIn the context of dotcom mania, Twitter\u2019s first-day gain almost seems reasonable: The social messaging service\u2019s stock finished its first day of public trading at $44.90 a share, up 73 percent from its $26 IPO price.\nScrolling through a list of the biggest first-day \u201cpops\u201d for Internet and technology IPOs is like entering a time machine set for the go-go days of the dotcom boom."}
