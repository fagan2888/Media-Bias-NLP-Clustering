Nancy Pelosi has absolutely no idea who this Jonathan Gruber guy is. Never heard of him. Did you mean that short-lived but intensely funny SNL skit, “MacGruber’? She’s heard of that. But Jooonaaaathaaaan Gruuuuuberrrr? Isn’t ringing any bells.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday tried to downplay comments by an architect of Obamacare, who was caught talking about the “stupidity of the American voter,” by saying she doesn’t even know who he is. “I don’t know who he is,” she told reporters. “He didn’t help write our bill.”

Which is hilarious since not only did her office repeatedly mention Gruber in a press release about the Affordable Care Act posted on her website (though it’s now been taken down), but Pelosi herself dropped Gruber’s name in an interview about the ACA back in November of 2009.

PELOSI: Let me just say this. Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end the health insurance companies’ discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. They let that stand. That’s scandalous, the fact that it exists. I don’t understand why they have not heard the American people, who have said preexisting conditions should not be a source of discrimination. And secondly, the Republican plan ensures about 3 million more people than now, and ours does 36 million people. So that’s a very big difference in that. We’re not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we’ll have a side by side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don’t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT’s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even some now, and much less preventing the upward spiral.

Seems like she also might be relying on the stupidity of the American voter.
