Walker\u2019s plan to close some Green Bay public schools and replace them with charters, I\u2019m beginning to believe the takeover of our public schools by big business and legislators like Walker is proceeding very well.\n\nThey say our public schools are failing. That\u2019s not fully true. Some are, but it\u2019s because of poverty. We don\u2019t fund them adequately to overcome student poverty-related problems.\n\nNo Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, and Common Core were composed and implemented by Bill Gates and other member of the 1 percent without input from parents, teachers of early childhood students and early education experts.\n\nThe educational expectations, of especially very young children, are causing children great stress, enough to make them throw up, cry and get sick. The standardized testing by Pearson (a British multinational corporation) is a hoax. It has no background in education or teaching children. Its record of mistakes in the test questions, correcting tests, and delivering them on time is dismal.\n\nI remember in the \u201970s standardized testing was dropped all over the country because the tests were considered an inaccurate method of measuring the whole learning process. They basically measure memorization. Now they\u2019re back and they\u2019re quick, inaccurate and expensive.\n\nThe complaint of parents, teachers, children and administrators are growing louder because of excessive homework. Health care professionals are saying the stress of overburdening students causing sleeping problems is unhealthy. The curriculum being used now relies on demand-and-push as a method of teaching. I call it abusive because that method doesn\u2019t respect the personhood of the student who becomes a yes person, not a creator.\n\nIn my teaching experience, I found children love to learn if they are presented with material they are mentally, physically and developmentally ready for.\n\nWe had a school in De Pere called the Wisconsin International School. It left with very little notice to parents and children. Teachers were out paychecks. A friend lost nearly $1,000 she paid as a retainer fee for the next year. They are suing but to little avail.\n\nA year ago, the Center for Popular Democracy issued a report demonstrating \u201ccharter schools in 15 states ... had experienced over $100 million in reported fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. Now there are millions of new alleged and confirmed cases of financial waste, fraud, and mismanagement reported.\u201d\n\nBut we don\u2019t yet have the necessary law to protect us from dishonesty in charter schools. How come?\n\nSen. Dave Hansen said, \u201cWisconsin taxpayers cannot afford to pay for two systems, much less a system of private schools that are not held accountable for providing their students quality education.\u201d\n\nWe need our public schools to care for all our students. Finland, a world leader in education, manages it with great success.\n\nPeggy Burns of Green Bay has a bachelor\u2019s degree in kindergarten-primary education, a master\u2019s degree in elementary eduction and 24 graduate credits in early childhood/educational exceptional needs.\n\nPeggy Burns has a bachelor\u2019s degree in kindergarten-primary education, a master\u2019s degree in elementary eduction and 24 graduate credits in early childhood/educational exceptional needs.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1LaUzqD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Big business has started takover of ourpublic schools", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Big business has started takover of ourpublic schools", "title": "Who\u2019s running our schools anyway?", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/10/03/running-schools-anyway/73316780/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big business has started takover of ourpublic schools", "title": "Who\u2019s running our schools anyway?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09b09cbdc4a6dc8f60dae539b97674a3a15c5fef/c=382-0-1908-1526&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/03/GreenBay/B9319005786Z.1_20151003222406_000_GC8C3UIAM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Walker\u2019s plan to close some Green Bay public schools and replace them with charters, I\u2019m beginning to believe the takeover of our public schools by big business and legislators like Walker is proceeding very well.\nThey say our public schools are failing.\nThe complaint of parents, teachers, children and administrators are growing louder because of excessive homework.\nSen.
