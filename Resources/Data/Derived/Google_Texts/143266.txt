“Our technology today seemingly has made it easier for the scam artists. There is a new victim of identity theft every two seconds in the United States,” said Nancy LeaMond, Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer, AARP. “Frank Abagnale’s guidance as AARP Fraud Watch Network Ambassador will be highly effective in educating our members and the public about ways to protect themselves and their families from fraud.”

As part of the AARP education campaign, Abagnale hosts a fun online “Catch the Con” video quiz. He also will participate in AARP-sponsored identity theft forums which are scheduled in communities nationwide. In the coming weeks, events are scheduled for: Omaha, Chicago, Sioux Falls, Seattle, St. Paul, and Hanover, N.H.

“We’ve all seen the news of the major security breaches which have occurred over the past two years,” said Abagnale. “Personal information from some of those incidents is just starting to show up, as it is common for criminals to warehouse personal data for two to three years before they make it available in the marketplace. Too many of us are vulnerable, and I look forward to working with AARP to advise people about the safest ways to conduct their financial transactions and manage social media.”
