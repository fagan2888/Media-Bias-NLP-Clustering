The theme this year, which also is the village's 150th anniversary, is glass, and society members drew upon the organization's extensive collection for their presentation.\n\nGuests viewed everything from jewelry, including glass beads, necklaces and a hat pin holder, to eyeglasses, medicine bottles and a glass train once filled with candy.\n\nSociety member Carolyn Mangold explained the significance of each item, including \"carnival glass.\"\n\n\"The glass was cheaply mass produced and was literally given away at carnivals and fairs as prizes in shooting galleries and ball throwing contests,\" she said.\n\nAmong the more curious items were \"pap\" bottles. Mangold said such bottles were used to feed babies mixtures of milk or water boiled with various ingredients like tapioca, flour, crackers or bread.\n\nThe pap bottle was boat-shaped with two hollow handles, through which the pap was blown into the baby's mouth.\n\nMangold also described the arduous process involved with blown glass.\n\n\"Creating a hot enough fire to make glass was not easy. It took two weeks to achieve a wood fire hot enough to melt the material into glass,\" she said.\n\nFor guest Linda Davidson, the blown glass figures conjured up childhood memories.\n\n\"When I was little, I used to have little blown glass figures. That just always intrigued me so much,\" she said.\n\nOthers appreciated the variety of pieces in the society's collection.\n\n\"I love knowing that they have this storeroom of archival stuff and that they can choose a topic and pull pieces out and share that with us,\" said Holly Petersen, a volunteer with the historical society.\n\nMore teas are scheduled at noon and 3 p.m. on April 16 and 17.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You might call it the Victorian version of a Tupperware party.
