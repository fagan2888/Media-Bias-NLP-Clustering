But is there more to Trump\u2019s rhetoric than meets the eye? According to a renowned cartoonist, Trump\u2019s techniques are straight out of a book\u2013 on hypnosis.\n\nTrump has acquired a skill that makes him the master of persuasion. In a political context, he has been able to top the polls early on this election cycle and maintain his lead. He may have even manipulated you.\n\nOpponents in the GOP field should take heed, as this is not child\u2019s play. What Trump has succeeded in doing is considered a highly effective form of \u201cLinguistic Judo\u201d so-to-speak, and has left those who are disenchanted by his methods bewildered and wondering; \u2018Just what is going on here?\u2019\n\nTrump is so adept when it comes to the skill of persuasion, Scott Adams, creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon, went so far as to call him a \u201cMaster Wizard\u201d of the method he uses to employ influential linguistic speech.\n\nReason Magazine spoke with Adams on what he says is a classic hypnosis technique. He says in the interview that Trump has a way with words and people in a way the media fails to understand, and \u201cthis is not appreciated by him,\u201d Adams says.\n\nWhile Adams has no political interest in this race, he admits that Trump may be the winner because of this approach alone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying, I see a flame-thrower,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI think the flame-thrower wins the State Fights,\u201d he says.\n\nAdams recognizes these techniques as those commonly used in hypnosis. He cautions that they are used as a strategy more often than some may want to admit. He indicates for specific examples:\n\n\u201cLinguistic Kill Shot\u201d \u2013 An engineered set of words essentially stopping an argument dead in its tracks (i.e.; Jeb Bush = \u201clow-energy\u201d, Carly Fiorina = \u201cRobot\u201d, and Dr. Ben Carson = \u201cnice\u201d).\n\n\u201cAnchor\u201d \u2013 Detracting from the issue at hand by bringing in unrelated issues, typically bigger in an emotional connotation to the interviewer or opponent (i.e.; at the Fox Debate where he avoids addressing his sexist remarks on women by injecting Rosie O\u2019Donnell into the conversation, escorting the audience away from the appropriate answer to the question).\n\n\u201cLinguistic Judo\u201d- A technique that is similar to Judo instruction, where you take the force of the label that is intended to use against you and change it. (i.e.; when he was called a \u201cwhiner,\u201d instead of denying it he said, \u201cI am a whiner, and I keep whining\u2026 and whining\u2026 until I win\u2026and I\u2019m going to make America great again.\u201d)\n\n\u201cVagueness\u201d \u2013 A trick used in hypnosis classes. The human condition of supporting ones own biases lends itself to the effective technique of when a person leaves enough blank spaces, you will fill them with whatever your personal preferences are.\n\n\u201cPersona\u201d \u2013 The Trump persona is so powerful that he can say whatever he wants. No matter what he does it fits entirely into his image as a celebrity billionaire.\n\nScott Adams admits to being impressed by Trump\u2019s strategy, but mainly, he is more intrigued by human behavior in our world.\n\nHe concludes by saying, \u201cReason will never be a satisfying explanation of what you see.\u201d\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Trump BLASTS Anderson Cooper \u201cThis is Why Americans Don\u2019t Trust You and The Media\u201d\n\n[Watch Video]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump isn't just a good rhetorician, he's employing powerful persuasion techniques", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "Trump isn't just a good rhetorician, he's employing powerful persuasion techniques", "title": "Expert: Trump Employing Hypnosis Techniques - The Libertarian Republic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trumphypnosis.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-08T14:22:15+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wont-believe-trump-using-strategy-winning/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelibrepublic", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trumphypnosis.jpg", "description": "Trump isn't just a good rhetorician, he's employing powerful persuasion techniques", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Expert: Trump Employing Hypnosis Techniques"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "published_time": "2015-10-08T11:59:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/LinaBryce1/?ref=hl", "section": "Political Opinion", "modified_time": "2015-10-08T14:22:15+00:00", "tag": "Republican Primaries"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe209d\"", "article_summary": "Reason Magazine spoke with Adams on what he says is a classic hypnosis technique.\nScott Adams admits to being impressed by Trump\u2019s strategy, but mainly, he is more intrigued by human behavior in our world.\nAccording to a renowned cartoonist, Trump\u2019s techniques are straight out of a book\u2013 on hypnosis.\nAdams recognizes these techniques as those commonly used in hypnosis.\nWhile Adams has no political interest in this race, he admits that Trump may be the winner because of this approach alone."}
