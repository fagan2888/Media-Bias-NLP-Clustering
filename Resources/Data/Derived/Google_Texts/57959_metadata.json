At the wheel was his friend, ex-race-car driver Roger Rodas, who was also killed.\n\nCops said Rodas, 38, had been speeding.\n\n\u201cThere was a post-collision fire, and the bodies are not visually identifiable,\u201d said Dana Bee, a deputy coroner with the Los Angeles Coroner\u2019s Office.\n\nThe office said it had contacted the victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cWe are working to legally obtain the dental records,\u201d Bee said.\n\nA photo snapped shortly before the fiery crash shows Walker getting into the red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT.\n\nHe had attended a fund-raiser to benefit victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and had left the event when the car careened out of control and crashed, bursting into flames in a business park in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles.\n\nA video posted online by a man who drove up on the fiery scene shows a mangled heap of steel engulfed in flame.\n\n\u201cDrive away! It\u2019s gonna blow up!\u201d a person is heard saying before a loud explosion.\n\nOnlookers asked for hoses as they tried to douse the flames.\n\n\u201cThe car is in half. I can\u2019t tell if there is someone in there,\u201d another witness is heard saying.\n\nA friend of Walker told the Santa Clara Valley Signal newspaper that he and others tried to save the men from the burning wreckage.\n\n\u201cWe all ran around and jumped in cars and grabbed fire extinguishers and immediately went to the vehicle,\u201d Antonio Holmes told the paper.\n\n\u201cIt was engulfed in flames. There was nothing. They were trapped.\u201d\n\nColleagues mourned the actor, who has played undercover cop Brian O\u2019Conner in five of the six \u201cFast & Furious\u201d movies and had been filming a seventh.\n\n\u201cBrother I will miss you very much.
