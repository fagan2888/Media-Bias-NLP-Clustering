Meridian Mayor Percy Bland says the city is continuing efforts to reduce crime.

One part of that is a police advisory board that met for the first time Aug. 26.

Each ward is represented and the mayor made a couple of appointments as well.

Bland says the group will offer feedback about its concerns to Police Chief Benny Dubose.

"That intel is how we make our decisions. That intel is how we reduce crime," said Bland. "So whenever you have the community giving you that type of feedback, it really helps us to reduce crime in the city of Meridian."

Bland applauded the efforts of the young democrats who sponsored an anti-crime rally at the mall over the weekend. He says young people will be part of the solution to solving the ills of our community
