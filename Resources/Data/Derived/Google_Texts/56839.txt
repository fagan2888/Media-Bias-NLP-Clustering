A U.S. House committee on Thursday passed legislation sponsored by Rep. Lynn Jenkins to reform portions of the Affordable Care Act.

Under the divisive 2010 health care reform law, health savings accounts may be used to pay for drugs “only if such medicine or drug is a prescribed drug,” exempting over-the-counter drugs.

H.R. 1270, which was passed by a voice vote in the House Ways and Means Committee, would remove that sentence, along with similar restrictions on flexible spending accounts.

“From the creation of these accounts until the passage of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of consumers had been free to use their HSA (health savings) or FSA (flexible spending) accounts to help defray their health care costs,” Jenkins, a Republican, told the 39-member Ways and Means Committee. “Included in the qualified expenses were OTC medications, such as allergy or cold medicine, antibiotic ointment, or pain relievers.”

Allowing for the purchase of over-the-counter medications will place more control in the hands of individuals and less in the hands of the federal government and insurance companies, Jenkins argued.

“Not every time you get sick you should be forced to go to the doctor,” the congresswoman said. “You should be able to treat yourself and purchase the medicine you need because we all know that not all sicknesses require a doctor’s visit.”

H.R. 1270 was introduced by Jenkins on March 4. It has 37 co-sponsors — 33 Republicans and four Democrats — including Jenkins’ Kansas colleague, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Wichita, a Republican.

“It is now my hope this bipartisan legislation is quickly brought to the House floor for a vote,” Jenkins said in a statement.
