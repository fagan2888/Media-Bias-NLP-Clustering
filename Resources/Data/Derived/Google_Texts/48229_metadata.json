She accused Republicans of being generally disrespectful to members of the administration and to women. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill later clarified that the reported GOP comment about the Irish has been relayed to Pelosi a number of times by Irish immigration activists she\u2019s met with.\n\nI realize she was asked a specific question about the made-up racial implications of Holder-Gohmert exchange earlier this week, but whyyy did she have to immediately respond with the other ways in which she pretends to think Republicans are oh so racist and sexist? \u2026I suppose relentlessly demagoguing the crap out of Republicans is practically in her job description, and we\u2019ve long established that intellectual honesty isn\u2019t really her thing \u2014 and since illegal immigration is the next big-ticket item on her pre-midterm docket with which to hammer Republicans while distracting from ObamaCare and energizing a blas\u00e9 base, why not take every opportunity to make Republicans look as morally repugnant as possible despite the availability of other, more valid criticisms? Makes sense.\n\nThe California Democrat does not wield the speaker\u2019s gavel anymore, but she\u2019s hitting the road to bring attention to immigration, which she calls her top legislative priority. In recent weeks, she\u2019s pitched an overhaul to audiences from Miami to Los Angeles to Laredo, Texas. The Pelosi immigration road show is unfolding as the issue remains on the back burner in the Republican-controlled House. \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest thing that we can do, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve said to the speaker, to the press, to these groups, I would rather pass [a] comprehensive immigration reform bill than win the elections in November,\u201d Pelosi said during the 30-minute interview. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we could accomplish in winning that would be as big as passing immigration reform.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Novel.", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: I think I know why the Republicans won\u2019t bring up immigration", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/10/nancy-pelosi-i-think-i-know-why-the-republicans-wont-bring-up-immigration/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T00:51:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T00:36:16+00:00"}, "keywords": "Democrats, illegal immigration, Nancy Pelosi, racism, Republicans,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc0e\"", "article_summary": "The Pelosi immigration road show is unfolding as the issue remains on the back burner in the Republican-controlled House.\nNancy Pelosi: I think I know why the Republicans won\u2019t bring up immigrationposted at 8:51 pm on April 10, 2014 by Erika JohnsenThree guesses, ya\u2019ll.\n\u201cI think race has something to do with the fact that they\u2019re not bringing up an immigration bill,\u201d the California Democrat told reporters at her regular weekly press conference.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday blamed racial issues for the GOP\u2019s failure to act on comprehensive immigration legislation.\n'\u201d Pelosi was responding to a question about whether race factors into how Republicans deal with members of the Obama administration."}
