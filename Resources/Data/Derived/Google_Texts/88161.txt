Saturday's winter blast was full of wet snow causing Wichitans to experience some of the worst driving conditions of the winter season.

The snow storm held off until the early evening leading to a mild day with rain and sleet in the afternoon. The roads took a dangerous turn after two inches of heavy snow fell in less than an hour.

"It's pretty slick, even in four-wheel drive I was having trouble stopping." says Carter Turybury.

"Lot of traffic out tonight for some reason but if you drive slow it's OK." says Leon Keiter.

The snow storm has Wichita plowing crews out in full force. All fifty plowing trucks are on the roads clearing priority routes. Public Works Director Alan King calls this the worst of all conditions.

"It takes us about 8 hours to get through all of our routes if you're just laying down salt sand mix but if we're plowing it takes about 3 times longer so it'll take us at least 24 hours to get through our 1500 lane miles of priority routes."

Public Works equipment operator Curtis Fisher started his evening shift laying a sand and salt mix on the slushy roads.

"Right now I'm just putting material on, Calcium," says Fisher. "That kinda gives the roads a force to work."

But as the snow turned heavy, the plows were dropped to the ground.

"Every last one of them," says Fisher. "We're going to have to stay on top of it because the temperatures drop and then become a little slick."

Public Works' goal is to plow the 1500 lane miles of main roadways all the way through Monday morning to have everything clear by the morning commute.

"It really depends how long this comes down and if it continues to come down as heavy as it is whether or not we'll be able to meet that target," says King.

If you absolutely have to go out tonight, be very careful and stay well under the speed limit. Roads are especially on ramps and bridges.
