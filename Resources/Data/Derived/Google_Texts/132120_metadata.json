James Martin, Special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - Pope Francis on Tuesday issued a bold new document - in Vatican parlance an \u201capostolic exhortation\u201d - called Evangelii Gaudium or \u201cThe Joy of the Gospel.\u201d\n\nIn this document, he sets out an exciting new vision of how to be a church. In all my years as a Catholic, I cannot remember a papal document that was so thought-provoking, surprising and invigorating. Frankly, reading it thrilled me.\n\nTo me, it seems that with each new homily, address, interview, general audience message and letter, Francis is challenging himself - and us - with three questions, each of which flows naturally from the other:\n\nFirst, why not look at things from a new perspective? Second, why not be open to doing things in a new way? And third, why not have a new vision for the church?\n\nAnd what is Francis' vision for the church?\n\nIt is to be a joyful community of believers completely unafraid of the modern world, completely unafraid of change and completely unafraid of challenges. Not everyone will like this document. Some may find it frightening. For it poses a fierce challenge to the status quo - explicitly: \u201cPastoral ministry in a missionary key seeks to abandon the complacent attitude that says: \u2018We have always done it this way,\u2019 \u201d he writes in a section titled \u201cEcclesial Renewal.\u201d\n\nThe document\u2019s overall message is that Catholics should be unafraid of new ways of proclaiming the Gospel and new ways of thinking about the church. In fact, such new ways are essential if we are to spread the Gospel at all. This may sound like boilerplate talk expected in a document on the \u201cNew Evangelization,\u201d but it is not; for in the document Francis identifies areas of petrification in the church, areas where he wants to see real change.\n\nThis is not to say that the Evangelii Gaudium seeks to overturn traditional church teachings. Instead it seeks to overturn the way that we have done things, and to be fearless in doing so. For example, while he reaffirms the church\u2019s inability to ordain women as priests, he also invites the church to think about their place in the church in new ways, to imagine \u201cthe possible role of women in decision-making in different areas of the Church\u2019s life.\"\n\nOver and over, the Pope takes aim against such longstanding roadblocks to growth as \u201ccomplacency,\u201d \u201cexcessive clericalism,\u201d and even Catholics who act like \u201csourpusses.\u201d (That\u2019s the official English-language translation.) About that last roadblock, he says that there are Christians whose lives are like \u201cLent without Easter.\u201d\n\nNor does the Pope have patience for people who are \u201ctempted to find excuses and complain.\u201d Essentially, he contrasts this dourness and pessimism with the joy of living a life centered in Christ and focused on the hope of the resurrection. It is a hope-filled, positive and energetic view of the church actively engaged with the world.\n\nEvangelii Gaudium is difficult to summarize, so wide-ranging is it. Ironically, something that would at first appear to be a narrow topic - how to spread the Gospel today - offers Francis the latitude to address many topics in his trademark open style. The exhortation moves easily from a discussion on joy as a requirement for evangelization, to how \u201cpersonal dialogue\u201d is needed for any authentic invitation into the faith, to the difficulty of being a church when Catholics are \u201cwarring\u201d against one another, to the need for priests and deacons to give better homilies, to an overriding concern for the poor in the world - the last being a special concern of the Pope.\n\nTo that end, some will be surprised that Francis champions an idea that has lately been out of favor: the church\u2019s \u201cpreferential option\u201d for the poor. \u201cGod\u2019s heart has a special place for the poor,\u201d the Pope says. But it is not enough simply to say that God loves the poor in a special way and leave it at that. We must be also vigilant in our care and advocacy for them. Everyone must do this, says the Pope.\n\n\u201cNone of us can think we are exempt from concern for the poor and for social justice.\u201d And in case anyone misses the point, after a critique of the \u201cidolatry of money\u201d and an \u201ceconomy of exclusion,\u201d the Pope says: \u201cThe Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but he is obliged in the name of Christ to remind all that the rich must help, respect and promote the poor. I exhort you to generous solidarity and a return of economics and finance to an ethical approach which favors human beings.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this does not mean simply caring for the poor, it means addressing the structures that keep them poor: \u201cThe need to resolve the structural causes of poverty cannot be delayed.\u201d\n\nThis joy and confidence needed to tackle these challenges - both inside and outside the church - is rooted and grounded in a deep relationship with Jesus Christ. Without that \u201cpersonal encounter\u201d with Jesus trying to spread the Gospel is useless. We must have what he calls a \u201cconstantly renewed experience of savoring Christ\u2019s friendship and his message.\u201d\n\nMost Catholics will, like me, read the letter with enthusiasm. But some Catholics have criticized the Pope for trying to change too much in the church - even though no dogma has been altered. A few Catholics are not only beginning to critique him, but even worse, fear him. Change seems to be something to fear. As one of my Jesuit friends used to say, playfully, \u201cI\u2019m against change; even change for the better!\u201d But the church must change if it is to grow - not in its core beliefs, but in the way that it lives out and shares those beliefs.\n\nMy advice to Catholics would be: Read the entire document. Take your time. Be generous with it. Let it excite you. Pray with it. And be open to the Holy Father\u2019s call to \u201cembark upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by this joy, while pointing out new paths for the Church\u2019s journey in years to come.\u201d\n\nFinally, as Jesus said, \u201cFear not.\u201d We can change the way we do things in the church - the spread of the Gospel demands it. So be confident in God\u2019s desire for the church to grow and change. Besides, as Francis says, \u201cNobody can go off to battle unless he is fully convinced of victory beforehand.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Francis uses a famous quote from Pope John XXIII, who noted at the opening of the Second Vatican Council that many doubted things could change for the better. Too many people at the time - 1962 - were predicting doom and disaster for the church and for the world. But John disagreed. \u201cWe feel that we must disagree with those prophets of doom who are always forecasting disaster.\u201d\n\nEvangelii Gaudium is Francis\u2019 own ringing response to prophets of doom.\n\nThe Rev.
