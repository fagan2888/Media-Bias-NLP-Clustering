U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced S. 1553, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill he is sponsoring in the U.S. Senate on Thursday. The bill has identical language as the bill that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in May and has 45 co-sponsors.

“Here is the theory of the case: Roe v. Wade was about medical viability. Roe v. Wade acknowledges that there is a compelling state interest in protecting the unborn child at the point of medical viability. I would argue that since 1973 to now that standard has probably changed. But we’re coming up with a new standard that I think is very compelling. The standard of medical practice, today, in America, is that if you operate on an unborn child at 20 weeks…you have to provide anesthesia to the baby because they’re capable of feeling extreme pain,” Graham said during a press conference introducing the bill on Thursday.

““So here’s the choice for America: if the doctor is required to provide anesthesia to the child—to help save his life because they feel pain in the process of being operated on—is it okay for society to say, ‘well at that stage in the pregnancy, we don’t want the operation to be an abortion’? I believe, that most Americans will say yes. We don’t want 20-week abortions on demand—we want out of this club…If this is not worthy of a debate of a great nation, than what would be?” Graham added.

Among the 45 co-sponsors of the bill are U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).
