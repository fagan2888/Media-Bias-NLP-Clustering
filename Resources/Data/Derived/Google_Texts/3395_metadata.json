REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n5022453\n\nGOP lawmakers were forced to issue subpoenas Wednesday after continually being stonewalled while attempting to gain critical information for an investigation into the Obama administration\u2019s potentially illegal payments to insurance companies through Obamacare.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shaun Donovan were served the subpoenas sent from House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady and Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton . The agencies failed to comply with multiple requests for documents pertaining to Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing reduction program over the course of past year.\n\nThe lawmakers first asked for the information at the start of the investigation on the legality of the payments without congressional approval in February, 2015. Burwell agreed to a phone call on the matter in January after the chairmen sent her a letter demanding the documents be handed over. According to Upton and Brady, she was unwilling to answer several questions or provide the documents.\n\nThe administration has allegedly been funding Obamacare\u2019s Basic Health Plan, a program designed to provide states with alternative health care for low-income residents without the necessary legal appropriation from Congress.\n\nExpenditures for the program total more than $5 billion to date, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, will total around $170 billion over the course of a decade.\n\nShould The Obama Administration Be Nervous About This?
