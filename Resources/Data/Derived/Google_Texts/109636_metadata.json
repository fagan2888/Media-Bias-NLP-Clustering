Reuters\n\nHear ye, hear ye! Uncle Sam is calling all citizens for some much needed help. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is \"soliciting proposals\" \u2014 sounds vaguely illegal, no? \u2014 from citizen-pot growers who can devote 12 acres to marijuana research. The announcement comes on the heels of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) decision to amplify the quantity of its reserve pot stock from 21,000 grams (about 46 pounds) to 650,000 grams (about 1,433 pounds). With increasingly relaxed drug laws in many states and legalization in Colorado and Washington well underway, the DEA\u2019s move suggests more investigation into marijuana\u2019s effects is both wanted and needed.\n\nTraditionally, such work is overseen by NIDA, a part of the National Institutes of Health, with DEA's stamp of approval. In addition to funding research, the NIDA Drug Supply Program provides the necessary illegal substances to researchers. In the case of marijuana, the government's supplier is a farm run by the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy. With demand risen dramatically, seems UMiss, which works for NIDA \"under a competitive contract,\u201d can\u2019t supply all the pot that is now needed.\n\nSo Uncle Sam wants its citizen-pot growers to step up and help.\n\nBut not just anybody. To be a successful candidate, you must possess a \u201ccurrent DEA registration for Schedules II to V substances and demonstrate the capability to obtain DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances,\u201d including marijuana and its constituents. Plus, you need a DEA registration for research, manufacture, and distribution of Schedule I through V controlled substances before the award of this contract. You also need video-surveillance for your outdoor facility of about 12 acres with a complementary indoor facility for growing weed under controlled conditions. Finally, the government insists you have a secure vault for maintaining stock.\n\nOne can only wonder how Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of NIDA since 2003, feels about all this. Staunchly wary of marijuana legalization, her agency has been criticized for funding research that focuses on, as its website claims, \u201cdrug abuse, addiction, prevention, and treatment\u201d \u2014 the downside of pot use and not its potential benefits.\n\n\u201cWe do not yet know how marijuana will affect vulnerable populations like older people or those with physical or mental health problems,\u201d Volkow wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cWe do know that marijuana increases the risk of car accidents (about 2-fold on its own, even more in combination with alcohol)... Besides being addictive, marijuana is cognitively impairing even beyond the phase of acute intoxication and regular use during adolescence may cause a significant, possibly permanent IQ loss.\u201d She also notes brain scans of users who started at a young age showed impaired neural development.\n\nDespite her concerns, her agency with the encouragement of the DEA has moved to expand the scope of marijuana research. An official recently told US News and World Report NIDA is now funding \u201cwell over 100 grants\u201d on cannabis, marijuana, and cannabinoids, including 30 studies of the plant's \u201ctherapeutic uses.\" No matter what you may believe about marijuana or where you stand on legalization, more information about marijuana's health effects, whether good or ill, can only benefit all of us. And reward a few citizen-pot growers to boot.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "citizen pot-growers, marijuana, nida, dea", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The National Institute on Drug Abuse needs the help of citizen-pot growers following DEA's decision to amplify its research stock from 46 pounds to 1,433 pounds.", "title": "The Government Needs Your Help Growing 1,400 Pounds Of Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-government-needs-your-help-growing-1400-pounds-marijuana-research-30-times-last-years-300242", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/citizen-pot-grower.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The National Institute on Drug Abuse needs the help of citizen-pot growers following DEA's decision to amplify its research stock from 46 pounds to 1,433 pounds.", "title": "The Government Needs Your Help Growing 1,400 Pounds Of Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-government-needs-your-help-growing-1400-pounds-marijuana-research-30-times-last-years-300242", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/citizen-pot-grower.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/citizen-pot-grower.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-08-28T11:08:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T11:58:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The National Institute on Drug Abuse needs the help of citizen-pot growers following DEA's decision to amplify its research stock from 46 pounds to 1,433 pounds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27ab\"", "article_summary": "The National Institute on Drug Abuse needs the help of citizen-pot growers following DEA's decision to amplify its research stock from 46 pounds to 1,433 pounds.\n\u2014 from citizen-pot growers who can devote 12 acres to marijuana research.\nDespite her concerns, her agency with the encouragement of the DEA has moved to expand the scope of marijuana research.\nSo Uncle Sam wants its citizen-pot growers to step up and help.\nIn addition to funding research, the NIDA Drug Supply Program provides the necessary illegal substances to researchers."}
