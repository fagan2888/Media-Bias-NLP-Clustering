It was a fitting way to spend Earth Day, especially considering the house is \u201coff the grid\u201d from public utilities.\n\nThe couple didn\u2019t set out to build an Earth-friendly house, six miles as the crow flies from the nearest neighbor, when they bought their 40 acres, 14 miles from Florence off Florence-Kelvin Highway, more than two decades ago. It was just a beautiful property with plenty of space to shoot targets \u2013 one of the couple\u2019s favorite hobbies.\n\nBut after a few years, when it became apparent that electric service wouldn\u2019t be available to their property anytime soon, they started designing their house with sustainability in mind. They sketched out the plans themselves -- as natives of Germany \u2013 in meters and centimeters. An architect placed their plans within context of local building codes and translated their metrics to feet and inches, and so they could get a building permit. A Mesa contractor built the house with high-insulating e-crete concrete blocks, and the house was finished at the beginning of 2005.\n\nDieter calculated the 4,000-square-foot home\u2019s electrical requirements himself, and an engineer in Scottsdale designed the solar system. Much of the time they generate more power than they need, and it\u2019s stored in batteries. For the rare occasions when they run low on sun power, they have a back-up diesel generator. They have evaporative coolers for summer heat. In the winter they burn wood.\n\nForced to move\n\nThey love their home, but they\u2019ve put it on the market. The asking price is $580,000, which Dieter says is close to what they spent to build it, and which their real estate agent said is what the home\u2019s appraised value was last summer.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to leave, but after being legal US residents for more than 30 years, their residency status is running out. They said their circumstances don\u2019t fit laws intended to help deserving resident aliens stay in the country.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, we do not fit any category under your immigration law. \u2026 What is missing in your immigration law is a category for people who can support themselves. We are self-sustained. We are not a burden on your social system,\u201d Dieter said.\n\nA German air force officer, Dieter, 69, trained American fighter pilots, some of whom are now colonels, serving in the US Air Force. The Cloeses said they\u2019ve met with congressmen J.D. Hayworth and Trent Franks on their immigration status, to no avail. One visit to the immigration office in Phoenix was enough for Dieter, who said the staff had little interest in his case.\n\nMargit also worries what will happen to them if they have a big medical bill. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to move; Obamacare makes us move. We can\u2019t afford it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe home and property can be seen in a 3 \u00bd-minute aerial video shot with a drone at https://player.vimeo.com/video/106996029 .\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t watch the video any more, I get tears in my eyes. It breaks my heart,\u201d Dieter said.\n\nMore information on the property is available from real estate broker Jeff Reich at jeff.reich@russlyon.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "By MARK COWLING", "title": "Visa issues lead to sale of Florence sustainable residence", "url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/coolidge_examiner/news/visa-issues-lead-to-sale-of-florence-sustainable-residence/article_a4f5e68c-1180-11e6-b27c-d795df3ed74e.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/trivalleycentral.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/03/c03a6832-1180-11e6-9901-2b460400c61d/57292a407e02e.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "By MARK COWLING", "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "We are not a burden on your social system,\u201d Dieter said.\nHayworth and Trent Franks on their immigration status, to no avail.\nIt was just a beautiful property with plenty of space to shoot targets \u2013 one of the couple\u2019s favorite hobbies.\nIt was a fitting way to spend Earth Day, especially considering the house is \u201coff the grid\u201d from public utilities.\nThe home and property can be seen in a 3 \u00bd-minute aerial video shot with a drone at https://player.vimeo.com/video/106996029 ."}
