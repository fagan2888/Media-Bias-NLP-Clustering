Extremely,\u201d DigitalGlobe CEO Jeffrey Tarr said at a news conference last month. \u201cMore customers buy as they push us for resolution and accuracy and spectral diversity.\u201d\n\nDigitalGlobe expects the resolution relief to lead to new market opportunities, particularly internationally. The company said this policy change may lead to a bolstering of its workforce, which is currently at 1,300.\n\nThe news comes as DigitalGlobe prepares for the August launch of WorldView-3, the most advanced Earth imagery satellite in the U.S.\n\nWorldView-3 can produce 31-centimeter-resolution images, and several of its already-orbiting satellites already can capture 41-centimeter images. But DigitalGlobe was prohibited, until Wednesday, from selling anything sharper than 50-centimeter resolution to non-U.S. government customers.\n\nThe 31-centimeter resolution images allow viewers to discern, for example, the windshield of a car and the direction the car is facing.\n\nLetitia Long, the head of the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency \u2014 DigitalGlobe\u2019s largest customer \u2014 told attendants at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs last month that it was only a matter of time before the government cleared industry to compete on a level playing field with international competitors.\n\n\u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t want to hinder anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nBeyond clarity, the company\u2019s new 6,200-pound bird \u2014 built by Boulder-based Ball Aerospace & Technologies \u2014 offers short-wave infrared resolution that sees through dust, smog and smoke as well as things on Earth invisible to the naked eye.\n\nDigitalGlobe executives told The Denver Post last month that its new sensors allow them to see minerals, identify tree and plant species and gather soil composition. When analyzed, this information can decipher what\u2019s beneath the surface \u2014 insight that can then be sold to industries including mining or oil and gas exploration.\n\nThe stock market reacted to the news with the company\u2019s shares jumping Wednesday. Its shares closed at $31.58, up 21 percent from a year low of $26.02 on April 11.\n\nKristen Leigh Painter: Kpainter@denverpost.com, 303-954-1638 and twitter.com/kristenpainter", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe130c\"", "article_summary": "The 31-centimeter resolution images allow viewers to discern, for example, the windshield of a car and the direction the car is facing.\nThe federal government has cleared DigitalGlobe to sell its highest-available resolution Earth images, a move that could open up $400 million in new business for the company.\nDigitalGlobe executives told The Denver Post last month that its new sensors allow them to see minerals, identify tree and plant species and gather soil composition.\nThe Longmont-based satellite imagery company had petitioned the government to lift what it felt were onerous restrictions.\nThe news comes as DigitalGlobe prepares for the August launch of WorldView-3, the most advanced Earth imagery satellite in the U.S.WorldView-3 can produce 31-centimeter-resolution images, and several of its already-orbiting satellites already can capture 41-centimeter images."}
