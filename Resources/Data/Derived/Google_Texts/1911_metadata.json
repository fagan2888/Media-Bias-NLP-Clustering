This week, we have a role-reversal pregnancy announcement that doesn\u2019t sit quite right, BuzzFeed hanging out with Bobby Jindal for some reason, twins doing yoga, and a robot butler. Oh, and, for a longer look at YouTube culture, check out last week\u2019s long read about my trip to VidCon 2015.\n\nHUSBAND SHOCKS WITH WITH PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT! - 4,219,358 views\n\nThis video, from mid-tier family YouTube channel \u201cSam and Nia,\u201d has gone mega-viral in the past two days, and you can see why. Everyone loves a surprise pregnancy announcement, and in this case there\u2019s the added hook that the gender roles are reversed. The man, Sam, isn\u2019t pregnant, no. But he does get to surprise his wife with the news that she\u2019s pregnant. How did he do this, exactly? Well, he saved some of her pee in the toilet and when she wasn\u2019t looking he took it out with a dropper and used a home pregnancy test. Yep. Then he filmed himself walking out to the kitchen and telling his wife, and two young children, that she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s . . . quite a thing.\n\nMy initial take on the video was that it was staged. The wife, Nia, seems just a little too ready for the moment, if that makes any sense. Maybe she\u2019s just sort of stiff in front of the camera, but something in her reaction is a little . . . rehearsed, maybe? I don\u2019t know. The modern world has made me a cynic and a skeptic.\n\nI no longer think it was staged, but I do think there\u2019s something decidedly off about it. For one thing, can\u2019t we let women have that? I mean, of all the things this country does to subjugate and objectify women and their bodies, do smarmy YouTube dudes really have to be taking pregnancy announcements away from them, too? I can just picture this guy, this Sam person, quietly stewing when his wife told him she was pregnant the other two times, because she got to have the cool, fun surprise and he didn\u2019t. So he decided that, for baby number three, he was gonna be the one who gets to say surprise. So he literally filmed himself extracting his wife\u2019s urine from a toilet and put it on YouTube, all so he could be the big surprise guy. Like, let women have that, dude. If you want to surprise the mother of your child with, like, the gender of the baby, because she didn\u2019t want the doctor to tell her, but would be fine with you telling her? Great! Good. Throw an \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d surprise party. Nothing wrong with that, so long as you\u2019re sure she wants to know. But pulling her pee out of the goddamned toilet all so you can get to tell her she\u2019s pregnant? It\u2019s creepy! I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s creepy, and controlling.\n\nDon\u2019t you detect a note of creepiness from this whole situation? Well, I did, so I did a minor amount of digging, and here are some things I\u2019ve learned about Sam and Nia. For one, they\u2019re big ol\u2019 Christians. Like \u201c\u2018Child of God\u2019 is the first thing in Sam\u2019s Instagram bio\u201d Christians. Which, hey, fine, to each their own. Except, last month, Sam, and Nia sort of made a video apologizing for the previous day\u2019s vlog, in which, I guess (the vlog has since been edited), they asked their daughter about gay marriage and she said whatever floats your boat, basically, but then Sam counseled her about why gay marriage is wrong. People got mad, and apparently the clip wound up on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show, and so Sam made a video saying he was sorry, and that he and his wife love everyone and even\u2014gasp!\u2014have gay friends who they, y\u2019know, don\u2019t treat like garbage, and are therefore magnanimous saints. But, uh, they then go on to say that they don\u2019t \u201cagree with that lifestyle\u201d or some such horseshit. See, what they\u2019re really \u201capologizing\u201d for is the way they talked about gay marriage\u2014Sam says that people are mad because he didn\u2019t treat it seriously enough. No, dude, people are mad because you\u2019re an asshole, not because of how you were an asshole.\n\nAlso? You know what lifestyle I don\u2019t agree with? I don\u2019t agree with filming yourself taking your wife\u2019s piss out of the toilet so you can lord the facts of her own body over her. And I certainly don\u2019t agree with naming your daughter Symphony, which these people did. (The kid\u2019s name is Symphony.) So go stick your \u201clifestyle\u201d where God\u2019s light don\u2019t shine, you fame-grubbing weirdo.\n\nUgh. It\u2019s always this type, isn\u2019t it? It always is.\n\nPush-Up Contest With Governor Bobby Jindal - 295,409 views\n\nSpeaking of that type, here\u2019s Bobby Jindal, a man from Louisiana who will never be president, doing a fun push-up contest for BuzzFeed. Yeah, BuzzFeed\u2019s at it again. That rancid Ted Cruz video wasn\u2019t enough, I guess. Now they\u2019ve gotta have a charming little thing with Bobby Jindal where he competes against things like \u201cObamacare\u201d in a push-up contest. Why are they doing these videos? I know, I know, \u201cboth sides of the issue,\u201d blah blah. But Ben Smith has recently gone on record as saying that BuzzFeed \u201cfirmly believe[s] that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women\u2019s rights, anti-racism, and LGBT equality, there are not two sides.\u201d Which, O.K., then why again are you giving such cheery, gee-whiz coverage to politicians like Bobby Jindal and Ted Cruz, who actively work against that stuff? Sure the \u201cmainstream media\u201d people might be howling away at the idea that conservative candidates shouldn\u2019t have access to a media platform because of their beliefs, but BuzzFeed is a publication that, by and large, has been admirably responsible, fair, and progressive in its coverage of women\u2019s rights, gay rights, trans rights, etc. And I think those principles are worth protecting and upholding far more than the sort of noodly idea that Bobby Jindal and Ted Cruz deserve silly viral videos just because, I dunno, they want them? Pfft. It\u2019s babyish and embarrassing and, what\u2019s worse, it all exists as a way for BuzzFeed to (a) brag about their access, and (b) limply try to convince conservatives that they can enjoy BuzzFeed, too\u2014not out of any real desire for balance, but because they want a certain kind of journalistic respect, and, hey, conservative readers\u2019 traffic can\u2019t hurt. This is the same lame strategy that had serial plagiarist and conservative doofus Benny Johnson in their employ for far too long. This new-nice, smarmy (there\u2019s that word again) pandering to being fully inclusive and reasonable and free from criticism. That last one is really what it\u2019s all about. We get videos like this because, not so deep down, BuzzFeed just wants everyone to like them.\n\nYoga Challenge - 327,519 views\n\nO.K., jeez, enough politics. Sorry about that. Here, to cleanse the palate, is a video of two twins doing yoga poses together. It\u2019s . . . well, hm, you know what? I don\u2019t know how old these kids are or what their deal is. (Well, I mean, I know what their deal is, they want to be YouTube stars\u2014I saw them strutting around VidCon like they already were, in fact.) So maybe we shouldn\u2019t be watching this yoga video. I mean, if you\u2019re a teenager and this video makes you laugh or makes you feel, y\u2019know, happy in your bathing suit area, that\u2019s just fine. But no one over the age of . . . 20(?) should be watching this video, I don\u2019t think. So! To all our teenage readers (there have to be at least one or two, right?), have at it. To the rest of you, don\u2019t press play and let\u2019s just move the heck along.\n\nAloft hotel robot butler that brings you room service. - 60,726 views\n\nIs this cute? Or is this deeply unsettling in an Ex Machina kind of a way? On the one hand, look at this cheery little talking trash can, bringing this guy yogurt or ice cream or something. I mean, good for it, this R2-D2-looking motherfucker. But on the other hand? This guy was expecting this whirring nightmare to show up at his door and chirp at him, he summoned it. But what if you didn\u2019t know this hotel had robot butlers and were just walking down the hallway, and suddenly there\u2019s this menace turning the corner and puttering toward you? In a hotel hallway, which is already a scary enough place? (Thanks a lot, Kubrick!) I think that might be one of the most terrifying moments of your life. So this robot is both things, a delight and a horror. It\u2019s all just a matter of perspective. I would love to order room service at a hotel and have this ungodly device show up at my door bearing food. But would I love being alone in a hotel corridor with this electric ghoul? Absolutely not. So, I\u2019m firmly ambivalent about this. That\u2019s what I am. How about you?\n\nI LOVE CHEESE. - 195,197 views\n\nFinally, something we can all agree on. The title for one. We all love cheese. Also, look at this weirdo eating the cheese. What\u2019s his deal? Why\u2019re his ears like that? Why\u2019s his tongue doing that? Who knows. But that little guy likes his cheese, that\u2019s for sure. And who can blame him. Cheese is good! Also good? Weekends. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, here comes a weekend right now. Go enjoy it. Summer may be fleeting away faster than ever before, but it\u2019s still here right now. So go revel in it. Eat some cheese. Do some yoga. Take a pregnancy test. Whatever. The world, or the weekend at least, is yours.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": "2015-08-07T01:19:00Z", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Richard Lawson", "og": {"url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/youtube-digest-august-7", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4e58f169027501c6f0516/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Screen Shot 2015-08-07 at 1.03.02 PM.png", "type": "article", "title": "Men Shouldn\u2019t Get to Surprise Women With a Pregnancy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "title": "Men Shouldn\u2019t Get to Surprise Women With a Pregnancy", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4e58f169027501c6f0516/master/pass/Screen Shot 2015-08-07 at 1.03.02 PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@VanityFair"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Everyone loves a surprise pregnancy announcement, and in this case there\u2019s the added hook that the gender roles are reversed.\nI don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know how old these kids are or what their deal is.\nThen he filmed himself walking out to the kitchen and telling his wife, and two young children, that she\u2019s pregnant.\nThe wife, Nia, seems just a little too ready for the moment, if that makes any sense."}
