The Status of Women\u2019s Reproductive Rights in the United States, NARAL rates each of the states with an over all grade. Rhode Island received a failing grade of F. Massachusetts and New Hampshire received a C+, Vermont and Maine a B+ and Connecticut an A-. Rhode Island\u2019s failing grade makes it, to borrow a favorite word of Speaker Nicholas Mattiello\u2019s, an \u201coutlier.\u201d\n\nThe report notes that \u201cRhode Island enacted a measure that restricts insurance coverage of abortion in the state insurance exchange\u201d in 2015, a reference to Raimondo\u2019s behind the scenes budget shenanigans that ultimately resulted in an estimated 9000 people losing their abortion coverage under Obamacare. This story was covered here on RI Future first, and received scant attention elsewhere.\n\nNARAL, a non-profit that engages in political action and advocacy efforts to oppose restrictions and expand access to abortion, has three ratings for governors and legislative bodies: pro-choice, mixed choice and anti-choice. Both the Rhode Island House of Representatives and the Rhode Island Senate were rated anti-choice.\n\nAll three Democratic candidates for president are running on strong pro-choice platforms. Hillary Clinton recently won the endorsement of Planned Parenthood and Bernie Sanders called for an expansion of Planned Parenthood funding, Raimondo\u2019s mixed-choice rating puts her badly out of step with the national Democratic Party.\n\nAs of this writing a request for comment from the governor\u2019s office has gone unanswered.\n\nVN:R_U [1.9.20_1166]\n\nRating: 10.0/10 (1 vote cast)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0", "copyright": "Copyright (c) January 2016", "author": "Steve Ahlquist", "revised": "Friday, January 22nd, 2016, 3:43 pm", "robots": "index,follow", "template": "Hybrid News 0.4", "keywords": "Campaign 2016, Civil Rights / Liberties, Democrats, Events, Featured, Health Care, National News, News, reproductive freedom, Rhode Island, Women, Emily's List, Gina Raimondo, NARAL, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Nicholas Mattiello, Planned Parenthood Votes RI PAC, Who Decides?
