Andrew Bodnarchuk, claimed on waivers from Columbus last week, will be playing his third game for Colorado and will be paired with Francois Beauchemin at even strength against the Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Roy said of Gormley after the Avalanche morning skate. \u201cObviously, hockey is a business sometimes and things could happen. Unfortunately for him, we thought that Stuart and E.J. might be back soon and we might have roster decisions to make. That will give us a little more flexibility, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\nJohnson will miss his third consecutive game Sunday night and he hasn\u2019t yet started skating since suffering the injury against Los Angeles on Jan. 4. At the time, Roy estimated Johnson would be out five to 12 days. Stuart hasn\u2019t played since Nov. 10 at Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know more when he\u2019s on the ice,\u201d Roy said of Johnson. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t put him on IR to show we think it\u2019s a short period of time. It\u2019s different for Brad Stuart. He didn\u2019t do so well the last time (he skated). I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a setback, it\u2019s just going to take more time than we thought.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche will be seeking its fourth consecutive victory Sunday against the Blackhawks, who have won six consecutive games. A win or an overtime or shootout loss would pull the Avalanche ahead of the Nashville Predators in points (both have 45), but Colorado already has the edge in the standings and is sitting in the second Western Conference wild-card spot because of more regulation and overtime wins.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erik Johnson, Brad Stuart out as Avalanche set to take on Chicago", "title": "Erik Johnson, Brad Stuart out as Avalanche set to take on Chicago", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/10/erik-johnson-brad-stuart-out-as-avalanche-set-to-take-on-chicago/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160105_011459_erik-johnson.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160105_011459_erik-johnson.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T11:02:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:18:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But Avalanche coach Patrick Roy emphasized that with Erik Johnson (lower body) and Brad Stuart (back) still out of the lineup, Gormley remains available to suit up and play if needed.\n\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Roy said of Gormley after the Avalanche morning skate.\nAt the time, Roy estimated Johnson would be out five to 12 days.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know more when he\u2019s on the ice,\u201d Roy said of Johnson.\nCHICAGO \u2014 The Avalanche will go with the same lineup as in the past two games Sunday night against Chicago, meaning defenseman Brandon Gormley \u2014 who was placed on and cleared waivers last week \u2014 will be a healthy scratch."}
