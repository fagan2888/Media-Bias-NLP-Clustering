He plays goalie for the home country in the one sport that Russia wants to win most at the Games.\n\nVarly, however, watched as teammate Sergei Bobrovski got the start between the pipes in the showcase game against the United States. Bobrovski was generally solid, but short of superb in a 3-2 loss to Team USA that had everybody in the country, including president Vladimir Putin, seeing red.\n\nThe Russians started listless and finished frustrated against Slovakia, which had lost two previous games in this tourney by a combined score of 10-2.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy about this game. We wanted to win it in regular time, not to go into shootouts or cause heart attacks,\u201d said Russian star Pavel Datsyuk, who sighed relief when teammates Alexander Radulov and Ilya Kovalchuk converted consecutive penalty shots to win the shootout in two rounds. The shootout might have been the easiest part of the game for Russia, because Varlamov went low to make two blocker saves against Slovakians Michal Handzus and Tomas Tatar.\n\nAnd now, as the tournament moves into the elimination rounds, it appears Russia might very well have a goalie controversy on its hands.\n\nVarlamov is undefeated in two games for Russia. His goal-against average is a microscopic 0.96. Bobrovski, on the other hand, left way too many juicy rebounds in front of him during his lone start, the stinging loss against the U.S.\n\nWho\u2019s the right man for the toughest job in Russia?\n\nIsn\u2019t it obvious? It\u2019s Varly.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Semyon Varlamov is the man for toughest job at Sochi Olympics", "title": "Kiszla: Semyon Varlamov is the man for toughest job at Sochi Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/16/kiszla-semyon-varlamov-is-the-man-for-toughest-job-at-sochi-olympics/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T12:08:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:51:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He plays goalie for the home country in the one sport that Russia wants to win most at the Games.\nVarly, however, watched as teammate Sergei Bobrovski got the start between the pipes in the showcase game against the United States.\nSOCHI \u2014 Semyon Varlamov saved Russia\u2019s bacon.\nThe shootout might have been the easiest part of the game for Russia, because Varlamov went low to make two blocker saves against Slovakians Michal Handzus and Tomas Tatar.\n\u201cIt was important for me and the team,\u201d Varlamov said."}
