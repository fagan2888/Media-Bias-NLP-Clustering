I hasten to add that I am not to blame for these terrible apologies, but I regret them deeply, all the same.\n\nChris Christie is terribly sorry that his staff lied to him about things they did without his knowledge, and he feels remorse that the partisan media are targeting him with a witch hunt.\n\nBob McDonnell is really sorry that an overzealous federal prosecutor is going after him for doing perfectly legal things.\n\nAnd Glenn Beck feels just awful that people were so \u201cfragile\u201d that they allowed his rhetoric to tear the country apart.\n\n1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Comedians, newspapers and magazines take aim at Chris Christie View Photos A roundup of humorous takes on Chris Christie\u2019s bridge scandal.

Bush\u2019s long-ago vow to change a culture that says \u201cif it feels good, do it; if you\u2019ve got a problem, blame somebody else.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, I regret to say.\n\nChristie\u2019s problem is the fault of MSNBC; McDonnell\u2019s problem is the fault of the U.S. attorney; and the damage Beck caused is the fault of the people who listened to him \u2014 and besides, he says, he didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nChristie at least began with a nominal acceptance of responsibility. Even as he pleaded innocence in the bridge scandal \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m telling you: I had nothing to do with this\u201d \u2014 he acknowledged that, at least in the technical sense of being New Jersey\u2019s chief executive, \u201cI\u2019m ultimately responsible.\u201d But this changed on Jan. 18, when his office issued a statement saying the mushrooming scandal was the fault of the liberal media.\n\n\u201cMSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him,\u201d the statement said. It also said the burgeoning accusations of intimidation by Christie\u2019s administration mean \u201cpartisan politics are at play here.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the scale of the Christie administration\u2019s wrongdoing will be sorted out by a federal prosecutor. But, as McDonnell made clear on Tuesday, a federal prosecutor is just another person who can be blamed for one\u2019s own transgressions.\n\nThe former Virginia governor, indicted along with his wife in a corruption scandal involving gifts from businessman Jonnie R. Williams, issued a statement saying he would \u201cprevail against this unjust overreach of the federal government.\u201d Said McDonnell: \u201cI deeply regret accepting legal gifts and loans from Mr. Williams, all of which have been repaid with interest.\u201d He then went on television to say \u201cI did nothing illegal for Mr. Williams in exchange for what I believe was his personal friendship and his generosity.\u201d\n\n1 of 24 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Scandal-plagued politicians: Where are they now? View Photos The rise and fall of former Va. governor Robert F. McDonnell seems cut and dried at the moment, but public figures have a way to bounce back from scandal. Here\u2019s a look at a few once-disgraced politicians \u2014 and what they are doing now. Caption Scandalized public figures have a way of bouncing back. Robert F.

The \u201cgenerosity\u201d included a shopping spree for the first lady at Oscar de la Renta ($10,999), Louis Vuitton ($5,685), and Bergdorf Goodman ($2,604), a $50,000 loan without documentation, $15,000 for his daughter\u2019s wedding, the use of a vacation home and Ferrari, the Rolex inscribed \u201c71st Governor of Virginia,\u201d the hot-tub cover, the deck staining, a Cape Cod vacation, yacht charter and golf outings. By total coincidence, the benefactor allegedly got help with state scientific researchers and support at various company events \u2014 including a product launch at the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nBut McDonnell, who gallantly rejected a plea deal that would have spared his wife, blames the feds.\n\nThis brings us to Beck, who on Tuesday night went on his former network and told Megyn Kelly that, before Fox News dropped him in 2011, \u201cI made an awful lot of mistakes. . . . I think I played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart.\u201d\n\nYa think? The nightly Nazi metaphors, the routine race-baiting and sponsorship of conspiracy theories and apocalyptic visions that, it appears, drove some to desperate violence? But hold on: Beck said the real trouble was that he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize how really fragile the people were. I thought we were kind of a little more in it together.\u201d In a follow-up interview on his online network, the Blaze, he further absolved himself, asserting that \u201cthere\u2019s no way that I could have done it any different than I did.\u201d\n\nBeck is nothing if not adaptable. He was a ponytail-wearing liberal before he saw a commercial opening in conservative talk radio. Now that an improving economy has cast doubt on his end-times visions, he\u2019s recasting himself again. This week, he unveiled a new mission statement for the Blaze: \u201cWe tell stories of love and courage where the good guys win.\u201d He devoted a radio show this week to \u201cthree classic Frank Sinatra songs you need to hear.\u201d\n\nAnd now we\u2019re supposed to believe he\u2019s genuine?\n\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bob McDonnell, Chris Christie and Glenn Beck are sorry \u2014 but it\u2019s not their fault.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Bob McDonnell, Chris Christie and Glenn Beck are sorry \u2014 but it\u2019s not their fault.", "title": "Dana Milbank: Apologize, then blame someone else", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-apologize-then-blame-someone-else/2014/01/24/789dd8aa-8506-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/24/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Former_Governor_Indicted-03777-1798.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-apologize-then-blame-someone-else/2014/01/24/789dd8aa-8506-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, bob mcdonnell, bob mcdonnell indictment, chris christie bridge scandal, chris christie, chris christie sorry, bob mcdonnell sorry, glenn beck sorry, glenn beck media, glenn beck fox, glenn beck fox apology, chris christie msnbc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "789dd8aa-8506-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, bob mcdonnell, bob mcdonnell indictment, chris christie bridge scandal, chris christie, chris christie sorry, bob mcdonnell sorry, glenn beck sorry, glenn beck media, glenn beck fox, glenn beck fox apology, chris christie msnbc"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3354\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him,\u201d the statement said.\nI hasten to add that I am not to blame for these terrible apologies, but I regret them deeply, all the same.\nTwitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\nBob McDonnell is really sorry that an overzealous federal prosecutor is going after him for doing perfectly legal things.\nAnd Glenn Beck feels just awful that people were so \u201cfragile\u201d that they allowed his rhetoric to tear the country apart."}
