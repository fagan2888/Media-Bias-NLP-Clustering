But they don’t usually end up with death threats and claims of “murdered democracy.” Jon Ralston, the go-to political reporter in Nevada, writes of the angry clash between Sanders and Clinton supporters that took place at the Nevada Democratic Convention in Las Vegas. He wonders if what happened in Vegas could spill over into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
