Indeed, it\u2019s fair to say that the religious right exists to fight any legal or cultural support for people who don\u2019t want their narrow definition of Christianity foisted on them. From objecting to gay marriage to trying to wedge creationism in schools, the religious right exists as a political movement for the purpose of stripping away religious freedom and establishing their religious beliefs as the dominant organizing force in law, politics and culture.\n\nSo why then are we hearing all these people who live their lives attacking religious freedom complaining all the time that \u201creligious freedom\u201d is under attack from liberals? Whydoes every religious-right publication and event echo the claim that right-wing Christians are somehow being stripped of the very right to religious freedom the right has worked tirelessly to take from everyone else for decades?\n\nThe simple answer is they\u2019re lying. Claiming the mantle of victimhood is so politically potent that religious-right leaders are going to do it, no matter how untrue it is, because, to be blunt, they\u2019re not held back by any moral interest in honesty. Getting Grandma to think she\u2019s going to lose her church is a great way to get her to sign her Social Security check over to your organization.\n\nThe longer answer is that the religious right has concocted a new strategy to squelch religious freedom: By redefining \u201creligious freedom\u201d to mean its opposite. The hope is that by repeatedly using the term \u201creligious freedom\u201d when they mean \u201cgiving the Christian right power to impose their faith on others,\u201d they can eventually drain the phrase of all its meaning and finally, after decades of fighting secularism, make it easier for the religious right to strip away individual protections for religion. In other words, they hope by saying that up is down long enough, the public and the courts will finally believe it.\n\nThis attitude\u2014that their \u201creligious freedom\u201d can only be protected if they get to foist their faith on everyone else\u2014is nakedly obvious every year when the whining about the mythical \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d begins. Needless to say, there is no war on Christmas. There is no effort whatsoever to prevent anyone from celebrating Christmas, buying Christmas presents, going to mass on Christmas, or playing that Manheim Steamroller record until you want to claw your ears out. Without fail, every example the right comes up with to prove there\u2019s a war on Christmas is, in fact, something else: An attempt to recognize that not everyone is a Christian and respect that there are multiple holidays people may be celebrating in lieu of, or in addition to, Christmas.\n\nThis belief that Christians, particularly right-wing Christians, are entitled to be acknowledged at the exclusion of everyone else and entitled to have their holidays held out as more important than everyone else\u2019s cropped up immediately after Thankgiving, right on schedule this year. The National Republican Congressional Committeetweeted out a picture of a T-shirt they\u2019re selling that says, \u201c\u2019Happy Holidays\u2019 is what liberals say,\u201d in Comic Sans font, of course. On the back it reads, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense unless the viewer agrees with the premise that conservative Christians are better than everyone else, and in order to honor how much more important they are, all other holidays and faith traditions need to be hidden away, as if they\u2019re shameful.\n\nNow the belief that \u201creligious freedom\u201d actually means the religious right gets to impose its beliefs on you is going to be tested by the Supreme Court. While many think the case of Hobby Lobby suing to avoid having to offer insurance benefits that cover contraception is primarily about reproductive rights, the real question at the center of the case is how much is your boss allowed to impose his religion on you, just because you work for him?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scaring people can convince them to hand over their money", "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scaring people can convince them to hand over their money", "title": "Christian conservatives have perfected playing the victim card", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/06/christian_conservatives_have_perfected_playing_the_victim_card_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_62864413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scaring people can convince them to hand over their money", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_62864413.jpg", "title": "Christian conservatives have perfected playing the victim card", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Christian conservatives have perfected playing the victim card", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bill of Rights, Christian Right, Christianity, constitution, Hobby Lobby, Religion, Religious Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b63\"", "article_summary": "So why then are we hearing all these people who live their lives attacking religious freedom complaining all the time that \u201creligious freedom\u201d is under attack from liberals?\nThe longer answer is that the religious right has concocted a new strategy to squelch religious freedom: By redefining \u201creligious freedom\u201d to mean its opposite.\nTopics: AlterNet, Bill of Rights, Christian Right, Christianity, constitution, Hobby Lobby, Religion, Religious Right, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetReligious freedom and separation of church and state have always been hated concepts to the religious right.\nNow the belief that \u201creligious freedom\u201d actually means the religious right gets to impose its beliefs on you is going to be tested by the Supreme Court.\nIndeed, it\u2019s fair to say that the religious right exists to fight any legal or cultural support for people who don\u2019t want their narrow definition of Christianity foisted on them."}
