Why not aim for an even bigger season?\n\nThe Miami Heat\u2019s 26-year-old center Hassan Whiteside was the breakout star of the NBA last season, but this year he\u2019s striving to achieve greater heights. Whiteside wants to win the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year award and it\u2019s not a lofty goal because he\u2019s got the capability to win it. Whiteside will be shaking Commissioner Adam Silvers\u2019 hand before a playoff game this season because he\u2019s going to win that award.\n\nLast year Kawhi Leonard missed a quarter of the season and took home one of the NBA\u2019s most coveted trophies because he was able to get the San Antonio Spurs 55 regular season wins while being their best defender. In addition, the Spurs also finished the year second in defensive rating, while holding their opponents to only 97 points per game, the third-best in the entire league. Leonard was trailed by the Golden State Warriors small forward Draymond Green. Statistically, Green\u2019s impact on the court didn\u2019t justify his second place finish, but if you saw live how he performed in the regular season it was more than enough evidence. Without Green, the Warriors wouldn\u2019t have finished with a 67-15 record. They also wouldn\u2019t have had the best defensive rating in the league.\n\nThe overall team performance is what got each of these two the nod for first and second places finishes. This year when the Miami Heat go to the playoffs, and potentially the Eastern Conference Finals, Whiteside too will have more than enough victories in his belt to show that his defense is too valuable to the Heat\u2019s success, further pushing his case to win the award.\n\nBarring any God forbidden injuries, it\u2019s safe to say that this season the Miami Heat will be in the playoffs. If the Heat can manage to win around 45 games and or finish with one of the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference it\u2019ll be hard to deny someone that averaged 10 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game, posting a triple-double and gathering 22 double-doubles in the process.\n\nThose are the numbers Whiteside accumulated last season in only 48 games. It\u2019s scary to think about the numbers he\u2019ll average on a full 82 game schedule. It\u2019s not a stretch to say that all of his numbers could increase even more. This year though we\u2019ve seen Whiteside working out in the American Airlines Arena more often and he\u2019s even hungrier to have even more success. If you look at him you can see that he\u2019s gotten stronger. You can also see that he\u2019s starting to develop his overall offensive game. It won\u2019t be a fluke and even his teammates are starting to rally behind Whiteside as well. During the Miami Heat\u2019s Media Day, Chris Bosh said this about Whiteside.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019m going to be on him every day because I see his ability and what he can do. Really further than that. You want him to increase his upside and get better. If you want to win then one of the main things you have to do is push each other. It\u2019s not always easy.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FanJam/status/648933993711337472", "article_metadata": {"DMSGuestbook": "1.17.5", "robots": "index,follow", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb11d\"", "article_summary": "Whiteside wants to win the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year award and it\u2019s not a lofty goal because he\u2019s got the capability to win it.\nWhiteside will be shaking Commissioner Adam Silvers\u2019 hand before a playoff game this season because he\u2019s going to win that award.\nThe Miami Heat\u2019s 26-year-old center Hassan Whiteside was the breakout star of the NBA last season, but this year he\u2019s striving to achieve greater heights.\nBarring any God forbidden injuries, it\u2019s safe to say that this season the Miami Heat will be in the playoffs.\nThose are the numbers Whiteside accumulated last season in only 48 games."}
