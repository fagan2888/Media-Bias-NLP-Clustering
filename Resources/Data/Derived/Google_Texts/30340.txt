Jonah Goldberg said Friday, on "Special Report With Bret Baier," that President Obama's statements on the Affordable Care Act will go down "as the biggest single domestic policy lie in presidential history."

It's "just simply factually untrue," said Goldberg, at-large editor of National Review Online, when discussing the President's prior statements on how the Affordable Care Act would allow people to keep their insurance and that premiums wouldn't go up.

"From the beginning, President Obama's statements about how you can keep your insurance, your premiums won't go up will go down in history, conceivably at least, it looks like it, as the biggest single domestic policy lies in presidential history. It is just simply factually untrue and there is copius data, copius video of him saying these things."
