The center has 110 health-care professionals and is located at 612 S. 12th St.\n\n\u201cYou can put this system anywhere and it would be a shining star,\u201d said Boyd, who is also a pharmacist. \u201cThey continue to improve on health care and the delivery model.\u201d\n\nThe citation also commends UAMS-West for achieving Level 3, the highest possible level as a Patient Centered Medical Home from the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Using a 55-point performance test, UAMS has named its UAMS West the best of its regional programs in 2009, 2012, 2013 and now 2014.\n\n\u201cUAMS West provides this excellence through the hard work and commitment of faculty and staff and their combined teamwork, communication and leadership in achieving the center\u2019s mission of exceptional training and patient care,\u201d the citation states.\n\nState Reps. Charlotte Vining Douglas, R-Fort Smith, and George B. McGill, D-Fort Smith, co-sponsored the citation.\n\nIn July, UAMS received $900,000 in federal funding to allow it to increase the number of resident physicians at its regional center in Fort Smith. The money was provided under the Teaching Health Care Center Program, a part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith the two new residents, UAMS West has a total of 30 residents in its training program. It is the most residents seen at the Area Health Education Center since being formed in 1974. Residents are trained in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, geriatrics and general dentistry.\n\nThe $900,000 award was part of $83.4 million in funding to 60 teaching health centers like UAMS West across the nation to help train more than 550 residents during the 2014-15 academic year.\n\nAccording to a UAMS West fact sheet, about 300 babies are born at UAMS West annually and clinic visits number 35,000 annually. The center has graduated 210 family practitioners, with 88 graduates currently practicing in western Arkansas and 139 having stayed to practice medicine in Arkansas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fort Smith\u2019s University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences West again set the bar for the six regional family medical and area health education centers in the state under the UAMS banner.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Fort Smith\u2019s University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences West again set the bar for the six regional family medical and area health education centers in the state under the UAMS banner.", "title": "UAMS West In Fort Smith Named Best In System Again", "url": "http://swtimes.com/business/uams-west-fort-smith-named-best-system-again", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_061_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/uams-west-fort-smith-named-best-system-again", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_061_1.jpg"}, "creator": "@timesrecord", "description": "Fort Smith\u2019s University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences West again set the bar for the six regional family medical and area health education centers in the state under the UAMS banner.", "title": "UAMS West In Fort Smith Named Best In System Again"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1624404", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1624404", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T04:05:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde891\"", "article_summary": "According to a UAMS West fact sheet, about 300 babies are born at UAMS West annually and clinic visits number 35,000 annually.\nUsing a 55-point performance test, UAMS has named its UAMS West the best of its regional programs in 2009, 2012, 2013 and now 2014.\nWith the two new residents, UAMS West has a total of 30 residents in its training program.\nThe money was provided under the Teaching Health Care Center Program, a part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\nIn July, UAMS received $900,000 in federal funding to allow it to increase the number of resident physicians at its regional center in Fort Smith."}
