Two years ago the state Legislature passed a law setting up Connect for Health Colorado so state residents wouldn\u2019t have to rely on the federal government. (If you are shopping for health insurance in Colorado it\u2019s advisable not to go to the federal website.)\n\nWhen Connect for Health Colorado launched Oct. 1, Peg Perl was among the first to log on.\n\n\u201cI had already navigated the maze of trying to figure out the insurance companies own websites and figured almost anything be better than that, but I was pleasantly surprised,\u201d she said.\n\nUnlike the federal site, Connect for Health Colorado has had a relatively smooth rollout.\n\n\u201cIt has been up, it has stayed up and people have really been able to shop and compare pretty much 100 percent of time,\u201d said Patty Fontneau, CEO of Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nFontneau admits people had problems initially setting up accounts, but on the site residents can shop anonymously without an account and get help by phone, online or in person from one of hundreds of specialists, free of charge.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to guide you through and provide you with advice in terms of how you choose your health insurance,\u201d Fontneau said.\n\nThere are up to 150 plans to choose from. You can narrow your search by coverage, premiums, deductibles and even doctors and then compare and contrast plans side by side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s even a button where can download the information into an Excel spreadsheet and just look at it offline and talk about it at the kitchen table,\u201d said Perl. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that Colorado has been working on it and got in place, ready to go.\u201d\n\nStarting Tuesday the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado Education are launching a campaign called Got Insurance? to get the word out about Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nMore than 3000 families or individuals have enrolled for health insurance through the site so far. This year\u2019s deadline to sign up for insurance without a penalty is Dec. 15.\n\nIf you are a Coloradan and you do go to the federal website, it will eventually kick you back to the state\u2019s site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Problems continue to plague the official federal website for consumers seeking health care under the Affordable Care Act, but for Colorado's online marketplace it's a different story.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/10/22/colorado-website-health-insurance/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/peg-perl.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/peg-perl.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "Problems continue to plague the official federal website for consumers seeking health care under the Affordable Care Act, but for Colorado's online marketplace it's a different story.", "title": "Colorado's Health Care Exchange Running Smoothly So Far"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/peg-perl.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Problems continue to plague the official federal website for consumers seeking health care under the Affordable Care Act, but for Colorado's online marketplace it's a different story.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Colorado's Health Care Exchange Running Smoothly So Far"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "keywords": "aca information, health, local, news, politics, shaun boyd, syndicated local, affordable care act, colorado consumer health initiative, connect for health colorado, got insurance?, patty fontneau, peg perl, progressnow colorado education", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, colorado consumer health initiative, connect for health colorado, got insurance?, patty fontneau, peg perl, progressnow colorado education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde77a\"", "article_summary": "DENVER (CBS4) \u2013 Problems continue to plague the official federal website for consumers seeking health care under the Affordable Care Act.\nUnlike the federal site, Connect for Health Colorado has had a relatively smooth rollout.\n(If you are shopping for health insurance in Colorado it\u2019s advisable not to go to the federal website.)\n\u201cThey will be able to guide you through and provide you with advice in terms of how you choose your health insurance,\u201d Fontneau said.\nMore than 3000 families or individuals have enrolled for health insurance through the site so far."}
