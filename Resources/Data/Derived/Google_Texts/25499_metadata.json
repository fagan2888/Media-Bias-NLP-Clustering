June 5, 2015 (Photo: Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nThe 62nd annual WHAS Crusade for Children raised $5,674,721 for children with special needs, exceeding last year's total by $37,041.\n\nThroughout Sunday, fire departments and other donors filled the studios at WHAS to share their stories and slowly drive up the grand total.\n\nCrusade president and CEO Dawn Lee said the nearly $5.7 million will directly affect about 200,000 children.\n\n\"It transcends the differences that come into play on a day to day basis,\" Lee said. \"We're all family. We're all here to help the children.\"\n\nThe organization gives 100 percent of the money raised in grants directly to organizations \u2014 such as schools and hospitals \u2014 reaching a forecast total 200,000 children in all Kentucky counties and about 50 Indiana counties.\n\nHundreds of volunteers kept the telethon moving over the weekend, including Rhonda Young, or \"Etheal\" as she is known when clowning. She was mentored by longtime crusade supporter Judy Barcus, better known as Ju-Ju The Clown, who died in 2011.\n\nFace painted pink and red nose affixed, Young has painted faces and put smiles on others since 1996 on crusade day in memory of her father, a fallen Meade County firefighter.\n\n\"I feel like I'm fulfilling his dream, since he never got to do the crusade,\" she said.\n\nYoung's daughter Fallon, now 32, struggled as a child with hearing and speech impairments and received help from the crusade through specialized learning materials at Jefferson County Public Schools.\n\nPart of her clown family, Mary Stewart \u2014 Kupkake Klown \u2014 works with Louisville Fire's arson bureau. She volunteers her time at many firefighter crusade fundraisers and has three children who were directly helped by crusade funding.\n\n\"It's special to me to work on crusade day and see all the departments come in and give what they work so hard to collect, and to know we had a small part in it, it means a whole lot,\" Stewart said.\n\nOutside the studio Sunday afternoon stood Fred Jupin of the PRP Fire Protection District, which raised the most of any fire department or organization with $294,247.\n\nJupin first volunteered with the crusade 25 years ago as a boy scout. Now, as an EMT, he said he sees the reach of the nonprofit when he when enters emergency rooms with patients, who are sometimes treated on equipment bearing a Crusade for Children sticker.\n\nPost-delivery, his 9-month-old daughter Michelle was kept warm in one such machine. She rested in her father's arms Sunday afternoon, sporting pink ear muffs to buffer the engines' sirens.\n\n\"Everybody in PRP lives for this time,\" he said.\n\nArea fire departments account for about 60 percent of the funds raised.\n\nLast year's crusade raised $5,637,680. The biggest collection in the crusade's history was $6.3 million in 2003 for its 50th campaign.\n\nSince it began in 1954, the crusade has raised $160 million for children with special needs in Kentucky and Southern Indiana.\n\nTo make a donation\n\nAlthough this year's telethon is over, tax-deductible contributions can still be made year-round online at WHASCrusade.org or by mailing:\n\nWHAS Crusade for Children\n\n520 W.
