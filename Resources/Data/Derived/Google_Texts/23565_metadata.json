REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\n4479214\n\nOn March 4, the Supreme Court is slated to hear oral arguments in King v. Burwell \u2014 the latest \u201cmortal threat\u201d to Obamacare. The cacophony from progressive defenders of this misguided law is nearly deafening. The plaintiffs\u2019 position is \u201cabsurd ,\u201d they cry. Congress \u201cnever contemplated withholding premium subsidies\u201d in noncooperative states. The Obama administration argues that \u201cit would have been perverse for Senators concerned about federalism to insist on pressuring States to participate in the implementation of a federal statute.\u201d\n\nMIT health economist Jonathan Gruber (the one who famously championed the lack of transparency used to pass the bill \u2014 justified in part by the \u201cstupidity\u201d of American voters) is equally disdainful, calling the challengers\u2019 stance \u201cnutty,\u201d \u201cstupid,\u201d and a \u201cscrewy interpretation\u201d of the law. Overheated as his dismissive remarks might seem, Prof. Gruber only wins second place in the apparent competition for most hyperbolic rhetoric concerning this case. The top prize goes to Abbe Gluck, a law professor at Yale University who argues that were the plaintiffs\u2019 position accepted, it would make Obamacare \u201cthe most draconian carrot-and-stick federalism statute in the U.S. Code!\u201d\n\nProf. Gluck\u2019s claimed is quite easily refuted. For 50 years, Uncle Sam has offered states a sizable carrot to states willing to participate in Medicaid. States willing to follow federal rules regarding eligibility, benefits, patient cost-sharing limits and provider payments get anywhere from half to three-quarters of their Medicaid costs reimbursed by federal taxpayers. States that refused this deal got nothing. Medicaid began in 1966 but it wasn\u2019t until 1982 that Arizona finally decided to take the bait and put into place a Medicaid program. In 2012, Arizona\u2019s federal Medicaid dollars accounted for more than 20 percent of total state government spending that year.\n\nIf Arizona doesn\u2019t play ball regarding Medicaid, Uncle Sam can threaten to take away up to one fifth of state government spending. That sounds pretty draconian to me. The $5.5 billion in federal funds Arizona got for Medicaid in FY2012 is roughly five times as large as the $1.17 billion it stands to lose in federal exchange subsidies in 2016 should the King v. Burwell plaintiffs prevail.\n\nWhen congressional intent is ambiguous, the Court unanimously held in Lamie v. United States Trustees 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004) that it cannot disregard plain statutory text unless it is objectively absurd. But limiting exchange subsidies to states that set up their own exchanges is no more objectively \u201cabsurd\u201d than threatening the loss of one fifth of a state\u2019s budget for failure to jump through federal Medicaid hoops.\n\nObamacare defenders say there is nothing in the legislative history to show that Congress intended subsidies to be limited to state-run exchanges. But that argument cuts both ways. There is nothing in the legislative history showing that they intended subsidies to be available on federally-run exchanges. But there are ample examples of prior health reform plans and even health statutes that have conditioned federal financial support on states taking specific actions. Here\u2019s just a sampling:\n\nPresident Nixon\u2019s 1974 health plan would have limited federal subsidies only to states who did what the federal government wanted them to do, leaving states that refused to do so out in the cold.\n\nThe 1993 Clinton health reform plan likewise contained substantial financial penalties for states that refused to implement the plan as reformers wanted.\n\nIn 2009, both the Senate Finance Committee and Senate HELP Committee reported out bills containing provisions that would have financially penalized states that failed to set up their own Exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christopher J.
