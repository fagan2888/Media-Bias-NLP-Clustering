Millions more will soon find out they will be forced to pay a penalty because of the law.\n\n\u201cThe rate requests are the first to reflect a full year of experience with the new insurance exchanges and federal guaranteed issue-community rating,\u201d according to Jane Orient, M.D. writing for the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) this weekend. \u201cIn Oregon, claims exceeded revenue by more than $100 million.\u201d\n\nCitizens, troubled about their health providers and financial future, learned in February that the IRS were placing tens of thousands of tax refunds on hold due to another Obamacare caused delay. In January, the White House announced that 800,000 enrollees received the wrong IRS forms causing them to face more delays, and the headache of updating or amending their taxes with new forms.\n\nThroughout 2015 patients are walking into their doctor's offices presenting new insurance policies, most with higher deductibles, and causing more chaos.\n\nFor decades the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) presented themselves as a support group some seniors turned to for benefits tailored to them. In the past few years, hundreds of thousands of seniors have decided to cancel their AARP membership in favor of alternative organizations.\n\nAARP blamed the weak economy, but the primary catalyst, or \u201clast straw\u201d for the massive drops in AARP membership numbers was their 2009 decision to support Obamacare. While AARP membership tumbled, millions of American seniors upset with President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act went elsewhere. AARP dropped from 40 million members to less than 37 million since 2008.\n\nAmerican physicians have reacted in the same fashion to the American Medical Association (AMA), which has also seen vast membership losses. Both organizations have benefited greatly from Obamacare.\n\nAARP and AMA have now mutated into sponsors and profiteers of the Obama healthcare agenda. AARP has turned into an insurance company through its subsidiary company. AARP is now earning over half a billion dollars in payments from their Medicare supplemental plans, dental insurance and other products sold by third parties under their specific brand names. AMA now only represents just 14% of U.S. doctors, but profits heavily on being the keeper of government health payment coding.\n\n\u201cAAPS is completely funded by membership dues and contributions, so we answer to and advocate for our physician members and not big corporate donors or government funding sources,\u201d stated AAPS Past President Lee D. Hieb, MD. \u201cThe AMA\u2019s deal with HCFA (Obamacare) gave it a monopoly on the CPT codes, from which it derives at least $70 million in revenue annually. AAPS was one of the first to expose this conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Business reported last week that 6.6 million people--about 10 percent more than the White House said\u2014will be paying a penalty for not having health insurance. Although the Treasury Department indicated in January that millions of taxpayers will be paying a fine, Bloomberg that a portion of that figure \u201cdidn\u2019t need to.\u201d The National Taxpayer Advocate reported that 300,000 taxpayers overpaid by about $35 million too much. The majority of these were low income earners.\n\nThe insurance companies throughout the nations are seeking increases upwards of 20 to 40 percent or more, according to Robert Pear, who has analyzed the Affordable Care Act impact.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hieb, AAPS, \u201chas been fighting the good fight to preserve the practice of private medicine since 1943. When the Clinton health plan was proposed, we fought for open meetings. And when the details came to light, the plan was halted.\u201d\n\nRecently the AAPS helped establish various physician assemblies and has a pending lawsuit suit in the DC Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cThe AAPS legal team defends doctors who have been mugged by Medicare, or railroaded by hospitals using sham peer review,\u201d Dr. Hieb added. \u201cWe sued the Texas Medical Board in defense of physicians\u2019 due process rights; this suit is now on appeal. We drafted legislation for reform of the Texas medical practice act and are fighting for its enactment.\u201d\n\nJesse Ellis O\u2019Brien of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group said: \u201cRate increases will be bigger in 2016 than they have been for years and years and will have a profound effect on consumers here. Some may start wondering if insurance is affordable or if it\u2019s worth the money,\u201d Orient quoted Jesse Ellis O\u2019Brien of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are about to be shaken even more by the hide tide of rate increases health insurers are seeking because of Obamacare.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/doctors-and-citizens-fight-new-massive-obamacare-rate-increases", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/54/1f/541fb9abb1e259c0b78604c8419551b3.jpg?itok=YqdCg840", "type": "article", "title": "Doctors and citizens fight new massive Obamacare rate increases"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans are about to be shaken even more by the hide tide of rate increases health insurers are seeking because of Obamacare.", "creator": "@Texasjackson", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/54/1f/541fb9abb1e259c0b78604c8419551b3.jpg?itok=YqdCg840", "title": "Doctors and citizens fight new massive Obamacare rate increases", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-07-19T18:11:13-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, Obamacare, affordable health, AAPS, doctors, physicians", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T18:11"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Americans are about to be shaken even more by the hide tide of rate increases health insurers are seeking because of Obamacare.\nWhile AARP membership tumbled, millions of American seniors upset with President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act went elsewhere.\nAARP blamed the weak economy, but the primary catalyst, or \u201clast straw\u201d for the massive drops in AARP membership numbers was their 2009 decision to support Obamacare.\nIn the past few years, hundreds of thousands of seniors have decided to cancel their AARP membership in favor of alternative organizations.\nThroughout 2015 patients are walking into their doctor's offices presenting new insurance policies, most with higher deductibles, and causing more chaos."}
