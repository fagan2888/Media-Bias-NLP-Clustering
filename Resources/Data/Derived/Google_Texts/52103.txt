Forecasters have extended a flood warning through Tuesday afternoon for an area on the Eastern Plains surrounding a levee breach on the South Platte River.

Water has been pouring from the river into an area of Morgan and Washington counties since Monday near the small community of Messex.

About 15 homes are under a voluntary evacuation and several county roads in the vicinity have been washed out. One man’s home, which is about five miles from the breach, was surrounded by knee-deep floodwaters Wednesday.

The warning was initially set to expire on Friday afternoon.

“Flooding from the breached river is expected to continue,” the National Weather Service in Boulder said Friday in a bulletin. “The river continues running high due to snowmelt runoff in the high mountains.”

Mike McCaleb, the Washington County emergency manager, reported Friday that water is now spilling out of the breach through a half-mile wide span that is 4 feet deep.

McCaleb said a levee repair will not be possible for several weeks, or at least until the South Platte’s river significantly diminishes.

“There is no place for it to go back to the river,” he told The Denver Post this week. “And we’re talking about a lot of water.”
