Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) has introduced legislation that would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.

Members of Congress would stop receiving their paychecks if they don't approve a budget that eliminates the deficit within a decade by April 15 of each year.

Messer, who chairs the House Republican Policy Committee, said the threat of losing their pay would motivate lawmakers to approve a budget on time.

“It is past time for the federal government do what families all across this country do every day: live within our means and balance our budget,” Messer said in a statement. “This bill requiring a balanced budget or no pay for members will help do that.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.

“The American people deserve a balanced budget. Unfortunately, Washington remains unwilling to take the steps needed to get our country back on solid fiscal ground,” Daines said.

In 2013, Congress included a measure known as "No Budget, No Pay" in a suspension of the debt limit that required lawmakers to pass a budget on time or else lose their pay. However, the law only applied to that year and did not specify a required timeframe for eradicating the federal deficit. Congress has not approved a similar provision in subsequent debt limit increases since then.
