Pennington, who owns a labeling and barcode software business, TPGTEX Label Solutions, was paying close to $750 per month for premiums before the ACA was implemented. They were reduced to $275 per month after a credit of $165 under Obamacare. Currently, under a new marketplace plan, Pennington is saving even more money, paying just $101 a month after his credit, a fraction of what he had been paying before the marketplace opened.\n\nBut premium prices like that may end soon for the estimated 7.5 million Americans who qualified for subsidies in the 34 states without state-run exchanges. That\u2019s due to a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v Burwell, which challenges the legality of subsidies in these states.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules in favor of Burwell, Pennington and millions of Americans can expect to lose their subsidies. (Subsidies would continue in the 17 state-based marketplaces.)\n\n\u201cIt will be a great financial burden on us,\u201d says Pennington. \u201cIt was very, very difficult before and now it will be just as difficult if not more.\u201d\n\nThe pain may come quickly. In commentary at news@JAMA, Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, predicted that subsidies would end, probably within a month of the decision, and premiums for these 7.5 million Americans would rise 256%, from an average of $105 after credits per month to $374 per month.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A case before the Supreme Court may sicken millions of American\u2019s bank accounts.", "author": "S.Z.
