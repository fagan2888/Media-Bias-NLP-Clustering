A thunderstorm in Hutchinson Sunday dropped heavy rains and hail right on top of fair-goers, forcing the fair to shut down a little early.

"It started to cool off, that was nice. Then it started to rain and that wasn't bad. Then it started to pour and then it started to hail," Fairgoer Troy Taylor said.

The storm swept in late Sunday afternoon. All the rides shut down at the first sign of lightning.

Because the storm forced the fair to shut down early, they are honoring ride tickets at next year's fair. For all wristbands purchased Sunday, they will be issuing a voucher that can be redeemed for a wristband at next year's fair.
