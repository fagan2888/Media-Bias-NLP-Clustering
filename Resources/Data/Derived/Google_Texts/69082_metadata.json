They are extremely hungry for anything that is real, genuine and imported from the West.\"\n\nNonetheless, she said some customers were skeptical that the new Tehran branch could replicate the quality and consistency customers are used to in Dubai, where branches offer dozens of standardized treatments and stringent hygiene procedures.\n\nHIGH FASHION\n\nIran's fashion-forward twenty-somethings have kept up with global trends on social media and travels abroad, skirting diplomatic isolation and domestic repression. Fattahi-Dansal says they are discerning consumers.\n\nEven under sanctions, independent shops in the affluent northern districts of Tehran managed to obtain the latest seasonal collections of top global brands such as Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Roberto Cavalli.\n\nSome of those luxury fashion brands are now entering Iran directly, and there could be similar opportunities for beauty and cosmetics -- a market estimated by Iran's parliament's research center to be worth more than $4 billion a year.\n\nBut they could face resistance from conservative factions in the establishment, which enforce Islamic dress codes and are wary of allowing any perceived Western cultural influence into the country.\n\n\"The way women dress and look is still one of the red lines in the Islamic Republic,\" said Afshin Sadeghizadeh, a brand management consultant in Tehran and former editor of Iran's Style magazine.\n\n\"The brands going to Iran should be ready to face resistance from conservatives or even get shut down and expelled from Iran,\" he said.\n\nSome conservatives even see foreign luxury brands as part of a war against the Islamic Republic. The Tasnim news agency, close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, last week reported that the CIA could spy on Iranians through fake eyelashes or skin care lotions.\n\nFRANCHISE IT\n\nComplex business and banking regulations are another potential obstacle that lead many, including Fattahi-Dansal, to opt for a franchise arrangement, licensing to a local partner rather than owning her Tehran shop herself. An expensive and badly-regulated rental market adds to the difficulties.\n\n\"Because of the legalities and complications, Iran is not an easy place to do business but it is also very lucrative. That was the reason we franchised,\" Fattahi-Dasmal said.\n\nSome brands have been held up by the difficulty of finding a partner who is a good fit for their business and not linked to any entity designated under U.S. sanctions that remain in place.\n\n\"Iran has potential but we are still at the stage of finding the right partner,\" said Jean Cassegrain, chief executive of handbag maker Longchamp, adding that the process could take considerable time.\n\nBut Fattahi-Dasmal is not deterred, and is even considering exporting another of her brands to Iran. JetSet, an aviation-themed hair salon chain, could soon land in Tehran.\n\n\"Why not?\" she said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Astrid Wendlandt in Paris; editing by Sam Wilkin and Peter Graff)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - When Dubai businesswoman Negin Fattahi-Dasmal opened the first branc", "title": "Nail polish and mascara: beauty brands eye up Iran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/17/Nail-polish-and-mascara-beauty-brands-eye-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-market-cosmetics_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/17/Nail-polish-and-mascara-beauty-brands-eye-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-market-cosmetics_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - When Dubai businesswoman Negin Fattahi-Dasmal opened the first branc", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Despite -- or perhaps partly because of -- strict Islamic dress codes, cosmetics sales in Iran are among the highest in the Middle East.\n\"The brands going to Iran should be ready to face resistance from conservatives or even get shut down and expelled from Iran,\" he said.\nBut Fattahi-Dasmal is not deterred, and is even considering exporting another of her brands to Iran.\nBut they could face resistance from conservative factions in the establishment, which enforce Islamic dress codes and are wary of allowing any perceived Western cultural influence into the country.\n\"Because of the legalities and complications, Iran is not an easy place to do business but it is also very lucrative."}
