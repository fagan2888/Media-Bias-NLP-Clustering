But the minor indignities paled in comparison to what happened to her grandfather: He had the chance to come to America in 1929, but he opted to stay, sensing an economic thaw. Seven years later, Sundeyeva says, he was arrested and never heard from again. Sundeyeva immigrated to San Francisco from Moldova in 1994, and now she and her husband run a Russian-language newspaper here called Kstati. Her Soviet experience colors how she sees U.S. politics to this day. Profiles of America\u2019s immigrant communities\n\nRead more \u201cI don\u2019t like big government,\u201d Sundeyeva said. She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have very much in common.\u201d Today, she\u2019s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she\u2019s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.\n\nTo Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers\u2019 revolution. \u201cI would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night?\u201d \u201cWe feel like we survived a plague, and now we are seeing people with boils on their skin.\u201d Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can\u2019t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist. As another Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, Tatiana Menaker, put it, \u201cWe feel like we survived a plague, and now we are seeing people with boils on their skin.\u201d Most of those who\u2019ve immigrated from the former Soviet Union to the United States over the past few decades have been Jewish. Estimates of America\u2019s Russian-speaking Jewish population range from 350,000 to 750,000, and about 40,000 of them settled in the Bay Area. Jews born in the Soviet Union now account for about 5 percent of the American Jewish population. Menaker and Sundeyeva are part of a small circle\u2014indeed, they know each other. Like with any immigrant group, the political views of Russians in the United States range widely. Ilya Strebulaev, a Russian-American and a finance professor at Stanford, said the left-leaning Russians he knows outnumber the right-leaning ones. Still, some researchers have found that Russian Jews tend to be both less religious than their American counterparts and more conservative. According to preliminary data from a survey being conducted by Sam Kliger, director of Russian-Jewish Community Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, between 60 and 70 percent of Russian-speaking Jews will vote Republican in this election. About that same percentage of American Jews backed Barack Obama in 2012. \u201cThey have experienced socialism and communism in a totalitarian regime,\u201d Kliger said. \u201cAnything that remotely resembles that, they hate it, they despise it.\u201d\n\nTatiana Menaker left St. Petersburg, then known as Leningrad, in 1985. She attended the same university as both Vladimir Putin and Ayn Rand. In the U.S., she built a successful tour-guide business using a fax machine she kept under her bed, all while raising three kids as a single mom. That was all she needed to become a hardcore Republican. \u201cWhy did [Soviet] Russians live in such a shit hole? They didn\u2019t even have a word for Q-tips,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans had wonderful foods and Russians had no cheese.\u201d The difference in lifestyles, she said, can be chalked up to Judeo-Christian values\u2014the kind embodied by her personal hero, Ted Cruz. Menaker recently hosted a birthday gathering for her friends in her three-story home in San Francisco\u2019s \u201cLittle Russia\u201d neighborhood. There wasn\u2019t quite enough champagne to go around, \u201cso those who are standing closest to me will get some,\u201d Menaker said, \u201cpa blatoo\u201d\u2014a reference to blat, the complex network of connections and favors that governed the trade of precious consumer goods in the Soviet Union. Staples could be bought in stores, but anything desirable was scarce. Friendliness with the butcher could get you a nice cut of meat; the baker would make your birthday cake in exchange for perfume for his wife. Those brushes with communism\u2019s downsides prompted Menaker and many of her friends to embrace capitalism with a rabid intensity. \u201cSocialism is a conspiracy of losers against achievers,\u201d Menaker said. \u201cAmerica is the only country where you can come naked with no language and make it in 25 years.\u201d Many Russian immigrants work in the tech industry, according to Kliger, since math and engineering were popular college majors among Jews in Russia. They arrived in Silicon Valley just as personal computing was taking off, and some made small fortunes that they are not keen to redistribute. They get their news primarily from conservative sources\u2014Fox News and the Drudge Report were popular go-tos among the party-goers. Nadia Shkolnikov, the birthday girl, said she \u201clistens to Rush Limbaugh to relax.\u201d\n\nMany of them are torn between Cruz and Trump. \u201cCruz, I like that he\u2019s conservative,\u201d said Shkolnikov. \u201cBut what is not appealing to me is that he sounds like he\u2019s preaching all the time. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Jewish, but I don\u2019t like when Christians are preaching too much.\u201d About Trump, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t like his personality, but I like all his ideas.\u201d Her husband, a software engineer named Val, considers himself a strong Trump supporter. \u201cHe\u2019s a successful businessman,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to work with people. Plus, a guy who\u2019s not a politician won\u2019t be able to promulgate big government for its own sake.\u201d Russian Jews in America value hard work and overcoming adversity, said Evgeny Finkel, a political science professor at George Washington University, who is of Ukrainian Jewish descent. \u201cThey worked hard and succeeded, back there in the USSR and especially here in the US. [In their minds], if others don't succeed it is because they don't want to, not because of structural problems.\u201d I suggested to Menaker\u2019s guests that even the most extreme of Sanders\u2019 proposals\u2014to make America resemble a Scandinavian country\u2014is not quite as radical workers rising up to seize the means of production. The Russians didn\u2019t buy it. There\u2019s no need for America to become more like Finland or France, they said. \u201cThey think Finland is just America with free medical care. Finland is good for people who are on welfare for a long time,\u201d Nadia Shkolnikov said. \u201cNot if you want to rise up.\u201d That brought about a discussion of Obamacare and single-payer healthcare. Specifically, how bad they consider it to be for providers. The saying in the Soviet Union was that a doctor who worked one shift had nothing to eat, and one who worked two shifts didn\u2019t have the time to. One attendee, Nick Wolfson, dissented. As a doctor who had worked in three different healthcare systems, he believed socialized medicine was the best option. \u201cI believe a good society should take care of the sick and weak and should not cost money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAre you going to work for free?!\u201d cried Alexander Bootman. \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay?\u201d It escalated until Wolfson rose up out of his seat, shouting. \u201cDo you really want Trump to be your president? He\u2019s going to sell you! He will sell you tomorrow to the Arabs!\u201d A flurry of shushes and calls to order brought the ruckus to a halt. \u201cAt least it wasn\u2019t a fist-fight?\u201d Nadia Shkolnikov said later, smiling. Others at the party seemed more conflicted, particularly when it came to abortion, which was widespread and normalized in the Soviet Union. \u201cWe have become successful and comfortable within capitalism,\u201d said Gina Budman. \u201cOn the other hand, I really am adamantly pro-choice. And I would love to see education that is less expensive. I am for gay rights.\u201d They are lured, though, by the GOP\u2019s more vociferous support for Israel, a country where many Russian Jews have friends and relatives. For some, this was a source of hesitation about Trump, the Republican front-runner, who said he\u2019d be \u201csort of a neutral guy\u201d on Israel. They also endorsed limits on illegal immigration. As refugees themselves, they support helping refugees in principle, but they harbored deep suspicions that migrants from Syria might have ties to the Islamic State. \u201cWe cannot let terrorists come here,\u201d Rose Bootman said. There was grumbling that refugees should be properly screened. \u201cTrump was right when he said we should postpone immigration until we figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Bootman\u2019s husband, Alexander, said. According to the AJC\u2019s Kliger, the opposition to immigrants, by immigrants, is not surprising. \u201cEvery immigrant group wants to be unique,\" he said. \u201cThey come here, and they don't want others.\u201d The Bay Area\u2019s small Russian population won\u2019t swing deep-blue California in the general election, of course. And Menaker\u2019s crew doesn\u2019t even represent all the Russians in the state. Several people at Menaker\u2019s house lamented that their adult children are turning out to be more liberal than they are. (\u201cOur children are all brainwashed already,\u201d Menaker said.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ultra-conservative views of many in the Russian Jewish community are driven by memories of life in the USSR.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Having lived under socialism, Soviet immigrants reject Bernie Sanders and the push for political correctness.", "title": "Why Russian Americans Love Donald Trump", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/04/BernieCommie/facebook.jpg?1460402510", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/bernie-sanders-trump-russians/477045/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Still, some researchers have found that Russian Jews tend to be both less religious than their American counterparts and more conservative.\nOthers at the party seemed more conflicted, particularly when it came to abortion, which was widespread and normalized in the Soviet Union.\nI am for gay rights.\u201d They are lured, though, by the GOP\u2019s more vociferous support for Israel, a country where many Russian Jews have friends and relatives.\n\u201cWhy did [Soviet] Russians live in such a shit hole?\nJews born in the Soviet Union now account for about 5 percent of the American Jewish population."}
