The holy season is marred by unprecedented turmoil, violence and sectarian hatreds that threaten to rip apart the Middle East, the epicenter of Islam.\n\nSyria is bleeding. Militants have taken over large parts of Iraq. Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Egypt are all battling Islamic extremists. Millions of war refugees are scattered across the landscape.\n\nAlthough the bloodshed has eroded much of the Ramadan joy, millions of Shiite and Sunni Muslims will fast for grueling hours, both hoping for God\u2019s acceptance.\n\nSome facts about Ramadan:\n\nWHAT IS RAMADAN?\n\nA Muslim holy month of fasting during which Muslims abstain from food, drink and other pleasures from sunrise to sunset. Ramadan is the time Muslims believe God started to reveal the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad. For believers, Ramadan is meant to be a time of reflection and worship, remembering the hardships of others and being charitable.\n\nWHEN DOES RAMADAN BEGIN AND END?\n\nIslam is based on a lunar calendar, so the start of Ramadan on the Gregorian calendar varies each year. Once the new crescent moon has been sighted, observance begins. The new moon at the end of the month signals Eid al-Fitr, a three-day festival marking the end of fasting. The majority of Shiites tend to mark Ramadan a day later than Sunnis, although this Ramadan is an exception and a rare event where Shiite and Sunnis will mark Ramadan together \u2014 at least in most places.\n\nWHY FAST?\n\nFasting is one of the five basic tenets, or pillars, of Islam. Muslims give multiple other reasons: to teach empathy with the poor, learn self-control and show devotion to God. Islam exempts the elderly, young children, pregnant women and those who are ill or travelling from fasting. In some countries like Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, non-Muslims are banned from eating, drinking, or smoking in public during Ramadan. Other countries are more flexible.\n\nINDULGENCE?\n\nIt may be a time for introspection but Ramadan can also be a time of indulgence. Much like Christmas or Thanksgiving in the Western world, Ramadan is a time for families and friends to gather for elaborate, fast-breaking daily meals known as iftars. There\u2019s a tendency to overeat and go wild on sweets. Prices go up. So-called Ramadan tents are popular venues, providing a place for people to meet after sunset to eat and smoke water pipes until the early morning hours.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "author": "Zeina Karam", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "title": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/from_morocco_to_jakarta_muslims_mark_ramadan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-palestinians-ramadan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-palestinians-ramadan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "From Morocco to Jakarta, Muslims mark Ramadan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbd7\"", "article_summary": "The majority of Shiites tend to mark Ramadan a day later than Sunnis, although this Ramadan is an exception and a rare event where Shiite and Sunnis will mark Ramadan together \u2014 at least in most places.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Across a wide belt that stretches halfway around the globe, the world\u2019s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims will mark the beginning of Ramadan this weekend.\nAlthough the bloodshed has eroded much of the Ramadan joy, millions of Shiite and Sunni Muslims will fast for grueling hours, both hoping for God\u2019s acceptance.\nA Muslim holy month of fasting during which Muslims abstain from food, drink and other pleasures from sunrise to sunset.\nRamadan is the time Muslims believe God started to reveal the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad."}
