Referee Kevin Pollock immediately signaled that there was no goal, ruling that Ward had prevented Lundqvist from being able to make a play on the puck.\n\nThe Capitals argued that Ward had been pushed into Lundqvist by Rangers center Derek Stepan, who made contact with Ward while Niskanen\u2019s shot was in the air. It was unclear whether Ward or Stepan had a skate in the crease at the time of contact, and also whether contact was made between the two before or after the puck was deflected into the net.\n\n\u201c[Officials] just said there was incidental contact,\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said after the game. \u201cWe felt, obviously, that he was pushed in. You know, they made the call, and that was it. You just deal with it and move on. On that one, we felt two things \u2014 Lundqvist came out, outside the blue, and engaged on it a little bit, and then Ward was pushed in.\u201d\n\nRob Shick, the officiating manager of the series, wrote in a pool report e-mailed during the game that Lundqvist \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed to play his position in the crease. Incidental contact [by Ward]. I support the call. Results in no goal, no penalty.\u201d\n\nThe same explanation was given to players and coaches on the ice. Ward, who did not speak to reporters following the game, was visibly upset immediately afterward, as was defenseman Brooks Orpik.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to try to find the puck when there\u2019s a guy on top of me like that,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cI think it was the right call. It\u2019s tough. We had a similar situation in the first and it was not enough for a penalty, but I think when you have interference like that, it\u2019s impossible to play the game. I think it\u2019s a great call.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NHL rulebook, a goal can be disallowed if \u201can attacking player, either by his positioning or by contact, impairs the goalkeeper\u2019s ability to move freely within his crease or defend his goal,\u201d or \u201can attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, inside or outside of his goal crease. Incidental contact with a goalkeeper will not be permitted, and resulting goals [will not be] allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the goal crease, provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.\u201d\n\nLikewise, if an attacking player \u201chas been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending player so as to cause him to come into contact with the goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.\u201d\n\nSuch a call is not subject to video review, and a penalty for goaltender interference is not mandatory. Officials are urged to give more consideration to the degree of contact than the players\u2019 positioning when disallowing a goal.\n\n\u201cObviously, it can be frustrating when a goal is called back like that, but it is what it is,\u201d Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby said. \u201cYou move forward. The play you look at it could be called either way. It could be a good goal, but it was called the other way.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s what we do. We crash the net. We try to put bodies in front and try to score those goals like that. In doing that, sometimes you get calls against you like that. You just have to live with it and battle through it, and next time that happens, I think we\u2019ll battle through it better.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals eventually scored the first goal of the game, marking the third time in the series they have done so, at 10:54 of the third period when Curtis Glencross put back his own rebound on a breakaway. The Rangers tied it at 18:19 of the third period when Chris Kreider scored, and then won it at 9:37 of overtime when Ryan McDonagh\u2019s shot glanced by Holtby.\n\n\u201cI think leading up to that goal, we were starting to put on some heat and we were feeling pretty good about ourselves, throwing a lot of pucks at the net,\u201d defenseman Karl Alzner said. \u201cIt was a good playoff goal \u2014 put the puck at the net in traffic, and that\u2019s what you want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A shot from Matt Niskanen in the second period that appeared to deflect off one of Joel Ward's shoulders and past goaltender Henrik Lundqvist was immediately struck down in the Capitals' eventual 2-1 overtime loss.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A shot from Matt Niskanen in the second period that appeared to deflect off one of Joel Ward\u2019s shoulders and past goaltender Henrik Lundqvist was immediately struck down in the Capitals\u2019 eventual 2-1 overtime loss.", "title": "Officials deny opening goal, cite contact with goaltender in Capitals\u2019 loss", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/9/officials-deny-opening-goal-cite-contact-goaltende/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/08/Capitals_Rangers_Hockey.JPEG-0a53c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/08/Capitals_Rangers_Hockey.JPEG-0a53c.jpg", "description": "A shot from Matt Niskanen in the second period that appeared to deflect off one of Joel Ward's shoulders and past goaltender Henrik Lundqvist was immediately struck down in the Capitals' eventual 2-1", "card": "summary", "title": "Officials deny opening goal, cite contact with goaltender in Capitals&"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Capitals, Henrik Lundqvist, New York Rangers, Joel Ward"}, "article_summary": "\u201c[Officials] just said there was incidental contact,\u201d Capitals coach Barry Trotz said after the game.\nOfficials are urged to give more consideration to the degree of contact than the players\u2019 positioning when disallowing a goal.\nThe Capitals argued that Ward had been pushed into Lundqvist by Rangers center Derek Stepan, who made contact with Ward while Niskanen\u2019s shot was in the air.\n\u201cObviously, it can be frustrating when a goal is called back like that, but it is what it is,\u201d Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby said.\n\u201cIt was a good playoff goal \u2014 put the puck at the net in traffic, and that\u2019s what you want.\u201d"}
