Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states’ attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, asserts that the Obama administration violated the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the federal Administrative Procedure Act when it implemented the president’s deferred action plan concerning the immigration status of millions of undocumented immigrants.

“The Take Care Clause mandates that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed — not rewrite them or ignore them under the guise of some type of executive discretion,” Caldwell said in a news release. “We will not tolerate this blatant violation of our Constitution.”

States joining Louisiana and Texas in the lawsuit are Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Gov. Bobby Jindal has sued Obama for allegedly forcing states to adopt Common Core State Standards.
