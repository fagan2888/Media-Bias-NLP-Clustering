Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Monday he plans to roll out an alternative plan to Obamacare sometime in the next three weeks.

“Well, we’ll lay it out in the next three weeks, and it’s to move back to a consumer-driven system where you have low-premium catastrophic coverage where it’s portable, where people can have more than one choice, and where they are more empowered to make decisions themselves,” Mr. Bush, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Mr. Bush said the health care law is creating higher costs and is suppressing wages.

“If we want more income for more people, then we have to have a dramatic change,” he said. “And I believe in repealing Obamacare — beyond that, we need to come up with an alternative that embraces conservative values, and I’ll do that in the next three weeks.”
