Her person and legal work are very good based on my own observations and those of my own family-lawyers. Bradley has been endorsed by a bipartisan group of over 100 sheriffs, chiefs of police and law enforcement officials from around the state. A great deal of my life in Green Bay has centered on local and state politics, as well as raising a family.\n\nIt truly speaks well of the Supreme Court having the mix in genders and legal experiences. Bradley is a former circuit court judge and has 20 years on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Bradley is committed to a Supreme Court that is fair, neutral and nonpartisan. She believes that judges should not be beholden to any special interest group, large or small, and is committed to ensuring that our courts remain a place where every Wisconsinite gets a fair shake.\n\nI have written out of respect for Justice Bradley and to counter some of the attacks directed against her.\n\nRosemary Hinkfuss, Green Bay\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1D59RsU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Re-elect Supreme Court justice", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Re-elect Supreme Court justice", "title": "Bradley is neutral and nonpartisan", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/04/04/bradley-neutral-nonpartisan/25299587/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Re-elect Supreme Court justice", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96c4f5ebb931187659d529f703e1e593a43b8492/c=0-627-4888-5515&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2015/03/31/B9316809940Z.1_20150331144221_000_GVVACJSHA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Bradley is neutral and nonpartisan", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf459\"", "article_summary": "Bradley is committed to a Supreme Court that is fair, neutral and nonpartisan.\nAnn Walsh Bradley (Photo: Submitted)This letter is in support of Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who is running for a third term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the April election.\nI have written out of respect for Justice Bradley and to counter some of the attacks directed against her.\nBradley is a former circuit court judge and has 20 years on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nI have met Justice Bradley on occasions both in Madison and Green Bay."}
