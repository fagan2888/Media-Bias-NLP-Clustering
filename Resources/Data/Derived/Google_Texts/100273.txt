Mayor Mark Holland said that Kansas City, Kansas, is the biggest job creator around.

In his state of city speech Tuesday, Holland said Kansas City, Kansas, is not only leading the Kansas City metropolitan area in job creation, but it's leading the entire state.

He pointed to the continued growth of the Village West area near the Kansas Speedway and Sporting Park.

"The 4,000 new jobs we created last year represented 30 percent of all the new jobs in the state of Kansas and 40 percent of all the new jobs in the metropolitan area," Holland said.

He said that thanks to the efforts of previous mayors, Kansas City, Kansas, is in a turnaround that many people are noticing.

"For years, we all moved," said Ralph Oropenza, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "We all moved out of Wyandotte County because there wasn't a lot of development."

Holland said it 2017, the city will start getting $12 million in STAR Bond money used to develop the Village West area. He said the money will be used to give city workers a raise, cut taxes and improve the city's infrastructure.

"And so the challenge in strategic investing is to do it wisely and for the long term," Holland said.

Wendell Maddox said he'd like to see the city specifically invest in its urban core using the future STAR bond money.

Holland also repeated his call for a more diverse public work force, noting that Kansas City, Kansas, is now a majority minority town.



Holland also made partisan commends, calling for the Republican majority in the Kansas Legislature to expand Medicaid and embrace the federal Affordable Care Act since the state is already taking government subsidies.



"I know we're taking federal subsidies for agriculture," Holland said. "I doubt that if we called it 'Obamaculture' that people would stop taking their agriculture subsidies."
