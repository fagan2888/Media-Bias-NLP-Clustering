Jimmy Gates, said before the polls opened that he\u2019d been disappointed with early voting numbers. He said Cuyahoga County had been averaging about 100 people a day voting at the elections board since the early voting period began Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the candidate or who\u2019s running for office,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people out to the polls to vote for their candidates or their issue of choice.\u201d\n\nMary Hunter said she could have voted Tuesday, but instead chose to wait in line Sunday with members of her East Cleveland church.\n\nLang Dunbar accompanied a passenger van of elderly voters to the Board of Elections from Cleveland\u2019s storied Antioch Baptist Church, which has long been a bulwark in the civil rights movement. The 78-year-old Mr. Dunbar thinks the black community has moved forward in some ways, but has regressed in others. Political activism, he said, has become stagnant.\n\n\u201cYoung people are a little bit disenchanted because older people have not stepped up,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said.\n\nIn Strongsville, one of the county\u2019s few Republican strongholds, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner made an appearance Sunday in support of fellow Ohioan U.S. Rep Jim Renacci and to encourage a crowd of about 70 people to get their friends and neighbors to the polls.\n\nMr. Boehner, dressed in jeans, a pullover and tasseled loafers, took his expected shots at President Obama\u2019s administration and the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate. He singled out the Affordable Care Act, an \u201cout of control\u201d U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\n\n\u201cPeople are bewildered by what they see,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.\n\nEd FitzGerald, the Democratic candidate for governor, made a brief appearance at Antioch Baptist Church during the afternoon. He said he had not seen The Columbus Dispatch Poll released Sunday that showed Republican Gov. John Kasich with a big lead.\n\nThe Dispatch Poll showed Mr. Kasich with 62 percent support to FitzGerald\u2019s 34 percent. The poll indicated Republican Treasurer Josh Mandel was in a tight race against state Rep. Connie Pillich, Cincinnati Democrat, with Republicans leading in other statewide races. The mail poll of 1,009 likely voters from Oct. 22-31 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\n\u201cYou should run for office because things you believe in,\u201dMr. FitzGerald said. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me motivated. It\u2019s not about that poll or this poll.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ministers in Cleveland and throughout Ohio rallied their congregations to vote Sunday with a \"souls to the polls,\" and House Speaker John Boehner made get-out-the-vote rounds, too.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ministers in Cleveland and throughout Ohio rallied their congregations to vote Sunday with a \u201csouls to the polls,\u201d and House Speaker John Boehner made get-out-the-vote rounds, too.", "title": "Black churches, Boehner rally \u2018souls to the polls\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/2/democrat-fitzgerald-continues-to-stump-for-votes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/19/boehner-iraqjpeg-09b6f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/19/boehner-iraqjpeg-09b6f.jpg", "description": "Ministers in Cleveland and throughout Ohio rallied their congregations to vote Sunday with a \"souls to the polls,\" and House Speaker John Boehner made get-out-the-vote rounds, too.", "card": "summary", "title": "Black churches, Boehner rally \u2018souls to the polls\u2019"}, "Author": "MARK GILLISPIE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Cleveland, Jimmy Gates"}, "article_summary": "The 78-year-old Mr. Dunbar thinks the black community has moved forward in some ways, but has regressed in others.\nMr. Boehner, dressed in jeans, a pullover and tasseled loafers, took his expected shots at President Obama\u2019s administration and the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate.\n\u201cYoung people are a little bit disenchanted because older people have not stepped up,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said.\n\u201cPeople are bewildered by what they see,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Ministers in Cleveland and throughout Ohio rallied their congregations to vote Sunday with a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d campaign among traditionally black churches two days before the election."}
