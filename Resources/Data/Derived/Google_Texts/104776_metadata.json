Oregon was supposed to be leading the nation. The Associated Press noted back in November that \u201cOregon officials set out to build one of the biggest and best in the nation \u2014 a model that other states would want to copy.\u201d\n\nIt has now become a national embarrassment, and the state\u2019s CIO in change of building the web site, Carolyn Lawson, has resigned.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming obvious that many of the problems were known for a long time before the web site was supposed to launch on October 1, 2013.\n\nKATU has been doing an outstanding job of researching the problems and trying to get answers.\n\nOn Thursday, KATU asked Gov. Kitzhaber some tough questions \u2013 especially about his having been warned in an email by former state Rep. Patrick Sheehan ten months before the web site launch date about problems with Carolyn Lawson and with the project. Gov. Kitzhaber claimed he hadn\u2019t seen the email, and then the interview was cut short by the Governor\u2019s spokesman.\n\nUnfortunately for Gov. Kitzhaber, his running from the tough questions has not gone unnoticed. The Huffington Post ran an article on Friday with the headline Oregon Governor Walks Out Of Interview Over Questions About State\u2019s Health Care Website. The Huffington Post also calls out the December 2012 warning from former state Rep. Patrick Sheehan to Gov. Kitzhaber, and notes that \u201cKitzhaber denied having seen the email, even though his legislative director responded to it, and claimed he didn\u2019t know of problems with Lawson until late [in 2013].\u201d\n\nHere are some highlights from Thursday\u2019s KATU story on the Cover Oregon disaster:\n\nKATU talked about Gov. John Kitzhaber\u2019s knowledge of the problems with Cover Oregon.\n\n\u201cKATU investigators uncovered a lot of red flags and mismanagement of the project \u2013 including a call for the Governor to fire the woman in charge of the botched web site development. Here\u2019s what happened when KATU\u2019s Hillary Lake asked him about that today.\u201d\n\nKATU \u201cYou knew about some of those red flags, or your office knew about some of those red flags \u2013 specifically with Carolyn Lawson \u2013 and people calling for her to be let go far before she resigned.\u201d\n\nGov. Kitzhaber \u201cWell I knew about the problems in late October \u2013 is when I first learned about the problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut ten months earlier, Rep. Patrick Sheehan sent an email to Gov. Kitzhaber\u2019s Legislative Director pushing for the Governor to take dramatic action to change the course of the project. Sheehan was on the Legislative Oversight Committee for the project. He wrote that Carolyn Lawson should be terminated. She\u2019s the woman who was in charge of developing the web site until she resigned for \u2018personal reasons\u2019 last month. Sheehan wrote Lawson was unfairly and untruthfully favoring Oracle as the only software company that could build Cover Oregon \u2013 when in fact other companies could have done the job.\u201d\n\nKATU \u201cWe have an email from Rep. Patrick Sheehan that went to you, and he encouraged you at the end of 2012 to let her go.\u201d\n\nGov. Kitzhaber \u201cIt may have gone to my office, but I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nKATU \u201cYou never actually saw it, OK.\u201d\n\nThe Governor\u2019s spokesman then said the interview would have to wrap up after one more question.\n\nKATU later asked former state Rep. Patrick Sheehan (R-Clackamas) about the Governor\u2019s claims that he hadn\u2019t seen Sheehan\u2019s December 2012 email.\n\nSheehan \u201cWell that\u2019s disappointing, the Legislature is the eyes and ears of the people, and when a legislator brings something like that up, with all those flags, the Governor should pay attention.\u201d\n\nKATU \u201cDo you believe he never got this information?\u201d\n\nSheehan \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\nKATU \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\n\nSheehan \u201cThis is the method that you get something to the Governor in the rare instance that you need to get something to him.\u201d\n\nBelow are two different segments that aired on KATU on Thursday on Gov. Kitzhaber\u2019s knowledge of the problems with Cover Oregon. They are well worth watching.", "article_metadata": {"wot-verification": "4539614150de0ef2ed1b", "og": {"site_name": "The Oregon Catalyst", "description": "by NW Spotlight The rollout of Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange for Obamacare, Cover Oregon, has been a disaster.
