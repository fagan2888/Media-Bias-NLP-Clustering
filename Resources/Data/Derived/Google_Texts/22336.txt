We have troves of data about polit­ical com­mu­ni­ca­tion — dig­ital tran­scripts of every law, speech, news story, blog, and tweet. With those, com­puter sci­en­tists are building tools for under­standing the lan­guage of pol­i­tics. In essence, they are putting the “sci­ence” in polit­ical science.

One sci­en­tist is Oren Tsur, a researcher at Har­vard and North­eastern who studies how social net­works shape and are shaped by lan­guage. He applies an arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence tech­nique called nat­ural lan­guage pro­cessing to polit­ical lan­guage to extract pat­terns, infer meaning, and track the evo­lu­tion of words, phrases, and, to a cer­tain extent, voter sen­ti­ment. Tsur found, for instance, that Democ­rats were able to blunt the pejo­ra­tive con­no­ta­tions of “Oba­macare” when they co-​​opted it from Republicans.
