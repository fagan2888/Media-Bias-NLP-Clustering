BEIRUT (AP) - An unmanned Israeli reconnaissance drone crashed in the waters near northern Lebanon’s port of Tripoli Saturday, the Lebanese army and a security official said.

In a statement, the army said the drone crashed at 8.30 a.m. local time (0530 GMT) Saturday. It gave no other details but published photos that showed the aircraft largely intact in the waters and then on land after it was taken out.

It had a Jewish Star of David and Hebrew writing on it.

Israel frequently sends drones and warplanes flying over Lebanon, mostly over towns and villages in the country’s south where the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is known to operate. The city of Tripoli is unusually far north but Israeli drones are known to fly over the entire country.

The Israeli military refused to comment on the report.

Lebanon and Israel are bitter enemies who remain technically in a state of war. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006 that killed 1,200 Lebanese, including hundreds of civilians, and 160 Israelis and caused heavy damage to Lebanon’s infrastructure.
