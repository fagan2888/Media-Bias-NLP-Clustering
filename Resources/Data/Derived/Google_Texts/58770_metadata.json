Then in October the parliament gave the green light to drilling in the park.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThat decision was followed by widespread criticism. \u201cYasun\u00ed is exceptionally rich in species and home to diverse cultures \u2014 including some living in voluntary isolation,\u201d stated Stuart Pimm of Duke University. \u201cIts protection defends nature and peoples: destroying it would be a particular tragedy.\u201d\n\nYet as Ecuador offers up the Yasun\u00ed to potential oil spills, it is also condemning the oil contamination brought to another area of the Amazon.\n\n\u201cFor the government to green-light one environmental disaster the day after it joins the world in condemning another is a cold, calculated move that insults our collective intelligence,\u201d Adam Zuckerman, Environmental and Human Rights Campaigner at indigenous rights NGO Amazon Watch, stated to Common Dreams, referring to Chevron\u2019s contamination in the Ecuadorian Amazon and the international day of action against the oil giant.\n\n\u201cIn its announcement the government forgot to mention that it has already divided up 45% of Yasun\u00ed National Park into seven oil concessions. According to its own records, Ecuador\u2019s state oil company averages nearly an oil spill every week, and just one spill in the most biodiverse and culturally sensitive part of the Amazon would be tragic,\u201d Zuckerman stated.\n\nCritics of the plan to drill in the biodiversity hotspot had spent months gathering signatures to put the issue \u2014 \u201cAre you in favor of leaving oil in the ground in Block 43/Yasun\u00ed-ITT indefinitely?\u201d \u2014 on a referendum. While they gathered 850,000 signatures, less than 360,00 were validated by Ecuadorian officials, leaving the petitioners without the number needed to force a referendum. Environmentalists and indigenous groups decried the signature purge as \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\n___________________________________\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Environment minister authorized environmental permits for oil drilling in Yasun\u00ed National Park", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Andrea Germanos | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Environment minister authorized environmental permits for oil drilling in Yasun\u00ed National Park", "title": "Ecuador 'Green-lights Environmental Disaster' In Biodiversity Hotspot", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/ecuador-green-lights-environmental-disaster-biodiversity-hotspot/191409/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4858685698_3f70db3e49_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-23T17:28:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Environment minister authorized environmental permits for oil drilling in Yasun\u00ed National Park", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4858685698_3f70db3e49_b.jpg", "title": "Ecuador 'Green-lights Environmental Disaster' In Biodiversity Hotspot", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Environment", "published_time": "2014-05-26T05:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T17:28:39-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Ecuador \u2018Green-lights Environmental Disaster\u2019 In Biodiversity HotspotEnvironment minister authorized environmental permits for oil drilling in Yasun\u00ed National ParkIn a move condemned as paving the way for an environmental disaster, the environment minister of Ecuador on Thursday authorized permits for oil exploration to begin within the Yasun\u00ed National Park, an area home to two indigenous communities living in voluntary isolation and an area some consider the most biodiverse place in the world.\n\u201cIn its announcement the government forgot to mention that it has already divided up 45% of Yasun\u00ed National Park into seven oil concessions.\nEnvironmentalists and indigenous groups decried the signature purge as \u201cfraud.\u201d___________________________________This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.\nOil production in the area could happen as soon as 2016.\nWhile they gathered 850,000 signatures, less than 360,00 were validated by Ecuadorian officials, leaving the petitioners without the number needed to force a referendum."}
