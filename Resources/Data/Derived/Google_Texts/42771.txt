Thanks Daniel. It’s hard to believe it was possible, but the stakes for tonight’s Republican presidential debate got raised with news of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death a few hours ago.

We’re sure to see CBS moderator John Dickerson pepper the six remaining candidates on stage about both whom they would appoint to the Court, but also whether the Senate should block President Barack Obama’s effort to fill Mr. Scalia’s seat.

Already presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have already said the seat should stay open for the next president to fill.
