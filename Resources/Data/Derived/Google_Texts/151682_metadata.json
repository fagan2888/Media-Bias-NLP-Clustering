The news follows promises from Pyongyang that a new submarine is in development.\n\nThe test fire over the weekend was conducted from a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine, according to CNN. The missile in question only traveled 19 miles before crashing into the East Sea. South Korean standards for a successful missile launch are 186 miles or 300 KM.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis weekend\u2019s launch is the latest failed intimidation attempt from Pyongyang. Earlier this month, American and South Korean military officials told news outlets that North Korea attempted a missile launch in honor of \u201cEternal President\u201d Kim Il-sung\u2019s birthday, which was described as \u201can embarrassing failure.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean state media is reporting the incident as a success. The government newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that dictator Kim Jong-un \u201chighly praised the officials, scientists and technicians in the field of national defense science and munitions factories for having successfully rounded off the technology of underwater launching of ballistic missile from a strategic submarine at a higher level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe successful test-fire would help remarkably bolster up the underwater operational capability of the KPA navy,\u201d he is quoted as saying. Yonhap confirmed the spin in North Korean propaganda, claiming that the test proves North Korea \u201cnow has the capability to strike its opponents in South Korea and the United States, with the least warning and at anytime it pleases.\u201d\n\nYonhap adds, however, that this latest test, if not confirming the abilities of North Korea\u2019s military, does confirm their intentions of acquiring a nuclear triad. \u201cNorth Korea may be in the process of developing a 3,000-ton submarine that can provide a stable platform to launch three submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) as the country is scurrying to enhance its nuclear delivery capability, military experts here said Monday.\u201d the outlet reported, adding that the project \u201ccould carry a number of SLBMs, an armament substantial enough to pose tangible threats to the United States,\u201d according to South Korean experts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korea attempted yet another failed missile launch Saturday, this time of an allegedly submarine-launched ballistic missile.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "North Korea attempted yet another failed missile launch Saturday, this time of an allegedly submarine-launched ballistic missile.", "title": "North Korea: Failed Submarine Test Was 'Eye-Opening Success'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/north-korea-kim-jong-un-watching-test-fire-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-04-25T21:26:31-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/04/25/north-korea-touts-failed-submarine-test-eye-opening-success/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Korea attempted yet another failed missile launch Saturday, this time of an allegedly submarine-launched ballistic missile.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/north-korea-kim-jong-un-watching-test-fire-afp.jpg", "title": "North Korea: Failed Submarine Test Was 'Eye-Opening Success'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "missile test, North Korea, President Obama, south korea,National Security,North Korea", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-25T21:15:24-07:00", "section": "National Security", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T21:26:31-07:00", "tag": "south korea", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNorth Korea attempted yet another failed missile launch Saturday, this time of an allegedly submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nSouth Korean standards for a successful missile launch are 186 miles or 300 KM.\nThe test fire over the weekend was conducted from a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine, according to CNN.\nEarlier this month, American and South Korean military officials told news outlets that North Korea attempted a missile launch in honor of \u201cEternal President\u201d Kim Il-sung\u2019s birthday, which was described as \u201can embarrassing failure.\u201dNorth Korean state media is reporting the incident as a success.\nThe news follows promises from Pyongyang that a new submarine is in development."}
