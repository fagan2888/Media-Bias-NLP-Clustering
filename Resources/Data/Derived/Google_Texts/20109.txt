A “die-off” of rabbits in southeast Fort Collins has triggered a health warning that tularemia bacteria found in one of the rabbits could make people and pets sick, authorities say.

The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment issued an alert primarily for residents in the Hahn Acres, Linden Park, and Paragon Estates neighborhoods.

The bacteria causing tularemia may be found in rabbits, rodents and hares, according to the advisory sent late Friday.

“There has been a die-off of rabbits in the area over the past few weeks, but until an animal was tested today, the cause of the die-off was unknown,” the advisory said.

People can be infected if they handle sick or dead animals infected with the disease. Ticks and deer flies can also spread the bacteria. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain and coughing.

If tularemia is caused by the bite of an infected insect or from bacteria entering a cut or scratch, it usually causes a skin ulcer and swollen glands, according to the advisory. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting.

Tularemia can be treated with antibiotics and anyone with the symptoms should get medical attention as soon as possible.

Dogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites.

If a dead animal must be moved, people should avoid direct contact with it. They should put on a repellent to protect themselves from its fleas or ticks. They can use a shovel to scoop it up, put it in a plastic bag and throw it in an outdoor trash can.

People can avoid infection by using insect repellent containing DEET when outdoors, the advisory says.
