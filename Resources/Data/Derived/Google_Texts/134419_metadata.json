He addressed the first TV ad State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak) ran in Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate Race called \u201cSqueal.\u201d He equated, during a press conference yesterday, hog castration with animal mutilation. Sodders said, \u201cIn part of her ad, she talks about mutilating animals and riding Harleys all the way to Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nIs this guy for real? Is he from Iowa? Granted I didn\u2019t grow up on a farm (I did grow up in a farming community), but even I know this is an accepted practice in the industry and I\u2019m not expected to respresent the agricultural community in the Iowa Senate.\n\nBraley was already in trouble with farmers. Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey released a statement after Kathie Obradovich broke this story at The Des Moines Register. \u201cBruce Braley and his campaign continue to show that he is out of touch and doesn\u2019t understand, respect or appreciate hard working Iowa farmers. First he insults Sen. Grassley in front of a group of Texas trial lawyers, now he is attacking farmers for a procedure that is a necessary and humane. Livestock farmers work hard, put in long hours and take great pride in caring for their animals. To say these farmers are mutilating their animals is an insult,\u201d Northey said.\n\nIt should be noted that the World Pork Expo started yesterday. Beautiful.\n\nWith friends like these Braley doesn\u2019t need enemies.\n\nPhoto credit: Mark Peters (CC by 2.0)", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/06/braley-surrogate-steve-sodders-hog-castration-animal-mutilation/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Yorkshire_pigs_at_animal_sanctuary.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-06-06T22:32:00+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "agriculture, bill northey, bruce braley, iowa&#039;s u.s. senate race, joni ernst, steve sodders, election central, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "I was focused on Braley\u2019s \u201cChick\u201d ad\u00a0and other news\u00a0yesterday so\u00a0I neglected to point out the asinine remark that Congressman Bruce Braley\u2019s surrogate, State Senator Steve Sodders (D-State Center), made. \u00a0 He addressed the first TV ad State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak) ran in Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate Race called \u201cSqueal.\u201d\u00a0 He equated, during a press \u2026", "title": "Braley Surrogate Steve Sodders: Hog Castration = Animal Mutilation | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Yorkshire_pigs_at_animal_sanctuary.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06T17:38:24-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/06/braley-surrogate-steve-sodders-hog-castration-animal-mutilation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I was focused on Braley\u2019s \u201cChick\u201d ad\u00a0and other news\u00a0yesterday so\u00a0I neglected to point out the asinine remark that Congressman Bruce Braley\u2019s surrogate, State Senator Steve Sodders (D-State Center), made. \u00a0 He addressed the first TV ad State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak) ran in Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate Race called \u201cSqueal.\u201d\u00a0 He equated, during a press [\u2026]", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Yorkshire_pigs_at_animal_sanctuary.jpg", "title": "Braley Surrogate Steve Sodders: Hog Castration = Animal Mutilation | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-06-06T17:32:00-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T17:38:24-05:00", "tag": "Steve Sodders"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He addressed the first TV ad State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak) ran in Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate Race called \u201cSqueal.\u201d He equated, during a press conference yesterday, hog castration with animal mutilation.\n\u201cBruce Braley and his campaign continue to show that he is out of touch and doesn\u2019t understand, respect or appreciate hard working Iowa farmers.\nSodders said, \u201cIn part of her ad, she talks about mutilating animals and riding Harleys all the way to Washington, D.C.\u201dIs this guy for real?\nI was focused on Braley\u2019s \u201cChick\u201d ad and other news yesterday so I neglected to point out the asinine remark that Congressman Bruce Braley\u2019s surrogate, State Senator Steve Sodders (D-State Center), made.\nTo say these farmers are mutilating their animals is an insult,\u201d Northey said."}
