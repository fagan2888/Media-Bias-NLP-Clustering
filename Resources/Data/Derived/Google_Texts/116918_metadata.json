Get rid of bad pre-Affordable Care Act plans\n\nWe recently heard from a reader with a plan he bought on his own before the new health law rules took effect. But now his wife is pregnant and his current insurance excludes maternity benefits. He wanted to know where he could get insurance that would cover maternity care, which all plans sold nowadays must do. Alas, the answer was that he can\u2019t until open enrollment starts on Nov. 15. If you have a pre-Affordable Care Act plan, make sure you understand its limitations.\n\n5. Don\u2019t accept an automatic replacement plan\n\nIf the plan you chose from your state marketplace last year is being discontinued, the government allows the insurer to auto-enroll you in a replacement plan\u2014unless you say otherwise. Check with your marketplace first to see whether you can get a better deal.\n\n6. Don\u2019t automatically take COBRA\n\nThis program used to be a lifeline if you lost your job, because it let you keep your employer\u2019s health plan for 18 months. But now it\u2019s more of an albatross. That\u2019s because COBRA requires that you pick up the full cost of the plan, which can hit $600 or more per month. Thanks to health care reform, you can almost certainly find equally good insurance for a better price on your state\u2019s marketplace, especially because your lower income will probably qualify you for big tax credits. Carefully compare the two before paying your first COBRA premium. Once you\u2019ve enrolled in COBRA, you can\u2019t switch to a marketplace plan until the next open enrollment period.\n\n7. Shop around for care\n\nObviously you can\u2019t do this for emergencies, and it\u2019s irrelevant for catastrophic situations such as cancer or a heart attack. But for a routine service, such as an MRI, or for things you can plan in advance, such as childbirth, register on your health plan\u2019s website and look for cost estimators. You\u2019re likely to find startling variations in prices for the same service, depending on where you get it.\n\n8. Master your plan\u2019s rules\n\nDon\u2019t assume that all plans are designed alike; they\u2019re not, and what you don\u2019t know can cost you. Say you wake up one day with a fever and a sore throat. A trip to your doctor might cost you a $40 co-pay. An urgent care center might set you back $60. An emergency room might cost $1,500. When you get a new plan, spend a few minutes with its standardized Summary of Benefits and Coverage form. It\u2019s not exciting reading, but it can save you big in the long run.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health insurance, obamacare, auto renew, Health, Conditions & Treatments, Doctors & Hospitals", "Title": "8 Things to Know Before You Buy Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/09/8-things-to-know-before-you-buy-health-insurance/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/1349101126998.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "8 Things to Know Before You Buy Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-09-25T20:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-09-25T20:24Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: 8 Things to Know Before You Buy Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News", "keywords": "health insurance, obamacare, auto renew, Health, Conditions & Treatments, Doctors & Hospitals", "contenttag": "Doctors & Hospitals", "description": "Consumer Reports offers simple advice on what to look for when choosing a health insurance plan."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3438\"", "article_summary": "He wanted to know where he could get insurance that would cover maternity care, which all plans sold nowadays must do.\nDon\u2019t automatically take COBRAThis program used to be a lifeline if you lost your job, because it let you keep your employer\u2019s health plan for 18 months.\nOnce you\u2019ve enrolled in COBRA, you can\u2019t switch to a marketplace plan until the next open enrollment period.\nBut for a routine service, such as an MRI, or for things you can plan in advance, such as childbirth, register on your health plan\u2019s website and look for cost estimators.\nMaster your plan\u2019s rulesDon\u2019t assume that all plans are designed alike; they\u2019re not, and what you don\u2019t know can cost you."}
