Church, an editor at the Sun and former Civil War correspondent. It answered a letter by a young girl. Merry Christmas!\n\nWe take pleasure in answering thus prominently the communication below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus. Papa says, \"If you see it in The Sun, it's so.\"\n\nPlease tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?\n\nVirginia O'Hanlon\n\n115 West Ninety-Fifth Street\n\nVirginia, your little friends are wrong.\n\nThey have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except what they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little.\n\nIn this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.\n\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.\n\nAlas! How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias.\n\nThere would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.\n\nNot believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.\n\nThe most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there.\n\nNobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world. You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart.\n\nOnly faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.\n\nNo Santa Claus! Thank God he lives and lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.\n\nSanta Claus and Christmas stocking, front view, close up (Photo: Getty Images/amana images RF)\n\nSanta Claus reading Christmas letter (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1OpHL33", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Read the famous 1897 Christmas editorial by the New York Sun.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Read the famous 1897 Christmas editorial by the New York Sun.", "title": "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/24/yes-virginia-there-santa-claus/77801886/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Read the famous 1897 Christmas editorial by the New York Sun.", "title": "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab83552f13e42b4d7006a420a52abc5367ea8a31/c=355-0-1889-1534&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/23/WIGroup/Wausau/635864619610744240-ThinkstockPhotos-497389860.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "yes virginia there is a santa claus, santa claus, christmas, spirit of christmas, new york sun"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe215c\"", "article_summary": "Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\nSanta Claus and Christmas stocking, front view, close up (Photo: Getty Images/amana images RF)Santa Claus reading Christmas letter (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Read or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1OpHL33\nYou might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove?\nNo Santa Claus!"}
