Families and individuals move for a wide range of reasons, but typically, it\u2019s to take or find a new job and to try to enhance their lifestyle and opportunities to prosper. Choosing the right city frequently is a highly complex and mindboggling decision to make.\n\n\u201cThere has been both experimental and quasi experimental research that shows that the place that people live \u2013 both for poor families and for middle class families -- has an effect on how children do in school, on children\u2019s and adults\u2019 health, and on their psychological well-being,\u201d said Rebekah Levine Coley, a professor on counseling, developmental and educational psychology at Boston College.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job Seekers\n\nAnalysts say that moving can be a sign of either opportunity, like landing a new, higher paying job or long term accumulation of wealth, or of instability, like running from foreclosure or a job loss.\n\n\u201cFor many people, it\u2019s not always an active choice,\u201d Coley added in an interview Monday. \u201cMany people don\u2019t have the resources \u2013 either the economic resources or the psychological resources, to really make an active and informed decision about where to live. Either we have to go where our job is, or where our families are.\u201d\n\nWith about 40 percent of all moving occurring during the summer months, the personal finance website WalletHub conducted an in-depth analysis of 2015\u2019s Best & Worst Cities for Families. WalletHub compared each of the 150 most populated cities using 30 key metrics that take into account essential family dynamics such as the relative cost of housing, the quality of local schools and health care systems, crime rates and safety and the opportunities for fun and recreation.\n\nRelated: The Top Ten College Towns\n\nThe analysis showed Overland Park, Kansas, as the number one city in the country for families \u2013 followed closely by Plano, Texas, and Virginia Beach, while Jackson, Mississippi drew the short straw as the worst city in the country for families, followed by Birmingham, Ala, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\u201cWhile obviously not perfect \u2013 given the intrinsic value of each city, personal preferences and the limitations of publicly available data \u2013 our findings will hopefully give prospective movers a sense of which areas offer the greatest opportunity to achieve wallet wellness and, of course, live a long and happy life,\u201d WalletHub\u2019s editors wrote.\n\nClick here to see their five best cities for families.\n\nClick here to see their five worst cities for families.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are probably no tougher or more important decisions to make in life than where t", "title": "The Five Best and Worst Cities for Families", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Five-Best-and-Worst-Cities-Families", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Overland_Park_Kansas_Flickr_neil1960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Five-Best-and-Worst-Cities-Families", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Overland_Park_Kansas_Flickr_neil1960.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There are probably no tougher or more important decisions to make in life than where t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see their five best cities for families.\nClick here to see their five worst cities for families.\nEither we have to go where our job is, or where our families are.\u201dWith about 40 percent of all moving occurring during the summer months, the personal finance website WalletHub conducted an in-depth analysis of 2015\u2019s Best & Worst Cities for Families.\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t have the resources \u2013 either the economic resources or the psychological resources, to really make an active and informed decision about where to live.\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job SeekersAnalysts say that moving can be a sign of either opportunity, like landing a new, higher paying job or long term accumulation of wealth, or of instability, like running from foreclosure or a job loss."}
