He referred to that voting bloc as the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 voters.\u201d\n\nAppearing as the male guest on Outnumbered, the new daytime talk show on Fox News that pits a group of female hosts against one man, Watters dismissed the concerns that Clinton raised about the low-wage workers at Hobby Lobby who will now have to foot the full cost of some types of contraception. \u201cShe\u2019s acting like Hobby Lobby all of a sudden is telling these women that work for them to wear a burka or something like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not surprised \u2014 this is her bread and butter, how she\u2019ll try to win the White House,\u201d Watters continued, in comments that were first reported by Buzzfeed. \u201cShe needs the single ladies vote. I call them \u2018the Beyonc\u00e9 voters\u2019 \u2014 the single ladies. Obama won single ladies by 76 percent last time, and made up about a quarter of the electorate. They depend on government because they\u2019re not depending on their husbands. They need contraception, health care, and they love to talk about equal pay.\u201d\n\nWatch it:\n\nWatters is relying on the common conservative assumption that insurance coverage for contraception is a frivolous government handout for promiscuous women. At the beginning of this year, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee (R) made headlines for distilling this argument into a comparison between the government and a sugar daddy, saying Democrats want women to think they\u2019re \u201chelpless\u201d without access to copay-free birth control.\n\nLinking Beyonc\u00e9 to sex is nothing new for right-wing pundits, either. In April, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly said that the singer\u2019s \u201craunchy\u201d new album is encouraging black girls to get pregnant out of wedlock. Of course, Beyonc\u00e9 is responsible for the chart topper \u201cSingle Ladies,\u201d and that may be why Watters used her name \u2014 but conservatives\u2019 constant fixation on her sexual morals still doesn\u2019t make much sense, considering the fact that she\u2019s half of one of pop culture\u2019s most famous marriages.\n\nAlthough Watters suggests that women could simply get married and rely on their husbands to pay for birth control, one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act is to eliminate this gender imbalance in health costs altogether. By requiring employers to offer birth control coverage without charging an extra co-pay, the health law is trying to prevent women from paying substantially more for their preventative health care simply because of their gender. If birth control costs are no longer a burden on female employees, there will be no need for either them or their spouse to pick up that extra tab.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"They depend on government because they\u2019re not depending on their husbands.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"They depend on government because they\u2019re not depending on their husbands.\"", "title": "Fox News Host: Hillary Clinton Needs Support From \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 Voters\u2019 Who Want Free Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/01/3455468/fox-news-hillary-beyonce/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Beyonce-Album.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"They depend on government because they\u2019re not depending on their husbands.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Beyonce-Album-321x214.jpg", "title": "Fox News Host: Hillary Clinton Needs Support From \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 Voters\u2019 Who Want Free Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Beyonce-Album.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Beyonce-Album.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-01T14:25:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Fox News Host: Hillary Clinton Needs Support From \u2018Beyonc\u00e9 Voters\u2019 Who Want Free Birth Control CREDIT: Sony Beyonc\u00e9 wants your vote.\nI call them \u2018the Beyonc\u00e9 voters\u2019 \u2014 the single ladies.\nObama won single ladies by 76 percent last time, and made up about a quarter of the electorate.\nIf birth control costs are no longer a burden on female employees, there will be no need for either them or their spouse to pick up that extra tab.\n\u201cShe needs the single ladies vote."}
