According to Deerfield, which in total manages more than $5 billion in investments, the new healthcare fund closed on the funding in July and features investments from prominent healthcare providers like New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering and Seattle Children's Hospital, nonprofits such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and universities including Princeton University and Northwestern University.

The fund hopes to add support to companies that support advances in genomics and disease research.

"The pullback in funding that has occurred for these innovations over the last decade could not have happened at a worse time," James Flynn, president and managing partner of Deerfield, said in a statement.
