Supporters of medical marijuana in Kansas are joining two Democratic state lawmakers at a Statehouse rally in favor of the Cannabis Compassionate Care Act.

Rep. Gail Finney, of Wichita, and Sen. David Haley of Kansas City filed medical marijuana bills prior to the start of this year's legislative session. Similar measures have been filed since 2009, but none of them have made it to the discussion stage in committee.

In addition to Thursday's rally, several medical cannabis groups also will be lobbying state lawmakers on behalf of patients and caregivers throughout the day.

More than 20 states across the U.S. have legalized the use of medical marijuana.

Finney says she thinks there's a good chance the measure will get a hearing during this year's session.
