They tell her they can\u2019t handle the pain, that the nausea is unbearable and the anxiety overwhelming.\n\nIf she were in the same situation, she too would want life-ending medication, even though she doubts she would ever take it. \u201cI would want an escape hatch,\u201d she said.\n\nIn October, California became the fifth \u2014 and largest \u2014 state to allow physicians to prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who ask for it. The law takes effect in 2016.\n\nYet van Zyl can\u2019t see herself as one of those doctors.\n\n\u201cThis is my life\u2019s work, to relieve suffering,\u201d said van Zyl, head of palliative care medicine at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. To her, that does not mean cutting short a life.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine pulling the trigger,\u201d she said.\n\nWeeks after California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the \u201cend-of-life option act\u201d into law, palliative care physicians like van Zyl are trying to come to terms with what it means for them and their terminally ill patients.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a question of whether they support aid-in-dying or personally would ever help end a life. Palliative care doctors say the law underscores the need to raise awareness among doctors and patients about what they do and to expand access to high-quality programs.\n\nContrary to some patients\u2019 fears, they say, palliative care doctors are not there to hasten death. Their job is to help seriously ill people get relief from symptoms and stress, and to improve quality of life for them and their families, regardless of how long the patients have to live.\n\nThe California law should be a \u201cwake-up\u201d call because it shows \u201chow terrified patients are of what they will experience at the end of life,\u201d said Dr. R. Sean Morrison, professor of geriatrics and palliative care medicine at Mt. Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine in New York.\n\nMorrison said that once patients who want to hasten their death get their symptoms controlled and their spiritual needs addressed, the overwhelming majority want to keep living.\n\n\u201cTheir choice shouldn\u2019t be an assisted death or living with intractable suffering,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s what laws allowing assisted suicide, in the absence of palliative care, present as a choice to patients.\u201d\n\nPalliative care has become more widespread in recent years, and more doctors, nurses and social workers are being trained in how to provide it. In addition, recent legislation in California requires that Medi-Cal managed care plans ensure access to programs.\n\nBut gaps remain. A recent report by the California HealthCare Foundation showed that residents in 22 of 58 California counties don\u2019t have access to community-based palliative care, and those in 19 counties don\u2019t have access to in-patient programs. Foundation researchers also found recently that specialists are in short supply and that there is no reliable way to pay for such care.\n\nDr. Ira Byock, a palliative care expert who opposed the California law, said its passage makes it more important than ever that all doctors receive more education on how to treat symptoms in seriously ill patients and talk with patients about what they want in their final months.\n\n\u201cAs hard as illness and dying are \u2026 people still have the capacity to experience the sense of well-being,\u201d said Byock, who heads the Providence Institute for Human Caring in Torrance, Calif.\n\nWithout palliative care programs, Byock and others say those conversations don\u2019t always take place. Only about 17 percent of patients have had end-of-life discussions with their doctors, though nearly 90 percent believe doctors should be doing so, according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In addition, research out of the Mayo Clinic found that only 12 percent of doctors had yearly end-of-life discussions with heart failure patients, and about 30 percent of the physicians had \u201clittle confidence\u201d doing so.\n\nDr. Tony Back, who is co-director of the University of Washington\u2019s Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, said that after a similar aid-in-dying law passed in his state, more doctors realized that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t just push it off on somebody else.\u201d\n\nAs van Zyl struggles with her own reactions to the new law, she continues to have those tough conversations with one patient after another, every day.\n\nOn a recent day, more than two dozen names were listed on a white board in her hospital offices \u2014 all of them patients referred to her team for care. A 33-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer. A 50-year-old with pancreatic cancer that had spread to her lungs. A 20-year-old man with a fast-growing brain tumor.\n\nOne patient van Zyl visited that day was Jose Garcia Flores, a gaunt, 60-year-old with advanced stage colon cancer. The former electrician had been diagnosed in the spring and was back in the hospital because of pain and nausea.\n\nVan Zyl told him that there was a possibility that doctors would no longer be able to continue chemotherapy because of a complication. Van Zyl asked what he valued more \u2014 living longer, no matter what that looked like, or not living as long but being able to spend quality time with family at home.\n\n\u201cThere is no right answer,\u201d she said, promising to do everything she could to ease his pain and control his symptoms, regardless of whether he wanted to continue treatment for his cancer.\n\nGarcia Flores paused and looked over at his wife standing next to the hospital bed. \u201cI would prefer\u2026 to enjoy time with my family,\u201d he said in Spanish.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair \u2014 any of this,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou are very brave.\u201d\n\nVan Zyl said that none of her patients have asked yet about the aid-in-dying law, which takes effect next year. She wonders if many of them even know about it.\n\nA native of South Africa who used to work in emergency medicine, van Zyl said she recognizes that her views on the new law are hypocritical. \u201cI don\u2019t have a logical answer why I would want it for myself but not want to offer it to my patients,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am still sitting on this fence that is increasingly pointy and uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nPart of it, she believes, is simple: \u201cI\u2019m deeply afraid of dying.\u201d\n\nYet she knows, as a doctor, that death doesn\u2019t have to be scary. Some problems, she says, have medical solutions \u2014 there are effective medications for pain and anxiety, for instance, so people can die peacefully. Van Zyl says her patients have always stopped asking to have their lives shortened once their symptoms were controlled.\n\nVan Zyl believes medical providers, regardless of specialty, can be taught how to provide palliative care. That\u2019s part of her job. And on this day, she stood before half a dozen medical residents, reviewing the best treatments for nausea, pain and shortness of breath. But suffering isn\u2019t always physical, she said. Patients and families also need help coping with emotional suffering, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to screw up a family for life with a bad conversation,\u201d she said. Van Zyl urged the residents not to run away from direct and honest \u2014 though hard \u2014 discussions. \u201cDon\u2019t do what so many doctors do, which is crumble.\u201d\n\nThen van Zyl brought up the aid-in-dying law. \u201cWhat will you do when your patients says, \u2018Can you kill me?\u2019\u201d she asked the group. \u201cSomebody, at some point, is going to ask you to do that.\u201d\n\nOne resident said that for her, prescribing lethal medication would be on a case-by-case basis. She would want to make sure the patient\u2019s symptoms and pain were under control first. Another said she worried about how her own family would view her decision to help patients end their lives.\n\nA third, Roshel Graham, said that no matter what, she hoped the law will help raise awareness about the benefits of palliative care. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people even know palliative care exists,\u201d she said.\n\nAs time goes on and doctors in California begin prescribing medicine to help people hasten their deaths, van Zyl said, perhaps her own views will become less conflicted.\n\n\u201cMaybe my position will evolve,\u201d she said. \u201cI could imagine one bad death tipping me over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In wake of new law, palliative care physicians are trying to come to grips with what it means to them and their terminally ill patients.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Assisted-Death Laws Accentuate Need for Palliative Care, Doctors Say\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/05\\/assisted-death-laws-accentuate-need-for-palliative-care-doctors-say\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-05 08:10:26\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-06 21:16:39\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":118441,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Aid in Dying\",\"News\",\"Physician-assisted Suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/palliative-care-1-e1449270292399.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In wake of new law, palliative care physicians are trying to come to grips with what it means to them and their terminally ill patients.", "title": "Assisted-Death Laws Accentuate Need for Palliative Care, Doctors Say", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/05/assisted-death-laws-accentuate-need-for-palliative-care-doctors-say/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/palliative-care-6-e1449270360767.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aid in dying,news,physician-assisted suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Palliative care doctors say the law underscores the need to raise awareness among doctors and patients about what they do and to expand access to high-quality programs.\nContrary to some patients\u2019 fears, they say, palliative care doctors are not there to hasten death.\n\u201cThis is my life\u2019s work, to relieve suffering,\u201d said van Zyl, head of palliative care medicine at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.\nVan Zyl believes medical providers, regardless of specialty, can be taught how to provide palliative care.\nWithout palliative care programs, Byock and others say those conversations don\u2019t always take place."}
