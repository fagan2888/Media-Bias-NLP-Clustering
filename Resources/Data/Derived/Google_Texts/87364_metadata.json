Today, bed bug infestations can occur anywhere from residential settings to luxury hotels. Bed bugs are incredibly hard to kill, have a ravenous appetite, and, let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re disgusting. After all, their only source of nutrition is human or animal blood. The good news is that bed bugs also reproduce slowly and they aren\u2019t that much of a health concern.\n\nConsidering their length at 1 to 7 millimeters, and that bite marks can take up to 14 days to develop on some people, we don\u2019t notice the 500 bites a night bed bugs can give us. They can also survive up to three months, starting from their lasting helping of blood. Although their bites are often considered a nuisance due to itching and loss of sleep, they do not carry disease. In fact, the only concern we have to worry about is excessive scratching that can lead to a secondary skin infection.\n\nWe are transportation for bed bugs, but not our bodies. They tend to hide in tiny crevices in our luggage, backpacks, and pocketbooks where it\u2019s cool. Our bodies, on the other hand, produce too much heat for their liking. Heat is also an effective way to eradicate a bed bug infestation. Kicking the temperature in a room up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any bed bugs. Just make sure you\u2019re not in there with them. Bed bug infestations are generally handled with insecticide spraying by a landlord or professional pest control company.\n\nBe on the lookout for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s signs of a bed bug infestation:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bed, bugs, bite, irritating, parasite, less, likely, pose, health, risk, humans, video", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If bed bugs are keeping you up at night, don't worry: They don't carry disease and reproducing is quite the problem for them.", "title": "Bed Bugs Bite, But They Won't Make You Sick [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bed-bugs-bite-irritating-parasite-less-likely-pose-health-risk-humans-video-337662", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/11/bed-bugs-bites-irritating-parasite-less-likely-pose-health-risk-humans-video.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If bed bugs are keeping you up at night, don't worry: They don't carry disease and reproducing is quite the problem for them.", "title": "Bed Bugs Bite, But They Won't Make You Sick [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bed-bugs-bite-irritating-parasite-less-likely-pose-health-risk-humans-video-337662", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/11/bed-bugs-bites-irritating-parasite-less-likely-pose-health-risk-humans-video.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/11/bed-bugs-bites-irritating-parasite-less-likely-pose-health-risk-humans-video.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-11T11:27:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T11:33:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If bed bugs are keeping you up at night, don't worry: They don't carry disease and reproducing is quite the problem for them."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeec4\"", "article_summary": "The good news is that bed bugs also reproduce slowly and they aren\u2019t that much of a health concern.\nBed bug infestations are generally handled with insecticide spraying by a landlord or professional pest control company.\nToday, bed bug infestations can occur anywhere from residential settings to luxury hotels.\nBe on the lookout for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s signs of a bed bug infestation:\nBed bugs are incredibly hard to kill, have a ravenous appetite, and, let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re disgusting."}
