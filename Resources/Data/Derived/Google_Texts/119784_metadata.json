The playoff qualifiers are the top three in each division, plus two wild cards from each conference.\n\nBalances of power swing, and the unbalanced schedule creates optical illusions, but it\u2019s possible that the Philadelphia Flyers, for example, could end up with more points than one or both of the Western Conference wild cards and miss the playoffs.\n\nGiven the Eastern-leaning power structure, impactful complaints about that are more likely than if, say, the San Jose Sharks were the \u201cvictims\u201d in such a scenario. And an Eastern complaint would be backed with math: 50 percent of Eastern Conference teams and 57 percent of Western Conference teams make the playoffs. When an Eastern Conference team\u2019s ownership is facing going without even a round of playoff gate receipts, the outrage can carry more weight.\n\nThere is an easy solution, of course.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201cE\u201d word.\n\nExpansion.\n\nI know that\u2019s anathema to those who not so long ago were arguing for Darwinian contraction. But it\u2019s appropriate now.\n\nAdd two teams, whether in Las Vegas and Quebec City, the two markets for which prospective ownerships forked over the $10 million application fee (with $2 million nonrefundable) last summer, or elsewhere if the league reopens the process and the bids, are compelling.\n\nLas Vegas, with Bill Foley and the Maloof family leading the NHL rush as Black Knight Sports, has deposits for more than 14,000 season tickets, and a new building \u2014 T-Mobile Arena \u2014 set to open in April.\n\nQuebec City, the former home of the Avalanche, has media company Quebecor behind its bid, also with the new Videotron Arena already completed.\n\nIf others are allowed to jump in and the NHL can get to Seattle (with what should be the Seattle Totems) ahead of an NBA return, I\u2019m confident that would be a gold mine. Several potential Seattle ownership groups expressed interest, citing possible arena projects both in the city and suburbs of Bellevue and Tukwila, but none submitted a bid last year.\n\nKansas City \u2014 which bombed with the ineptly run, underfunded and terrible Kansas City Scouts for two seasons before the franchise was shifted to Denver in 1976 \u2014 has a terrific new arena without an NBA or NHL tenant.\n\nHouston has its proponents too.\n\nThese discussions inevitably trigger concerns about watering down the NHL\u2019s talent pool. But adding about 6 percent more roster spots isn\u2019t all that significant, and the internationalization of the player pool has been a mitigating factor during the NHL\u2019s growth. Actually, the biggest potential problem for the talent pool is the increasing cost of the sport turning it into even more of an affluent kid\u2019s game, especially in the United States.\n\nThe NHL\u2019s caution on this is understandable. The league hasn\u2019t expanded since the Columbus Blue Jackets began play in 2000-01, and adding teams involves wrestling with revenue and salary cap implications.\n\nBut the NHL should do it.\n\nAdd two teams, rearrange because of geographical necessity and have four divisions of eight. (Easiest: If it\u2019s Las Vegas and Quebec City, put the former in the West, the latter in the East and switch Detroit or Columbus back to the West.)\n\nStick with a 16-team playoff field. Quickly shout down any attempt to tinker with that.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s appropriate \u2026\n\nWhat happens in Vegas shows up in the NHL standings.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nAlex Tanguay, left wing, Coyotes\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Monday, the Pepsi Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Arizona and Colorado meet a week after making the deal that sent Alex Tanguay and two major junior prospects (2014 draft choices Conner Bleackley and Kyle Wood) to the Coyotes for Mikkel Boedker.\n\nBackground: Tanguay, 36, needed to be in the trade to clear a roster spot, among other reasons. The Avs were at the max 50 contracts, plus his deal is up after this season and Colorado wouldn\u2019t have attempted to re-sign him after his struggles in 2015-16. The Avs tried a lot of things to get him jump-started, including entrusting him to play on a line with Nathan MacKinnon and Gabe Landeskog, but Tanguay ended up with four goals this season with the Avs. He was scratched for his first Arizona game, at Anaheim on Thursday, with the Coyotes citing a lower body injury. Then he made a splashy debut for the Coyotes on Saturday, scoring twice in a win over Florida.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: Tanguay, a member of the Avalanche\u2019s 20th anniversary team, is one of the nicest guys in the NHL and always will occupy an honored spot in Colorado hockey lore because of his two stints with the team \u2014 and especially his two goals in Game 7 of the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals against New Jersey. He also scored in the Avs\u2019 Stadium Series loss to Detroit last weekend. His huge smile and his joy after getting that goal made for a nice exit line.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: It\u2019s time for NHL to expand again", "title": "Frei: It\u2019s time for NHL to expand again", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/frei-its-time-for-nhl-to-expand-again/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T20:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:36:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3954\"", "article_summary": "And an Eastern complaint would be backed with math: 50 percent of Eastern Conference teams and 57 percent of Western Conference teams make the playoffs.\nWhen an Eastern Conference team\u2019s ownership is facing going without even a round of playoff gate receipts, the outrage can carry more weight.\nOne of the biggest upsets in recent NHL history is that there hasn\u2019t been more bellyaching from Eastern Conference teams about the \u201cunfairness\u201d in the playoff format.\nThis is the third NHL season of the four-division format, with 14 teams in the Western Conference and 16 in the East, and eight teams making the postseason from each.\nAnd if it\u2019s appropriate \u2026What happens in Vegas shows up in the NHL standings."}
