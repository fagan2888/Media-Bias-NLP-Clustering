I went outside, and I was just really confused why everyone was around the car,\" Corral said.\n\n\"An ambulance just backed up; two people got out. The car gets completely covered; ambulance leaves five minutes later. People taking pictures, they leave five minutes later, and it was clear. That was it. It was super quick,\" Weiner said.\n\nIt wasn't long before deputies returned to the scene to set up a perimeter. Investigators combed through yards and began questioning several neighbors, including Weiner.\n\n\"They asked me a bunch of questions about if I heard any gunshots, if I heard any broken glass, how many people were in the house,\" he said.\n\n\"People are just really crazy. They get mad for stupid stuff, and then they take it out in stupid ways,\" said Ryan Phillips of Lehigh Acres.\n\nWith one question answered, the focus turns to who is responsible. Neighbors said they hope someone knows something.\n\n\"It scares me, to be honest with you. That's right next to my house. They could've easily drove by and shot up every house out here,\" Phillips said.\n\nAnyone with information on the crime is asked to call the Lee County Sheriff's Office at (239) 477-1000 or to remain anonymous, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS(8477).", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Lee County deputies are investigating the death of a man found inside a car late Saturday.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/31629699/crime-scene-investigation-in-lehigh-acres", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lee County deputies are investigating the death of a man found inside a car late Saturday.", "title": "Man found dead inside car in Lehigh Acres"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/10244927_G.jpg", "description": "Lee County deputies are investigating the death of a man found inside a car late Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Man found dead inside car in Lehigh Acres"}, "wnreadableurl": "crime-scene-investigation-in-lehigh-acres", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2016/04/03", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS04"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37f2\"", "article_summary": "Investigators say they found Izquierdo's body in a newer model Mercedes-Benz parked outside a home they also searched.\nThey get mad for stupid stuff, and then they take it out in stupid ways,\" said Ryan Phillips of Lehigh Acres.\nAfter nearly 15 hours, Lee County deputies confirm a shooting investigation led them to a dead man inside a car.\nI went outside, and I was just really confused why everyone was around the car,\" Corral said.\nA rainy evening meant movie night for Jake Weiner and girlfriend Cherrika Corral, but soon the real drama would unfold on their doorstep."}
