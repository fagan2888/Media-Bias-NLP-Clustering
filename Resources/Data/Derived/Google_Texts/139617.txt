Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD

Three hundred and fifty airmen from Ellsworth Air Force Base are deploying to southwest Asia to provide support to forces in Afghanistan.



A portion of the 28th Bomb Wing's B-1 bomber fleet shipped out from the base in western South Dakota on Friday.



Officials say the airmen are going to be providing air support and presence over Afghanistan. They say they'll also be conducting a variety of tasks to provide critical battlefield support and long-range strike capabilities.



The deployment is expected to last six months.
