After dinner and a movie, they turned in and Lathan died in his sleep.\n\n\u201cHe was happy. We were laughing and having a great time,\u201d said Amy Lathan. \u201cWe went to bed, and only I woke up.\u201d\n\nA former Central High ROTC cadet, Lathan followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Army, serving as a helicopter mechanic. He met his future wife at his first duty stop.\n\nLathan was injured on July 4, 2004, in Baghdad after being struck by shrapnel at the base of the skull. He earned a Purple Heart.\n\nLathan wasn't ill at the time of his death, his wife said.\n\n\u201cEven though you're not prepared for death, we knew for the last nine and a half years that something like this could happen at any time,\u201d Amy Lathan said. \u201cWe were just thankful for the time we got and continued to have with him.\u201d\n\nShe said the injury never broke her husband's spirit: \u201cHe never once blamed the government or anybody for his condition. He never once looked back and said, 'I can't believe this happened to me.' \u201d\n\nThe Lathans were involved in their 13-year-old son James Lathan III's Boy Scouts Troop 308 activities and the lives of their three godchildren \u2014 Shana, Julien and Anja Moultrie \u2014 who live with them.\n\nThe couple saved up money and recently sent their son to the National Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. Her husband \u201cwas really proud of his son,\u201d Amy Lathan said.\n\nShe will remember her husband as someone who was constantly learning and \u201ctrying to become better educated.\u201d He served as a trustee for Christ Temple Church, enjoyed checking the stock market and was interested in real estate.\n\n\u201cAnything he wanted to do, he did,\u201d she said.\n\nLathan was preceded in death by his grandmother Leola Hull. In addition to his wife, son and godchildren, he is survived by his mother, Alisa Frieson; father, James P. Lathan Sr.; brothers, Jonathan and Jason Lathan and Charles Frieson Jr.; sisters, Melissa Giles, Kiesha Wrigley, Sheena Frieson and Tonya Duvall; and grandparents, Calvin Lathan and Bernadine and Phillip Jefferson.\n\nServices are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday at Lifegate Church, 15555 West Dodge Road.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "\u201cHe was happy.
