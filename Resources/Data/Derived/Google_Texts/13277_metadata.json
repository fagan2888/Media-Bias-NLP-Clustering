Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, said today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that Republicans will come to their senses and realize how valuable the Affordable Care act is to the American people,\u201d he told reporters on a White House conference call that also included Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich, Rep. Matthew Cartwright, D-Pa. and a senior Obama adviser, David Simas.\n\n\u201cThis is no longer an abstraction,\u201d Simas said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a pocketbook issue for millions of Americans across the country.\u201d\n\nThe White House today released estimates of the law\u2019s benefits for Texans.\n\nAccording to their numbers, more than 5 million Texans with private insurance have gained access to cost-free preventative care such as immunizations, birth control or mammograms. And the nearly 5 million uninsured in the state have expanded choices in terms of healthcare plans through Medicaid or the ACA marketplace.\n\nCastro said the ACA is gathering momentum in Texas. Though only 3,000 people in the state signed up in the program\u2019s first month, he said, last month saw more than 14,000 Texans join. \u201cWe believe the third month will be even higher,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state is dealing with a \u201cvery difficult, and in some ways unique, situation,\u201d Castro said, due to its high number of uninsured and rapid demographic changes. \u201cWe\u2019re in a dire state here in Texas.\u201d\n\nHe placed some blame at the feet of Republicans, calling their attitude callous and decrying actions like Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\nHe also blasted Sen. Ted Cruz for his efforts to defund or repeal the ACA, and said Republicans could cause another fiscal standoff like the one that lead to October\u2019s government shutdown and near-default on the nation\u2019s debts.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz, who caused the government shutdown, still talks nearly every day via social media about repealing the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. So they could threaten the debt ceiling again. We don\u2019t put that past them. \u201d\n\nRepublicans pushing for repeal say the law is too costly and will cause millions to lose their health care, their jobs, or both.\n\n\u201cThe only reason the White House held this call today is because enrollment numbers for Obamacare have been disastrously low,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton. \u201cTexans, like millions of Americans all over the country, know this terrible law is costing them jobs, the plans they liked, and forcing them to pay more for their insurance through higher premiums and deductibles.\u201d\n\nCastro said repealing the law is unpopular with voters, and that further attempts to topple it would have consequences for Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe American people, and Texans, will not stand for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. If they try to repeal it, there will be a real backlash among Texans,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi9jYXN0cm8tYmxhc3RzLWNydXotc2F5cy10ZXhhbnMtd29udC1zdGFuZC1mb3Itb2JhbWFjYXJlLXJlcGVhbC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Affordable Care Act is picking up steam, and repealing it now would cause a huge backlash from voters, Rep.
