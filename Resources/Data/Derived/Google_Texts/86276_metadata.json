The mayor\u2019s belated response has been to prop them up with money.\n\nHis latest financial plan calls for supporting the Health and Hospitals Corp. with an immediate $337 million and $1 billion more over the next five years.\n\nAt best, he\u2019s struggling to keep the doors open without confronting economics that will inescapably force HHC to undergo significant changes.\n\nDe Blasio should have learned a painful lesson in health care realities from his losing battle to keep open Brooklyn\u2019s Long Island College Hospital. There, a venerable local facility fell victim to the flight of patients to medical centers affiliated with major institutions like Mount Sinai and New York University.\n\nWhile running for mayor, de Blasio pledged to stop closure of LICH, in the process making a splash by getting arrested at a protest and wearing handcuffs as a badge of honor.\n\nOnce in office, he wound up with a deal that shuttered the hospital in favor of a walk-in facility and real estate development.\n\nMany of the same forces that doomed LICH, plus some, are buffeting the city system. As more patients obtain health insurance under Obamacare, they\u2019ve been leaving the public system in droves, with a 2.5% drop in visits last year alone.\n\nAdding to HHC woes, Obamacare cut funds that had been used to treat the uninsured \u2014 patients who account for 1 of every 4 outpatient visits.\n\nMeanwhile, world-class private health systems like NYU compete aggressively to lock insured patients into their doctor networks. You may have seen the ads on TV and in the subways.\n\nHHC\u2019s president, Dr. Ram Raju, last year plotted a plan to compete with those private giants for patients\u2019 loyalty, aiming for an audacious 43% increase by 2020.\n\nHe\u2019s moving to bulk up outpatient care, improve the patient experience and convince New Yorkers by the hundreds of thousands to forego nearby world-class private health systems and go to the public facilities instead.\n\nCould happen. By most measures, public hospitals\u2019 care is now on a par with private counterparts . But Raju is competing with private-sector sharks and their advertising budgets.\n\nSooner or later, there will be a reckoning as the hospitals demand large city subsidies. Now is the time to start honestly taking stock of the hospital system\u2019s place in a fast-evolving health system.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "Nine agonizing months after the head of the city\u2019s ailing public hospitals buzzed the mayor\u2019s pager, Dr. de Blasio is transfusing cash into", "title": "Intensive care needed", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/intensive-care-needed-article-1.2530294", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2530293.1455327728!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hospitals30e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "nyc hospital, new york hospital reform, mount sinai,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "nyc hospital, new york hospital reform, mount sinai,", "nydn_tags": "bill de blasio, obamacare, nyu", "news_keywords": "nyc hospital, new york hospital reform, mount sinai,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/intensive-care-needed-article-1.2530294", "parsely-title": "Intensive care needed", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-16T04:05:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Intensive care needed", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-16T09:05:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2530293.1455327728!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hospitals30e-1-web.jpg", "description": "Nine agonizing months after the head of the city\u2019s ailing public hospitals buzzed the mayor\u2019s pager, Dr. de Blasio is transfusing cash into", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Nine agonizing months after the head of the city\u2019s ailing public hospitals buzzed the mayor\u2019s pager, Dr. de Blasio is transfusing cash into", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Nine agonizing months after the head of the city\u2019s ailing public hospitals buzzed the mayor\u2019s pager, Dr. de Blasio is transfusing cash into", "title": "Intensive care needed", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/intensive-care-needed-article-1.2530294", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2530293.1455327728!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hospitals30e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bill de blasio, obamacare, nyu", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2530293.1455327728!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hospitals30e-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Rapid changes in health care delivery, including Obamacare, have put the New York\u2019s 11 municipal hospitals into increasingly critical condition.\nBy most measures, public hospitals\u2019 care is now on a par with private counterparts .\nDe Blasio should have learned a painful lesson in health care realities from his losing battle to keep open Brooklyn\u2019s Long Island College Hospital.\nNow is the time to start honestly taking stock of the hospital system\u2019s place in a fast-evolving health system.\nNine agonizing months after the head of the city\u2019s ailing public hospitals buzzed the mayor\u2019s pager, Dr. de Blasio is transfusing cash into to a hemorrhaging public hospital system."}
