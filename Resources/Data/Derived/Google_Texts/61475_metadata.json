Republicans simply aren\u2019t in any position to criticize this ludicrous claim because they have spent years telling their voters that this sort of thing happens all the time \u2013 to Christians, conservatives, everyone the liberals at the IRS hate. And this, of course, is just one example of hate and nonsense debt coming due. Shift gears now and they\u2019re \u201cRINOs.\u201d\n\nTake Trump\u2019s plan to deport 11 million people living in the US illegally or build the planned Trump Taj MaWall. As John Kasich has futilely tried to explain in debate after debate, whatever the rights and wrongs of it, this is simply never going to happen. Such an effort would be more on the order of a post-War World II population transfer than anything remotely like a conventional immigration enforcement action, costing probably hundreds of billions of dollars and perhaps even constituting something approaching a war crime. As for the Wall, of course, in the real world net immigration across the US-Mexico has actually gone into reverse in recent years. More are leaving than coming. But in the Republican/Fox news world, hordes of feral Mexicans are still streaming across the Southern border \u2013 them and a layering of ISIS death squads who fly from Ankara to Belize and then walk to the Arizona border.\n\nBut this is just the hate and nonsense debt coming due from 2013. You can either let the status quo go on or you can devise a way to regularize at least the majority of people who are here illegally. There\u2019s no other option. Unless you just want to say \u2018No Amnesty\u2019 and pretend the problem will go away with \u2018self-deportation\u2019 or some other such nonsense. And that of course is precisely what Republican congressional leaders did. All Trump did was say openly, clearly, more coherently what Republicans were already saying themselves, while saying out of the sides of their mouths that somehow they\u2019d get to the mass deportation later.\n\nThe truth is virtually Trump\u2019s entire campaign is built on stuff just like this, whether it\u2019s about mass deportation, race, the persecution of Christians, Obamacare, the coming debt crisis and a million other things. At the last debate, Trump got pressed on his completely ludicrous tax cut plan. He eventually said growth (which if you calculate it would need to be something like 20% on average) would take care of the huge budget shortfall created by his tax plan. But Republicans can\u2019t really dispute this point since all of Republican campaign economics is based on precisely the same argument. What about Obamacare? Can Marco \u201cEstablishment\u201d Rubio really get traction attacking Trump for having no specific plan to replace Obamacare when Republicans have spent the last five years repeatedly voting to repeal Obamacare without ever specifying a plan to replace it with? On each of these fronts, the slow accumulation of nonsense and paranoia \u2013 \u2018debt\u2019 to use our metaphor \u2013 built into a massive trap door under the notional GOP leadership with a lever that a canny huckster like Trump could come in and pull pretty much whenever. This is the downside of building party identity around a package of calculated nonsense and comically unrealizable goals.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "Josh Marshall explains on Talking Points Memo.
