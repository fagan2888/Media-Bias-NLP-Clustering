The weaker of the two rates will be a free float based on an existing system that currently sells dollars at around 200 bolivars, Maduro said.\n\nCritics immediately questioned the latter claim, noting that the government has repeatedly announced \"free-floating\" systems that withered away precisely because authorities never allowed them to be determined by demand.\n\nThe price of premium gasoline will rise by 1,329 percent, but fuel is so heavily subsidized that fueling a small car will still cost about half the price of a soft drink, or about $0.23 based on the black market exchange rate.\n\n\"The devaluation from 6.3 to 10 will not have a relevant impact,\" wrote economist and pollster Luis Vicente Leon on Twitter. \"With respect to the gasoline, the only way to consolidate is to adjust (the price) regularly, otherwise it will be pulverized by inflation.\"\n\nCritics say the only solution to Venezuela's economic problems is to entirely dismantle the 13-year-old currency system created during the government of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.\n\n(Additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer, Corina Pons, Eyanir Chinea and Diego Ore; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio and Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday devalued the curr", "title": "Venezuela raises fuel price, devalues bolivar amid crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/17/Venezuela-raises-fuel-price-devalues-bolivar-amid-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-economy_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/17/Venezuela-raises-fuel-price-devalues-bolivar-amid-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-economy_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday devalued the curr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"With respect to the gasoline, the only way to consolidate is to adjust (the price) regularly, otherwise it will be pulverized by inflation.\"\n(Additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer, Corina Pons, Eyanir Chinea and Diego Ore; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio and Andrew Hay)\n\"The devaluation from 6.3 to 10 will not have a relevant impact,\" wrote economist and pollster Luis Vicente Leon on Twitter.\nCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday devalued the currency and raised heavily subsidized fuel prices in an effort to stem a widening economic crisis, though critics of the socialist leader quickly dismissed the moves as insufficient.\nCritics say the only solution to Venezuela's economic problems is to entirely dismantle the 13-year-old currency system created during the government of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez."}
