A man jailed in connection to a deadly Christmas-morning crash in Montbello slurred his words and reeked of alcohol and marijuana when Denver officers arrested him, according to a police report released Thursday.

Johnny Cephus Gilbert, 37, faces charges including vehicular homicide and assault in the crash, in which Dora Gaytan-Esparza, 35, was killed and three of her family members were injured.

Among them was a 6-year-old girl, Daniela Medina-Gaytan, who police said suffered skull fractures and other serious injuries.

The crash happened just after midnight at East 51st Avenue and Peoria Street when Gilbert failed to stop at a red light and struck Gaytan-Esparza’s car. He got out of the wrecked vehicle and ran from the scene, but officers found him within 15 minutes in the 4900 block of Scranton Street, where witnesses identified him as the suspect, police said.

An officer wrote in the report that Gilbert mumbled and stammered, and had poor balance and bloodshot eyes while having his blood drawn at Denver Health Medical Center. He told police he suffered a back injury in the crash.

A judge on Thursday held Gilbert, of Park Hill, in the Downtown Denver Detention Center on $50,000 bond.

The crash was Gilbert’s latest interaction with police, court records show. He has a criminal history that spans nearly a decade, including a 1996 arrest by Aurora police for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, first-degree assault and criminal conspiracy.

Court records show he was sentenced to 10 years in state prison stemming from those charges.

In 2004, he was cited in Denver for driving under restraint and a series of other traffic offenses that were later dismissed.
