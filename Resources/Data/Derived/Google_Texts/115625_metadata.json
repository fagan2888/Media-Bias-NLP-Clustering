In a survey released Wednesday, United Benefit Advisors said the tax could affect 74% of employers by 2022, with even the lowest quality \u201cbronze-level\u201d plans on the ACA exchanges at risk of triggering the levy.\n\n\u201cWhen the law was created, it was assumed that only three percent of plans would trigger the Cadillac tax, and it was marketed as a tax on \u2018the rich benefits of executives,\u2019\u201d UBA chief executive Les McPhearson said in a news release. \u201cThe reality is that this tax will weigh heavily on a majority of American businesses that can\u2019t afford it and will have to make severe cuts to stay above water.\u201d\n\nUsing a 6% rate or \u201ctrend\u201d increase, compounded each year, UBA found that by 2018, 30% of employers will be subject to the Cadillac tax; by 2020, 50%; and by 2022 the tax will hit 73.79% of employers.\n\n\u201cMany of these employers, even after reducing benefits and premiums, will still not be able to lower their annual costs under the Cadillac tax thresholds,\u201d said Carol Taylor, chairwoman of the UBA Client Compliance Solutions Committee.\n\n\u201cThe Cadillac tax hits those employers with an aging workforce, those with high claims and those in areas with high medical care costs,\u201d she added. \u201cThey should be strategizing now, however, to mitigate liabilities as much as possible.\u201d\n\nRepeal or delay of the Cadillac tax is being considered in the current congressional negotiations over a government funding package. An earlier analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the tax will hit 26% of employers in 2018, jumping to 42% over the next decade.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for changes to the law that could make it affect fewer businesses, but unless employers start planning now for the changes coming January 1, 2018, they could face devastating cost increases,\u201d McPhearson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rather than applying only to the most generous health plans, a survey says the tax will \"weigh heavily\" on most businesses.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"74% of Employers Exposed to 'Cadillac Tax'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-care\\/2015\\/12\\/74-employers-exposed-cadillac-tax\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-09 16:45:32\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-09 16:55:27\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":465651,\"author_id\":\"15056\",\"author_name\":\"Katie Kuehner-Hebert\",\"author_display_name\":\"Katie Kuehner-Hebert\",\"tags\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Aggregation\",\"Cadillac tax\",\"Employer Health Care\",\"Health insurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Employee Benefits and Compensation\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Health Care\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":null}", "author": "Katie Kuehner-Hebert", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Rather than applying only to the most generous health plans, a survey says the tax will \"weigh heavily\" on most businesses.", "title": "74% of Employers Exposed to 'Cadillac Tax'", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-12-09T16:55:27+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-care/2015/12/74-employers-exposed-cadillac-tax/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Rather than applying only to the most generous health plans, a survey says the tax will \"weigh heavily\" on most businesses.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "74% of Employers Exposed to 'Cadillac Tax'", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Care", "headline": "74% of Employers Exposed to 'Cadillac Tax'", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20151209, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "United Benefit Advisors", "published_time": "2015-12-09T16:45:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-09T16:55:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, aggregation, cadillac tax, employer health care, health insurance, patient protection and affordable care act, united benefit advisors"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Cadillac tax hits those employers with an aging workforce, those with high claims and those in areas with high medical care costs,\u201d she added.\nA new survey challenges the conventional wisdom that only especially generous employer health plans would be subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2018s \u201cCadillac tax\u201d provision.\nRather than applying only to the most generous health plans, a survey says the tax will \"weigh heavily\" on most businesses.\n\u201cThey should be strategizing now, however, to mitigate liabilities as much as possible.\u201dRepeal or delay of the Cadillac tax is being considered in the current congressional negotiations over a government funding package.\nAn earlier analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the tax will hit 26% of employers in 2018, jumping to 42% over the next decade."}
