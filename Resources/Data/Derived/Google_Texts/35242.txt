Troy Tulowitzki, as captain of the National League’s home run derby team for next week’s All-Star Game in Minnesota, is in charge of picking four other sluggers for the team.

And he’s on the end of a hard lobbying effort from other players.

“Hopefully everybody is happy,” Tulowitzki said of his looming final decision.

Tulowitzki said he will announce that team on Tuesday. In the meantime, his phone is blowing up with text messages — many from players lobbying for their teammates to get on the team, he said.

Tulo has mentioned that Miami’s Giancarlo Stanton is all but on the team. And he’s hinted the Yasiel Puig is a top candidate. Tulo and Puig were chatting Sunday after a series finale between the Rockies and Dodgers at Coors Field.

Tulowitzki also said he will use the derby to honor Yankees veteran Derek Jeter, his fellow AL counterpart captain in the All-Star Game. Jeter, playing in his final season, is a player Tulowitzki has said he long looked up to.

“There’s a charity that we get to pick, meaning the captain, with the gold home run balls,” Tulowitzki said. “And the charity I’m picking is actually the Turn 2 Foundation, which is the charity he’s been running for a long time. That’s a kind of tribute that I’m gonna do for him.

“But in return, I’m looking for something from the game from him, as a fan. Whatever it may be.”
