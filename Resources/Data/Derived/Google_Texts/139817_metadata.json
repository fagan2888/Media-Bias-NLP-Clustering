He couldn't help but ask his Denver friends what it meant. Turns out, 710 backwards and upside spells OIL, which is a reference to marijuana oil.\n\n\"You can take one hit and you will be as high as if you had taken a couple of bowl hits of marijuana,\" said Dickens, who lives in Washington DC. \"It's a cleaner, purer high but you can build tolerance and become accustomed to it.\"\n\nDickens has been smoking marijuana oil for nearly 18 months.\n\nAlso See: Cooking With Cannabis -- 8 Delicious Marijuana Recipes\n\n\"My friends in Denver and I are completely converted,\" Dickens told MainStreet. \"I prefer 710 over the flowers.\"\n\nUnlike in Denver, recreational use is not yet legal in the capitol city and when Dickens buys oil on the street, he pays $40 to $80 a gram. That's more than double the price for street marijuana, which is an estimated $20 a gram.\n\n\"The head rush is more intense, immediate and instant,\" said the 28-year-old music promoter. \"It feels like I'm smoking marijuana for the first time.\"\n\nThe use of marijuana oil has come under fire in Colorado, literally this year, after a rise in explosions and injuries from pot users trying to extract oil from marijuana at home.\n\nIn the first five months of 2014, fire departments across the state reported more than 30 oil explosions.\n\n\"Rather than butane, we use a CO2 extractor,\" said GFarmaLabs CEO Ata Gonzalez, who launched a line of marijuana oil called Liquid Gold in November 2013. \"We put no additives or cuts in it.\"\n\nButane is a highly flammable solvent that when passed through a tube filled with marijuana flower, crystallizes the resins. As the butane-tainted resins exit the tube, the solvent is collected in a glass cup.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "The use of marijuana oil has come under fire in Colorado, literally this year, after a rise in explosions and injuries from pot users trying to extract oil from marijuana at home.", "author": "Juliette Fairley", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "The use of marijuana oil has come under fire in Colorado, literally this year, after a rise in explosions and injuries from pot users trying to extract oil from marijuana at home.", "title": "Controversial Marijuana Oil Use on the Rise", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/controversial-marijuana-oil-use-rise", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "personal finance, marijuana oil, cannabis oil, pot, weed, colorado marijuana oil, gfarmalabs", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "gfarmalabs", "published_time": "2014-07-14T15:24Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1598405"}, "date": "2014-07-14T15:24Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 12864106, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/controversial-marijuana-oil-use-rise", "site": "@mainstr", "description": "The use of marijuana oil has come under fire in Colorado, literally this year, after a rise in explosions and injuries from pot users trying to extract oil from marijuana at home.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Controversial Marijuana Oil Use on the Rise"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "personal finance, marijuana oil, cannabis oil, pot, weed, colorado marijuana oil, gfarmalabs"}, "article_summary": "The use of marijuana oil has come under fire in Colorado, literally this year, after a rise in explosions and injuries from pot users trying to extract oil from marijuana at home.\nTurns out, 710 backwards and upside spells OIL, which is a reference to marijuana oil.\nDickens has been smoking marijuana oil for nearly 18 months.\n\"Rather than butane, we use a CO2 extractor,\" said GFarmaLabs CEO Ata Gonzalez, who launched a line of marijuana oil called Liquid Gold in November 2013.\nThat's more than double the price for street marijuana, which is an estimated $20 a gram."}
