Forbes Picks Up Photo-Sharing App Camerama

The acqui-hire brings Camerama founder Salah Akram Zalatimo to Forbes as VP of mobile products

Forbes Media has acquired photo-sharing application Camerama for an undisclosed amount.

The acqui-hire adds Camerama's founder, Salah Akram Zalatimo, to Forbes as vice president of mobile products, where he will focus on building the media brand's mobile strategy. Zalatimo founded the photo-sharing app, which is available on iOS and Android operating systems, in 2014.

Forbes is not running the Camerama photo sharing app. Were using the underlying technology of this for future Forbes apps," says Forbes chief product officer Lewis D'vorkin.

Other recent startup acquisitions include Sega Networks purchase of a majority stake in video-game developer Ignited Artists in February, and Twitter Inc.'s (Nasdaq: TWTR) deal for ZipDial Mobile Solutions, an Indian marketing company , in January.

Photo-related businesses have also generated their share of M&A activity. In January, Adobe closed a deal for Fotolia, and before that, in November, Shutterfly bought GrooveBook.

Acqui-hiring is often the motive for startup acquisitions, a strategy we've seen from companies like Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO). For more on acqui-hiring, see PE Networking Habits Spark Reverse Acqui-Hiring.
