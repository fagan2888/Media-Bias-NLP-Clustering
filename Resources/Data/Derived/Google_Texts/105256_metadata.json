In addition, the transitioning process can take years, and some transgender people forgo reassignment surgery because of cost or other reasons.\n\nAs a result, they might still need annual mammograms or pap smears even if they are transitioning to men, or prostate exams if they are transitioning to women\u2014not to mention treatment for problems typically regarded as gender-specific. Those could range from sexually transmitted diseases to life-threatening illnesses such as cancer.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you have insurance and you\u2019re still being denied basic care is outrageous,\u201d Maril said. She noted that before the health law, many insurance companies had exclusions barring transition-related care or care to transgender people in general, citing it as a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nUnder the federal health law, insurance companies selling policies in the individual or small group markets cannot deny coverage to transgender people or to those who are in the process of transitioning their sex. In addition, the administration released guidance in May telling insurers that they cannot deny coverage of sex-specific preventive services to transgender people. But advocates say that has not always happened in practice.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said plans are complying with the law.\n\n\u201cHealth plans want to make sure patients have access to the care they need, and this latest guidance was aligned with those efforts. Plans do cover medically necessary care and preventive services for transgender individuals,\u201d said Clare Krusing of AHIP.\n\nUnited HealthCare and Cigna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kaiser Permanente, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Health News, said it has a process to address denials based on gender. Aetna said it has a process to cover these claims and is working to delink services from gender identification.\n\nThe challenges with insurers lead some transgender people to forgo an insurance plan altogether or to stick to their birth gender on their insurance ID cards.\n\nEli Strong started transitioning from female to male before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, while he lived in Washington, D.C., and had employer-based coverage. In 2008, he changed all his legal identification to male but kept his health insurance ID as female because he had not yet gotten a hysterectomy. He didn\u2019t want to have to fight his insurer over a gynecological exam.\n\n\u201cI was afraid that my insurance company wouldn\u2019t cover annual exams or anything having to do with organs that insurance companies deemed as non-male,\u201d Strong said. \u201cI resented having to keep my insurance marker as female because the way I saw it, that simple marker shouldn\u2019t determine what coverage I received. What should determine my coverage is whatever organs I currently have, or conditions I am diagnosed with.\u201d\n\nStrong finally changed his insurance ID to male in 2014 after having a hysterectomy. But some of his transgender friends have not had as easy a time navigating the system. Others, he said, changed their insurance IDs to their new gender and contacted their insurance companies after a claim was denied to explain their transgender status, with limited success.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Strong said that before his hysterectomy, \u201cI put off having annual [gynecological] exams\u2026because it was also so incredibly uncomfortable to be a bearded man in a gynecologist\u2019s office.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost transgender men still have a cervix, so they need a pap smear, so you have to create an environment where they feel comfortable talking about themselves,\u201d said Harvey Makadon, director of professional education and training at Fenway Community Health, a LGBT health center in Boston.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance industry argues the responsibility for clarifying health service needs should fall to the health care provider, arguing that the doctor can explain the patient is transgender in the notes section of a submitted claim.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t always work, says Dru Levasseur of the Transgender Rights Project at Lambda Legal. Most insurance billing systems are automated, and reproductive services like mammograms and prostate exams are flagged with a corresponding \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale.\u201d\n\nLevasseur says the service is denied automatically if the gender and service don\u2019t match. To allow payment, he and others say, an insurer could put a hold on the claim, verify it with the health care provider, and then manually override the code. \u201cThe onus should be on the insurance companies,\u201d Levasseur said.\n\nMedicare already has codes that allow providers to identify as transgender the person getting, say, a pap smear or a mammogram, which allows the claim to be processed, according to the AAPC, a trade group representing physician-based medical coders. Transgender advocates and the AAPC say the same can be done with private insurers.\n\nBut the gendered service claims system is there for a reason, and changing it is not as easy as flipping a switch, said Andrew Naugle, a consultant at actuarial firm Milliman. The system, he explained, is part of quality control mechanisms meant to filter out treatments that shouldn\u2019t happen, like a child being prescribed a drug not deemed safe for that age group.\n\nThough there\u2019s no reliable data quantifying the relationship between the coding issues and denials, said Sarah MacCarthy, a RAND Corporation health researcher, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it\u2019s challenging to access services, and if even if they are accessed, they continue to be of low quality.\u201d Some plans and providers say they are committed to changing that.\n\nDeborah Espinal, executive director of health plan policy at Kaiser Permanente, said her organization is intent on removing barriers to care. \u201cWe see many patients in transition that have a need for preventive services that cross genders, and we work to ensure that KP is both socially and medically sensitive to our transgender members before, during, and after their transition,\u201d Espinal said.\n\nAdvocates say their goal is to add new categories, such as \u201dtransgender man\u201d or \u201ctransgender woman,\u201d to insurance application forms, as well as to research, to get a more accurate picture of the number of transgender people, how many are denied coverage, and how these denials affect health outcomes.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "LGBT Issues, Obamacare, Health, transgender, health care", "publicationDate": 201507200500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "description": "The health law requires insurance companies not to deny coverage based on gender, but advocates say enrollees are still being turned down for services for that very reason.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamacares Failed Transgender Promise", "tags": "obsessional:lgbt-issues,Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:lifestyle/health,transgender,entity:industryterm/health_care", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare\u2019s Failed Transgender Promise\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47912282.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-20T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Kaiser Health News\",\"tags\":[\"lgbt-issues\",\"Industryterm\",\"health\",\"transgender\",\"health_care\"]}", "news_keywords": "LGBT Issues, Obamacare, Health, transgender, health care", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"section": "health", "published_time": "2015-07-20T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kaiser-health-newshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The health law requires insurance companies not to deny coverage based on gender, but advocates say enrollees are still being turned down for services for that very reason.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Failed Transgender Promise", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/20/obamacare-s-failed-transgender-promise/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1437368465625.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/k/kaiser-health-news", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said plans are complying with the law.\nWe will not share your email with anyone for any reasonInsurance difficulties can create additional anxiety for people already fearful about seeking health care.\n\u201cI was afraid that my insurance company wouldn\u2019t cover annual exams or anything having to do with organs that insurance companies deemed as non-male,\u201d Strong said.\nIn addition, the administration released guidance in May telling insurers that they cannot deny coverage of sex-specific preventive services to transgender people.\nIn 2008, he changed all his legal identification to male but kept his health insurance ID as female because he had not yet gotten a hysterectomy."}
