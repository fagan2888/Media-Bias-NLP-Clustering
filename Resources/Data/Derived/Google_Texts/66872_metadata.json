Bernie Sanders continued to take aim at his rivals in both parties Sunday as he campaigned in New York ahead of a key primary on April 19. He continued to focus on his differences between himself and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, including her support for the Iraq war. \"She voted for that war, the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country.\" Sanders also took aim across the aisle, telling supporters \"There is concern that Donald Trump might become President of the United States. It ain't going to happen.\" \"The American people will not elect a candidate who every day insults Latinos, and Mexicans; who insults Muslims, and Islam; who insults women, who insults African Americans,\" Sanders said. Clinton represented New York as a U.S. senator and considers the state her home turf. Recent polls have shown Clinton more than 10 points ahead in the state. Tension between the two candidates flared earlier this week in a party race that has typically focused on policies and not personal attacks. The candidates dialed back their criticism of one another on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "video", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~50X50/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/g/r/o/0/uiw3/reuters04?videoId=117692820", "sailthru.author": "Thomson Reuters", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders takes aim at his rivals in both parties Sunday as he campaigns in New York ahead of a key primary April 19.
