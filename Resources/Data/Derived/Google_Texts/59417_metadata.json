More than 800 kits that had been neglected were tested, dormant complaints were reopened and the reforms seemed to have done what they were supposed to do.\n\nBut, as the Times-Picayune reported Friday, the change didn\u2019t last very long, and the police department\u2019s special victims unit has allowed its rape kit backlog to reach into the hundreds. According to Noel, who has been brought in again to oversee a sex crimes task force, the unit has more than 400 unprocessed kits on its shelves.\n\nThis is only the latest in a series of damning revelations about the unit. An inquiry led by the city\u2019s inspector general found that five detectives had failed to properly document and investigate more than 1,000 cases of child sexual abuse and rape between 2011 and 2013.\n\nIn one case, a 2-year-old who was believed to be a victim of sexual assault was brought to the emergency room and found to have a sexually transmitted disease. But there was no investigation. The same detective closed another case of an alleged sexual assault of a juvenile, disregarding a forensic interview report noting that it had found that a sex offender \u201cwas living in the same house with the juvenile.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a federal investigation and a series of 2011 reforms, old abuses and failures have NOPD back under scrutiny", "title": "\u201cWe don\u2019t trust you to investigate yourself\u201d: New Orleans rape kit backlog raises questions about limits of police \u201creform\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a federal investigation and a series of 2011 reforms, old abuses and failures have NOPD back under scrutiny", "title": "\u201cWe don\u2019t trust you to investigate yourself\u201d: New Orleans rape kit backlog raises questions about limits of police \u201creform\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/19/we_dont_trust_you_to_investigate_yourself_new_orleans_rape_kit_backlog_raises_questions_about_limits_of_police_reform/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/berkeley_police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a federal investigation and a series of 2011 reforms, old abuses and failures have NOPD back under scrutiny", "title": "\u201cWe don\u2019t trust you to investigate yourself\u201d: New Orleans rape kit backlog raises questions about limits of police \u201creform\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/berkeley_police.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Child abuse, New Orleans, police misconduct, police violence, Rape, rape kit, rape kit backlog, Sex abuse, Sexual assault, sexual violence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2106\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Child abuse, New Orleans, police misconduct, police violence, Rape, rape kit, rape kit backlog, Sex abuse, Sexual assault, sexual violence, Politics NewsIn 2010 and 2011, while the federal government investigated the New Orleans Police Department for its handling of rape cases, a police supervisor named Paul Noel led the department in a process to address its rape kit backlog.\nBut, as the Times-Picayune reported Friday, the change didn\u2019t last very long, and the police department\u2019s special victims unit has allowed its rape kit backlog to reach into the hundreds.\nIn one case, a 2-year-old who was believed to be a victim of sexual assault was brought to the emergency room and found to have a sexually transmitted disease.\nAn inquiry led by the city\u2019s inspector general found that five detectives had failed to properly document and investigate more than 1,000 cases of child sexual abuse and rape between 2011 and 2013.\nThe same detective closed another case of an alleged sexual assault of a juvenile, disregarding a forensic interview report noting that it had found that a sex offender \u201cwas living in the same house with the juvenile.\u201d"}
