Rosica\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 As Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford departs the political scene, he sounds like a man focused more on now than later.\n\nWeatherford, a 34-year-old Wesley Chapel Republican, faces term limits after eight years as a state representative, the last two as speaker.\n\nOver that time, he and wife, Courtney, also had four children, with the most recent addition to the family \u2014 son William Winston \u2014 arriving earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone from reading bill analyses at night to reading Dr. Seuss with my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from the challenges of the political process to changing dirty diapers.\u201d\n\nHe will hand the gavel to Speaker-designate Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, this November.\n\nWeatherford said he doesn\u2019t know the answer to the obvious question: How long will it be before his name is back on a Florida ballot?\n\n\u201cI would definitely never rule that out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would say I\u2019m catching my breath and I\u2019m going to enjoy family life and focus on the private sector more.\u201d\n\nHis rest may be short.\n\n\u201cI expect to host a fundraiser for Will Weatherford for governor or U.S. senator sometime in the next five years,\u201d said Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville.\n\n\u201cWill Weatherford is the future of Florida,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cHe will be, if he wants to be, very significant on the Florida political landscape for the next 30 years.\u201d\n\nIn many respects, Weatherford has lived a charmed political life.\n\nHis father-in-law is Allen Bense, a Republican former state representative from Panama City who preceded him as speaker in 2004-06. Bense chairs the Florida State University trustees, who Tuesday named state Sen. John Thrasher president of FSU.\n\nWeatherford has seen almost all of his legislative goals fulfilled, including overhauls of campaign finance, ethics and elections law, and expanding access to school vouchers.\n\nThat\u2019s because he had a willing partner in Gaetz. The men presented a united policy front for the two sessions over which they presided.\n\n\u201cWith most presidents and most speakers, when their two years are up, you\u2019re lucky if they\u2019re still talking to each other,\u201d Weatherford said. \u201cDon Gaetz and I are better friends now than when we started two years ago.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship stands in contrast to that of their immediate predecessors, Senate President Mike Haridopolos and House Speaker Dean Cannon, who presided over the \u201cmidnight meltdown\u201d of 2011.\n\nBoth chambers were at an impasse over competing priorities, including tax breaks and claim bills, and adjourned separately late into the night without the traditional joint \u201chanky drop\u201d that marks the end of a legislative session.\n\nBut Weatherford, stymied by others in the Senate, lost an effort to close the state pension fund to new employees and shift them to a 401(k)-style retirement plan.\n\nDespite the relative strength of the Florida Retirement System, Weatherford has long complained of the millions of dollars still needed to shore up the fund each year.\n\nFor many, though, his legacy will be as the man who said \u2018no\u2019 to Medicaid expansion.\n\nTwo years in a row, Weatherford successfully blocked the state from taking federal money under the Affordable Care Act to insure about 1 million Floridians \u2014 those still considered poor but making enough to put them over the poverty line.\n\nWeatherford and House Republicans said they didn\u2019t trust federal officials to follow through, and bucked Gov. Rick Scott, Senate Republicans, progressives, and business, medical and labor groups, all of whom favored some form of Medicaid expansion.\n\nWeatherford offered an alternative House plan to cover about 115,000 residents using more than $200 million in state money. That was rejected by the Senate.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe there is a way to provide free-market health care to the citizens of Florida who are in the greatest need,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one is refuting that there are people who live within our state who have a need for health care and currently do not have access to it,\u201d Weatherford said. \u201cBut to just put them on Medicaid, by the millions across the country, and claim that you\u2019re solving the health care challenges of our citizens, is false.\n\n\u201cThat is not a true solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a government solution that will not lead to better health outcomes.\u201d\n\nKaren Woodall, executive director of the progressive Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, is puzzled by Weatherford.\n\nHe was so entrenched against Medicaid expansion, she said, but he championed passage of in-state tuition for immigrant students who are in the country illegally \u2014 something many Republicans still oppose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical to me that he stood so firm against expanding coverage for thousands of Floridians, yet also did something heroic and correct that he\u2019s not going to get a lot of kudos from his party,\u201d Woodall said.\n\nIn the past few months, Weatherford also has launched a political action committee, seeded with $425,000 from the Republican Party of Florida, and has given to several GOP legislative candidates running this year.\n\nIn turn, through the Committee for a Stronger Florida, Weatherford has disbursed $1,000 each to the campaigns for Scott, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Attorney General Pam Bondi, all incumbent Republicans.\n\nCampaign finance records show his committee also has passed through $10,000 to a PAC controlled by fellow Pasco County GOP Rep. Richard Corcoran, on tap to be speaker in 2017-18, and sent $5,000 to another PAC chaired by state Rep. Eddy Gonzalez, R-Hialeah.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to support Republicans and conservative Republicans across the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I do because I believe in the party. I understand how important it is to have resources to win elections. We help our friends, people who share our values and our world view.\u201d\n\nBut Weatherford said political fundraising is just a sideline for him. For instance, he mentioned doing \u201cbusiness development,\u201d though he didn\u2019t have specifics yet.\n\nWeatherford is private about details of his work, though he has disclosed his primary income coming from an environmental remediation company owned by Sen. Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby.\n\n\u201cWhile I have not asked him about his long-range plans, it is my hope that he will continue to work for Simpson Environmental Services Inc.,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cHe is a valuable member of the team.\u201d\n\nFamily friend and Florida real estate executive Dewey Mitchell said Weatherford has had \u201ca lot of offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I mean is, a lot of people have reached out to him,\u201d said Mitchell, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Florida Properties Group. He didn\u2019t drop any names, however.\n\n\u201cHe will be successful at whatever he decides to do,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe he doesn\u2019t have a very good political future ahead of him.\u201d\n\nWeatherford was inducted last week into the Hall of Fame at Land O\u2019 Lakes High School, where he played football.\n\nWeatherford\u2019s pastor, Ken Whitten of Idlewild Baptist Church in Lutz, said \u201cGod has something in store for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too young to sit on the sidelines or pull up a rocking chair,\u201d Whitten said. \u201cI do believe he has a gift in the area of politics.\u201d\n\n__ Contact Tampa Tribune reporter James Rosica at jrosica@tampatrib.com, (850) 765-0807.
