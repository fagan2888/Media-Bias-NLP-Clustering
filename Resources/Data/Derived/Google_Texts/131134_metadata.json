If you do go to a car wash, he said you should pay for a place that washes the undercarriage.\n\nAs the temperature begins to rise, the damage will begin. Rust can eventually cause brake failure and paint damage.\n\nYet, Frazier said the problem can be prevented by waxing a vehicle. He suggests that people do this by fall, but if you have yet to do so, he said you can do it anytime. Frazier recommends that people wash off their car completely, then wax it.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you thought icy roads are a headache, car experts say there's one unfortunate reality when it comes to winter: the solution used to make roads safe can damage your car.", "language": "english", "author": "Annette Lawless -", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Road-salt-may-rust-vehicles-damage-brakes-237321831.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/429*315/snow-icy-roads-generic.gif", "type": "article", "description": "If you thought icy roads are a headache, car experts say there's one unfortunate reality when it comes to winter: the solution used to make roads safe can damage your car.", "title": "Road salt may rust vehicles, damage brakes"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "If you thought icy roads are a headache, car experts say there's one unfortunate reality when it comes to winter: the solution used to make roads safe can damage your car.", "title": "Road salt may rust vehicles, damage brakes", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Road-salt-may-rust-vehicles-damage-brakes-237321831.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/snow-icy-roads-generic.gif", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Road salt may rust vehicles, damage brakes", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Road salt may rust vehicles"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe34b4\"", "article_summary": "If you do go to a car wash, he said you should pay for a place that washes the undercarriage.\n\"Even though you're getting right back on the road, you still want to get that big layer of salt off, so you know, it doesn't hurt your vehicle,\" Frazier said.\nFrazier recommends that people wash off their car -- either a professional facility or at home -- the day after a storm hits.\n\"When the salt and ice melt, it gets on to bare metal and helps the corrosion process faster,\" said Ricky Frazier, manager of Zips Car Wash in Wichita.\nFrazier recommends that people wash off their car completely, then wax it."}
