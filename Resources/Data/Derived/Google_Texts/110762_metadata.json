But few expected the smartphone to be the instrument that made civil rights, racial discrimination and police brutality a new rallying cry for justice in the 21st century.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, a grainy black and white video showed five LAPD officers beating Rodney King, a black man who had been speeding on the Foothill Freeway. After giving chase, they cornered him and tried to arrest him. King resisted and was beaten quite mercilessly with batons.\n\nThe L.A. police were taught not to pull their weapons lest a perpertrator grab a gun and use it against them. Today, after two dramatic police shootings of apparently unarmed black men, according to video taken by smartphones, rules from 1991 do not seem to apply.\n\nSeveral years ago, when the Internet was becoming omnipresent, the meme that circulated among the chattering classes was citizen journalism. Today, that meme has become reality \u2014 and with the killing of Walter Scott, we're seeing the power of citizen journalists, armed with smartphone cameras, to change the public debate.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With 1.4 billion smar", "title": "Why Cops Who Shoot People in the Back Will Always Get Caught", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/Why-Cops-Who-Shoot-People-Back-Will-Always-Get-Caught", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Walter%20Scott%20shooting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/Why-Cops-Who-Shoot-People-Back-Will-Always-Get-Caught", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Walter%20Scott%20shooting.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With 1.4 billion smar", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1355\"", "article_summary": "Several years ago, when the Internet was becoming omnipresent, the meme that circulated among the chattering classes was citizen journalism.\nTwenty-four years ago, a grainy black and white video showed five LAPD officers beating Rodney King, a black man who had been speeding on the Foothill Freeway.\nToday, after two dramatic police shootings of apparently unarmed black men, according to video taken by smartphones, rules from 1991 do not seem to apply.\nThe L.A. police were taught not to pull their weapons lest a perpertrator grab a gun and use it against them.\nBut few expected the smartphone to be the instrument that made civil rights, racial discrimination and police brutality a new rallying cry for justice in the 21st century."}
