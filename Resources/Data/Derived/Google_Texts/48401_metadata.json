So what makes anyone believe that war would be any different?\n\nThis week the president okayed airstrikes against ISIS targets\u2014allying us with Assad Bashar, possibly Iran and definitely Qatar\u2014using an unrelated 13-year old AUMF as his legal mandate. Seems like a big deal. It might even be a good idea. Yet, even though Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, informed the Senate that ground troops could be needed to finish the job, whatever that job may be, the president didn\u2019t bother to ask for permission.\n\nAnd really, why should he? With the midterms approaching, most elected Democrats have remained vigilantly quiet or tepidly supportive, and the once-vibrant anti-war movement has all but withered away. (We look forward to its miraculous rebirth when, or if, a GOP administration ever comes back to power.) It should be noted, of course, that there are voices on the Left expressing apprehension about the legality and aims of the mission. The problem is that most often these are the same voices\u2014from The New York Times editorial board to Joan Walsh\u2014that have been justifying every unilateral executive action this administration takes or threatens to take. Their sudden reverence for process and constitutionality is about as credible as John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit to stop executive abuse.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because the Boehner who supports air strikes, with the \u201cunderstanding that this is just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat this terrorist organization,\u201d is the same Boehner who brought a Republican suit against Obama for exceeding his constitutional authority by making unilateral changes to Obamacare. Whereas Boehner\u2019s lawsuit once seemed like a somewhat worthy political stunt that might help highlight some of the lawlessness of the administration, now it seems completely hollow and pointless.\n\nObama must feel more emboldened than ever in following through on his happy authoritarian talk. If war isn\u2019t worth a vote, what is? This week, the Treasury Department went ahead and offered new \u201cguidance\u201d on inversions, putting American companies on notice. Any deals corporations enter into after this week will be subject to a bunch of new tax rules in the future. \u201cFor some companies considering deals, today\u2019s actions may mean that those transactions no longer make economic sense,\u201d lectured Treasury Secretary Jack Lew (a guy who received a $940,000 bonus from Citigroup in early 2009 as the bank was getting $45 billion in bailout funds from taxpayers.)\n\nWell, yeah. But let\u2019s think about this for a moment.\n\nThe executive branch will be \u201ccracking down\u201d\u2014that\u2019s how most media outlets correctly put it\u2014on tax maneuvers that are legal. Democrats tend to be annoyed by the fact that corporations shield their profits, and because the issue has political potency the White House will retroactively and unilaterally issue legislation masquerading as rules. This would be the equivalent of a Republican administration \u201ccracking down\u201d on solar panel companies for using subsidizes because conservatives don\u2019t like the practice.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unfortunate that a modern administration peddles archaic protectionism for political gain\u2014one of the new rules will make it nearly impossible for a smaller foreign company to take over a larger U.S. company\u2014the issue is hardly a pressing matter. Certainly when it comes to more serious matters like immigration, Obama has no compunction threatening executive action. Here\u2019s what Joe Biden had to say on Tuesday at the Hispanic Heritage Month reception:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not offering any false hope about what they\u2019ll do between now and the election, but \u2026 I can tell you, when this election [is] over in the lame-duck session, they may see the Lord. It is possible. But if they don\u2019t, they will see some lightning,\u2019 Biden said on Monday at the fifth Hispanic Heritage month reception, according to White House press pool reports.\n\nDo what we say or we\u2019ll do what we want.\n\nIt\u2019s the same on climate change. As a way of creating leverage for this week\u2019s UN\u2019s 2014 Climate Summit, Obama signed an executive order this week that will require all government agencies to waste millions factoring in \u201cclimate-resilience considerations systematically into the U.S. government\u2019s international development work and to promote a similar approach with multilateral entities.\u201d Though counterproductive, the order is certainly within the purview of a president\u2019s power. What Obama is attempting to set up, if anyone\u2019s forgotten, is not.\n\nAs The New York Times reported:\n\nThe Obama administration is working to forge a sweeping international climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions, but without ratification from Congress.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for this agreement, to be signed at a United Nations summit meeting in 2015 in Paris, the negotiators are meeting with diplomats from other countries to broker a deal to commit some of the world\u2019s largest economies to enact laws to reduce their carbon pollution.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 07:46:37 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Left has defended the president's unilateral actions for years.
