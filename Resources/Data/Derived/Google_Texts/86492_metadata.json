It may be something as minor as the weight that registers when we step on the scale at the clinic or it may be something far more sensitive.\n\nProfessionals have long acknowledged our concern about privacy and secrecy by offering solemn promises to protect patient confidentiality. One of the strongest of such pledges is a 10-century Persian code for physicians: \"A physician should respect confidences and protect the patient's secrets. In protecting a patient's secrets, he must be more insistent than the patient himself.\"\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, which took effect in 2003, is a codification of these pledges. Nowadays there are numerous workers in health care settings who have access to information about patients, including many clerks and technicians who may not have the professional training to impress upon them the importance of protecting patient secrets. Thus, it became advisable to supplement professionalism with regulation.\n\nThe basic principle behind the rule is relatively simple: Patients' privacy and their secrets ought to be protected. However, codifying this principle into a regulation is not so simple. The final statement of the regulation and its rationale fills nearly a hundred pages of the Federal Register.\n\nIn one important way, the scope of the regulation is severely limited. Because of the underlying legislation that authorized the Department of Health and Human Services to issue this regulation, the rule applies only to health plans, health care clearinghouses and health providers who transmit information electronically. These are called \"covered entities.\" Furthermore, it applies only to information about the patient's health that would allow the individual patient to be identified. This is called \"protected health information,\" or PHI. The rule can apply indirectly to \"business associates\" of covered entities ? that is, those whose work with covered entities requires access to PHI.\n\nThere have been lots of misconceptions about the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Nothing in the rule prevents exchange of appropriate PHI among caregivers; it is only necessary that the information disclosed be limited to what is needed for the professional activities of the other caregivers and that those who receive the information promise not to reveal it outside the care context.\n\nOne provision of the rule that I find particularly interesting is that it permits patients to find out who in the health care setting has accessed their information. This should help eliminate the practice ? all too common in health care institutions ? of employees who are not directly involved in their care accessing patient records of friends and neighbors.\n\nAnd certainly nothing in the rule prevents the patient from revealing PHI to anyone they choose. And if, for example, an employer receives PHI from the patient or from a covered entity at the request of the patient, the restrictions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule do not apply to the employer. There may be other ethical principles, such as a general respect for privacy, that say that an employer ought not to reveal personal information about employees, but this is totally independent of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nMy own interest in the rule is in the area of research. Access to medical information can help researchers to improve treatment and prevent disease for others, if not for the present patients. The first level of protection is to offer researchers only data sets from which all identifying information has been removed. For much research, such \"de-identified\" data sets are all that is necessary.\n\nWhen it is essential to the research that identifying information be included, the HIPAA Privacy Rule gives the patients the final say as to whether their PHI is to be shared with researchers ? after they are given information about the proposed research, what information would be used and how it would be protected by the researchers. And that is what privacy is ultimately all about ? letting me control who knows what about me.\n\nFederal guidelines for research involving human participants are currently undergoing significant revision. The kind of safeguards included in the HIPAA Privacy Rule may be expanded to other areas of research, such as work with genetic information. Thus it is important that the misunderstandings about the rule be resolved, and the valid core of the rule be preserved.\n\nGlenn C.
