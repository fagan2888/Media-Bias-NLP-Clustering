Tweedy is a psychiatrist at Duke University, where he also attended medical school.\n\nAnd welcome to you.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY, Author, Black Man in a White Coat: Thank you.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: So, you start with this big subject. Is that what started it for you, that you wanted to write about?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.\n\nSo, race is this really highly charged political subject that we have in our society, obviously, but, for me, this is a very personal story. This is really kind of about my experience and my journey.\n\nAll too often in medical school, you learn about health problems in the black community, you learn \u2014 you hear this disease is more common than this. It\u2019s always more common in black people, but you didn\u2019t really hear why. And so it wasn\u2019t \u2014 and the question of why is a huge issue for me.\n\nAnd there was also a big question about how my experience as a young black man was different than the experiences of other people in my class.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Well, that comes through, because you\u2019re also saying that, as a young doctor in training, you\u2019re saying constantly hearing about the medical frailties of black people picked at the scab of your insecurity. You didn\u2019t set out thinking about medicine and race.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: No, I was actually attracted to medicine.\n\nIt was sort of like this \u2014 it was almost like a post-racial kind of mind-set I had. Medicine to me held it appeal to being objective, formulas, equations. And it was really \u2014 and that was appealing. So much of society is messy, and life is messy as a black person. So this \u2014 it was this appeal that it could be objective.\n\nAnd then, when I got to medical school, I kind of got a rude awakening that it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: When you refer to your insecurities, what do you mean?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: I come from Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. And it was an all-black neighborhood that I grew up in, just outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd I went to a state college. Then I got to Duke. Duke is a fancy private school. A lot of my classmates had parents who were doctors. And so I was really insecure about that.\n\nAnd as a black person, there is always a sort of thing about, is affirmative action part of why you\u2019re here, and do you really belong? And so I grappling with all those things when I first got to medical school.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: You write about a number of incidents that you witnessed in which you saw white doctors unaware of the different ways that they were treating black patients.\n\nHow much in the end did you conclude that race does a play factor in the doctor\u2019s room, in the hospital room?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: I think it plays a big factor, and often in ways that the doctor and the patient may not even be aware of.\n\nAnd there are several examples I talk about in the book. And there is one example in particular, so it comes to mind off the top of my head. This was a time when I was going to the clinic myself as a patient. So, I\u2019m coming from home. And I had injured my knee a few days earlier.\n\nAnd I\u2019m dressed very casually in sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And I come into the exam room with the doctor. And he comes in. And he never looks at me. He just looks at my knee and sort of has me stand up and down and then says, you\u2019re OK, and kind of was going to shuttle me away.\n\nAnd being a doctor, I knew that there was more that could be done or should have been done. And so I mentioned to him that I\u2019m a doctor. And then, suddenly, he looks at me, and his eyes kind of light up. And he looks at my knee. He starts to talk to me. And so he really engages in the sort of doctor-patient exchange, the way that it should have been from the beginning.\n\nAnd it was a really vivid illustration of how differently I can \u2014 perceived. On one hand, I could just be a young black man who is off the street somewhere. And who knows what negative presumptions he may have had, because he didn\u2019t engage with me at all. And then once he realizes I\u2019m a doctor, it was like a totally different experience.\n\nAnd so I think that really illustrates how differently things can play out in the exam room.\n\n\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: You became a psychiatrist.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Why?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Great question.\n\nI never thought, when I went to medical school, I would become \u2014 come to psychiatry.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: But as I got towards the end of medical school, I took this one rotation just on a flyer, and I really enjoyed it. And the patients told my supervisors that I had a way with \u2014 of relaxing people and getting them to talk to me and I had a way of connecting with people.\n\nAnd so that really made me think about psychiatry. There is also this huge issue as an African-American. And the mental health in the black community is really a big deal, because, often, black people will be resistant to mental health care or feel like it\u2019s something that\u2019s not for them. And there is this huge sort of stigma that we often deal with.\n\nAnd so, as a psychiatrist, I have often been one of the only few black psychiatrist. And so it\u2019s a huge deal there as well.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Well, this is something important that you have written a lot about, the dearth of the black doctors generally.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes. Yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And you\u2019re pointing to that as one of the important factors of why blacks fair so poorly in the medical system.\n\nWhy? Why is it important to have more black doctors?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.\n\nSo, African-Americans make up about 13 percent of the population, but about 4 percent of physicians. And it\u2019s like \u2014 mental health and psychiatry, it is about the same, really low numbers.\n\nAnd what you often see is that there is this issue of the patients don\u2019t trust the health care system because there has been a bad history of things that have happened in the past. And so often, as a black doctor, I\u2019m there to help sort of be a translator in a way.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: So that\u2019s why we need more black doctors.\n\nAt the same time, I saw recently the Association of American Medical Colleges, a new report that applications from African-American men have declined\u2026\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes, exactly.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: \u2026 from 1978 to recently.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Right. Exactly.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Why?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.\n\nSo, the numbers for black women have actually increased during that time.\n\nBut I think there\u2019s this bigger issue about the way society from the very top down kind of limits the horizons and the expectations of what African-American men can be. And I think that really filters down. It starts from the top and it filters down into the communities.\n\nI come from that kind of community, where the idea of being a doctor was sort of an alien concept. And it was only the \u2014 I had the good fortune of having an older brother who had gone to college and then being in a program \u2014 I tested into a program that really set \u2014 a magnet program that really set me on that path.\n\nBut there all too many young black men who don\u2019t have those opportunities. And there is talent being squandered. And so I think that is the big factor.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: I know this is a sort of personal memoir for you.\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Sure.\n\n\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Have you thought about larger questions of policy-type questions of what should be done, either in the medical profession or the wider society?\n\nDR. DAMON TWEEDY: Sure.\n\nAnd in the book, I talk about some of those. I talk about the Affordable Care Act and its \u2014 the way it\u2019s helped and the way it\u2019s been undercut by sort of the politics of all of it.\n\nI also talk about ways in which doctors and patients can be \u2014 can sort of be educated to have a better relationship, because I think that\u2019s \u2014 a huge issue in my book is about the doctor and patient relationship. And when that\u2019s frayed, that really makes a huge impact on patients. And, ultimately, the way our society is set up, often, black people are the ones who are facing the biggest consequence for that.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right.\n\nThe new book is \u201cBlack Man in a White Coat.\u201d\n\nDr. Damon Tweedy, thank you so much.\n\nDR.
