The administration insisted that this move was not a harbinger of a major deployment of combat troops in Syria.\n\nRelated: Americans Agree on Little About ISIS \u2013 Except the U.S. Is Losing the War\n\nHowever, during an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, Carter said, \u201cIf we find additional groups that are willing to fight ISIL and are capable and motivated, we\u2019ll do more.\u201d\n\nCarter was using another acronym for the murderous Islamic terrorist group that has captured wide swaths of Iraq and Syria, fomented conflict elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, and claimed responsibility for downing a Russian commercial jetliner over the Sinai Peninsula a week ago, killing all 224 passengers and crew aboard.\n\n\u201cThe president has indicated a willingness to do more [against ISIS]; I certainly am prepared to recommend he do more, but you need to have capable local forces,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to sustainable victory.\u201d\n\nCarter said that the special operations forces being deployed in Syria would provide intelligence and access to air power to help local forces, including Kurds and Syrian Arabs battling ISIS. \u201cSo this small, very elite group is intended to bring to bear all that the United States can bring to bear, in the way of intelligence, air power and so forth, to help these motivated, capable local forces.\u201d\n\nRelated: Exclusive: Investigators '90 percent sure' bomb downed Russian plane\n\n\u201cAnd this is an instance of the whole strategy,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe have to beat ISIL. We will beat ISIL. ISIL\u2019s heart is in Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nFor the past year, the administration has pursued a dubious campaign against ISIS that combined thousands of air strikes against ISIS targets with a mostly failed effort to recruit and train rebel forces in Syria to wage war with ISIS forces. Many leading Republicans and some Democrats have complained that the administration\u2019s strategy is woefully inadequate for the massive and growing challenge.\n\nA majority of Americans would support sending in more ground troops to battle ISIS, according to a recent Quinnipiac University national poll, but 66 percent believe the U.S. is currently losing the war. Moreover, U.S. allies in the Middle East and Europe that initially took part in the air strikes against ISIS have been pulling back in recent months, leaving it to the U.S. to carry the burden of the air war, according to The New York Times. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, for example, have moved most of their aircraft to focus more on their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThus far, Arab and Western allies have conducted only about five percent of the 2,700 airstrikes in Syria, compared to 30 percent of the 5,100 air strikes in Iraq, according to The Times.\n\nRelated: $42 Million for 54 Recruits: U.S. Program to Train Syrian Rebels Is a Disaster\n\nIn the wake of the Russian airline disaster that many now suspect was caused by a bomb planted by an ISIS affiliate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the suspected bombing of the Russian airline should be a \u201cwakeup call\u201d to both the U.S. and Russia for the need to join forces.\n\n\u201cI have said before and I really believe it,\u201d she said on Meet the Press yesterday. \u201cWe will fight them now or we will fight them later. It\u2019s only a question of time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid mounting criticism and public skepticism of President Obama\u2019s str", "title": "Carter Hints Sending Even More US Special Ops to Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Carter-Hints-Sending-Even-More-US-Special-Ops-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-pentagon-carter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Carter-Hints-Sending-Even-More-US-Special-Ops-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-pentagon-carter_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Amid mounting criticism and public skepticism of President Obama\u2019s str", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The administration insisted that this move was not a harbinger of a major deployment of combat troops in Syria.\n\u201cThe president has indicated a willingness to do more [against ISIS]; I certainly am prepared to recommend he do more, but you need to have capable local forces,\u201d Carter said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key to sustainable victory.\u201dCarter said that the special operations forces being deployed in Syria would provide intelligence and access to air power to help local forces, including Kurds and Syrian Arabs battling ISIS.\nAs conditions worsened in civil war torn Syria, the administration announced late last month it would deploy roughly 50 Special Operations to serve in an advisory capacity to groups battling ISIS as well as the Assad regime.\nMany leading Republicans and some Democrats have complained that the administration\u2019s strategy is woefully inadequate for the massive and growing challenge."}
