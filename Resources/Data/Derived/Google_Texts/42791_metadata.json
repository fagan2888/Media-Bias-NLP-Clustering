It also can only be used for one budget resolution each year in the Senate. Democrats actually employed budget reconciliation in 2010 to pass Obamacare.\n\nIn another bid to show how serious they are about avoiding a shutdown, the GOP-controlled House voted Thursday to allow leaders to invoke \u201cmartial law.\u201d The move lets leaders bring a spending bill aimed at avoiding a shutdown to the floor the same day it clears the House Rules Committee, skipping the usual one-day wait to do so.\n\nRelated: GOP Debate Exposes a Rift that Could Topple Boehner\n\nTogether, the actions indicate Boehner and fellow Republicans realize how little time is left on the clock before the fiscal year ends on October 1.\n\nAs the GOP gropes for a solution that appeases their right flank, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA) Democrats would sustain President Obama\u2019s veto if Republican-backed legislation to defund Planned Parenthood ever reached his desk.\n\n\u201cYes, we could sustain the veto,\u201d Pelosi said during a press briefing on Capitol Hill\n\nRepublicans should take the California Democrat at her word. In August she predicted, correctly, that House Democrats had the votes to uphold an Obama veto of a resolution against the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Bring Down Senate Republicans in 2016\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) visited the White House to strategize over how to proceed on the budget.\n\nAfter the meeting, the duo repeated their stance that Congress should pass a continuing resolution with no policy riders to keep the government\u2019s doors open and give lawmakers extra breathing room to resolve the budget standoff.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Republican leaders may have struck upon a budget maneuver that would allow them to avoid a government shutdown and cut off funds for Planned Parenthood, thereby closing a rift among rank and file members that has threated to oust Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).", "title": "Boehner May Have Found an Escape Hatch on Budget Standoff", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Boehner-May-Have-Found-Escape-Hatch-Budget-Standoff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-budget-boehner_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Boehner-May-Have-Found-Escape-Hatch-Budget-Standoff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-budget-boehner_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "House Republican leaders may have struck upon a budget maneuver that would allow them to avoid a government shutdown and cut off funds for Planned Parenthood, thereby closing a rift among rank and file members that has threated to oust Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3aa\"", "article_summary": "It also can only be used for one budget resolution each year in the Senate.\nRelated: How Trump Could Bring Down Senate Republicans in 2016Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) visited the White House to strategize over how to proceed on the budget.\nIn August she predicted, correctly, that House Democrats had the votes to uphold an Obama veto of a resolution against the Iran nuclear deal.\nReconciliation requires only a simple majority to pass the Senate, meaning Democrats can\u2019t filibuster a measure used under the tactic.\nDemocrats actually employed budget reconciliation in 2010 to pass Obamacare."}
