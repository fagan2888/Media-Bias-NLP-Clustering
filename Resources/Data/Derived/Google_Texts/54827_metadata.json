When you had them as Open Yale courses did you offer certification?\n\nA. No. We put the lectures on, and the course material. But there was none of the interactivity or on-line forum discussion that\u2019s all built into Coursera.\n\nQ. It looks as if edX is going for a kind of exclusivity in the universities that make it up, while Coursera is not doing that.\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure that edX is more exclusive than we are. Their numbers are smaller \u2014 in part because we got a bit of a head start. And there are some schools that are trying both platforms.\n\nQ. There are?\n\nA. We don\u2019t require exclusivity. We want to win by having the best technology and the best support for our partners, and we\u2019re not trying to constrain them. We recognize this is an experimental period.\n\nQ. How do you see the landscape of MOOCs \u2014 now and going forward?\n\nA. Many schools started in this because they thought they could do something to improve their on-campus experience \u2014 by using on-line lectures to give students background, and then have them come in the so-called flipped classroom and have more active engagement with the instructor.\n\nThat\u2019s a great thing. But to me that\u2019s like saying that the purpose of movies is to film theater productions. It\u2019s missing the fact that we have a new medium now. Films today don\u2019t look like film versions of stage productions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou\u2019re now talking about extended student bodies that are numbering in the hundreds of thousands potentially, for most of our partners, whereas their campuses are in the tens of thousands. And within a few years it\u2019s going to be in the millions, per school.\n\nThat\u2019s what got me interested. If this were just about the flipped classroom I wouldn\u2019t have decided to take this plunge. I see a completely new set of opportunities opening up for universities \u2014 and for individuals.\n\nQ. Doesn\u2019t edX have an advantage in being not-for-profit, meaning they don\u2019t have to worry about returning on investment so soon? Yesterday Andrew Ng said, \u201cWe\u2019ve raised $85 million, so we\u2019ve got some runway.\u201d How much runway?\n\nA. I think the principal investors in Coursera understand that this is a long term play. We\u2019re fortunate to have patient investors; and as Andrew said, we\u2019re quite adequately capitalized. I think we can become financially viable certainly within that five-year framework.\n\nQ. You\u2019re an economist. How do you get from here to there?\n\nA. Right now courses are free and we\u2019re charging for certification. We think that as the idea of using Coursera courses for professional advancement grows, the numbers seeking certificates will grow. And the price we charge probably can grow, too. A move from $50 or $60 for Signature Track to $100 is certainly imaginable. At $100 a pop, if you had two or three, or five million people. ...\n\nQ. When you start charging more, and people expect more from their certificates, won\u2019t differentiation between partners be more of a factor?\n\nA. There\u2019s no doubt that the number of student enrollments \u2014 and the capacity to produce revenue \u2014 is going to vary across our institutions.\n\nQ. Because it\u2019s very stark. You either get 10,000 people signing up for your course, or you don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA. I\u2019m not particularly worried about that. Relative to the revenue potential, the cost of producing these courses is such that I think this can be viable for most if not all of our partners.\n\nQ. How much of this is about first-mover advantage?\n\nA. Well, there are both kinds of lessons in the history of Internet companies. One is that first mover advantage can be substantial. The second lesson is that it can sometimes be overcome. Netscape [an early Web browser] didn\u2019t survive.\n\nQ. Right now your target audience is not people who want college credits. Do you think that will change?\n\nA. I think there\u2019s going to be innovation in every dimension. You\u2019re going to see some of the Coursera partners offer credit for courses. I think that\u2019s bound to happen.\n\nQ. At their own institutions?\n\nA. At their own, or accepting credits for Coursera courses taken at other institutions. We\u2019re not pushing it. In that respect we are a technology company. So that\u2019s for our partners to decide.\n\nQ. What is the partner role in corporate governance? Do they have a structural role?\n\nA. There\u2019s a university advisory board, composed of academic vice presidents or provosts from a number \u2014 I think it\u2019s 10 \u2014 of our partner institutions.\n\nQ. When you were at Yale your base pay was in excess of $1 million a year. Are you taking a pay cut to come to Coursera?\n\nA. I don\u2019t want to talk about my personal package. It\u2019s a startup.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140413120115, "twitter": {"description": "Richard C.
