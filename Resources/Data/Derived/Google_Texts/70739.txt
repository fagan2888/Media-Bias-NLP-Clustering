Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is continuing his strong early showing in Iowa, leading other candidates and potential candidates in the 2016 GOP field with 17 percent of the vote in a new poll.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were tied for second at 10 percent in the Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 9 percent apiece.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania were tied at 6 percent apiece, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 5 percent.

Mr. Walker had led with 15 percent in a poll released in January. Neither Mr. Walker nor Mr. Bush have formally declared they are running for president in 2016.

Thirty-five percent of likely caucus goers said they would never consider voting for Mr. Bush, and businessman Donald Trump was first in the “never would support” category at 58 percent.

Mr. Rubio was the voters’ top second choice, and when the survey added voters’ first and second choices, his 18 percent was second to Mr. Walker’s 27 percent.

The survey of 402 likely Republican caucus goers was taken May 25-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.
