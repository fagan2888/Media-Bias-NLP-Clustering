Schmitz, the colorful and quotable arch-conservative who represented Orange County in Washington and Sacramento from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, was asked whether he objected to Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Red China.\n\nSchmitz was the right guy to ask. A fierce critic of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Schmitz\u2019s congressional district included San Clemente, meaning that the man in the White House, a fellow Republican, was his constituent\u2014a constituent whom Schmitz had accused of \u201csurrendering to international communism.\u201d Schmitz also has a devilish wit.\n\n\u201cI have no objection to President Nixon going to China,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cI just object to his coming back.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s visit to Alaska last week evoked similar sentiments in some quarters. Couldn\u2019t he just stay up there? Part of this was envy, as the president seamlessly combined work and pleasure. He sampled salmon jerky, toured a fjord, hiked a glacier, petted Iditarod sled dogs, drew attention to melting snowcaps, and renamed a mountain. Not just any mountain, either; the highest peak in North America. One named after a U.S. president\u2014and a martyred president at that.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Alaska and visited the national park that encompasses the landmark in question. Officially, the park was called Denali, and the peak Mount McKinley\u2014at least until Obama arrived. Now they\u2019re both named Denali. Although this makes historic and cultural sense, it irks many Republicans. But they aren\u2019t the only ones who should view Obama\u2019s geographical adventurism with skepticism.\n\nFor starters, the Obama administration ruined a reasonable political compromise. The Denali-McKinley issue isn\u2019t a partisan fuss, which is rare in politics these days. It\u2019s a regional dispute, pitting Ohio Republicans vs. Alaskans of most political persuasions.\n\nIt all goes back to 1917, when Congress created Mount McKinley National Park. Or maybe the rumpus traces back to when the great mountain was first called McKinley. The year was 1896, a presidential election year, and pitted William McKinley, an Ohio Republican, against Democrat William Jennings Bryan. The big national issue then was whether the United States should remain on the gold standard, which McKinley supported, or go to a bimetal system that added silver. Bryan was a \u201cfree silver\u201d man, and his famous and fiery July 9, 1896 \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech at the Democratic convention in Chicago impassioned his party.\n\nOut in the Alaska territory, however, William A. Dickey was decidedly unimpressed. A Seattle businessman who had spent the summer exploring the Alaskan interior, he had been incommunicado for months and didn\u2019t hear about the political conventions until later. In his telling, he named the fantastic mountain he encountered after the GOP nominee immediately after hearing of McKinley\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe mountain was called McKinley for decades before Alaska became a state in 1959. In 1975, Alaska changed the mountain\u2019s name to Denali for official state use. That\u2019s what the Athabaskan people called it for centuries. This is popularly thought to mean \u201cThe Great One,\u201d though modern linguists say a better translation is simply \u201cThe High One.\u201d\n\nIn any event, 40 years ago, Alaska Gov. Jay Hammond asked the federal Board on Geographic Names to make the change nationwide. Then, as now, Ohioans balked at the slight to one of their favorite sons. The Board on Geographic Names, in turn, balked at getting in the middle of the Alaska-Ohio spat. The board, created in 1890, was reorganized in 1947 to bring order to place names, not really to solve thorny political questions.\n\nA middle ground of sorts was reached in 1980, when Congress expanded the size of the park and changed its name to Denali National Park and Preserve while retaining \u201cMount McKinley.\u201d But compromise isn\u2019t in vogue these days. The reigning ethos in Washington is: If you have power, use it. That\u2019s Obama\u2019s governing philosophy (Donald Trump\u2019s, too), so Obama\u2019s Interior Department simply proclaimed that the 1947 statute gave them the authority to change the name.\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner, who happens to be from Ohio, doesn\u2019t buy it. Neither does Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is seeking to replace Obama in the Oval Office. If he\u2019s inaugurated president in 2017, perhaps Kasich can celebrate the park\u2019s centennial by changing the name back.\n\nThat\u2019s the more serious issue here: presidential unilateralism. This episode reminds Republicans that on issues ranging from implementing Obamacare to formulating immigration policy, this president routinely ignores the wishes of Congress and the law. Unless Democrats think their party will occupy the White House forever, this precedent ought to alarm them, too.\n\nObama\u2019s Alaska machinations also reveal his unattractive habit of disparaging previous Republican administrations. In 2008, asked at his first news conference as president-elect whether he\u2019d consulted with former presidents, Obama gratuitously mocked Ronald Reagan\u2019s widow. He\u2019d spoken with all the ex-presidents \u201cthat are living,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about doing any s\u00e9ances.\u201d\n\nThis was untrue. Mrs. Reagan had consulted an astrologist after her husband was shot because she was worried about keeping him alive\u2014not attempting to talk to the dead. But people who traffic in insults (Trump comes to mind again) aren\u2019t usually concerned about accuracy.\n\nObama also claimed that when Rutherford B. Hayes encountered the telephone, he wondered who would ever want to use one. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s not on Mount Rushmore,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe\u2019s explaining why we can\u2019t do something instead of why we can do something.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s slander. Hayes never said anything of the kind about the telephone\u2014an invention he installed in the White House\u2014or any other new technology. What he actually said about the phone was \u201cThat is wonderful.\u201d\n\nObama has also taken shots at George W. Bush over Hurricane Katrina, and misquoted Abraham Lincoln, a president he professes to admire. But what did poor William McKinley ever do to merit Obama administration scorn? The answer, revealed in a White House fact sheet, was: \u201cHe never set foot in Alaska.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a curious criterion for place names. Does Obama fancy that George Washington climbed Mount Washington\u2014or that the Marquis de Lafayette ever laid eyes on nearby Mount Lafayette in New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains?\n\nSuch folly isn\u2019t limited to Democrats. Alaska native Bristol Palin criticized the Mount McKinley name change on the grounds that Obama should instead be \"worrying about the radical jihadists in ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never called the mountain Denali, and neither does anyone I know,\u201d young Miss Palin wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s my cue to say, \u201cBristol Palin, meet Sarah Palin.\u201d\n\nAlaska\u2019s former governor actually mentioned the mountain in her 2009 gubernatorial farewell address. The governor, Bristol Palin\u2019s mother, put it this way: \u201cDenali, the \u2018Great One,\u2019 soaring under the midnight sun.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "John G.
