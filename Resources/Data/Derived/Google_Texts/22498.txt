If you've watched TV recently, you've probably seen Republican candidate for governor Doug Burgum's ad criticizing his opponent Wayne Stenehjem for supporting a lawsuit that would have helped dismantle Obamacare.

Stenehjem is firing back.

Stenehjem said he did oppose King v. Burwell because he says it was the wrong way to overturn the law.

The suit would have ended federal subsidies that about 15,000 North Dakotans expected when they signed up for insurance through healthcare.gov.

Stenehjem says he was, however, at the forefront of a 2011 lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.

"I'm so disappointed in the campaign that he's decided to run. What I hear from people is they want to hear you talk about your idea, quit criticizing everybody else, and let us know what you're thinking about," said Stenehjem.

"It is a fact. It is true, talking about the fact that he sided with 21 Democrat attorney generals (sic) in the last best chance to stop Obamacare is, I think that's important information for voters to know," said Burgum.

When asked how he responds to Stenehjem's ad that says North Dakota's not for sale, Burgum says, quote, "The infrastructure is set up so strongly towards keeping incumbents in place, that it takes someone that is willing to invest in themselves to try to break through that power structure."
