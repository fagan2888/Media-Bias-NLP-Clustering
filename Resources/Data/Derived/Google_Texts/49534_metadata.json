When Merce Cunningham died in 2009, his dance company went on a farewell tour and then disbanded, according to his wishes.\n\nNow Paul Taylor, who is among the remaining pioneers of the modernist movement that transformed dance in the mid-20th century, is shaking up his company as it celebrates its 60th anniversary \u2014 in the hope, he said, of keeping it going for \u201cat least\u201d another 60 years.\n\nAfter six decades in which the Paul Taylor Dance Company existed to dance almost nothing but Paul Taylor works, Mr. Taylor said that he wanted to broaden its mission to include presenting past masterworks of modern dance and works of contemporary choreographers in addition to his oeuvre and the dances he plans to continue to create.\n\n\u201cI want to bring back great works of American modern dance that have been done in the past, so that today\u2019s audiences can see them,\u201d Mr. Taylor, 83, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd I want to encourage future choreographers of modern dance.\u201d\n\nHis idea startled the company\u2019s board when he first broached it with them in the fall, at a meeting in a 50th-floor conference room atop the McGraw-Hill building in Midtown. Since then, the board has been working feverishly to iron out the plan, said John Tomlinson, the executive director of the Paul Taylor Dance Foundation. The troupe plans to announce the details of its vision to create what it is calling \u201ca new center for American modern dance\u201d on March 13, the day of its gala at the David H. Koch Theater.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the board presented Mr. Taylor with a five-year plan for restructuring the company, he raised an objection. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018There\u2019s a problem with this plan,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Tomlinson recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take five years. I want to do this now.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor said that he had been encouraged by the support he had gotten from the board. \u201cThey seemed to like the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of them had been wondering what would happen to the company if the time comes that I can\u2019t crank out something.\u201d\n\nThat time has not yet come. The troupe will present two new Taylor dances this March in its three-week season at the Koch Theater. \u201cOne of them I just finished the other day,\u201d he said, explaining that it was called \u201cMarathon Cadenzas\u201d and set to music by Raymond Scott.\n\nMr. Taylor said that his decision to restructure his company and plan for the future had been influenced by his dismay at the disbanding of Cunningham\u2019s company. \u201cThat was sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that to happen. I would like the company to continue.\u201d\n\nHis proposal to reorganize the troupe raises a host of interesting questions, from how to choose canonical works from modern dance\u2019s past to whether his dancers are suited to other kinds of dance.\n\nMr. Taylor said that many details were still being worked out, including which contemporary choreographers would be chosen, which past works would be revived and whether those works would all be danced by members of his company, or by others. Asked what choreographers from the past he would be interested in presenting, he mentioned the possibility of Graham, whose company he danced in; Doris Humphrey; and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cThose are a few,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Taylor has become a fixture in American modern dance, especially in New York, where his company has managed to have regular annual New York seasons for decades, even as it has regularly toured the nation and the world. He danced for seven seasons with the Martha Graham Dance Company, and was a guest artist at New York City Ballet in 1959, where George Balanchine choreographed \u201cEpisodes\u201d for him.\n\nSince founding his own troupe in 1954, Mr. Taylor has created 140 dances, including works like \u201cEsplanade,\u201d \u201cAureole\u201d and \u201cCompany B,\u201d and his pieces have been performed by other companies including the Royal Danish Ballet, American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, Miami City Ballet and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. In 2010, Alastair Macaulay wrote in The New York Times, \u201cIt is fair to say, though few have done so, that Mr. Taylor\u2019s work became the mainstream of American modern dance more than 35 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tomlinson said that the first inklings of change would be apparent next month when Tiler Peck and Robert Fairchild, New York City Ballet dancers, perform excerpts from Mr. Taylor\u2019s \u201cAirs\u201d at his company\u2019s gala. Mr. Tomlinson said the changes would be reflected in the 2015 season.\n\nThe company has made a number of other plans to celebrate its 60th anniversary. For a special performance on March 11, it is selling all tickets at the Koch Theater for just $6. And at a March 23 performance, several dozen alumni of the company plan to join current members for a performance of Mr. Taylor\u2019s \u201cFrom Sea to Shining Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be like old home week,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.\n\nHe said that there were times when the company almost folded. \u201cSure, it\u2019s been a struggle, all along,\u201d he said, noting the financial pressure around dance. \u201cAnd nowadays it\u2019s still a struggle.\u201d\n\nBut he said that he was still excited to choreograph new dances, and plans to continue creating two new works each year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already thinking about the next new piece,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140209171749, "twitter": {"description": "As Paul Taylor celebrates
