He has blasted the Obama administration for the ongoing collapse of Iraq, criticized Republicans for capitulating to the president, and all the while, seemed completely oblivious to his own role in the quagmire that now threatens the stability of the entire Middle East.\n\nCheney, 73, has long been a divisive figure in American politics. His role in the faulty lead-up to the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent chaos that enveloped the country \u2013 as well as his refusal to acknowledge missteps along the way \u2013 have long made liberals disdain him.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Need Rand Paul\u2019s Help With Iraq\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that he enraged the left with his op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal when he blamed only President Obama for the advance of the Islamic State militant group - not himself or for the Bush administration.\n\n\u201cRarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many,\u201d Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney, wrote in their June 18 piece. \u201cToo many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is \u2018ending\u2019 the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 as though wishing made it so,\u201d the Cheneys continued. \u201cHis rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not \u2018decimated.\u2019 They are emboldened and on the march.\u201d\n\nThe Cheneys blamed Obama for wasting the gains made by the Bush administration \u2013 with no acknowledgment whatsoever that many of Iraq\u2019s problems arose from a gross mismanagement of the war.\n\n\u201cIraq is at risk of falling to a radical Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change,\u201d the Cheney father-and-daughter team wrote. \u201cTerrorists take control of more territory and resources than ever before in history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present danger to the United States of America.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Map That Shows How to Save Iraq\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s politics, Cheney\u2019s assessment shows a startling ability to ignore facts. Not only did the United States enter Iraq using faulty intelligence, it completely mismanaged decisions made after Baghdad fell.\n\nThe Bush White House, for instance, decided to disband the Iraq army once Americans had taken Baghdad. These former soldiers later regrouped to kill thousands of Americans and injure many thousands more.\n\nCheney also fails to acknowledge how his focus on Iraq led to near-disaster in Afghanistan. In the months after the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were on the run. He was nearly captured at the Battle of Tora Bora, and the rest of al Qaeda in Afghanistan was decimated.\n\nInstead of continuing to pursue gains made in Afghanistan\u2019s mountains, Cheney championed the unnecessary invasion of Iraq, allowing the Taliban to regroup. Some 13 years later, American troops are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan.\n\nRelated: Obama's Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another Story\n\nThese are just two examples of policy failures. There still remain issues about the Bush administration\u2019s use of torture on terror suspects, a policy Cheney supported. The former vice president was also dismissive of abuses at Abu Ghraib prison.\n\nBipartisan Condemnation\n\nCheney\u2019s questionable record - and his recent blunt assertions two years after a heart transplant revived him both physically and mentally \u2013 have allowed those on both sides of the political spectrum to pile on. Secretary of State John Kerry dismissed the op ed with this: \u201cThis is the man who took us into Iraq saying this? Please.\u201d\n\nEven some within the Republican establishment have criticized Cheney. Rand Paul, a presumptive GOP presidential candidate in 2016, said that Cheney was to blame for the violence in Iraq, not Obama. Megyn Kelly, a host of Fox News, slammed Cheney for the suggestions made in The Journal piece.\n\n\u201cTime and time again, history has proven that you got it wrong as well in Iraq, sir. You said there was no doubt Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. You said we would be greeted as liberators,\u201d Kelly said to Cheney. \u201cYou said the insurgency was in its last throes back in 2005, and you said that after our intervention, extremists would have to \u2018rethink their strategy of jihad.\u2019 Now, with almost a trillion dollars spent there, with almost 4,500 American lives lost there, what do you say to those who say you were so wrong about so much at the expense of so many?\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Cheney has remained defiant. Along with his daughter Liz, an attorney and political commentator, he\u2019s started the Alliance for a Strong America, formed \u201cbecause we know that America\u2019s security depends upon reversing President Obama\u2019s policies,\u201d the group says in its mission statement.\n\nCheney\u2019s recent behavior has been dividing the Republican Party at the very time it seeks to unify itself in a midterm election year and two years ahead of the 2016 election. \u201cWith his long track record of bad judgment, Cheney\u2019s efforts to depict more prudent and thoughtful Republicans, such as Rand Paul, as isolationists is ridiculous,\u201d Richard Burt, a former diplomat for President Ronald Reagan and the elder President George Bush who has been advising Mr. Paul, told The New York Times recently. And Kevin Madden, who advised Mitt Romney, also said to The Times, \u201cOne of the challenges of a Cheney re-emergency is the party does need new leaders, new voices, new visions on national security policy and overall foreign policy to emerge.\u201d\n\nStill, some in the GOP don\u2019t mind the tough cases he\u2019s been making. And Cheney has shown no signs of backing down. He continues to dismiss those who question him of being arrogant of history, and insists the past has no bearing on the present.\n\n\u201cIf we spend our time debating what happened eleven or twelve years ago, we\u2019re going to miss the threat that is growing and that we do face,\u201d Cheney said on This Week with George Stephanopoulos recently. \u201cWe\u2019re missing the boat, we don\u2019t understand that nature of the threat, and we\u2019re unwilling to deal with it.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been on a tear lately.", "title": "Dick Cheney\u2019s Swipe at Obama Divides the GOP", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/06/Dick-Cheney-s-Swipe-Obama-Divides-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07062014_Cheney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/06/Dick-Cheney-s-Swipe-Obama-Divides-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07062014_Cheney.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been on a tear lately.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb417\"", "article_summary": "Rand Paul, a presumptive GOP presidential candidate in 2016, said that Cheney was to blame for the violence in Iraq, not Obama.\nThere still remain issues about the Bush administration\u2019s use of torture on terror suspects, a policy Cheney supported.\n\u201cToo many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is \u2018ending\u2019 the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 as though wishing made it so,\u201d the Cheneys continued.\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney has been on a tear lately.\n\u201cIraq is at risk of falling to a radical Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change,\u201d the Cheney father-and-daughter team wrote."}
