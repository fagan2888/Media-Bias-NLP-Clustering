PLAYA DEL REY (CBSLA.com) — Some Anthem Blue Cross members have received letters that their health insurance plans are no longer available due to the Affordable Care Act.

Deborah Cavallaro got a letter from Anthem Blue Cross which stated, “Because of the requirements of the new laws, we can no longer offer your current Anthem policy.”

“I was infuriated, totally infuriated,” she said. “It’s sort of forcing you to walk the plank.”

The letter also said that Cavallaro is being offered a new policy and her monthly payment will increase from $292 to $484.

“The president kept saying, you know, ‘If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Your premiums will be going down.’ But, in fact, the letter is completely contradictory to that,” said Cavallaro.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, said major health insurance companies are simply taking advantage of the confusion surrounding the new health care law to engage in price gouging.

“This is not the fault of the Affordable Care Act or President Obama. This is the fault of the insurance company. This is a handful of insurance companies that have convinced a very gullible state agency, Covered California, to allow them to drop plans that could very easily…with a few little tweaks… be compliant under the Affordable Care Act, and people wouldn’t have to leave their plans,” said Court.

CBS2’s Randy Paige reached out to Anthem Blue Cross for comment, but was referred to a health industry trade group.

“The facts are there are considerable new changes under the Affordable Care Act that will be beneficial to people, but those changes come at a cost. Some people will pay more, some people will pay less, and we need to continue to have a conversation about the affordability of medical care,” said Nicole Evans of the California Association of Health Plans.
