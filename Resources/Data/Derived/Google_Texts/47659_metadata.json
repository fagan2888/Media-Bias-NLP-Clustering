That sounds complicated, but it\u2019s really not: Basically, Texas women are losing their legal right to abortions.\n\nThe very next day, the D.C. appeals court ruled that the contraceptive coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act violates the religious freedom of Freshway Foods, an Ohio-based food company \u2013 meaning the company\u2019s health insurance doesn\u2019t have to cover birth control for its employees.\n\nSo who\u2019s behind these blows to women\u2019s rights? Strangely, it\u2019s two female judges. Thursday\u2019s decision was written by Judge Priscilla Owen, a Bush 43 appointee. And Friday\u2019s ruling came from Judge Janice Rogers Brown, who was \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 also a George W. Bush pick.\n\nJudge Owen\u2019s a Texas native who previously served on the state\u2019s Supreme Court. She was also reportedly in the running to replace Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor in 2005, though Harriet Miers was eventually nominated instead. Owen\u2019s got a long, respected legal career \u2013 more than thirty years in practice \u2013 and even earned the American Bar Association\u2019s highest possible rating for her qualifications when she was nominated to the Fifth Circuit position.\n\nBut while Owen\u2019s qualifications may be beyond reproach, her rulings regarding women\u2019s health are more controversial. In 2000, she wrote a much-criticized minority opinion on Texas\u2019 parental notification law, arguing that it should be harder for minors to get judicial approval for abortions without their parents\u2019 consent. Former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales \u2013 also on the Texas Supreme Court at the time \u2013 slammed Owen and her contingent in his majority ruling, saying: \u201c[T]o create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism.\u201d In that same opinion, Owen argued that young women should \u201cbe aware of\u2026philosophic, social, moral, and religious arguments\u201d against abortions \u2013 which activists say is the only known instance of a state supreme court justice trying to create a \u201creligious awareness\u201d standard for the procedure.\n\nAs a Texas Supreme Court Justice, Owen also supported the elimination of buffer zones around Planned Parenthood clinics in Houston \u2013 another black mark on her women\u2019s rights record.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Janice Rogers Brown. Born to a farming family in Alabama in the heart of the Jim Crow years, Brown was originally a fairly progressive Democrat, inspired to go into law by the civil rights movement. But things changed. There\u2019s that time she hired a convicted bank robber \u2013 fresh off a ten-year stint in prison \u2013 as her law clerk. Oh, and the time she compared liberalism to slavery. She\u2019s an evangelical Christian with a penchant for quoting rock lyrics in her decisions (one greatest hit: rewriting the lyrics to Paul Simon\u2019s \u201c50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\u201d as \u201c50 Ways to Lose Your Liberty\u201d). She was nominated to the D.C. Circuit in 2003, but Senate Democrats fought against her so hard that it took two years and the implementation of the \u201cnuclear option\u201d before she was confirmed. (For more on the so-called \u201cnuclear option,\u201d check out guest blogger Ari Rabin-Havt\u2019s recent post on the topic.)\n\nWhere Judge Owen is generally considered a fair and knowledgeable jurist, Judge Brown\u2019s reputation is less airtight. When she was nominated to the California State Supreme Court in 1994, the state\u2019s bar association rated her \u201cunqualified\u201d for the role. In later years, Brown\u2019s colleagues filed complaints against her, saying the justice was \u201cinsensitive to established legal precedent \u2026 and lacked compassion and intellectual tolerance for opposing views.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s her record on women\u2019s issues \u2013 the topic that\u2019s putting her in the headlines this week. In a 2004 decision centered on employers\u2019 responsibility to cover contraceptives \u2013 a case very similar to the current Freshway Foods one \u2013 Brown suggested that if employees felt discriminated against, then they should simply move to \u201cmore congenial employoment.\u201d\n\nThe year before, in a case of alleged date rape involving a 17-year-old girl, Brown asked whether the girl had protested enough, saying none of her requests to stop the sexual activity were \u201cunequivocal.\u201d Though the court eventually ruled the case a rape, Brown was the lone dissenter, writing in her minority opinion: \u201cIs persistence the same thing as force?\u201d\n\nPriscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown: women ruling against women, women taking away women\u2019s rights. With these kinds of judges on the bench, perhaps it\u2019s time to redefine the meaning of \u201cviolence against women.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Two major legal cases took away women's rights this week - and they were both decided by female judges.
