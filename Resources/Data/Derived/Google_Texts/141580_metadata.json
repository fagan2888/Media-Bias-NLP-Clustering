Companies that did not pay for health insurance are now doing it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Schultz expressed concern that the botched rollout of the HealthCare.gov website would overshadow what he believed were the law\u2019s good intentions. At the height of the problem in October, Schultz told CNBC, \u201cUnfortunately, in this kind of situation, execution trumps strategy. It might be a great strategy, but the execution is really flawed. It\u2019s off the rails.\u201d\n\nBut now that officials have fixed the site and more than 8 million Americans have signed up for insurance, he said, the program's benefits outweigh its issues.\n\n\u201cNo plan would have been perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt'll be refined, improved.\u201d\n\nSchultz spoke with HuffPost reporters and editors as part of a media tour promoting a new Starbucks program that offers workers the chance to get a college degree at an extreme discount.\n\nUnlike many corporate chiefs and franchisees, Schultz said he has no plans to cut benefits as a result of the law. Business owners have periodically made waves by suggesting Obamacare would push them to cut their employees\u2019 hours so they wouldn\u2019t have to cover them. Obamacare requires that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees provide health insurance to anyone working at least 30 hours a week.\n\nSchultz noted that Starbucks\u2019 plan was always more generous than the new law requires, offering coverage to employees working 20 hours or more per week. He said that \u201cthe first question we got from shareholders\u201d about the law was whether Starbucks would bump up its threshold to 30 hours to save money.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s millions of dollars and we wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nStill, it\u2019s possible that kicking part-time employees off the company\u2019s plan could actually result in a better deal for them if they buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges instead. In many cases, part-time workers may make so little that they would qualify for subsidies under the law, but they aren\u2019t eligible if their company offers an affordable plan that meets Obamacare\u2019s standards. If the employees qualify for Medicaid, they're still eligible even if their employer offers an affordable plan.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s announced last year that it would stop offering health insurance to its part-time workforce, much to those workers' chagrin. But several months later, some employees told HuffPost that the decision actually worked out in their favor.\n\nThat's because by providing affordable insurance, Obamacare frees up some workers staying at their jobs only for health benefits to leave and pursue other opportunities, like finding more fulfilling jobs that don\u2019t offer insurance, starting a business, taking care of their kids or retiring.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite its disastrous rollout, Obamacare has been a good thing overall, according to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a net positive,\u201d Sc...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-06-18 15:51:47 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Despite its disastrous rollout, Obamacare has been a good thing overall, according to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a net positive,\u201d Sc...", "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz: Obamacare Is 'A Net Positive'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/17/howard-schultz-obamacare_n_5504128.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1860529/images/o-HOWARD-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostBiz", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1860529/images/o-HOWARD-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "Despite its disastrous rollout, Obamacare has been a good thing overall, according to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a net positive,\u201d Sc...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz: Obamacare Is 'A Net Positive'"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-17 15:51:47 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5504128", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "starbucks,Howard Schultz,Howard Schultz Starbucks,starbucks-obamacare,obamacare,starbucks-obamacare-off-the-rails,howard schultz obamacare", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "starbucks,Howard Schultz,Howard Schultz Starbucks,starbucks-obamacare,obamacare,starbucks-obamacare-off-the-rails,howard schultz obamacare", "published_time": "2014-06-17 15:51:47 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-06-17 15:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think it\u2019s a net positive,\u201d Schultz said Tuesday of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nBusiness owners have periodically made waves by suggesting Obamacare would push them to cut their employees\u2019 hours so they wouldn\u2019t have to cover them.\nObamacare requires that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees provide health insurance to anyone working at least 30 hours a week.\nWendy George/The Huffington PostDespite its disastrous rollout, Obamacare has been a good thing overall, according to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.\nTrader Joe\u2019s announced last year that it would stop offering health insurance to its part-time workforce, much to those workers' chagrin."}
