Santa Rosa Beach, FL---As of Saturday's regional finals, seven days remained in the high school volleyball season. Eight teams remained in the championship hunt in each class.

If you're still playing, clearly, you're good. The problem what that? So is your competition.

Four local programs took the court in the Elite 8, all looking to make the trip to Kissemmee for the state semifinals, including South Walton. The Lady Seahawks were looking for their first ever birth in the Final Four, hosting last year's state runner-up, Baker in 1A play.

In the highlights attached above, in the first set, with the Lady Seahawks trailing by three, Maddie Cope gets her team back in the match with a service run featuring three aces in a row to tie the ballgame.

Baker retakes the lead quickly, but South Walton's in control of momentum, thanks to Belle Waldrop and one of her 24 kills on the day that puts the Lady Seahawks up four.

Waldrop then comes up with back-to-back aces as South Walton wins the first 25-16.

In the second set, Cope's serving stays hot, as she gets three more aces in a row. She had nine total to go with 12 kills.

Yet Baker takes the second and third sets, meaning the Lady Seahawks were down to their final 25 points of the season.

With their backs against the wall, they answered the call, coming back to win the final two, as South Walton advances to Kissemmee, winning 25-16, 15-25, 24-26, 25-16, and 15-9.

Setter Laura Andrews had 47 assists on the match.

The win improves South Walton to 13-10 on the season. They advance to the state semi's to face the defending champ Sneads, who swept Blountstown Saturday in straight sets 25-15, 25-17, 25-11. The Lady Seahawks and Lady Pirates will battle at 9 AM Tuesday in a match that guarantees a local will play for the state championship.

The Tigers 2014 ends with a 22-8 record.

The lone local still playing outside of 1A was in 5A, the Mosley Lady Dolphins, who saw their season end in Jacksonville to state favorite Bishop Kenny in straight sets, 25-13, 25-18, and 25-11. The green and orange finish the campaign with a 21-9 mark.
