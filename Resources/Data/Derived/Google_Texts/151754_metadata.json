All precincts have reported in the largely conservative and mostly rural district.\n\nMcAllister, running as an outsider, lined up an endorsement from \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Phil Robertson, the patriarch in the popular reality show, and cast member Willie Robertson appeared in a commercial for the candidate. The program is shot in the northeast part of Louisiana that McAllister will represent.\n\nUnlike McAllister, Riser had the backing of a number of prominent Republicans including U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nMcAllister campaigned as a social and fiscal conservative. But the college dropout, whose business interests range from oilfield technology to fast-food franchises, also pledged to return some civility to the nation\u2019s capital and positioned himself slightly to the left of Riser.\n\nHe argued that Louisiana should accept the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare reform effort.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a Republican who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, has refused to accept the expansion that would be fully financed by the federal government for three years and then subject to a 10 percent state match.\n\n\u201cWhat a blessing,\u201d McAllister told supporters in a victory speech that echoed his campaign\u2019s populist tone. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fun. I guess Fox News, get ready. Sometimes the truth ain\u2019t what you want to hear, but it\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the race\u2019s at-times negative tone, he said his election is proof that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be ugly and nasty and tell lies and make up stories. You can be who you are.\u201d\n\nRiser agreed with the governor\u2019s stance to reject the Medicaid expansion.\n\nAs a state senator, Riser authored a Louisiana constitutional amendment requiring any state gun restrictions to pass the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. The funeral home owner was the contest\u2019s early favorite with backing from the conservative Tea Party of Louisiana and the national group FreedomWorks, which is aligned with the Tea Party movement.\n\nThe 5th District stretches from the Arkansas border south to the outer edges of the New Orleans area. It has a higher rate of poverty than the national average and more 35 percent of residents are black.\n\nJoshua Stockley, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, said McAllister\u2019s big win signaled that the hard-line stance of some Republicans has limits.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will not become a majority party or a governing party with the simple message of defund Obamacare, defund Obamacare, defund Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe voters of the 5th District appeared to repudiate that theme.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly the endorsements of Phil and Willie Robertson made a lot of voters feel better\u201d about their attraction to his candidacy, Stockley said.\n\nIn October, Riser finished first in the non-partisan primary against a field of 13 rival candidates, taking 32 percent. He was followed by McAllister with 18 percent. In Louisiana, if no candidate earns a majority of the vote in the open primary, the top two finishers meet in the runoff, regardless of party.\n\nThe congressional seat opened in August when Alexander, in his sixth term, resigned to become Jindal\u2019s secretary of veterans\u2019 affairs.\n\nSince he is replacing a Republican, McAllister\u2019s election will not change the Republican majority in the U.S. House. Democrats have a majority in the Senate.\n\n_______\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Capitol Hill Blue\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Thomson Reuters All Rights Reserved\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Hill Blue", "description": "Republican businessman Vance McAllister, a political newcomer who boasts of never having visited Washington, D.C., won a special election in Louisiana on Saturday to fill the congressional seat for\u2026", "title": "\u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 candidate wins Congressional seat", "url": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/50443", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111713mcallister.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-17T13:11:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T12:47:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111713mcallister.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "article_summary": "Since he is replacing a Republican, McAllister\u2019s election will not change the Republican majority in the U.S. House.\n\u201cRepublicans will not become a majority party or a governing party with the simple message of defund Obamacare, defund Obamacare, defund Obamacare,\u201d he said.\nUnlike McAllister, Riser had the backing of a number of prominent Republicans including U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\nThe congressional seat opened in August when Alexander, in his sixth term, resigned to become Jindal\u2019s secretary of veterans\u2019 affairs.\nIn a runoff to fill Louisiana\u2019s vacant 5th Congressional District, McAllister took 60 percent of the vote against fellow Republican Neil Riser, a state senator."}
