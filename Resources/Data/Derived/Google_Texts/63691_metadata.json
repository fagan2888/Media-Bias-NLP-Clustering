Yet they were unable to find the net, narrowly missing on what were credited four saves by Mustangs goalie Michael Nelson.\n\nDenver had close calls in the final 10 minutes of regulation, but the Pioneers didn\u2019t get a shot off in extra time, as Garcia\u2019s score came quickly on a throw-in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be one I put on my wall and show everybody how beautiful we played because it wasn\u2019t the most beautiful game,\u201d said SMU coach Kevin Hudson. \u201cBut we did generate enough number of scoring chances to get the result.\u201d\n\nDespite defeat, Franks is optimistic about the future of the Pioneers\u2019 program. Twenty-three of the 25 on the current roster are eligible to return next season.\n\nSince arriving at DU as an assistant under then-coach Bobby Muuss in 2012, Franks has revamped recruiting to put an emphasis on character, which he said has directly translated to on-field results.\n\n\u201cI think the word resilient is an important word to talk about in soccer \u2014 there\u2019s tons of mistakes,\u201d Franks told The Denver Post last week. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to make any mistakes on kids.\u201d\n\nFranks, 29, led the Pioneers to a 15-0-3 regular-season record. It was the first time Denver had accomplished such a feat since 1989, when it was part of the NAIA.\n\nFranks seemed the logical choice to replace Muuss, who left for Wake Forest, but Franks insists he only took the Denver helm because he believed the Pioneers could reach soccer\u2019s Final Four.\n\n\u201cThe program will be stronger from all the results we had,\u201d he said. \u201cThey somehow need to channel this type of emptiness into motivation, and it\u2019s not easy. But we\u2019ve got really good character in that locker room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Pioneers get upset in NCAA Men\u2019s Soccer Tournament", "title": "Denver Pioneers get upset in NCAA Men\u2019s Soccer Tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/denver-pioneers-get-upset-in-ncaa-mens-soccer-tournament/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T21:34:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-22T21:34:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "The Denver Pioneers\u2019 undefeated run came to a gut-wrenching halt in Sunday\u2019s 1-0 overtime defeat to Southern Methodist in the second round of the NCAA Men\u2019s Soccer Tournament.\nDespite the finality of Sunday\u2019s loss, the Pioneers hung their hats as the only undefeated team during the regular season in the NCAA.\n\u201cI think the word resilient is an important word to talk about in soccer \u2014 there\u2019s tons of mistakes,\u201d Franks told The Denver Post last week.\nIt was the first time Denver had accomplished such a feat since 1989, when it was part of the NAIA.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to make any mistakes on kids.\u201dFranks, 29, led the Pioneers to a 15-0-3 regular-season record."}
