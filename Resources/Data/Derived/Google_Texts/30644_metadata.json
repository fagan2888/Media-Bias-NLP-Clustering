They deny the charges.\n\nThe former strongman and Adly were both sentenced to life in prison in 2012 after being convicted in the case but an appeals court subsequently ordered a retrial.\n\nMany Egyptians who lived through his autocracy and crony capitalism considered it a victory to see Mubarak behind bars.\n\nHis overthrow led to Egypt's first free leadership election but the winner, Mohamed Mursi, was ousted last year by the army and some Mubarak-era figures have since been released, raising fears among activists that the old regime was regaining influence.\n\nMubarak, 86, arrived at the court in a medical helicopter and was wheeled off the back on a stretcher surrounded by police clutching rifles. He appeared with fellow defendants in a courtroom cage, looking pale and glum and wearing sunglasses.\n\nOutside the court at the Cairo police academy, his supporters gathered, carrying pictures of the former airforce commander and chanting slogans demanding his release.\n\nFamilies of those killed by security forces during the uprising came to protest.\n\n\"This delay comes in preparation for the clearing of Mubarak,\" said one woman whose son died during the street revolt. \"We feel like our rights have been lost.\"\n\nHighlighting how polarized Egyptian society has become, fights broke out between Mubarak supporters and relatives of the deceased. Police broke up the fight and arrested two people.\n\nThe political demise of Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood at the hands of the military means voices more sympathetic to Mubarak are now being heard.\n\nMubarak told the court last month that he had not ordered the killing of protesters and said history would vindicate him.\n\nAdly and other Mubarak-era officials have also had their testimonies broadcast in recent weeks, giving them a platform to rebuild their reputations with the public.\n\nMubarak is unlikely to be freed, however. Though he has been given bail in this case, he is already serving a separate three-year sentence for embezzlement at a military hospital in the upscale Maadi district of Cairo. The court ordered that Adly remain in custody pending the verdict.\n\n(Reporting by Lin Noueihed; editing by Andrew Heavens and Tom Pfeiffer)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "An Egyptian court postponed to Nov. 29 its verdict on whether former president Hosni Mubarak ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three-decade rule.", "title": "Egypt postpones verdict in case against ex-president Mubarak", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, EGYPT, MUBARAK, VERDICT", "sailthru.title": "Egypt postpones verdict in case against ex-president Mubarak", "keywords": "US,EGYPT,MUBARAK,VERDICT,Civil Unrest,Lawmaking,Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties,International / National Security,Crime / Law / Justice,Islam,Crime,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East,Emerging Market Countries,Government / Politics,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Egypt", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;EGYPT;MUBARAK;VERDICT;Civil Unrest;Lawmaking;Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties;International / National Security;Crime / Law / Justice;Islam;Crime;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Middle East;Emerging Market Countries;Government / Politics;Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions;Human Rights / Civil Rights;Egypt", "WT.cg_n": "World", "sailthru.description": "An Egyptian court postponed to Nov. 29 its verdict on whether former president Hosni Mubarak ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three-decade rule.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-27T20:25:16+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "topNews;worldNews;newsMaps;gc05;ford;everything;treasuryMarkets;Cargill;Shell;Amtrak;Amtrak2;Topnews1;yahoo2Dub;yahoo3;Sprintboard;echoActivityStream;Suntrust_SmallBiz;HSBC_US;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;OutloudFeed;egypt;CFA;jpGambaroPeople;trending-hp;samsung;middle-east;newsproHome;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;competitorsdependency;shipping;nonegative;lyxor;MLGZero;BNY;Intel;BNYForesight;HP_Ad2one_Asia;Fidelity2014;GCA-NewsPro", "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Sep 27 20:25:16 UTC 2014", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Egypt+postpones+verdict+in+case+against+ex-president+Mubarak", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKCN0HM07F20140927", "WT.cg_s": "World", "description": "An Egyptian court postponed to Nov. 29 its verdict on whether former president Hosni Mubarak ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three-decade rule.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "WT.z_inlinetype": "Video", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "An Egyptian court postponed to Nov. 29 its verdict on whether former president Hosni Mubarak ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three-decade rule.", "title": "Egypt postpones verdict in case against ex-president Mubarak", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-mubarak-verdict-idUSKCN0HM07F20140927", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,EGYPT,MUBARAK,VERDICT,Civil Unrest,Lawmaking,Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties,International / National Security,Crime / Law / Justice,Islam,Crime,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East,Emerging Market Countries,Government / Politics,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Egypt", "published_time": "2014-09-27T20:25:16+0000", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T20:25:16+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USKCN0HM07F20140927", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1c5\"", "article_summary": "Highlighting how polarized Egyptian society has become, fights broke out between Mubarak supporters and relatives of the deceased.\nThe court ordered that Adly remain in custody pending the verdict.\nCAIRO An Egyptian court postponed to Nov. 29 its verdict on whether former president Hosni Mubarak ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ended his three-decade rule.\nMubarak told the court last month that he had not ordered the killing of protesters and said history would vindicate him.\nA TV screen in the courtroom showed thousands of documents related to the case piled up in folders and bound with string."}
