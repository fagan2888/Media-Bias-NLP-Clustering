For him, the cheapest supplemental policy would cost $115, while the most expensive would come in at $443. As a fellow New Yorker of Medicare age, Hillary Clinton would have to pay the same amount.\n\nGov. Chris Christie would have to pay $502 a month.\n\nFor those candidates not old enough to get Medicare, HealthCare.com used the premium for the cheapest \"Silver\" plan offered in the candidate's state for someone of that age. The plans included ones sold on and off the federal exchange. The website assumed none of the candidates would qualify for a federal subsidy.\n\nThe hypothetical coverage is for individual coverage, not a family plan. Rick Santorum, who has seven children, or Christie, who has four, would obviously pay for more for family coverage.\n\nThe numbers show wide state-by-state disparities, as well as differences even within states. For example, both Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee live in Florida, but Bush would have a choice of 102 different plans, while Huckabee's would have only 30 choices.\n\nThey also show the effect of age on prices. Under the Affordable Care Act, while insurers can no longer charge women more than men, they can charge older customers more than younger ones.\n\nThose factors led to big differences among the candidates:\n\nJeb Bush (62, Florida): $615.\n\nBen Carson (63, Maryland): $522.\n\nChris Christie (53, New Jersey): $502.\n\nHillary Clinton: (67, New York; Medicare): $115\n\nTed Cruz (44, Texas): $271.\n\nCarly Fiorina (61, Virginia): $600.\n\nLindsey Graham (60, South Carolina): $603.\n\nMike Huckabee (60, Florida): $620.\n\nBobby Jindal (44, Louisiana): $319.\n\nJohn Kasich (63, Ohio): $563.\n\nMartin O'Malley (53, Maryland): $361.\n\nRand Paul (53, Kentucky): $460.\n\nMarco Rubio (44, Florida): $299.\n\nBernie Sanders (74, Vermont; Medicare): $71.\n\nRick Santorum (57, Dallas): $485.\n\nDonald Trump (69, New York; Medicare): $115.\n\nJim Webb (69, Virginia; Medicare): $54.\n\nScott Walker (48, Wisconsin): $303.\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com.
