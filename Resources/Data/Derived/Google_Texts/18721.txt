A 20-year-old woman died Saturday morning after her car crossed the median on Interstate 70 and struck a Dodge pickup truck coming in the opposite direction, Lakewood Police reported.

Lakewood Police responded to the accident at 7:39 a.m. Westbound I-70 was closed for nearly four hours as they investigated.

The woman, who was driving a white Dodge Neon eastbound, died at the scene of the accident near the West Colfax Avenue exit. She was driving alone.

A child in the truck was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Others in the truck suffered minor injuries and were treated on the scene, Lakewood Police said.

Investigators don’t suspect alcohol was involved, but are awaiting toxicology results. The deceased driver’s name will be released once the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office notifies her relatives.
