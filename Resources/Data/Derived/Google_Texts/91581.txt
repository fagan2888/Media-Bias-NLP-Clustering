Guess what day it is? Get this hump day started right with some news of the day.

TOO CLOSE:Ballots are still being counted in Washington state for the $15 an hour minimum wage measure in SeaTac. The yes votes are still winning but it’s close. And no matter what, opponents plan to drag the fight back to court, saying the measure should be invalidated.

EYE ON YOU: Seattle police have agreed to deactivate a wifi system that had some people worried it would be used to spy on residents and track your movements. It’s not the first time the Seattle police department has come under scrutiny for surveillance equipment.

SUGAR DADDIES: Obamacare’s insurance premium increases have convinced some women to consider getting a “sugar daddy” to cover the added costs, according to a website that facilitates such agreements, the Washington Examiner reports.

GROSSLY MISLEADING: It didn’t take long for opponents of U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon, to cry foul after the congressman blasted President Barack Obama for misleading the public with his keep-your-plan-under-Obamacare promise.
