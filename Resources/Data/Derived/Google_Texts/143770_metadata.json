While Boca Raton Regional Hospital remains in Humana\u2019s South Florida health care provider network for the next two years for our Medicare and Employer Group health plan members, Humana was not able to agree on rates with Boca Raton Regional for continued participation in \u2018HUMx,\u2019 or Humana\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace individual exchange plan network in South Florida.\u201d\n\nLubitz continued, \u201cIn Palm Beach County, Humana\u2019s 2015 exchange network hospitals include Bethesda Memorial and Wellington Regional. Humana also has a number of participating Broward hospitals in its exchange network, including all the Broward Health Hospitals and the Memorial Health System. As your reader indicated, Humana has informed our affected Marketplace plan members in Palm Beach County that Boca Raton Regional is no longer in our exchange network.\u201d\n\nHe declined to say how many people are affected.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t characterize the number of Humana individual exchange members affected by the network change as we consider Marketplace membership to be competitive information,\u201d Lubitz said. \u201cHowever, Humana is constantly evaluating its health care provider network, always seeking to balance access with affordability, and that\u2019s an even more important consideration for the exchange network, when many of those South Floridians seeking health insurance coverage qualify for federal subsidies.\u201d\n\nA Boca Raton Regional Hospital spokesman said the various Humana plans are different products and declined comment on why it could not reach a deal on exchange policies.\n\nThe reader, who asked not to be identified, sees \u201clots of politics\u201d at work here. She adds, \u201cHumana is being cooperative in helping me make other arrangements for my surgery through a different provider and hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported last week that Humana renewed a two-year deal with Boca Raton Regional Hospital that provides continued network access for health plan members. The extension, which took effect Oct. 1, ensures members who enroll in Humana Medicare plans during the upcoming enrollment period \u2014 Oct. 15 through Dec. 7 \u2014 will be able to receive in-network services.\n\nThe renewal applies to Humana Medicare and Employer Group HMO and PPO plans and includes all Boca Raton Regional-employed physicians and specialists, such as BocaCare, Boca Urology and Surgical Associates of Palm Beach, the company said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Protecting Your Pocket", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2014/10/14/wait-humana-and-boca-regional-dont-have-deal-for-all-customers/", "image": "https://cmgpbpprotectingyourpocket.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/humana.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "Hold on there, a reader says: Humana Inc.'s renewed deal with Boca Raton Regional Hospital does not mean all customers can enjoy network access at relatively low prices.\r\n\r\nA reader who says she gets a government subsidy under an Affordable Care Act plan with Humana says the hospital is not \"in network\" for her plan on the health care exchange.\r\n\r\nThat leaves \"patients like me, who need surgery and have gone to...", "title": "There\u2019s more to the story on Humana and Boca Regional  | Protecting Your Pocket"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0eb717cde8a67beef4209846aa3f6a28?s=16", "keywords": "business, insurance, uncategorized, bnblogs, boca raton regional hospital, humana, newsfeed, obamacare", "viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Hold on there, a reader says: Humana Inc.'s renewed deal with Boca Raton Regional Hospital does not mean all customers can enjoy network access at relatively low prices."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaee5\"", "article_summary": "Hold on there, a reader says: Humana Inc.\u2019s renewed deal with Boca Raton Regional Hospital does not mean all customers can enjoy network access at relatively low prices.\n\u201cThank you very much Humana and Boca Regional.\u201dHere\u2019s what Humana spokesman Mitch Lubitz said: \u201cCharles: Your Post reader is correct.\nThe renewal applies to Humana Medicare and Employer Group HMO and PPO plans and includes all Boca Raton Regional-employed physicians and specialists, such as BocaCare, Boca Urology and Surgical Associates of Palm Beach, the company said.\nThat leaves \u201cpatients like me, who need surgery and have gone to in-network doctors with hospital privileges only at Boca Regional, between a rock and a hard place,\u201d she said.\nShe adds, \u201cHumana is being cooperative in helping me make other arrangements for my surgery through a different provider and hospital.\u201dThe Post reported last week that Humana renewed a two-year deal with Boca Raton Regional Hospital that provides continued network access for health plan members."}
