There was the dimwit who confiscated a child\u2019s candy canes and the dunderheads who banned the colors red and green. And how can we forget about the simpletons who outlawed classroom poinsettias or the Junior League communists who rewrote the lyrics to \"Silent Night\"?\n\nBut those are junior varsity skirmishes compared to what happened at Butler Elementary School \u2013 where the PTA canceled a field trip to see \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d because there was a Christmas tree on the stage.\n\nI\u2019m not making this up, folks.\n\nTelevision station WHDH did a stellar job reporting this act of lunacy. They report that a group of parents were alarmed at the \u201cquestionable content\u201d of the popular ballet.\n\nThe questionable content had nothing to do with men in tights. The parents got their tutus in a twist over \"O Tannenbaum.\"\n\n\u201cIn the past years, there were parent complaints as \"The Nutcracker\" has a religious content,\u201d PTA co-president Barbara Bulfoni told the television station.\n\nWell, smoke some holly and call me jolly! Heaven help the unfortunate children who gaze upon a tree decorated with ornaments and sparkly lights and tinsel.\n\nAccording to the reporting of WHDH, the issue came to a boiling point during a recent PTA meeting. Parents who supported the ballet were told accused of being discriminatory.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the PTA secretly canceled the trip.\n\nOnce the parents learned the trip had been canceled \u2013 they raised a ruckus and faster than you could say \u201cSugar Plum Fairy\u201d \u2013 the PTA reversed its decision.\n\nFor the record - there are no reported instances of a child spontaneously converting to the Christian faith while attending a performance of \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d\n\nI commend the PTA for coming to their senses and I raise a cup of egg nog in their honor.
