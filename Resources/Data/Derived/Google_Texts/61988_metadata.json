They were countered, though, by fierce opposition, both from lawmakers and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who continued to argue vehemently against the pact.\n\nThe deal, struck between Iran and six major world powers, the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia and China, is meant to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by sharply limiting its ability to process uranium.\n\nRelated: After Obama\u2019s Nuke Deal, What Happens If Israel Attacks Iran?\n\nIn exchange for accepting cuts to its nuclear program and an intrusive inspections and monitoring regime, Iran receives relief from international sanctions, some of which have been hobbling its economy for a generation. That will mean an immediate windfall of more than $100 billion in frozen assets, the ability to sell oil freely on the international market, and eventually, the lifting of an embargo restricting arms sales to the Islamic Republic.\n\nCritics of the deal object to many elements of it, but most of the arguments share a single assumption as their starting point: that Iran is negotiating in bad faith.\n\nThe preamble of the agreement contains the explicit statement, \u201cIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to assume that they will cheat on the deal,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a veteran of the Iraq war who has been vocally in opposition to any deal with Iran,\u201d said on Meet the Press.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Iran Deal Gives a Free Pass to a Rogues Gallery\n\nNetanyahu, who faces frequent calls for the destruction of his country from the Iranian leadership, called it Tehran\u2019s \u201cdream deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt paves their way to many, many bombs after a decade or so,\u201d Netanyahu said, calling it \u201ca very bad deal with a very bad regime.\u201d\n\nThe deal \u201calmost guarantees that there will be an arms race in the Middle East,\u201d said Florida senator and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination Marco Rubio.\n\nNot even the Obama administration\u2019s political allies were all rushing to support it. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, refused to commit himself to a position when it comes time for Congress to vote on whether or not to approve the deal.\n\nRelated: Clinton Cautious in Praise of a Nuclear Deal She Helped to Orchestrate\n\n\u201cMy obligations are to the people of this country\u2026I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s in the best interests of this country,\u201d Cardin said, on Fox News.\n\nSo they shouldn\u2019t count on you? Asked host Chris Wallace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of what party I belong to,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of supporting the president. The question is what\u2019s in the best interests of this country.\u201d\n\nThe vote Cardin was discussing is part of a process Congress and the president agreed on earlier this year, which gives lawmakers 60 days to assess the deal before voting to approve it or disapprove it. A vote of disapproval could be vetoed by Obama, allowing the deal to go forward, unless two thirds of each house of Congress vote to override the veto.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Important Things to Know About the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\n\u201cIf Congress were to kill this,\u201d Kerry warned on CNN, \u201cthen we have no inspections, no sanctions, no ability to negotiate \u2013 because I assure you, the Ayatollah? if the United States arbitrarily and unilaterally kills this, you\u2019re not going to have another negotiation, and they will feel free to go do the very things this prevents.\u201d\n\nKerry, who has been combative in the face of many attacks on the deal as na\u00efve or rushed, responded to one question from CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper with an aggressive defense.\n\n\u201cGuess what, my friend?\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIran has 12,000 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, and that\u2019s enough, if they enriched it further for 10 to 12 bombs. They have it. That\u2019s what Barack Obama was dealt as a hand when he came in. Nineteen thousand centrifuges already spinning, a country that had already mastered the fuel cycle, a country that already was threshold in the sense that they are only 2 months away from breakout.\u201d\n\nKerry also took aim at the assertion that Iran has a clear path to a bomb, outlining what he called \u201cunprecedented\u201d an inspection regime.\n\nRelated: Iran\u2019s Frozen Assets \u2013 Where Are They, Exactly?\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re expanding that breakout from two months to one year, for 10 years and longer, and we have lifetime inspection, adherence to the [International Atomic Energy Agency], adherence to the advance protocol, 25 years of tracking and monitoring their uranium from mining to milling to yellowcake to gas to centrifuge to waste. That\u2019s unprecedented and we would not have had that without this agreement.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s position was backed up by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who appeared on Meet the Press.\n\n\u201cThis is the better outcome; it keeps Iran away from a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, this is the toughest set of proposals put in place\u2026that we\u2019ve seen in any of these negotiations.\u201d\n\nOthers in favor of the deal point out that the current sanctions regime was poised to crumble anyway \u2013 many of the existing U.S. sanctions were in place in order to bring Iran to the negotiating table, and a number of U.S. allies have indicated that they are in favor of ending them now that negotiations have taken place.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Slide as Traders Eye Iran Glut\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a key ally of the administration reinforced that point on Face the Nation, saying, \u201cRegardless of what we do, these nations will drop their sanctions at some point.\u201d\n\nAsked if she thought the deal would survive Congress, she said, \u201cI hope so,\u201d and added, \u201cI believe it\u2019s our one opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Critics of the deal object to many elements of it, but most of the arguments share a single assumption as their starting point: that Iran is negotiating in bad faith.", "title": "Did Iran Negotiate in Bad Faith?
