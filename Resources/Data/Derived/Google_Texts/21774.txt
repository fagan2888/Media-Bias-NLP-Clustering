On Monday night, “The Daily Show” welcomed a new senior correspondent, Jordan Klepper, to the show. Klepper replaces former correspondent John Oliver, who left the show in 2013 to host his own news program on HBO.

Variety reports that Klepper, from Michigan, performed comedy at New York’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre for three years, while also writing comedy shorts for UCB Comedy.

Without much ceremony, Klepper jumped right in, reporting “live” from the Crimean peninsula. But the segment quickly turned into meta-humor about Klepper’s debut and the shoes he’s going to be filling.
