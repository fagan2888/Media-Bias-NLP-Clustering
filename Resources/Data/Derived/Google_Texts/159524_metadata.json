The contents were transferred to a brass box in 1855. The capsule \u201cwas rediscovered last year during an ongoing water filtration project at the building.\u201d\n\nAfter undergoing a series of X-rays, the box was opened by conservators at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBoston\u2019s Fox 25 called the brass box \u201ccrammed\u201d with historically significant items, including newspapers, coins and a silver plaque with fingerprints. One of the coins dates back to the 1650s.\n\nThe inscription on the plaque says that it was placed in the cornerstone of the building on July 4, 1795\u2014the 19th anniversary of American independence.\n\nThe plaque also reveals that the time capsule was placed there by Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, who was governor of Massachusetts at the time.\n\nMichael Comeau, executive director of the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum, told the AP the contents of the capsule are \u201cthe stuff of history.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our collective memory, our shared heritage,\u201d said Comeau.\n\nConservators told the AP the newspapers are in \u201camazingly good condition,\u201d but they have yet to unfold the delicate pages. They think one of the papers might be an edition of the Boston Evening Traveller, which eventually became part of today\u2019s Boston Herald.\n\nFox 25 reports that after study and restoration by historians, the artifacts will be displayed for a brief period before returning to their time capsule in the cornerstone \u201cpossibly with some additions from the modern era.\u201d\n\nView images of the capsule and its contents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historians have finally opened a post-revolutionary era time capsule that was unearthed in Boston last month.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Historians have finally opened a post-revolutionary era time capsule that was unearthed in Boston last month.", "title": "Paul Revere and Samuel Adams\u2019 Time Capsule Finally Opened in Boston.
