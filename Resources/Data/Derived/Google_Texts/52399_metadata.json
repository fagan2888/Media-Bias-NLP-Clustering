His hope was to become a well-paid cardiology technician.\n\nRelated: How Gov\u2019t Student Loans Ruined College Education\n\n\u201cBut after about two years of studying cardiovascular physiology and the mechanics of electrocardiograms, Mr. DeGrella, now 57, found himself jobless and $20,000 in debt,\u201d the article noted. \u201cHe moved into his sister\u2019s basement and now works at an AutoZone.\u201d\n\nThe Workforce Investment Act was passed in 1998 and \u201cexpanded in 2009 as part of the federal economic stimulus package,\u201d The Times noted. \u201cAs the economy has improved\u201d and more jobs have materialized, \u201ctraining and apprenticeships have become a central component of the Obama administration\u2019s plan to match the unemployed with job openings. About 21 million jobless people entered retraining in 2012.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem: The government program provides little long-term counseling to make sure the participants are taking the right courses and are on track to rewarding new jobs. This is a serious downside, as job training at for-profit schools can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 or more to obtain a certificate or degree, at community colleges, and vocational and business schools.\n\nIn an effort to crack down on predatory practices by for-profit colleges and career-focused programs at public and private non-profit colleges, the Department of Education has promulgated a \u201cgainful-employment rule.\u201d The measure would deny federal student aid to programs \u201cwhere too many students default on their loans or where their debt, relative to their earnings or discretionary income, is too high,\u201d according to an analysis by The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nRelated: How to Stop the Epidemic of Student Debt Defaults\n\nHowever, the for-profit-college industry\u2019s trade association sharply criticized the proposed rule as \u201cflawed, arbitrary, and biased,\u201d backed by a 100-page report by economists, and warned in late May that the rule would deny as many as 7.5 million students access to much-needed education over the coming decade, The Chronicle also reported.\n\nWhile government officials defend the job training programs as helpful \u2013 and clearly they have led to employment for many people \u2013 \u201cneither federal nor state agencies collect data on the number of people who finish job training or earn professional certificates,\u201d according to The Times. The publication did note, however, that \u201cin a nod to past criticism, the updated law does require states to better track former students to determine if training helped them find work with sustainable wages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will transform the sometimes bureaucratic federal l job training system into a streamlined program that can help many more people learn the skills they need to get meaningful jobs,\u201d Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), said in late June as Congress prepared to reauthorize the legislation. \u201cThe reauthorization will eliminate 15 programs identified as ineffective or duplicative \u2013 we don\u2019t do that very often \u2013 and 21 federal mandates on state and local workforce boards. That is what we need to be doing throughout government.\u201d\n\nMaybe not.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A misguided $3.1 billion federal program recently reauthorized by Congress on a bipartisan basis lured millions of unsuspecting unemployed Americans into costly job-training courses that left many without new employment but huge college debt.", "title": "The Flaws in the Federal Job Training Program", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/Flaws-Federal-Job-Training-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072012_unemployment_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/Flaws-Federal-Job-Training-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072012_unemployment_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A misguided $3.1 billion federal program recently reauthorized by Congress on a bipartisan basis lured millions of unsuspecting unemployed Americans into costly job-training courses that left many without new employment but huge college debt.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc283\"", "article_summary": "While government officials defend the job training programs as helpful \u2013 and clearly they have led to employment for many people \u2013 \u201cneither federal nor state agencies collect data on the number of people who finish job training or earn professional certificates,\u201d according to The Times.\nThis is a serious downside, as job training at for-profit schools can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 or more to obtain a certificate or degree, at community colleges, and vocational and business schools.\n\u201cAs the economy has improved\u201d and more jobs have materialized, \u201ctraining and apprenticeships have become a central component of the Obama administration\u2019s plan to match the unemployed with job openings.\n\u201cThe reauthorization will eliminate 15 programs identified as ineffective or duplicative \u2013 we don\u2019t do that very often \u2013 and 21 federal mandates on state and local workforce boards.\nMany desperate out-of-work Americans assumed they could put their confidence \u2013 and their meager financial resources \u2013 into a jointly run federal-state operation designed to steer them toward new job opportunities and the training they would need to qualify."}
