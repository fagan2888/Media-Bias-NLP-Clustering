is going after Ben Carson \u2014 who won a presidential straw poll of Republican voters in Iowa over the weekend \u2014 by drawing attention to colorful remarks made by the neurosurgeon.\n\nOn Monday, the DNC sent a short email to reporters about \u201cBen Carson\u2019s 2016 Momentum.\u201d The committee linked to a Des Moines Register story about Carson winning the Polk County Republican Party straw poll on Sunday.\n\nThe DNC then drew attention to previous headlines about Carson, including \u201cBen Carson: Obamacare worst thing \u2018since slavery'\u201d and \u201cBen Carson: America\u2019s now \u2018very much like Nazi Germany.'\u201d\n\nCarson \u2014 the former director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital \u2014 has acknowledged that he is considering a White House campaign.\n\nThe author and public speaker has been increasingly mentioned as a possible candidate, following a burst of attention last year for famously arguing a conservative message at the National Prayer Breakfast as President Barack Obama sat just a few feet away.\n\nA close friend and adviser to Carson recently told The Daily Caller that he believes it is likely the neurosurgeon will run as a Republican for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s very, very serious,\u201d said Terry Giles, who would serve as chairman of the campaign if Carson pulls the trigger on a run. \u201cIf it were on the big board in Vegas, I\u2019d probably be betting in favor of the fact he\u2019s going to run.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex
