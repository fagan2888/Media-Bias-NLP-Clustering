General Electric\n\nIs it ethical for a venture capital investor to praise a product put out by a company he\u2019s invested in without disclosing his financial interest?\n\nJames D. Robinson IV, a founder of RRE Ventures in New York City, which is currently investing from a $280 million fund raised this year, did just that. RRE is an investor in Quirky Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and OnDeck Capital Inc.\n\nIn a review on Amazon.com, Mr. Robinson praised Aros, an air conditioner introduced in May by Quirky Inc. and General Electric, rating it a high five out of five stars.\n\n\u201cBeautiful, functional, smart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs for cooling, seems to do a great job, and unlike some, it just doesn\u2019t seem any louder to me.\u201d The loudness remark was a response to some critics who had cited the \u201cnoise\u201d in their own Amazon reviews.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nMr. Robinson\u2019s review, however, didn\u2019t note that his firm, RRE Ventures, is an investor in Quirky and he is member of the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a pretty clear cut conflict of interest,\u201d says David Hess, a professor of business law and business ethics at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cI would think that anyone who uses Amazon reviews would definitely want to know this.\u201d\n\nIn an e-mail, Mr. Robinson called the omission \u201can oversight on his part.\u201d He also said that he thinks \u201cit is entirely appropriate as a private citizen to write a review about a product or service he actually uses.\u201d\n\nAnn Buchholtz, research director for the Institute for Ethical Leadership at Rutgers University says that, \u201cas a private citizen, he certainly has a right to express his opinion. But,\u201d she added, \u201che also has a responsibility to let people know any fact that would be appropriate for them to consider.\u201d\n\nAfter The Journal sought comment from him about his five-star review, Mr. Robinson added some new language to the text that accompanied his rating. In his update, he acknowledged that he was an investor in Quirky, but said, \u201cmy review is from my actual experience buying Aros through Amazon, and installing it myself.\u201d Mr. Robinson added that he had since bought two additional Aros units.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nQuirky, General Electric and Amazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nQuirky, a five-year-old New York-based invention facilitating company, has a lot riding on Aros, which was launched in May. Best known for tchotchkes such as rubber bands with hooks and flexible power strips, the company is expanding to the connected home with products such as Aros and Wink, a software platform for smart-home products set up to connect products made by Quirky and major manufacturers.\n\nGE has bet on Quirky, taking a $30 million stake in the company last year and announcing plans to develop several appliances in conjunction with the young startup.\n\nThe company says Quirky is just one of many corporate efforts to improve GE\u2019s agility and speed in getting products to market, and an embrace of a startup culture that is willing to experiment with new product designs in order to find a hit. GE says it expects the market for \u201cconnected devices\u201d to reach $25 billion.\n\nThe review by Mr. Robinson, a Quirky investor and board member, was more favorable than many of the initial assessments of the new air conditioner on the Amazon site. Just 32 of the 156 reviewers gave the product five stars; 42 of the reviews carried four stars.\n\nTwenty-five reviewers gave the product one star and 29 two stars. \u201cGreat idea, attractive, but TERRIBLE air conditioner,\u201d wrote one unhappy purchaser who gave the product one star.\n\nOther purchasers complained about noise. \u201cIt is easily twice as loud as the 25 year old model I was hoping to replace,\u201d wrote another Amazon shopper who gave the Aros two stars.\n\nSee also:\n\nOne Week, 3,000 Product Ideas \u2013 WSJ\n\nGE\u2019s First Quirky Device Isn\u2019t Very Quirky \u2013 WSJ\n\nInvention Isn\u2019t Easy: Quirky\u2019s Hits and Misses \u2013 Corporate Intelligence", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Is it ethical for a venture capital investor to praise a product put out by a company he\u2019s invested in, without disclosing his financial interest?", "title": "An Amazon Review, and a Quirky Approach to Disclosure", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/09/an-amazon-review-and-a-quirky-approach-to-disclosure/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DO795_0709PT_P_20140707164258.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "An Amazon Review, and a Quirky Approach to Disclosure", "description": "Is it ethical for a venture capital investor to praise a product put out by a company he\u2019s invested in, without disclosing his financial interest?", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Ruth Simon and Ted Mann", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Is it ethical for a venture capital investor to praise a product put out by a company he\u2019s invested in, without disclosing his financial interest?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-09T20:49:32-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/09/an-amazon-review-and-a-quirky-approach-to-disclosure/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5078", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Is it ethical for a venture capital investor to praise a product put out by a company he\u2019s invested in, without disclosing his financial interest?", "title": "An Amazon Review, and a Quirky Approach to Disclosure", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/09/an-amazon-review-and-a-quirky-approach-to-disclosure/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DO795_0709PT_P_20140707164258.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5078", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-09T21:33:36-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1658\"", "article_summary": "The review by Mr. Robinson, a Quirky investor and board member, was more favorable than many of the initial assessments of the new air conditioner on the Amazon site.\nSee also:One Week, 3,000 Product Ideas \u2013 WSJGE\u2019s First Quirky Device Isn\u2019t Very Quirky \u2013 WSJInvention Isn\u2019t Easy: Quirky\u2019s Hits and Misses \u2013 Corporate Intelligence\nIn a review on Amazon.com, Mr. Robinson praised Aros, an air conditioner introduced in May by Quirky Inc. and General Electric, rating it a high five out of five stars.\nAmazon.comMr. Robinson\u2019s review, however, didn\u2019t note that his firm, RRE Ventures, is an investor in Quirky and he is member of the company\u2019s board of directors.\nRRE is an investor in Quirky Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and OnDeck Capital Inc."}
