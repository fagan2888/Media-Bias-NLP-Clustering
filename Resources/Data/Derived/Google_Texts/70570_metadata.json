( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )\n\n\"The gap has closed,\" proclaimed University of Colorado football coach Mike MacIntyre in the wee hours of Sunday morning, not long after his Buffaloes trudged off a sodden Folsom Field on the wrong side of a 41-24 decision against Oregon.\n\nCertainly by any definable number, that assessment is true. Particularly when compared to the Buffs' two previous attempts at toppling the mighty Ducks during MacIntyre's regime.\n\nIn MacIntyre's first season, CU lost by 41 points to Oregon while allowing 580 yards. That gap closed to a 34-point differential last year while surrendering 597 yards.\n\nSaturday's 17-point differential in a game that saw the Buffs tied at halftime certainly counts as a gap-closing effort. Yet given Oregon's thrashing at the hands of Utah a week earlier, and the Ducks' issues at quarterback, it is easy to wonder just why that gap has narrowed.\n\nHave the Buffs truly improved enough to compete with the best the Pac-12 Conference has to offer? Or has Oregon simply slipped closer to the pack? The Buffs remain confident the answer is the former rather than the latter.\n\nHowever the evidence from Saturday, particularly during the second half, might suggest otherwise. And the confrontation between MacIntyre and safeties coach Joe Tumpkin certainly won't help matters as CU prepares to visit an Arizona State squad coming off an impressive win against No. 7 UCLA (now No. 20).\n\nAs has been well-documented, the program certainly is in better shape than when MacIntyre took over. The Buffs are stronger, faster, and deeper than previous seasons. The rate of attrition among incoming recruiting classes has slowed, allowing CU to stockpile young talent instead of banking on immediate contributions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the field, though, it remains a familiar refrain. Among the common criticisms of CU have been turnovers and questionable coaching decisions. On Saturday night the Buffs lost the turnover battle 3-1, with two of those three giveaways turning into touchdowns for Oregon.\n\nAlso deserving greater scrutiny is MacIntyre's decision to punt on a fourth-and-four with the Buffs trailing by two touchdowns midway through the fourth quarter. It's never an easy call to risk turning the ball over on downs deep in one's own territory (CU was on its own 31). Yet at that point the CU defense had allowed touchdowns on three of Oregon's previous four second-half possessions, with those scoring drives covering an average of 67.7 yards.\n\nEssentially, MacIntyre believed the odds were greater for his defense to notch two three-and-outs in quick succession than it was for his offense to pick up four yards. By the time the Buffs got the ball back, Oregon had tacked on a field goal and only 2:37 remained. Game over.\n\nPerhaps most pressing for MacIntyre is to make certain the sideline confrontation with Tumpkin doesn't become a divisive issue, particularly since the play of the secondary has been among the team's bright spots. MacIntyre had every reason to be livid for the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty assessed against Tumpkin. An assistant coach's mouth costing 15 yards is inexcusable. But the shoving and finger-in-the-face confrontation that ensued should have been handled behind closed doors and set a poor example for a team still attempting to learn how to respond in the second halves of close games.\n\nIn the week leading up to the Oregon game CU backers were hopeful their favorite program might pick up a signature win, perhaps even announcing the Buffs as an up-and-coming Pac-12 contender.\n\nNow, as they head to the desert, the Buffs must continue to address many of the same issues that have plagued the program for years.\n\nPat Rooney: rooneyp@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/prooney07", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-10-04T16:58:52-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-10-04T21:02:44-0600", "byline": "By Pat RooneyBuffZone.com", "sailthru.author": "By Pat Rooney \n \n  BuffZone.com Writer", "description": "\"The gap has closed,\" proclaimed University of Colorado football coach Mike MacIntyre in the wee hours of Sunday morning, not long after his Buffaloes trudged off a sodden Folsom Field on the wrong side of a 41-24 decision against Oregon.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28920495:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1004/20151004__05DCSROONw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\"The gap has closed,\" proclaimed University of Colorado football coach Mike MacIntyre in the wee hours of Sunday morning, not long after his Buffaloes trudged off a sodden Folsom Field on the wrong side of a 41-24 decision against Oregon.", "title": "Rooney: Familiar refrain in CU's shortcomings"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "\"The gap has closed,\" proclaimed University of Colorado football coach Mike MacIntyre in the wee hours of Sunday morning, not long after his Buffaloes trudged off a sodden Folsom Field on the wrong side of a 41-24 decision against Oregon.", "title": "Rooney: Familiar refrain in CU's shortcomings", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1004/20151004__05DCSROONw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-04T16:58:52-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-04T16:57:49-0600", "sailthru.title": "Rooney: Familiar refrain in CU's shortcomings", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-10-04T17:01:58-0600"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday night the Buffs lost the turnover battle 3-1, with two of those three giveaways turning into touchdowns for Oregon.\nBy the time the Buffs got the ball back, Oregon had tacked on a field goal and only 2:37 remained.\nIn MacIntyre's first season, CU lost by 41 points to Oregon while allowing 580 yards.\nAdvertisementOn the field, though, it remains a familiar refrain.\nSaturday's 17-point differential in a game that saw the Buffs tied at halftime certainly counts as a gap-closing effort."}
