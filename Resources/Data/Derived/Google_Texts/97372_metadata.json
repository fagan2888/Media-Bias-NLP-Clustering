Frank McNulty passed around a tray of candies and cookies in a legislative committee Thursday to emphasize that some marijuana-infused products look exactly like the regular products without pot.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t tell the difference, how could a 3-year-old?\u201d asked McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch, who is sponsoring a bill that would require all edible marijuana products to be \u201cshaped, stamped, colored or otherwise marked with a standard symbol\u201d indicating they contain marijuana.\n\nWe\u2019re not certain markings would stop a 3-year-old and urge caution for anyone who possesses marijuana in a residence with kids. But the idea of the bill has merit.\n\nThe fe deral government already warned Colorado to do everything it can to keep pot out of kids\u2019 hands.\n\nAlready this year, six children have been treated for marijuana-related illnesses at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado after eating edibles. Last year, the hospital treated eight kids, so the incidents may be trending up.\n\nThe state already requires edibles to be sold in child-proof packaging and to be clearly marked as being an infused product.\n\nBut to McNulty\u2019s point, when the products are out of the bag, it is difficult to discern the difference. Forcing manufacturers to identify their products as infused is a reasonable request and one that should be approved.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Make marijuana edibles simple to identify", "title": "Make marijuana edibles simple to identify", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/11/make-marijuana-edibles-simple-to-identify/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__ediblesp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__ediblesp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T17:54:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:45:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12cc\"", "article_summary": "Forcing manufacturers to identify their products as infused is a reasonable request and one that should be approved.\nLast year, the hospital treated eight kids, so the incidents may be trending up.\nWe\u2019re not certain markings would stop a 3-year-old and urge caution for anyone who possesses marijuana in a residence with kids.\nThe state already requires edibles to be sold in child-proof packaging and to be clearly marked as being an infused product.\nAlready this year, six children have been treated for marijuana-related illnesses at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado after eating edibles."}
