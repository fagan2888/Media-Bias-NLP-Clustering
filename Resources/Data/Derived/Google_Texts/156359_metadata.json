It is another to fear it, heeding all God\u2019s warnings, trusting all God\u2019s promises, and obeying all God\u2019s commands.\u201d\n\nIt is possible to sit in church every Sunday and read your Bible every day and still lack maturity.\n\nJames describes this condition. He said it is like a man who looks intently at his face in a mirror and then goes away and promptly forgets what he looks like.\n\nDoes that not sound ridiculous? But that is exactly how we are when we just hear God\u2019s word and not apply it to our lives. The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us, so we must, as Ryken notes, heed God\u2019s warnings, trust God\u2019s promises, and obey God\u2019s commands. As James tells us we are to be doers of the Word and not just hearers only.\n\nHear the word and put into practice what God tells us to do.\n\nThis is Shane Vander Hart with your Caffeinated Thought of the Day.\n\nRemember you can listen to Caffeinated Thoughts Radio on air at 8:00a and 6:00p on Saturdays on The Truth Network 99.3 FM if you live in the Des Moines/Ames Metro area. You can also listen online live here. Also we are on iTunes!", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/caffeinated-thought-day-hearing-bible-isnt-enough/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/open-bible-1024x682.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-01-05T07:00:22+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "bible, james, obeying god, philip ryken, caffeinated thoughts radio, faith & theology", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Shane Vander Hart: The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us, so we must, as Ryken notes, heed God\u2019s warnings, trust God\u2019s promises, and obey God\u2019s commands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Shane Vander Hart: The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us, so we must, as Ryken notes, heed God\u2019s warnings, trust God\u2019s promises, and obey God\u2019s commands.", "title": "Caffeinated Thought of the Day: Hearing the Bible Isn't Enough | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/open-bible-1024x682.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-04T23:26:12-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/01/caffeinated-thought-day-hearing-bible-isnt-enough/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shane Vander Hart: The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us, so we must, as Ryken notes, heed God\u2019s warnings, trust God\u2019s promises, and obey God\u2019s commands.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/open-bible.jpg", "title": "Caffeinated Thought of the Day: Hearing the Bible Isn't Enough | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-01-05T01:00:22-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Caffeinated Thoughts Radio", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T23:26:12-05:00", "tag": "Philip Ryken"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But that is exactly how we are when we just hear God\u2019s word and not apply it to our lives.\nThe Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us, so we must, as Ryken notes, heed God\u2019s warnings, trust God\u2019s promises, and obey God\u2019s commands.\nIt is another to fear it, heeding all God\u2019s warnings, trusting all God\u2019s promises, and obeying all God\u2019s commands.\u201dIt is possible to sit in church every Sunday and read your Bible every day and still lack maturity.\nPhilip Ryken wrote, \u201cIt is one thing to hear God\u2019s word.\nThis is Shane Vander Hart with your Caffeinated Thought of the Day."}
