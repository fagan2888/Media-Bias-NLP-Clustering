Thus far in the 2016 presidential race, two women have officially declared their candidacy. Video blogger, writer and DJ Jay Smooth knows that many members of the media are dense, sexist turd balls. So, in an attempt to pre-empt the inevitable articles about the candidates’ wardrobe and hair and weight and emotional instability, Smooth created a brief, informative primer on what not to do when covering a woman running for president.

He and guests Kat Lazo, Zerlina Maxwell, Jennifer L. Pozner and Samhita Mukhopadhyay offer simple, if obvious, tips like don’t hold a cable news panel featuring only men, don’t talk about the candidate’s appearance and don’t call a candidate “pushy” or “calculating” or “domineering.”
