KETV NEWSWATCH 7 CHRONICLING COMMUNITY. STORIES MAKING A DIFFERENCE. STORIES THAT MATTER TO YOU. THIS IS KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S "CHRONICLE." A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO OUR FEDERAL DELEGATION, TO THEIR STAFFS, EVERY WEEK REGARDING ISSUES IMPORTANT TO US, MOST OF THOSE AGAIN ARE DONE IN EVERY ORDINARY DAY CONVERSATIONS OR EMAIL OR LETTERS, NOT HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE. THAT'S NOT THE WAY MOST GOVERNORS WANT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO OPERATE. IT'S A PHILOSOPHY GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN STUCK WITH. QUIETLY BUT EFFECTIVELY GETTING THINGS DONE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO DAVE HEINEMAN WELL OVER A DECADE, THAT WHICH YOU SAW WAS A 2002 INTERVIEW WHEN HE RAN FOR SECOND HIS RUN AS GOVERNOR IS NEARING AN END AND HE'S FACING A NEW CHALLENGE, WHAT ATTITUDE AFTER LEAVING. I'M ROB McCARTNEY. Brandi: I'M BRANDI PETERSON. Rob: WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN, A MAN WHO, UNLESS LAWS CHANGE, WILL GO DOWN IN NEBRASKA HISTORY AS THE LONGEST SERVE GOVERNOR. HE' A NATIVE NEBRASKAIAN AND WAHOO. HE WENT TO WEST POINT AND SERVED FIVE YEARS IN THE ARMY RISING TO CAPTAIN. HEINEMAN'S LIFE IN POLITICS STARTED IN FREMONT CITY COUNCIL, GOVERNOR. I SO SWEAR. IT WAS HIS DREAM JOB TAKING OVER FROM MIKE JOHANNS WHO LEFT IN JANUARY OF 2005. WINNING ELECTION THEN REELECTION IN LANDSLIDE FASHION STEERING THE STATE OVER THE DECADE TO HISTORIC JOB GROWTH, TWO LARGE TAX CUTS AND A RECORD CASH RESERVE AS THE ECONOMY WENT THROUGH A DOWNTURN. WE BELIEVE IN THE FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL PRINCIPLE, DON'T SPEND IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DRIVING BECAUSE TROOPERS TAKE YOU EVERYWHERE. I PRACTICED IN THE LAST MONTH BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I THINK MY FAMILY'S NERVOUS. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OUT WHEN I'M OUT. IN AN INTERVIEW THE GOVERNOR AND FIRST LADY TALKED ABOUT THEIR LEGACY. I CAN SAY ECONOMICALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY WE'RE STRONGER TODAY THAN WE WERE A DECADE AGO. HEINEMAN GOT STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS IN READING, WRITING, MATH AND SCIENCE AND WAS ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT SHIELD EDUCATION FROM BUDGET CUTS. WE'RE ONE OF THE 13 THAT INCREASED REAL MONEY TO EDUCATION. I ALWAYS SAY IT'S NEVER ENOUGH. THE GOVERNOR KNEW BETTER THAN TO CUT SCHOOLS WITH. I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A COLD SHOULDER IN ADDITION TO A COLD STAIR. WE TALK ALL THE TIME. SHE KNEW THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED. ON AGRICULTURAL, HE SECURED $2.4 BILLION IN CONTRACTS FOR NEBRASKA PRODUCERS. HE ENDURED A FOUR -HOUR ONE WAY COVERS WITH FIDEL CASTRO. WE WEREN'T ABOUT TO SIT DOWN. HE FINISHED TALKING AT SHOULD GIVE HIM A FOUR-HOUR LECTURE ABOUT THE STATE OF NEBRASKA BUT WE WERE SCHEDULED TO BE ON A PLANE THE NEXT MORNING. THE GOVERNOR HAD CRITICS, PROBLEMS EXPOSED IN THE DEPARTMENDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND HOUSE OF CORRECTIONS. SOME BLAMED HEINEMAN'S LEADERSHIP FOR POSSIBLE ILLEGAL PROGRAMS THAT RELEASED HUNDREDS OF INMATES EARLY. ED LEADERSHIP OR ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP AND CULTURE THAT DEVELOPED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS COMPROMISED PUBLIC SAFETY. WE PROVIDED LEADERSHIP THAT SAID OKAY, I ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. THE BUCK STOPS AT MY DESK, NOW HOW DO WE CORRECT IT? A STATEMENT THE GOVERNOR SAYS SENATOR LATHRUP IS ONLY INTERESTED IN SCORING POLITICAL POINTS. WE MADE MOST OF THE CORRECTIONS. THERE'S STILL WORK TO DO. THE WORST DAYS ON THE JOB, SEEING TWO LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS FORCED TO RESIGN AMID SCANDAL. I WISH YOU WELL. IT REALLY IMPACT THE GOVERNOR EMOTIONALLY AND I SAW HIM JUST DRAINED. AFTER TEN YEARS, THERE ARE SOME THINGS ABOUT HEINEMAN ONLY A FEW KNOW, LIKE HE WAS A STAY-AT-HOME DAD FOR HIS SON, SAM. HE TURNED DOWN A CHANCE TO RUN SAM WAS JUST GOING INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL. SAM WENT TO HIS DAD, PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HIM AND SAID DADDY, IF IT MADE YOU HAVE TO BE GONE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T THINK THE TIMING WAS RIGHT. AS IT TURNED OUT, I GOT ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. ANOTHER THING WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR WILL DO AFTER JANUARY 7, HIS LAST DAY IN OFFICE, BECAUSE NEITHER DOES HE. I KNOW MAYBE FOR A WEEK OR SO WE CAN TAKE IT EASY. BY THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. ON THE OTHER HAND WE'LL BE MORE SPONTANEOUS AND WHEN FRIENDS INVITE US OVER, WE CAN SAY YES, WE'LL DROP OVER. THEY'LL MISS THE INTERACTION WITH NEBRASKANS VOLUNTEERING AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SHOWING OFF THE MANSION TO VISITORS. THIS IS A HAPPY PLACE, A WARM PLACE. IT'S VERY INVITING. THE FIRST LADY WILL CONTINUE HER WORK ON CREATING A VIRTUAL TOUR OF THE MANSION. SHE'S RAISED $400 FOR THE PROJECT. SO TEACHERS CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AND USE THEM TEACHING HISTORY. HEINEMAN WILL LEAVE WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS BUT ONE FAMILY HAS A HIGHER. SNICKERS. HE'S NEVER KNOWN ANOTHER HOUSE EXCEPT FOR HERE. GOOD WORK. JOINING US NOW IS OUTGOING GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. Brandi: LOOKING AT THAT, WHEN YOU WERE SWORN IN, TEN YEARS, HAS IT GONE BY QUICK OR IS IT -- IT'S FLOWN BY. I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY THAT I WAS IN OFFICE. IT WAS VERY, VERY EXCITING, COLLAGING, FUN. IT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE. WE HAVE TO MAKE A LOT OF DIFFICULT DECISIONS BUT I ENJOYED BEING GOVERNOR, THE PEOPLE OF NEBRASKA OR TERRIFIC. WHAT I HAVE APPRECIATED, THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS, THEIR IDEAS, HOW TO MAKE GOVERNMENT BETTER, HOW TO GROW THE ECONOMY, HOW TO STRENGTH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. NOT REALLY. I MEAN I'VE ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE, ROB. WHAT CAN WE DO TOMORROW? WHAT CAN WE DO A MONTH FROM NOW, SIX MONTHS FROM NOW TO MAKE THE STATE BETTER. THAT'S JUST ME. YOU CAN'T CHANGE YESTERDAY BUT YOU CAN IMPACT THE FUTURE AND TRY TO LEARN FROM WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND MAKE IT BETTER AND I'M PROUD OF WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. WE'RE STRONGER ECONOMICALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN AND THAT'S OUR F CUS. Brandi: DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL THOSE THINGS, YOUR PERSONALITY, WITH SUCH A HIGH APPROVAL RATING? I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. GROWING UP IN NEBRASKA UNDERSTAND THE STATE BETTER. I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN, A LOT OF SMALL COMMUNITIES. MY DAD WORKED FOR JCPENNEY AS ALL HIS LIFE AND THEY MOVED HIM EVERY COUPLE YEARS. I LEARNED FROM MY MOM AND DAD TO BE APPROACHABLE, TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE, AND I'VE REALLY ENJOYED TRAVELING THE STATE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU REALLY WE'RE AT AN EVENT TO HONOR A COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER OR FOOTBALL GAME, BASKETBALL GAME, VOLLEYBALL, PEOPLE SHARE THEIR IDEAS AND SAY YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND WE CHECK INTO IT. I'M PLEASED THEY RESPECT WHAT WE'VE DONE. Rob: YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT QUIETLY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES. FIRST AND FOREMOST, PRISON REFORM. SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WAS CRITICAL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP. FORMER CORRECTIONS LEADS BOBHOUSE DEFENDED. ERNIE CHAMBERS BLAMED YOU. LET'S LISTEN. IT WAS CREATED BY THE PAROLE BOARD AND IT WASN'T TO CIRCUMVENT THE SYSTEM. WE WORKED HAND-IN-HAND. THERE WASN'T A SINGLE PERSON THAT THE PROGRAM THE PAROLE BOARD DIDN'T SIGN OFF. THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ARE AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE GOVERNOR. Rob: DO YOU -- WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? DO YOU AGREE WITH ANYMORE? NO, I DON'T. THE LATHRUP REPORT TRIES TO REWRITE HISTORY. THEY TALK ABOUT A 2006 REPORT THAT SUGGESTED WE BUILD A NEW PRISON. SENATOR LATHRUP HAS BEEN BEEN EIGHT YEARS AND NEVER SUPPOSED A BILL TO BUILD OR FUND A NEW PRISON. BELIEVE IS DISINGENUOUS AND HYPOCRITICAL. I HAVE TRIED TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR ASHFORD FOR EXAMPLE THE LAST EIGHT YEARS TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE PASSED A NUMBER OF BILLS AND OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DO A BETTER JOB AND AVOID SPENDING $250 MILLION ON IN NEW PRISON AND WE'VE BEEN CAN CAN SUCCESSFUL. GROUP, THE CHIEF JUSTICE, SPEAKER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND I COCHAIR THAT, I BELIEVE YOU'LL SEE ADDITIONAL REFORMS IN THE NEXT SESSION. AGAIN, WE WON'T HAVE TO BUILD A NEW $250 MILLION PRISON SYSTEM. Rob: SENATOR LATHRUP PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT YOUR COMMENTS ARE DESPERATE SPIN, A DECEITFUL ATTEMPT TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY. HE'S JUST WRONG. YOU KNOW, HIS PRIORITY SEEMS TO BE CRIMINALS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. I WOULD RATHER SPEND $250 MILLION ON KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM. THEM EARLY, MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, GIVE THEM A GREAT EDUCATION AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. Brandi: THE DISMISSAL OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF CORRECTIONS WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. GOVERNOR-ELECT RICKETS SAID NEW LEADERSHIP, CHANGING CULTURE WAS NECESSARY. WERE THOSE THINGS YOU CONSIDERED? FIRST OF ALL WE DID MAKE A CHANGE. WE HAD A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT PERSONNEL REPORT. THE LEGAL COUNCIL DOWN AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, GEORGE GREEN, HE MADE MOST OF THE MISTAKES. HE NO LONGER WORKS FOR STATE GOVERNMENT. HE ESSENTIALLY HAD A CHOICE, GET FIRED OR RETIRE AND HE CHOSE TO RETIRE. NOW, WE'VE BROUGHT IN A NEW DIRECTOR, MIKE KENNY, UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE'S TRIED TO MOVE THE DEPARTMENT FORWARD. ELECT RICKETS IS HEADED. I SUPPORT THAT. WE DO NEED A CULTURE CHANGE GINGRICH WHAT OCCURRED BUT -- GIVEN WHAT OCCURRED BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DONE THEIR JOB PROPERLY AND WEyw√± SHOULDN'T ALLOW SIX PEOPLE TO TAINT THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S HINDSIGHT BUT SHOULD HAVE NOT DECLARED AN EMERGENCY ON THE PRISON OVERCROWDING SITUATION? THIS SEEMS TO BE A KEY POINT IS YOU SHOULD HAVE, AS GOVERNOR, SAID THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, WE'RE AT 140% SOMETHING, WE SHOULD HAVE -- WE DIDN'T -- WHEN IT HIT 140% YOU REVIEW THE SITUATION. WE DIDN'T DECLARE AN EMERGENCY. SENATOR ASHFORD AND I TALKED TO THE DIRECTOR AND HE SAID I CAN MANAGE IT. I BELIEVE EVEN TODAY WE CAN MANAGE THAT. YOU START TO GET TO 170% YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHALLENGE. BUT THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENT'S REPORT WE FOUND OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT USED SOMEONE HAD SIX MONTHS OR LESS TO SERVE, THEY PUT THEM IN A COUNTY JAIL. NOW WE'RE PUTTING THEM IN STATE PRISONS. AT A TIME WHEN THE CRIME RATE IS DOWN, THE PRISON POPULATION IS UP. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OMAHA JUDGES, FOR THE SAME CRIME, THEY'RE SENTENCING PEOPLE TO PRISON WHERE OTHER JUDGES ARE SENTENCING THEM TO PAROLE OR PROBATION. THE OTHER THING YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEW REPORT, MORE SUPERVISED RELEASE, WHICH WE SUPPORT, MORE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. I THINK WE'RE ON A PATH THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO CHANGE, MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER AND WE WON'T HAVE TO BUILD A NEW PRISON SYSTEM. SWITCHING GEARS, HHS IS UNDER FIRE. AUDITOR FOLEY HAS A NUMBER OF REPORTS SHOWING MISMANAGEMENT OF FUNDS. YOU SAID THIS WAS ON MY WATCH, WE'VE HAD TOO MANY OF THESE? WE'VE TRIED TO DO THAT ALL ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS A BIG ORGANIZATION AND MISTAKES WILL BE MADE. THE KEY IS CORRECT THOSE MISTAKES. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT AT HHS BUT THERE'S A CHALLENGE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SILOS TOO MANY PROGRAMS, THEY DON'T GIVE US FLEXIBILITY. SO WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT MEDICAID OR TALKING ABOUT CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN NEBRASKA IS DIFFERENT THAN CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK. AGAIN, WE NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY, LESS REGULATION. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BLOCK GRANT THOSE PROGRAMS, LET US DEVELOP OUR OWN PROGRAM. THERE ARE STILL IMPROVEMENTS SERVICES. YOU SAID I'M UNHAPPY WHERE WE'RE AT. QUOTE. RELATIVE TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN HHS. YOU MADE SURE PEOPLE WHO MADE THOSE PEAKS ARE -- PEOPLE WHO MAKE THOSE MISTAKES ARE NO LONGER PRESENT. THAT LEADS UP TO YOUR DOORSTEP AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? WHAT I SAY IS THE GOVERNOR HAS THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY, THE BUCK STOPS AT MY DESK. MISTAKES ARE GOING TO BE MADE. THEN YOU CORRECT THEM. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BOTH WITH WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CORRECTIONS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. STILL MORE PROGRESS NEEDS TO BE MADE BUT WE DO NEED TO TAKE TO PROVIDE A GREATER CONVENES THE USE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY. SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE 21st CENTURY. THEY WANT YOU TO GO TO A BRICK AND MORTAR BUILDING WHATEVER. THE PUBLIC WANTS TO DO IT AT 2:00 AT NIGHT ON SATURDAY MORNING WHEN THEY'RE FREE, NOT 8:00 TO 5:00. A ISSUE THAT CAME UP THIS WEEK, ATTORNEY GENERAL BRUENING FILING A LAWSUIT SAYING COLORADO'S LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. YOUR THOUGHTS? I SUPPORT WHAT HE'S DOING. I'LL LEAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS TO HIM BUT I'VE BEEN TO WESTERN NEBRASKA AND IT HAS A IMPACT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPE ABILITIES. MARIJUANA WILL CREATE ALL SORTS OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS. COLORADO IS EXPERIENCING FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING AND HIGH ON MARIJUANA, WHAT DO YOU GET CHARGED WITH? IT'S IMPACTING LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH ALL THAT MARIJUANA TRAFFIC GOING ACROSS OUR STATE AND DON'T THEY JUST CHARGE THEM ON DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED? APPARENTLY THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME LAWS FOR MARIJUANA AS DRINKING AND DRIVING SO THEY'RE THIS IS ONE WHERE THEY MADE A OF THE SURROUNDING STATES. WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE DECISION AND A FEDERAL DECISION? OF IS IN THAT GREAT AREA. I SUPPORT STATE'S RIGHTS. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR US BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATES SURROUNDING YOU. THIS IS ONE WHERE MAYBE COLORADO SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO US MORE, THE OTHER SURROUNDING STATES AND IMPACT ON OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON YOUR -- WHEN YOU'VE BEEN GOVERNOR, YOU AND YOU WIFE MENTIONED HAVING TWO LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS RESIGN WAS TOUGH. WHAT DID YOU FIRST FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH RICK SHEEHEY. WHEN WE WERE ALERTED. I SAY ASKED RICK SEVERAL TIMES IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO IT AND I BELIEVED HIM. WHEN IT CAME UP A THIRD TIME, I SAID WHAT'S GOING ON? I COULD TELL THAT TIME HE WASN'T TELLING ME THE TRUTH AND I SAID YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE, BY TOMORROW MORNING, YOU HAVE TO RESIGN. YOU MOVED TO LAVON HEINEMAN AND HE HAD TO RESIGN DURING THE ELECTION. CONVERSATION BECAUSE BOTH WERE THEY BOTH DID A GREAT JOB AT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. HE HAD A FAMILY SQUABBLE, A LAWSUIT BETWEEN CUSTODY BATTLES BETWEEN HE AND HIS SISTER AND HE KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO ONCE IT BECAME PUBLIC AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE LAVON DID A GREAT JOB AT CHAIRMAN OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. HEAVILY? ARE THEY FRIENDS AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES? THEY WERE FRIENDS, THEY HAD DONE A IN THE CASE OF RICK, I EXPECTED HIM TO TELL ME THE TRUTH AND HE DIDN'T. LAVON WAS JUST GOING THROUGH A INVOLVING HIS MOTHER, AND THE USAGE OF CERTAIN MEDICATIONS AND THE FAMILY FARM. AND AGAIN, IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS MORE PERSONAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THESE WERE TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT I TRUSTED. THEY DID A GREAT JOB FOR ME BUT THEY GOT IN TROUBLE IN TERMS OF PERSONAL ACTIONSES. WE'VE TALKED MANY TIMES ABOUT TAX RELIEF AND YOUR EFFORTS AGAINST -- OR WITH THE LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATURE OVERROAD YOUR VETOES THIS YEAR RESTORING 61 MILLION OF THE 65 MILLION YOU CUT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T SEEM WARM AND FUZZY. WE'LL PUT IT THAT WAY. HOW DO YOU -- WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO? THREE ELECTIONS WHERE THREE MORE LIBERAL SENATORS GOT ELECTED INSTEAD OF CONSERVATIVES AND IT GOT REVERSED IN THE LATEST ELECTION CYCLE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT RELATIVE TO GOVERNOR ELECT RICKETS AND WHAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO. IT WAS MORE PERSONAL IN NATURE. THEY SWORE MORE GOVERNMENT SPENDING, I THINK WE NEED TO LOWER TAXES -- I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE ISSUES GET DETERMINED IN A DIFFERENT MATTER IN THE NEXT SESSION BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT SENATORS THERE. SO AGAIN, I ENJOY WORKING WITH THEM. THERE WAS JUST A DIFFERENCE OF PHILOSOPHY. HOW HARD IS IT GOING TO BE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOVERNOR. YOU'RE A VOTER LIKE ALL OF US AND YOU SEE THE LEGISLATURE, GOVERNOR-ELECT, DOING THESE THINGS. IT WILL BE HARD. I'LL BE A FORMER GOVERNOR, I'LL KEEP QUIET. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THE STATE FORWARD AND I'M CONFIDENT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. I HAVE HAD MY CHANCE. WE HAD A GREAT RUN BUT IT'S TIME FOR THE NEW GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE. SO I'LL SIT IN THE BACKGROUND, MAYBE SEND YOU A TWEET SAYING LOOK INTO THIS. DO YOU TWEET A LOT? LET ME TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS LAW AND WE HAVE TO KEEP TRACK, IT'S EASIER TO CALL SOMEONE UP AND TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE AND -- BUT WHEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND HAVE SOME FUN. IT'S TIME TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. TRYING TIMES ST FOR THE STATES. JOINING THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WHO WANTED TO BE HERE TO SAY WE'RE BEHIND YOU. THAT WAS GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN BACK IN DECEMBER OF 2007 WHEN VAUGHN MAR REOPENED ITS DOORS, ALL DAY CUSTOMERS FLOODED IN LOOKING FOR NORMALCY, SUPPORT AND THAT TIME OF YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS. A FEW WEEKS EARLIER IT WAS THE DEADLIEST IN NEBRASKA HISTORY. EIGHT DIED, MANY INJURED, WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS HE WAS IN SHOCK AND ASKED EVERYONE TO PRAY. THAT'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PARTS ARE BEING GOVERNOR. WHEN TRAGIC EVENTS HAPPEN RESIDENTS LOOK AT YOU FOR THE TWIN TORNADOES THAT LEVELED PILGER THIS JUNE. OUR CAMERAS WERE THERE WHEN THE GOVERNOR SAW THE MESS FIRSTHAND, THE DAMAGE SO EXTENSIVE HE IMMEDIATELY DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE VOLUNTEERS WHO SHOWED UP TO HELP. AMERICANS ARE SHOWING UP IN SUPPORT OF THIS TINY COMMUNITY. THEIR MOTTO IS WE'RE A LITTLE TOWN TOO TOUGH TO DIE AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T. WHEN NEBRASKANS ARE IN CRISIS, LEADING THE STATE CAN BE CHALLENGING. DURING HIS TEN YEARS IN OFFICE, GOVERNOR HEINEMAN WEATHERED MANY A STORM. HE'S WITH US TALKING ABOUT THE PAST DECADE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE THINGS, WAS THERE A WORSE SITUATION OR DO THEY ALL COME TOGETHER? THE VAUGHN MOORE SITUATION WAS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE LOST MANY LIVES. PRESIDENT BUSH HAD BEEN THERE EARLIER. I WAS ON MY WAY BACK TO LINCOLN. WHEN WE HEARD WHAT OCCURRED AND WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE PILGER, TWO TORNADOES. WE WERE AT THE EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER MONITORING WHAT TODAY WE HAVE GOT A LIVE FEED FROM THE STATE PATROL HELICOPTER AND WITHIN 30 MINUTES WE COULD SEE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. EMERGENCY. WE ORDERED NATIONAL GUARD OUT AND THE THING I WAS MOST PROUD OF, FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, 1500 MEMBERS EASTBOUND NEBRASKANS SHOWED UP TO VOLUNTEER. FIVE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE WERE THERE EVERY DAY. I'VE SEEN IT WITH FLOODS, WILD FIRES. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO GET THAT PHONE CALL, DOES SOMEONE SAY GOVERNOR, I HAVE BAD NEWS, IS IT A RED PHONE, YOUR CELL PHONE? IT'S NOT A RED PHONE. USUALLY IT'S A CELL PHONE AND THEY'RE CALLING TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. I KNOW ALL THE INDIVIDUALS VERY WELL. THE ADJ.ANT GENERAL, THE DEPUTY MANAGER, MY CHIEF THE STAFF. WE DEALT WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. WE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS. AND PROPERTY AND WE'RE INVARIABLY THEREIN THERE WITHIN 24 HOURS, THEY KNOW WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THE FEDERAL DELEGATION HAS BEEN FANTASTIC WHEN WE NEEDED ASSISTANCE FROM FEMA AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FEMA. THEY OPERATE IN OUR OFFICE. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING WE UNDERSTAND. WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. WE NEVER LIKE IT TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF THE DAY I GET THAT CALL. Brandi: BACK TO VAUGHN MAR, YOU JUST MENTIONED YOU JUST LEFT OMAHA, THE PRESIDENT WAS HERE. WAS IT RELATED TO THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT? WHAT HAD GONE ON INSIDE. AT GOVERNOR, WHAT WERE SOME QUESTIONS YOU WERE ASKING? SAME THING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. WE JUST LEFT THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE NATION'S CAPITOL. BECAUSE HE WAS IN TOWN WE HAD SO MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AVAILABLE THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY WENT TO IN CONTACT WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE. WE TRY NOT TO INTERVENE. WHEN THEY NEED OUR HELP, WE'RE THEY'RE TO SUPPORT BUT YOU'RE KEPT YOU A BREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON. WAS THERE EVER A MOMENT YOU THOUGHT THIS IS MY STATE. HOW IS THAT HAPPENING? YOU ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT THAT. WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD DRIVE BY A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT AND JUST INDISCRIMINATELY SHOOT AND KILL A YOUNG KID. THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEVER DID WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP. YOU NEVER SHOT AT OTHER INDIVIDUALS. IT'S A DIFFERENT CULTURE TODAY BUT I'M PROUD, WE'RE A SAFER STATE THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE IN AMERICA THANKS TO ALL OF US AS PARENTS AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. YOU MENTIONED THE SAFETY OF NEBRASKA. SOME PEOPLE SAY IN SOME POCKETS OF THE STATE IT'S NOT SO SAFE POPULATION. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD ANOTHER TERM OR TWO TERMS? WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE MA THE STREETS SAFER? WE WOULD WORK IN OMAHA WITH THE MAYOR, CHIEF SHMADDER. REPEAL THAT LAW SO THE CRIMINALS DON'T GET AUTOMATIC GOOD TIME IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. THE CHIEF HAS A GREAT IDEA ABOUT THE GREATER USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES, ANKLE BRACELETS TO KEEP TRACK OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME AND MAY BE PRONE TO DO IT AGAIN. WE'VE TALKED TO HIM SEVERAL TIMES. WE'RE THERE WITH THE STATE PATROL, BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. CONDUCT RANDOM SEARCHES THAT ARE LEGAL TO SEND A MESSAGE SAYING WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. IT'S AN EVERY-DAY RESPONSIBILITY WOMAN TO WORK IN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. SAME THING WITH OUR FIREFIGHTERS. THEY'RE CALLED TO HELP IN MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SITUATIONS. THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. FLOODS OF 2011, A LOT OF POLITICAL QUESTIONS AS WELL AS NATURAL DISASTER QUESTIONS. FRUSTRATION FROM YOUR OFFICE a LOT OF CALLS ABOUT HOW THINGS WERE HANDLED FROM PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE DAMS BEING RELEASED OR WHATEVER -- REMEMBER, BRANDI, I HOSTED TWO MEETINGS OF ALL THE GOVERNORS ALONG THE MISSOURI RIVER, ONE OF THE FEW TIMES WE'VE ALL BEEN UNITED. WE WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE WAY WE RELEASED THE WATER. WE WOULD HAVE STILL HAD FLOODING BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED BETTER. THEY MADE A COMMITMENT THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT AGAIN. WE HAD BOTH THOSE MEETINGS AT GALLOP AND YOU COULD LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND THE FLOODWATERS WERE UP BUT I WILL SAY OUR CITIZENS AND CITIZENS OF OTHER STATES RESPONDED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY FASHION AND, AGAIN, ALL OF OMAHA CAME TOGETHER WITH COUNCIL BLUFFS. WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH IOWA IN THAT REGARD. THE WILDFIRES AS WELL. A LOT OF PEOPLE -- IT DIDN'T AFFECT US HERE. THEY MAY NOT REMEMBER THEM AS WELL. YOU WENT UP AND TOURED THE AREA. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU CALL IN THE COUPLE THINGS ON THIS ONE. FIRST OF ALL IT WAS IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF OUR STATE. ONE OF THE SMALLEST COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE, HARRISON. WE GOT FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS I AND VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND I COULD TELL THE LOOKS ON THOSE PROBABLY GOING HAVE TO BE IN COMMAND. WE DO A BRIEFING, THE CHIEF OF THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS THAT SCRUB. AND YOU THOUGHT OH, MY GOSH, HE GETS UP THERE AND LAYS OUT A PLAN AND THE FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS, THE PROFESSIONALS LOOKED AT ME AND SAID WE'LL DO WHATEVER HE SAYS, HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S TALKING1=]q√∑ ABOUT. WE COMMUNICATED WITH HIM. WE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THEY NEEDED OUR HELICOPTERS FOR AERIAL SUPPORT TO ASSIST IN TRYING TO PUT OUT THE FIRE. SO AGAIN IT HELPS WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. IT'S WHY WE PRACTICE AND TRAIN. PEOPLE WONDER WHY YOU DO THAT. IN TIMES LIKE THIS IT COMES IN HANDY. WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. WE'LL DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN BECAUSE THAT GIVES ME GREATER LATITUDE TO BRING OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND OTHER RESOURCES. WE HAVE EMERGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL STATES. THEY ALL HELP US. WE HELP THEM IN TIME OF NEED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SENTINEL OUR OTHER STATES IN TIME OF NEED. THEY HELPED US WHEN WE HAD FIRES. BUT I WAS VERY PROUD OF THE MEN AND WOMEN AND YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE, YOU GO INTO LOCAL FIRE HALLS AND I KIDDED ABOUT THIS BUT IT WAS TRUE. THERE WERE MORE WATER, FOOD AND GATORADE THERE THAN AT MEMORIAL STADIUM ON ANY GIVEN SATURDAY AFTERNOON. I WALKED IN AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE SERVING CAME UP AND SAID GOVERNOR, I HAVE HOT BROWNIES, YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE. I SAID YES, I WILL BUT I'M THINKING THOSE OUGHT TO GO TO THE FIREFIGHTERS AND WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES DO TO SUPPORT THOSE FIREFIGHTERS, BECAUSE THEY WOULD WORK 18-20 HOURS WITHOUT A BREAK. Brandi: WE HAVE MORE TO TALK ABOUT. THIS SPECIAL KETV NEWSWATCH 7. Rob: NEXT WE'RE NAMING NAMES. TALKING TO THE GOVERNOR ABOUT SOME OF THE STATE'S TOP POLITICIANS. MR. SPEAKER I RISE TO RECOGNIZE THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF DAVE HEINEMAN, NEBRASKA'S LONGEST SERVING GOVERNOR. MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TIME IS OFFICE IS HE HAS KEPT OUR STATE PROSPEROUS, REFORMING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INSENSITIVES AND IMPROVING EDUCATION. HE'S AN ALLY OF TAXPAYERS, KEEP OUR BUDGET BALANCED. CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMONG THE BEST STATES TO LIVE, WORK, DO BUSINESS AND RAISE A FAMILY. I'M THANKFUL FOR GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN'S LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE. I WISH HIM AND HIS WIFE, SALLY, GODSPEED AS THEY EMBARK ON THE NEXT CHAPTER OF HAIR THEIR LIVES. TAKE THIS NUMBER. IN THE PAST TEN YEARS THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AROUND 2,050 BILLS INTO LAW. HE'S HERE TALKING WITH US ABOUT HIS TIME IN OFFICE. TALKING ABOUT NAMING NAMES, YOU WORKED WITH A LOT OF LAWMAKERS. FAVORITES? I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH SPEAKER MIKE FLOOD. STATE SENATOR DEB FISHER, WE WORKED ON CREATING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM RELATIVES TO ROADS FUNDING. LAVON HEINEMAN, I ENJOYED WORKING WITH HIM. SENATOR McCOY HAS BEEN A GREAT ALLY. SENATOR DAVE LANDIS FROM LINCOLN HELPED MODERNIZE OUR ECONOMIC INCENTIVE PROGRAM. SENATOR RAMY JANSON FROM NICKERSON HELPED WRITE THE LARGEST TAX RELIEF PACKAGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. SENATOR PAT BORE REPUBLICAN -- IT'S BEEN SENATORS OF BOTH I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH THEM. WE DON'T HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERY OTHER. WHAT ABOUT SENATOR CHAMBERS. HE WAS THERE SO LOCK, LEFT, CAME BACK. WORDS HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED? I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES, MAYBE THE ONLY ONE WHO SAID WHEN HIM BACK BUT I REMINDED HIM, I SAID SENATOR CHAMBERS, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME THE DAY YOU LEFT? HE SAID NO, BUT YOU'LL REMIND ME. YES, YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK BUT HE MISSED IT AND HE DID COME BACK. Rob: YOU HAVE A SOMEWHAT CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. THE YEARS. IS THAT HOW IT HAS TO BE OR IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE? YOU KNOW, I HOPE WITH SENATOR CHAMBERS, I HOPE HE RESPECTS ME. WE'RE GOING TO AGREE ON TWO ISSUES OUT OF TEN. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES ON EDUCATION WHERE WE'VE BEEN IN AGREEMENT. WE WORKED -- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE WANTS TO STOP A BILL WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH AND OTHER TIMES HE HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I SUPPORTS AUTOMATIC GOOD TIME AND PROBABLY WROTE THE BILL IN THE EARLY '90s BUT I'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH HIM, I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR HIM. WHAT ABOUT COACH OSBORN, YOU RAN AGAINST EACH OTHER. YOU'RE A HUGE FOOTBALL FAN. DO YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP? WE DO. THERE IS NO INDIVIDUAL I RESPECT MORE IN THIS STATE THAN COACH TOM OSBORN. I MEAN WHAT HE'S DONE FOR THIS STATE WELL BEYOND THE FOOTBALL FIELD FOR HELPING KIDS OR WHATEVER IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY. I'LL BET YOU YOU'LL NEVER SEE ANOTHER RACE WHERE WE WERE RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER. WE NEVER SAID A BAD WORD ABOUT EACH OTHER. WE SHOWED GREAT RESPECT AND BOTH TOLD ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO FOR THE STATE. I STARTED OUT 40 POINTS BEHIND, WE WORKED REALLY HARD AND I THINK IT TURNED OUT WELL. WE GOT COACH OSBORN BACK AS THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR. IT WAS AT A CRITICAL TIME RELATIVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA BUT WE BOTH WANTED TO WIN. WE WERE GOOD COMPETITORS AND HE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUAL. DEPARTMENT AND SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS, THAT SPEAKS TO THE STATE ACE IMAGE. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT PALINI SAID. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LANGUAGE HE USED. THAT WAS VERY, VERY UNFORTUNATE. IT WAS A DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR SEVEN SEASONS, HE WON NINE FOOTBALL GAMES BUT THE UNIVERSITY DECIDED TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY. THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN NEBRASKA, WE HAVE A PASSION ABOUT FOOTBALL. WE HAVE 1.8 MILLION ASSISTANT COACHES AND WE'RE GOOD ABOUT CALLING PLAYS AFTER THE FACT BUT STATE. WE CAN THANK COACH DEVANEY AND WE'RE UNITED AROUND OUR TEAM. WE DON'T HAVE AYE WARNINGS IOWA STATE, KANSAS, KANSAS STATE SO EVERYBODY GROWS UP BEING A HUSKER FAN. EVERY COMMUNITY HAS ONE PERSON WHO IS PART OF THE WALK ON PROGRAM. DUNCAN, NEBRASKA, THE SIGN SAYS HOME OF CORY SCHLESSINGER. THE 1994 ORANGE BOWL AND NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. THOSE ARE THE THINGS NEBRASKAIANS CHERISH. YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY HEAR THESE THINGS. I REMEMBER HIM ROLLING INTO THE END ZONE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK NOW. Brandi: WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT ISSUES LIKE CUBA, TRADE MISSIONS AND IT BECOMES VERY POSITIVE FOR NEBRASKA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR COMPANIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPORT TO CHINA. HOPEFULLY OVER TIME THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF CHINESE COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN NEBRASKA. WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT. DURING HIS TIME AT GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN MADE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO ENHANCING NEBRASKA EXPORT. HE AND SEVERAL OTHERS LED MORE THAN A DOZEN TRADE MISSION TO SAY CHINA AND CUBA. GOVERNOR HEINEMAN IS WITH US. TELL US HOW CRUCIAL ARE THOSEYf TRADE MISSION AS SOON AS. THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF ECONOMICS SUCCESS. ONE THING I LEARNED OVER TEN YEARS, IT USED TO BE 15, 20 YEARS AGO WE COMPETED IN A MIDWEST ECONOMY. TODAY WE COMPETE IN A KNOWLEDGE BASED, TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN GLOBAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY. WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST EVER TRADE OFF IN NEBRASKA TOKYO AND CHINA. I'VE BEEN IT CUBA, THAT WAS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. I COULD TELL YOU GREAT STORIES. Brandi: IS THIS YOUR LEGACY? DO YOU WANT THIS TO BE YOUR LEGACY? I DON'T ALWAYS GET TIED UP IN MY LEGACY BUT THIS IS PART OF THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WE HAD. YOU HAVE TO GO MARKET YOUR STATE. I DON'T MIND BEING THE CHIEF CHEERLEADER OR SALESMAN BECAUSE I HAVE A GREAT STATE TO SELL AND MARKET. THE WORLD'S POPULATION IS GOING TO GROW 2 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 30 YEARS. NEED OUR BEEF, OUR PORK, WHEAT, SOYBEANS SO THE NEXT GOVERNOR AND FUTURE GOVERNORS HAVE TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKET. WE BROUGHT 500 GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS LEADERS TO NEBRASKA AND WORKED WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE LINCOLN AREA, THING A COMMUNITY, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA TO SHOWCASE WHAT WE HAD TO OFFER. YOU MET CASTRO, DO YOU SUPPORT OPENING UP DIPLOMATIC TIES? LET ME SHARE WHAT I THINK IS KEY. IF WE COULD ESTABLISH STRONGER ECONOMIC AND TRADE TIES BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND CUBA I HOPE THAT LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST START BY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO NORMALIZE WITHOUT SOME SORT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR FREEDOM FOR THE CUBANS. WE EXPERIENCED IT. AFTER WE CUT THE DEAL, CASTRO INVITED US OVER AND WE WENT INTO HIS CONFERENCE ROOM AND HE ABOUT CUBA. WE WERE BEHIND OUR CHAIRS THINKING HE WAS GOING TO OFFER US A SEAT. 10:45, 11:45, FOUR HOURS LATER BEFORE HE QUIT TALKING THEN I HAD TO REBUT THAT AND I THOUGHT, I SHOULD GIVE HIM A FOUR-HOUR LECTURE ABOUT NEBRASKA BUT WE HAD A PLANE TO CATCH AT 7:00 SO I HELD IT TO FIVE MINUTES AND SAID HE OUGHT TO SIGN AND EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE INSTEAD OF A $7 MILLION TRADE DEAL WE COULD GET A $30 MILLION TRADE. NEXT DAY IN NEBRASKA DOING A RECEPTION AT 6:30 AT NIGHT. HIS CHIEF EXPORT, IMPORTER PERSON CALLED ME AND SAID WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH THERE IN NEBRASKA, CASTRO AGREED TO A $30 MILLION DEAL. SO IT DID PAY TO NEGOTIATING WITH HIM. Brandi: WHAT DO YOU DO, ALONG THOSE LINES TO MARKET NEBRASKA TO NEBRASKANS. FIRST YOU HAVE TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER. WE HAVE GREAT LEADERS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THE AG COMMUNITY. SO WHEN WE WERE ON AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE MISSION WE US. WHEN WE WENT TO CHINA, WE HAD 65 SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT. WE HAD AG LEADERS,OMA BUSINESS LEADERS TALKING ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THEY TALKED ABOUT TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. I JUST TOOK THE EXPERTS WITH ME AND I'M JUST THE GUY WHO INTRODUCES ALL THESE GREAT GUYS WHO CAN HELP YOU LEAD A BETTER LIFE AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO IS CONVINCE PEOPLE TO STAY HERE. HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT BRAIN IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO LOOK TO THE COAST FIGHT THAT. HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, WE'VE REVERSED QUITE A BIT OF THAT. YOU HAVE GOT TO FOCUS ON GREATER JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. YOU NEED A BETTER TAX INSTRUCTOR MORE COMPETITIVE. TODAY REF GREATER OPPORTUNITIES IN AUGUST CULTURE. OMAHA AND LINCOLN, WE'RE A LEADER IN INSURANCE, MANUFACTURING, TECHNOLOGY, TRANSPORTATION, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, AND WE OFFER MORE DIVERSITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAN IN ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE. AND I JUST TRY TO CONNECT HIGHER COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID, WE STARTED AN INTERN PROGRAM SO WE PAY FOR HALF OF IT IF YOU'LL ALLOW A NEW INTERNSHIP WITH YOUNG KIDS AT ANY OF OUR COLLEGES IN YOUR PARTICULAR BUSINESS. Rob: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER SHORT BREAK. STILL AHEAD, OUR CONVERSATION CONTINUES. WELCOME BACK WE'RE TALKING WITH GOVERNOR HEINEMAN IN A ONE-HOUR SPECIAL. Brandi: OBVIOUSLY WE CAN TALK ALL DAY LONG BUT WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS THE LIGHTNING ROUND. BIG ISSUES, WE'RE GOING TO THROW OUT THE QUESTIONS AND GET AN ANSWER AND MOVE ON. WE TALKED ABOUT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, YOUR STANCE IN NEBRASKA AND WE TALKED ABOUT NOT WANTING PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE STATE. HOW DO WE FIND THE MIDDLE GROUND? THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE. IT'S A STATE'S RIGHTS ISSUE WHERE MARRIAGE HAS BEEN THE PREROGATIVE OF INDIVIDUAL STATES. IT WASN'T THE LEGISLATURE WHO PASTED THAT BILL, NEBRASKAIANS VOTED ON IT. 70% SAID THEY WANTED MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND WOMAN. THE VOTERS OF THIS STATE. Rob: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IS IT GOING TO BE REPEALED? I DON'T KNOW. NEEDS REPLACED BUT I THINK THE SUPREME COURT WILL STRIKE A BLOW TO. IT IF THEY SAY YOU DON'T HAVE A EXCHANGE, YOU'RE NOT ENTITLE TO FEDERAL BENEFITS. THAT WILL CAUSE A COLLAPSE AND FORCE EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE AND GET IT DONE RIGHT. Brandi: IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ILLEGALLY. WILL THEY GO BACK? COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. TECHNOLOGY AND YOU HAVE TO ILLEGALLY, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE THEM. WE TELL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AS GOVERNOR. MAKE ONE. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE HALF OF AMERICA MAD NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. Rob: THE DREAM ACT, PROVIDING PERMANENT RESIDENCY TO RESIDENTS TO CUAL QUALIFY. YEAR GENERALLY OPPOSED. AN ILLEGAL INDIVIDUAL, A KID IN PARTICULAR, IF YOU WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, LEARNED ENGLISH AND MAYBE SERVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE, A MILITARY OR OTHERWISE FOR TWO YEARS, THEN YOU COULD GET YOUR CITIZENSHIP. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER WAY. Brandi: THE LEARNING COMMUNITY IS UNDER FIRE. YOU AND SALLY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION. WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THAT? I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, WE HOPED IT WOULD WORK. I DON'T THINK IT HAS. I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF EXTRA BUREAUCRACY AND GET BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL FOCUS ON HELPING AND IMPROVEMENT. I DON'T THINK IT'S WORLD. THE COUNCIL DOCTRINE, SUPPORT? SUPPORT IT. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT'S TOO MUCH. IT'S DANGEROUS TO HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE SHOOT FIRST, ASK I THING YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE LAW CAREFULLY BUT YOU HAVE TO PROPERTY. I THINK MOST NEBRASKANS SUPPORT THAT. Brandi: ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR-ELECT FOCUS ON? I HOPE THEY ARE CONTINUE OUR FOCUS ON EDUCATION, ECONOMY AND JOBS. WHAT'S WHAT NEBRASKANS CARE ABOUT. THEY WANT THEIRS KIDS TO GET THE BEST EDUCATION WE CAN GIVE AND THEN THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY CAN GET JOBS IN NEBRASKA. WHEN THEY GET MARRIED, PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THE GRANDKIDS. THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO RAISE A FAMILY, TO WORK. SO, AGAIN, JOB CREATION, EDUCATION, THOSE ARE TWO KEY ISSUES. A LOT OF PEOPLE ORDER THINGS ON THE INTERNET. ENFORCEMENT OF COLLECTING THE SALES TAX? A LOT OF PEOPLE ORDER THINGS ON THE INTERNET AND NOT PAY SALES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO DECIDE HOW TO HANDLE IT AND THEY SHIED AWAY FROM IT. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE INTERNET TO PURCHASE BUT THEY SAY I DON'T HAVE. I DON'T BLAME THEM. WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Brandi: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH FINAL THOUGHTS. YOUR COMMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS SHOW. DIRECTLY AT 402-978-8960. SPEAK CLEARLY. WE MAY USE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE AIR. Rob: EMAIL US AT KETV.COM AND CLICK ON THE "CHRONICLE" LINK. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WELCOME BACK TO THE SPECIAL EDITION OF KETV NEWSWATCH 7 "CHRONICLE." HEINEMAN ABOUT PRISON REFORM, TAXES, GOOD TIMES AND BAD. Brandi: GOVERNOR, WHERE DO YOU GO NOW. CAREER WISE WHAT, ARE YOU GOING TO DO. WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. JANUARY 7 IS THE LAST DAY. WE MOVE BACK TO FREMONT JANUARY 8 AND REFLECT ON THE NEXT CHAPTER. I'M GOING TO STAY ACTIVE IN NEBRASKA AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE. SO WILL SALLY. MY DAD SAYS JUST DO THE JOB YOU HAVE WELL AND THE REST WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. Rob: YOU SAID JANUARY 7 THE STATE IS ON YOUR SHOULDERS, JANUARY 8 IT'S ON PETE RICKETS SHOULDER. I TRIED TO TELL HIM LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE OF NEBRASKA, DO YOUR RESEARCH, TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS AND BE YOURSELF. DON'T TRY TO BE LIKE ANY OTHER GOVERNOR. I DIDN'T TRY TO DO THAT. I JUST TRIED TO BE WHO I WAS AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ACT. LOOKING BACK ON YOUR TEN YEARS IN OFFICE AND LONGER THAN THAT, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MISS THE MOST? I THINK I'M GOING TO MISS THE PEOPLE OF NEBRASKA. THEY'RE A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE TO WORK FOR AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE OPPORTUNITY TO I LOVE THE INTERACTION WITH THEM. THEY SHARE THEIR IDEAS WITH ME. BUT THEY EXPECT US TO WORK TOGETHER. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO MISS. Rob: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MISS THE LEAST? I'VE ENJOYED EVERY PART OF POLICY DECISIONS THROUGH THE HONORING PEOPLE, BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR, TEACHER OF THE YEAR. KIDS WHO RECEIVE ACADEMIC AND ATHLETIC AWARDS. SO EVERY PART. I LOVE EVERY PART OF THIS JOB. Rob: ARE YOU GOING TO MISS AT ALL THE -- NOT MISS, ARE YOU GOING TO WELCOME THE PRIVACY OF BEING A PRIVATE CITIZEN? I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ENJOY THAT. WE CAN BE MORE SPONTANEOUS. WE KID WHEN YOU'RE GOVERNOR, YOU DON'T DRIVE SO I HAVEN'T DRIVEN IN TEN YEARS. EDUCATION CLASS AND LEARN TO DRIVE AGAIN AND MY WIFE AND SON WANT TO KNOW WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT HOME. Rob: ANYTHING KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. IF YOU HAD A MULLIGAN. IF YOU HAD A MULLIGAN, WHAT WOULD YOU TAKE IT ON? I WOULD LIKE MORE TAX RELIEF BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. YOU WORK ON IT EVERY YEAR. WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, WE PASSED THE TWO LARGEST TAX RELIEF PACKAGES IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. LEGISLATURE WILL IMPROVE IT MORE. Brandi: IF YOU GET A FOLK PHONE CALL WOULD YOU RUN FOR SENATE OR CONGRESS, WOULD YOU DO IT? NO. I LOVED BEING THE GOVERNOR IN STATES. I DON'T WANT TO BE A SENATOR OR CONGRESS PERSON. Rob: JUST A FEW SECONDS LEFT. WHAT IS YOUR FINAL MESSAGE TO NEBRASKA? THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR5x√ß9x GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR OUR FAMILY. WE'RE ENORMOUSLY PROUD OF OUR CITIZENS AND THIS STATE. Brandi: WE THANK YOU, GOVERNOR DAVE HEINEMAN, FOR BEING HERE TODAY. OF COURSE THANK ALL OF YOU FOR TUNING IN. Rob: IF YOU MISSED IN PART OF THIS WATCH IT ON LINE RIGHT NOW AT KETV.COM. THANKS FOR WATCHING, HAVE A GREAT DAY.
