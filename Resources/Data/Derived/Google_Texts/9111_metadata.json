They, therefore, do not account for the recently announced U.S. government Ebola relief effort, which includes sending 3,000 members of the armed forces to the stricken region and training 500 healthcare workers per week.\n\n\"Extensive, immediate actions - such as those already started - can bring the epidemic to a tipping point to start a rapid decline in cases,\" CDC said in a statement.\n\n\"A surge now can break the back of the epidemic,\" CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters. \"If you get enough people effectively isolated, the epidemic can be stopped,\" he said, adding, \"I am confident the most dire projections will not come to pass\" now that the international community has begun to respond.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, experts from the World Health Organization projected that Ebola outbreak could infect 20,000 people as soon as early November unless rigorous infection control measures are implemented, and might become a constant, endemic disease in the region rather than being completely eradicated.\n\nIn contrast, the WHO in late August predicted that the virus could strike 20,000 people by the middle of 2015. The current death toll is at least 2,811 out of the reported 5,864 cases, the U.N. agency said.\n\nAccording to the CDC analysis, published in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, reported cases in Liberia are doubling every 15 to 20 days, while those in Sierra Leone are doubling every 30 to 40 days.\n\nThe essence of the CDC analysis is a mathematical model, called EbolaResponse, that allows researchers to see how different actions affect the course of the epidemic.\n\nFor instance, it shows that if by late December 70 percent of Ebola patients have received treatment - or safe burial, if medical efforts fail - thereby slashing transmission rates, the epidemic begins to decrease and eventually end by late January 2015.\n\nThe model also projects that every 30-day delay in reaching that 70 percent tipping point would triple the number of daily cases at the peak of the epidemic.\n\nThe Excel 2010-based model is available at http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ebola, cdc, tops, 1, million, cases", "pubdate": "2014-09-23T12:01:38", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015, according to a study published on Tuesday by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\r\nThe top range of the estimate, 1.4...", "title": "CDC: Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million by January", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ebola-cdc-tops-1/2014/09/23/id/596360/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=ecc75493-0e82-4886-a3f8-6ecffb56ad29&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ebola-cdc-tops-1/2014/09/23/id/596360/", "description": "Between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015, according to a study published on Tuesday by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\r\nThe top range of the estimate, 1.4...", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "CDC: Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million by January"}, "epoch": 1411473698, "keywords": "ebola, cdc, tops, 1, million, cases", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-09-23T12:01:38"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ebola-cdc-tops-1/2014/09/23/id/596360/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "CDC: Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million by January"}, "article_summary": "\"A surge now can break the back of the epidemic,\" CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters.\nBetween 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015, according to a study published on Tuesday by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\"Extensive, immediate actions - such as those already started - can bring the epidemic to a tipping point to start a rapid decline in cases,\" CDC said in a statement.\nThe current death toll is at least 2,811 out of the reported 5,864 cases, the U.N. agency said.\nThe model also projects that every 30-day delay in reaching that 70 percent tipping point would triple the number of daily cases at the peak of the epidemic."}
