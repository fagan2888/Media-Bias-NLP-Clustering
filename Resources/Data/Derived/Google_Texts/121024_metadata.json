Students conducted a \u201csit-in\u201d that stretched to 18 days, and Spina served as an intermediary between the chancellor and the students.\n\nHe also weighed in on a high-profile basketball scandal at Syracuse and was witness to a decline in research money that led Syracuse to drop out of a prestigious consortium of research universities.\n\n\u201cAt the end of Eric\u2019s tenure here, I think there was a great deal of, or at least a building up of, conflict on campus, and Eric as provost was in the middle of that,\u201d said Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse. \u201cI have to say that even though at times I was critical, he was unfailingly polite and he always listened.\n\n+ Jim Witmer The University of Dayton introduced Eric Spina as its 19th president Sept. 15. JIM WITMER/STAFF Jim Witmer \u00d7\n\n\u201cI think those are good qualities for an incoming president.\u201d\n\nStudent \u2018sit-in\u2019\n\nThe last month of Spina\u2019s tenure as Syracuse provost and vice chancellor \u2014 a position he held for nearly a decade \u2014 included several meetings with student protesters camping out in the lobby of a campus building. The students refused to leave, even having meals brought in.\n\n+ For 18 days in November 2014, students at Syracuse University camped out in a campus building to protest administrative decisions. University ... read more \u00d7\n\nThe November 2014 \u201csit-ins\u201d started as a reaction to the university\u2019s decision to close a center for victims of sexual assault and cuts to minority scholarships. However, the protesters\u2019 demands grew into a long laundry list of concerns by groups across campus.\n\nThe protest ended just weeks before Spina stepped down as provost in December, but individuals familiar with the situation say the events are exclusive. In January 2014, Syracuse named Kent Syverud as its new president, replacing Nancy Cantor \u2014 the president who hired Spina as provost.\n\nThe 54-year-old Spina has spent 27 years at Syracuse, rising from assistant professor to vice chancellor and provost. When he stepped down he took a position as a trustee professor and announced he would seek a president\u2019s position at another university.\n\n\u201cI think the general sentiment was he was Nancy\u2019s guy, and (there was) some sort of understanding that after a year he would step down,\u201d said Jessica Iannetta, a former news editor at Syracuse\u2019s student newspaper.\n\nCantor, now chancellor at Rutgers University-Newark, said Spina is \u201cnot your standard careerist\u201d and would have been happy staying at Syracuse.\n\n\u201cHe did what is classic about Eric \u2014 he took some time to really carefully and thoughtfully think it through and decided he was ready, that it was a good time for he and Karen and he was ready to make that move,\u201d Cantor said.\n\nSpina declined to be interviewed for this story. He did grant this newspaper a brief interview after being introduced to the UD community on Sept. 15.\n\nResearch drop\n\nDuring Spina\u2019s first remarks at UD he said research would be among his top priorities. Several Syracuse staff members indicated that Spina, who has a Ph.D. and master\u2019s degree in aerospace and mechanical engineering, likely will grow UD\u2019s research footprint.\n\n\u201cI think he is going to do some strategic planning, and I imagine he would bring in some powerhouse faculty,\u201d said Patrick Mather, director of the Syracuse Biomaterials Institute. \u201cI would anticipate a cluster of hiring, and a building up of current strengths, such as work with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\u201d\n\nUD is in the midst of a research boom. Earlier this month, the University of Dayton Research Institute announced the largest award in its history \u2014 a $99 million U.S. Air Force contract.\n\n\u201cI foresee UD being talked about in circles it\u2019s not in,\u201d Mather said. \u201cRight now its research is more regional. (With Spina) it could be national.\u201d\n\nYet during Spina\u2019s time at Syracuse, the university\u2019s research slipped. That culminated in its 2011 withdrawal from the Association of American Universities \u2014 a prestigious group of the nation\u2019s 62 \u201cleading\u201d research universities.\n\nSyracuse was placed under review by the AAU in 2010 as a result of a decrease in federal research dollars.\n\nAccording to a 2011 analysis by the Chronicle of Higher Education, Syracuse from 1999 to 2009 had the \u201cfifth-largest percentage decrease in federally financed research expenditures of any college that was in the top 200 in federal money in 1999.\u201d\n\nBen Ware, dean of the Syracuse Graduate School, said that drop pre-dates Spina \u2014 who started as provost in 2006 \u2014 by more than a decade.\n\n\u201cSyracuse was in a research growth mode until the recession of 1990 to 1991 brought about a steep drop in enrollment and some other revenues,\u201d Ware said. \u201cEngineering and computer science together were cut by almost 50 percent by 1995 and science departments were cut by 20 to 30 percent.\u201d\n\nWare added that Spina was \u201cbehind several of the most successful initiatives at Syracuse,\u201d including helping attract $100 million in state and federal funds for a center of excellence for environmental and engineering systems.\n\nMore recent data posted on Syracuse\u2019s website show its research continued to decline through 2013, despite requesting higher amounts of funding.\n\n\u201cI worked closely with him, and I can assure you that he has the perfect blend of creativity, practical strategic implementation, and selfless administration that make initiatives succeed,\u201d Ware said.\n\nDiversity champion\n\nSpina has also touted diversity as one of his main focuses. It was an issue he confronted at Syracuse.\n\nOf the 10 deans he hired while at Syracuse, a private school, six were women and two were minorities. He also increased the number of women among STEM faculty by 30 percent in the past five years.\n\nHowever, some Syracuse students were concerned with several university decisions during the Spina tenure. For instance, Syracuse made cuts last year to a scholarship fund geared toward minority students \u2014 something students say triggered last year\u2019s protest.\n\n\u201cHe was the staunchest defender of them (the cuts), telling student organizers that he knew of better places to put the money to achieve the goals of the university but never being specific about where,\u201d the student group that staged the sit-in, General Body, wrote in an email to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nSome students and staff said the student protesters were \u201cunreasonable with their demands.\u201d\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed when the university recently said it would discontinue a popular \u201ckiss cam\u201d feature at football and basketball games after students suggested it sent the wrong message about campus sexual violence.\n\n\u201cEric was an advocate for diversity, and he would remind us it\u2019s about the students,\u201d said Lorraine Branham, dean of Syracuse\u2019s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\nA \u2018sports guy\u2019\n\nSpina is a big fan of the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Pirates. He even tweeted a message from PNC Park in Pittsburgh this summer.\n\nHe has 890 followers on Twitter. The day after he was named UD\u2019s president-elect, he tweeted a message to UD\u2019s student body, saying \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see the @red_scare in action up close and personal!!\u201d\n\nUD fans can expect to see Spina at plenty of sports events, a calling card for Curran during his tenure.\n\n\u201cWhen I took the job at Syracuse, he invited my family to be in the sports box,\u201d Mather said. \u201cHe had the full orange sports attire on. After the (football) game, he took us on the field, and welcomed us to campus.\u201d\n\nWhile at Syracuse, Spina witnessed several sports controversies. Earlier this year, the NCAA released a 94-page report that resulted in the forfeiture of more than 100 basketball victories and the loss of scholarships.\n\nAccording to the report, the university displayed a lack of institutional control by breaking rules in 2012 in order to keep star player Fab Melo eligible. Melo lost his eligibility in January 2012, but later completed an assignment \u2014 with help from basketball support staff, the NCAA ruled \u2014 to get a grade changed.\n\nHowever, he was not immediately cleared, prompting an email string among school officials. The NCAA report said one email from a member of the athletic department to a vice president said that Spina would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if Melo\u2019s grade was not changed.\n\nThe NCAA later investigated and ruled that Syracuse officials had given \u201cunauthorized assistance\u201d to Melo, who was again ruled ineligible on the eve of the NCAA tournament. Syracuse ended up losing to Ohio State in the Elite Eight.\n\nSpina did not return a request seeking comment on his role in the Melo case, but UD spokesperson Cilla Shindell said the quote attributed to Spina by the NCAA was inaccurate. She said Spina said \u201cthe process needed to run its course without interference.\u201d\n\nDuring Spina\u2019s earlier interview with this newspaper, he said this about student-athletes: \u201cFirst and foremost they\u2019re students, and sometimes we all forget that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key is to keep things in balance,\u201d he said about collegiate sports. \u201cMy father\u2019s greatest line is \u2018everything in moderation.\u2019 We embrace our NCAA Division I athletics, but we keep it in perspective and support our student-athletes, making sure they know we have their back and we also have expectations of them, as we do all students.\u201d\n\n\u2018Collaborator\u2019\n\nSpina has received high marks for problem-solving and keeping a level head. Ann Clark, dean of Syracuse\u2019s College of Visual and Performing Arts, said the way Spina handled himself during the Great Recession, when her predecessor unexpectedly stepped down, speaks volumes about his leadership.\n\n\u201cThe students and faculty of the college were incredibly concerned, and Eric thwarted panic by immediately calling all college meetings and listening and talking to people, to get the whole college through a very, very difficult time,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cIt could have been disastrous to see the school\u2019s wheels come off at a time when the stakes were so high. He (led) with dignity, grace and confidence, and reassurance, in a way that is remarkable.\u201d\n\nWhile at Syracuse, Spina helped pushed for a change in tenure structure, allowing faculty to have tenure based on their community work, in addition to scholarly work \u2014 something a few staff members say was bound to ruffle feathers.\n\n\u201cHe has very deep values and that shines through in everything he does and he is \u2018activist\u2019 in the sense he is bent on getting things done, but he has a very collaborative style and thoughtfully listens to people,\u201d said Cantor, who was president at Syracuse for 10 years and worked closely with Spina.\n\n\u201cHe was really good at bringing community economic development and business leaders together with university scholars and thinking about what innovation would really energize the Syracuse and upstate New York economy, and at the same provide opportunities for faculty to really pursue cutting-edge research,\u201d she added.\n\nSpina acknowledged that his role as UD president brings with it a responsibility to build relationships in the community.\n\n\u201cThe University of Dayton can\u2019t become a better institution unless the city of Dayton and the region continue to become a better region in terms of education, in terms of economic development, jobs and working together,\u201d Spina said.\n\nHarvey Teres, an associate professor of English at Syracuse, worked with Spina on several policy changes, including the tenure shift.\n\n\u201cHe is an excellent collaborator,\u201d Teres said. \u201cNever loses his cool, is always even tempered.\u201d\n\nNearly everyone interviewed for this story provided a similar narrative of Spina\u2019s time at Syracuse: a workhorse who would answer emails from the early morning to the late in the evening; a great listener; a leader who is quick to tackle a problem.\n\n\u201cThe deans would joke that we didn\u2019t know if he ever ate,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nCantor said what Spina experienced at Syracuse will serve him well at UD, and that he has the toughness to do the job.\n\n\u201cPart of toughness is when you really believe in things,\u201d she said, \u201cand he does.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Brian Kollars contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eric Spina coming to UD from Syracuse, which in many ways is similar to Dayton.", "author": "By Brian Kollars\u00a0and\u00a0Lance Lambert - Staff Writers", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/local-education/conflict-part-of-spina-tenure-at-syracuse/nnpKr/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/26/f4/46/GeneralBodysitin_FrankiePrijatel_DSC9446.NEF.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Eric Spina coming to UD from Syracuse, which in many ways is similar to Dayton.", "title": "Dayton president new to area, but setting will be familiar"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/09/26/93/5a/Eric-Spina0240.jpg", "description": "University of Dayton president-elect Eric Spina experienced student protests, a flagging economy and sports scandals during his time as provost at Syracuse University &mdash; moments, many of his colleagues say, that made him &ldquo;battle tested&rdquo; and will serve him well at UD.", "card": "summary", "title": "Conflict part of Spina tenure at Syracuse"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/local-education/conflict-part-of-spina-tenure-at-syracuse/nnpKr/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3077498/news/news/local-education/conflict-part-of-spina-tenure-at-syracuse/nnpKr/", "keywords": "Higher education", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b6b\"", "article_summary": "Spina acknowledged that his role as UD president brings with it a responsibility to build relationships in the community.\nIn January 2014, Syracuse named Kent Syverud as its new president, replacing Nancy Cantor \u2014 the president who hired Spina as provost.\n+ For 18 days in November 2014, students at Syracuse University camped out in a campus building to protest administrative decisions.\nAfter the (football) game, he took us on the field, and welcomed us to campus.\u201dWhile at Syracuse, Spina witnessed several sports controversies.\n+ Jim Witmer The University of Dayton introduced Eric Spina as its 19th president Sept. 15."}
