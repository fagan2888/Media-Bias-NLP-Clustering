(AP) \u2014 Breanna Stewart has joined another exclusive club, and she is only a junior.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s versatile star is the winner of The Associated Press Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year, becoming just the fifth player to accomplish the feat. Florida State\u2019s Sue Semrau was selected as coach of the year for the first time.\n\nThe pair accepted their awards at the women\u2019s Final Four on Saturday in front of a crowd that included the entire UConn team.\n\nStewart, a unanimous All-American for the second straight season, got 20 votes from the 35-member national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25. Notre Dame\u2019s Jewell Loyd received the other 15 votes. It was the closest race since 2007, when Courtney Paris edged Candace Parker and Lindsey Harding by two votes.\n\nStewart joined Brittney Griner, Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus and Chamique Holdsclaw as the only two-time winners. No player has won the award three times.\n\nStewart helped the Huskies win the national championship in her first two years at the school and has UConn two victories away from a third straight title. The 6-foot-4 guard/forward averaged 17.6 points and 7.6 rebounds while helping UConn to a 36-1 record this season and an eighth straight trip to the Final Four.\n\n\u201cPeople are under the impression that because Stewie doesn\u2019t get 30 every night that she can\u2019t,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cIf Stewie wanted to \u2026 she could do it every night. If we didn\u2019t have the balanced team that we have, she\u2019d be doing it every night. They\u2019d be talking about her as the best player by far in America. Because she\u2019s content to just play, and not worry about the numbers part of it, people forget how good she really is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "author": "Doug Feinberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "title": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/breanna_stewart_and_sue_semrau_are_ap_player_coach_of_year/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ncaa-uconn-maryland-final-four-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ncaa-uconn-maryland-final-four-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Breanna Stewart and Sue Semrau are AP Player, Coach of Year", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Stewart, a unanimous All-American for the second straight season, got 20 votes from the 35-member national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsTAMPA, Fla.
