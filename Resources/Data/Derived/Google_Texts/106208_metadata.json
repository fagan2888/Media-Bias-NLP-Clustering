Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are giving back donations received from the Texas leader of a white-supremacist group, who is reportedly linked to the 21-year-old man who confessed to killing nine people last week at a black church in South Carolina.\n\nMr. Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate, said Sunday night that he would be returning about $8,500 in donations he received from Earl Holt III, who lists himself as president of the Council of Conservative Citizens, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cWe just learned this evening that Mr. Holt had contributed to the campaign,\u201d a Cruz spokesman told the paper. \u201cWe will be immediately refunding all those donations.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Paul told The Hill that the Republican candidate will be donating the $2,250 he received in donations from Mr. Holt to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund, named after the church where the shooting took place.\n\nMr. Holt has also donated to Republican candidate Rick Santorum, Sen.
