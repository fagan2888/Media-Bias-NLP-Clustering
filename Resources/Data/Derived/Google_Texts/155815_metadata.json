Health care advocates are simultaneously celebrating the developments while preparing for the next hurdle.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a law goes into effect requiring state health care programs to cover diagnoses and treatment for autism.\n\nThe change continues a recent trend in New Mexico expanding health coverage of the neurological disorder, which impacts social and behavioral development. Five years ago, state lawmakers passed a bill that similarly expanded autism coverage for private insurers. And a planned spike in Medicaid practices here promises to provide similar treatment for more patients.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been an incredible amount of change that\u2019s occurred,\u201d says Santa Fe provider Zoe Migel, who serves as executive director of Bright Futures: Autism and Early Intervention.\n\nBut whether there are enough providers actually available to grant new coverage is another story. Migel and several others say this is especially an issue in remote, rural areas where health care is harder to come by.\n\n\u201cIf you live in Albuquerque or Las Cruces, your chances of getting good services [are] much better,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though there are mandates, the problem remains as to whether you get access to those services anyway.\u201d\n\n\"We have access to services, but we don\u2019t have enough people to provide services\"\n\nIt\u2019s something that Laura Bruening, the mother of a 13-year-old boy with autism, experienced herself. In the early years of her son\u2019s life, the family lived in Edgewood, where certified providers from Albuquerque would travel to treat her son. The distance meant limited service, and eventually, she moved closer to where she could receive care for her son.\n\n\u201cA lot of rural areas really rely on people in the city,\u201d Bruening says. \u201cI said, \u2018Enough,\u2019 and moved to Albuquerque.\u201d\n\nFive of the six state-certified providers that use Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), the most widely accepted medical approach to treat autism, are based in Albuquerque. That leaves a void for similar coverage in other parts of the state, including Santa Fe.\n\nThe scarcity, coupled with the Medicaid expansion that recently drew more than 150,000 new enrollees in New Mexico as part of the Affordable Care Act, leaves much of the state\u2019s health care services stretched thin, Bruening says.\n\n\u201cWe have access to services, but we don\u2019t have enough people to provide services,\u201d she says.\n\nTo add to the problems, Medicaid currently doesn\u2019t provide ABA care to children with autism in New Mexico above age 5. For Bruening, whose son Michael is insured through Medicaid, this meant that she had to seek this type of treatment in other ways. Until November, Michael received ABA care through a two-year grant.\n\nAs part of the coverage, health providers helped Michael with activities like reading, answering questions and sitting still for extended periods of time.\n\n\u201cYou would do things like teaching them how to shave,\u201d Bruening says. \u201cSome of those basic skills that [teens] with autism don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nABA therapy, which stresses treatment through positive reinforcement, is backed as the best way to treat the disorder by a multitude of medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Surgeon General\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one therapy that has the most research behind it,\u201d Gay Finlayson, an education and outreach manager at the University of New Mexico\u2019s Center for Development and Disability, tells SFR. \u201cThe structure of it makes sense for how to treat a person with autism.\u201d\n\nABA\u2019s required involvement with the patient, however, means its cost can be high.\n\nThe state\u2019s Medicaid program, known as Centennial Care, originally proposed to expand ABA therapy to older children in January 2014. But the additional coverage got delayed all year and still hasn\u2019t taken effect.\n\nThis might change next month.\n\nFinlayson recently attended a webinar meeting with the state Human Services Department, which oversees Centennial Care. There, she says officials with HSD indicated that they would be expanding ABA therapy coverage next January.\n\nHSD spokesman Matt Kennicott says the new autism coverage will start rolling out in January and be effective by March.\n\nThe incoming law adding autism coverage to state health care plans suffered a similar delay. Passed during the 2013 state legislative session, the bill took two years to take effect.\n\nState Sen. Bill O\u2019Neill, D-Bernalillo, co-sponsored the legislation with state Rep. Jim White, R-Bernalillo. O\u2019Neill blames Gov. Susana Martinez for the delay, stressing that she wouldn\u2019t sign the bill without a wait.\n\n\u201cThat was totally Martinez,\u201d he says.\n\nThe bill\u2019s fiscal impact report estimates an added cost of between $750,000 and $3 million each year. The governor\u2019s spokesman Enrique Knell denies that the request for delay came specifically from her office. Instead, he says legislators and staff at the General Services Department decided on the postponement because the state\u2019s benefits fund, at the time, was projected to go $70 million in the red.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s Benefit Fund is now solvent and capable of handling implementations,\u201d Knell adds.\n\nAs for the next hurdle\u2014fixing limited health care access in rural New Mexico\u2014O\u2019Neill says he first wants to see the state gather evidence about the extent of the problem.\n\n\u201cWe hear that anecdotally as legislators all the time, and we\u2019re pushing HSD for hard facts,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on our radar screen.\u201d\n\nUntil then, Finlayson anticipates that managed care companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield and Molina Healthcare will hear the brunt of patients\u2019 complaints about lack of access.\n\n\u201cWe need to incentivize providers to come to New Mexico,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Access to medical care for autism may expand in multiple ways during the new year in New Mexico.", "title": "Obstacles: Are additional health benefits for autism enough to treat the disorder here?", "og": {"description": "Access to medical care for autism may expand in multiple ways during the new year in New Mexico.", "title": "Obstacles: Are additional health benefits for autism enough to treat the disorder here?", "url": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-9711-obstacles.html", "image": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/imgs/media.images/15592/News2-MAIN.widea.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@santafereporter", "image": {"src": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/imgs/media.images/15592/News2-MAIN.widea.jpg"}, "description": "Access to medical care for autism may expand in multiple ways during the new year in New Mexico.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obstacles: Are additional health benefits for autism enough to treat the disorder here?"}, "revisit-after": "30 days", "p": {"domain_verify": "51bded99d6557f8f30245e0de5de827d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113396122025698}, "keywords": "santa fe, new mexico, news, health, medical, insurance, autism, medicaid, zoe migel, bright futures autism and early intervention, laura bruening, applied behavior analysis, affordable care act, providers, coverage, bill o'neill, jim white, finlayson", "msvalidate.01": "F1EFD0AC3641A48B692131870526DE91", "article": {"section": "Local News", "tag": "Array", "author": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/by-author-388-1.html"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "article_summary": "On Jan. 1, a law goes into effect requiring state health care programs to cover diagnoses and treatment for autism.\nThe incoming law adding autism coverage to state health care plans suffered a similar delay.\nThe change continues a recent trend in New Mexico expanding health coverage of the neurological disorder, which impacts social and behavioral development.\nMigel and several others say this is especially an issue in remote, rural areas where health care is harder to come by.\nAs part of the coverage, health providers helped Michael with activities like reading, answering questions and sitting still for extended periods of time."}
