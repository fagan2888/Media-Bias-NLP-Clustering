Lee / Special to Desert Outlook)\n\nI remember years ago being introduced to the phrase \u201ctoo cool for words,\u201d when trying to describe something or someone whose greatness was so cool that even the words to describe it had yet to be invented. And, it was apparent that even after the words were invented, they still wouldn\u2019t be enough. That is how I, and many others, feel about George Zander, my friend and mentor.\n\nGeorge died Dec. 10, six weeks after he and his husband, Chris Zander, were attacked during a hate crime incident in downtown Palm Springs that shocked many in the Coachella Valley\u2019s LGBT community. He was 71. A public celebration of George's life is planned for March 21 at the Pavilion in Palm Springs. An investigation is underway, but it has not been determined if the attack and George\u2019s death are linked.\n\nGeorge was someone who made such a positive impact in all he met, from his hometown of Seattle to the San Francisco Bay Area, to Washington, D.C., and all the way down here to the Coachella Valley. He was someone who inspired a \u201cWow\u201d after you were introduced to him.\n\nI met George back in 2005 as a youth attending Gay Associated Youth. It was a brief connection that left me amazed. We reconnected on Facebook in 2010, but it wasn\u2019t until early 2014 that we saw each other again. He became my mentor. George was always willing to take under his wing anyone who wanted to learn how to be an organizer and activist. He surrounded himself with other activists and organizers, which is probably why he was so great at activism. Even at a young age, he seemed destined to make a difference.\n\nAs a student at Ballard High School in Seattle, George was a part of the student government cabinet. After graduating in 1962, he enrolled at the University of Washington. Four years later, he joined the Peace Corps in Micronesia, a smattering of islands north of Australia. And he put the governmental skills he\u2019d learned in school to work on the islands.\n\nWhen he returned to Seattle, George got to work. His day job was as a travel agent for AAA, but he also got involved in local politics and coalition building. Starting in 1974, he was active in the Democratic Party, helping to advance LGBT and other issues as a part of The Dorian Group, the first lesbian and gay lobbying organization in Seattle. He worked for many political candidates and on various issues in Seattle well into the mid \u201990s.\n\nCommunity involvement and activism began early for George Zander, shown here circa 1960. (Photo: Submitted)\n\n\u201cI first met him on the 1988 Jesse Jackson campaign,\u201d remembers Jeanne Legault. \u201cWe were in the same Democratic district and lived in the same neighborhood, and I was the Jackson coordinator for that district. George quickly became my right-hand person and soon my best friend for life. We had a deep connection that I don't know if I can explain, but we were also fellow warriors in the fight for human rights.\u201d\n\nGeorge later became chairman of the King County Democrats Party, which he served until 1997. One of his last projects was coordinating Seattle\u2019s efforts during the second election campaign of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.\n\nIt was in 1997 that George also moved to the desert. Living in La Quinta, he continued his work for AAA. In the valley, he helped to found both the Desert Stonewall Democrats and Some Fabulous Leos. The latter organization was based on a concept George brought from Seattle, where he encouraged donations to organizations he cared about rather than getting presents on his birthday.\n\nAfter retiring from AAA, he went to work as a local staffer for U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Rancho Mirage, for two years. Contributing to many other campaigns and causes followed, including \u201cNo on Prop 8\u201d and the November 2015 election of Geoff Kors to Palm Springs City Council. Geoff and George shared an affiliation with Equality California, the statewide LGBT advocacy organization Geoff once led as executive director. And George became Equality California\u2019s Palm Springs field organizer in 2009, after stepping down from his chairman post with the Desert Stonewall Democrats.\n\n\u201cWorking with George was always an invigorating experience,\u201d Geoff says. \u201cHe was very creative politically and was always throwing out ideas to try and find something that would help us advance our goals. George brought such joy and passion to his work and that impacted everyone around him.\u201d\n\nChris and George Zander (second and third from left) attend a Some Fabulous Leos event in 2012 with Evan J.

You get to know someone pretty well like that. I learned a lot from him about advocacy and field work, and life in general.\u201d\n\nThrough Equality California, George worked tirelessly on many human rights causes in the desert. His projects included participating in the marriage equality decision rally in June 2015 and co-chairing the annual Harvey Milk Diversity Breakfast.\n\nMike Thompson, executive director of the LGBT Community Center of the Desert, met George at The Center after the Affordable Care Act was passed. \u201cHe was there signing people up for Covered California,\u201d Mike says. \u201cI had previous knowledge of him, but to see him in action, [I] was amazed to see how passionate he was in getting people access to health care.\u201d\n\nGeorge also was a passionate advocate for transgender rights. Since 2013, he worked alongside the local group, Trans Community Project, on trans-inclusive events such as the Transgender Day of Visibility. He also had a hand in, with the Coachella Valley Transgender Community Coalition, the Transgender Day of Remembrance. Most recently, George presented an event in partnership with both The Center and Chill Bar called An Evening of Equality for Transgender Awareness. And, George and I were planning the 2016 Transgender Day of Visibility at the time of his death.\n\nKenny Cassady is behind the steering wheel as George Zander participates in a parade.

He met the love of his life, musician and freestyle vocalist Chris Freitas, in 2011. They were married May 18, 2014, at their Palm Springs home. The love and respect these two had for one another were evident when you saw them together\n\nWhen George died last month, I was deeply saddened by the unexpected loss. In the trans community, of which I\u2019m a part, we tend to pick as our surrogate family those who will be there for us, love us unconditionally, and lift us up during the dark hours. George was family. As our friend Shelli Orion puts it, he \u201cwas our gay daddy, and was really there for us and loved us.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not alone. Many fondly remember his impact on the community:\n\n\u201cGeorge Zander represented the best part of our humanity.\u201d - Mike Thompson\n\n\u201cGeorge devoted his life to helping others and making a difference \u2014 and he succeeded. George made a tremendous difference.\u201d - Geoff Kors\n\n\u201cGeorge was a role model and a hero, not only to me but everyone he met. I miss his smiling face and positive energy. His presence was a gift.\u201d - Kenny Cassady\n\nGeorge\u2019s impact was evident during recent efforts to honor his life and work on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. Ray Chance, a close friend of the Zanders, started a Go Fund Me campaign to raise funds to pay for George\u2019s star. Less than a week after the campaign launch, the $11,160 fundraising goal was reached. While there will be a star to immortalize George, he also lives on through those he touched as a mentor, activist, leader and friend.\n\nRest in power, George.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Celebration of George William Zander's life\n\nWhen: 5-8 p.m. March 21\n\nWhere: Palm Springs Pavilion, 401 S.
