New equal pay push for midterms\n\nAt the White House on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will sign two executive actions on equal pay, as Senate Democrats move for a show vote this week on the Paycheck Fairness Act \u2014 launching Democrats\u2019 first large-scale coordinated message effort ahead of this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nOne of the new executive orders on Tuesday, Equal Pay Day, will prohibit federal contractors from retaliating against workers who discuss their salaries \u2014 a move one White House official called \u201ca critical tool to encourage pay transparency.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama will also sign a presidential memorandum instructing Labor Secretary Tom Perez to create new regulations requiring federal contractors to report salary summary data to the government, including sex and race breakdowns. The hope, according to the White House, is that this will encourage other employers to submit data voluntarily, enabling more targeted government enforcement.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's challenge: Don't blow it)\n\nThe president will bring Lilly Ledbetter \u2014 namesake of the first bill he signed as president, which expanded women\u2019s ability to recover wages lost to discrimination \u2014 back to the White House for the signing event in the East Room on Tuesday.\n\nAnd Obama will make a speech calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act \u2014 but, as with the minimum wage increase for federal contractors Obama announced in his State of the Union in January, the White House official called this new executive order another instance of \u201cleading by example\u201d when Congress won\u2019t act.\n\nMeanwhile, as Senate Democrats vote on Tuesday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will launch a new \u201cGOP Pay Gap\u201d branding campaign that will include the release of state-by-state data on the pay differences, a high-five figures online advertising campaign, a social media campaign and specified email alerts to supporters tracking the votes.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How an Obama pool stop went viral)\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Democrats are making such a push on equal pay: They say their polls and focus groups are showing them that pressing Republicans on their opposition to the bill is quickly ticking up to be one of their most effective negative messages for persuadable voters this year. According to Democrats who\u2019ve seen the numbers, women respond, men respond \u2014 in the same kind of high numbers, no matter where they are in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an issue that appeals to or affects women. As the economy has recovered, too many American families are being left behind,\u201d said DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil. \u201cAnd the only response Republicans have is to pretend the problem doesn\u2019t exist at all.\u201d\n\nThe difference between the Democratic and Republican positions on equal pay, argued EMILY\u2019s List press secretary Marcy Stech, \u201cunderscores the clearest difference between the parties.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee will be doing its own social media campaign, paired with a Web video going out to supporters and a petition it has prepared to send out to its own email list, along with those of the other national Democratic campaign committees.\n\nTuesday morning, together with EMILY\u2019s List, the DNC will hold a call with female Hispanic leaders to combine two demographic appeals: Women overall make 77 cents on the dollar compared with men, but Hispanic women make 54 cents on the dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, EMILY\u2019s List has positioned itself as the nexus of information and guidance on equal pay at the local level. The group has guided candidates through creating online petitions and talking points, and its affiliated research arm, American Women, released state-by-state \u201ctoolkits\u201d last week that include a tailored conversation guide with highlighted local statistics on how each state ranks on women\u2019s economic issues.\n\nThose include each state\u2019s women\u2019s economic grade from the Center for American Progress, and polls like the ones cited in its Shriver Report showing how much support for women\u2019s economic issues has grown \u2014 highest among Democrats, but with Republicans and independents not far behind.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and an informal adviser who\u2019s been pushing the White House behind the scenes to focus more on the potency of women\u2019s issues this year, said support for equal pay specifically is \u201cthrough the roof.\u201d\n\nKatie Packer Gage, a Republican consultant who started a firm last year geared around helping her party appeal to women, acknowledges that from the data she has seen, women do believe that they get paid less for the same job men do. She blames that on anecdotal evidence shared among women and a disinformation campaign from Democrats.\n\nThe only way to fight that, Gage says, is for Republicans to move quickly to speak out strongly in favor of equal pay for equal work, eliminating any rhetorical distance with Democrats, and then remind voters they support the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nThen, Gage said, Republicans need to press the idea that the bill won\u2019t be enough, and that these problems can\u2019t be fixed by that legislation \u2014 or by anything else likely to come out of Washington.\n\n\u201cEver notice that the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act is about 10 times longer than the bills originally surrounding pay fairness? It\u2019s so obviously a political statement,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an honest world, this bill would be called the Trial Lawyer Job Security Act.\u201d\n\nGage has told GOP candidates to hit Democrats with the distraction argument and turn the pitch to female voters back on them by talking about the women who, she says, are losing their insurance plans under Obamacare.\n\nEven within the broader pitch to women that\u2019s shaping Democrats\u2019 2014 strategy, equal pay sticks out. Unlike just about every other issue within the women\u2019s agenda and beyond, every competitive Democrat is on the same page, and the Republican counterargument is generally limited to calling the conversation a distraction and the proposed legislative solution unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the Republican argument,\u201d Tanden said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not an argument that seems like it\u2019s resonating with voters.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: Lilly Ledbetter's name was misspelled in an earlier version of this story.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: David Cohen @ 04/06/2014 03:12 PM CORRECTION: Lilly Ledbetter's name was misspelled in an earlier version of this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president will sign two executive actions on equal pay this Tuesday.", "title": "New equal pay push for midterms", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/obama-equal-pay-push-105406.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/04/04/140404_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Paycheck Fairness Act,Women Rule,EMILY's List,Salaries,Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The president will sign two executive actions on equal pay this Tuesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, EMILY\u2019s List has positioned itself as the nexus of information and guidance on equal pay at the local level.\nNew equal pay push for midtermsAt the White House on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will sign two executive actions on equal pay, as Senate Democrats move for a show vote this week on the Paycheck Fairness Act \u2014 launching Democrats\u2019 first large-scale coordinated message effort ahead of this year\u2019s midterms.\n\u201cEver notice that the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act is about 10 times longer than the bills originally surrounding pay fairness?\nEven within the broader pitch to women that\u2019s shaping Democrats\u2019 2014 strategy, equal pay sticks out.\nThe hope, according to the White House, is that this will encourage other employers to submit data voluntarily, enabling more targeted government enforcement."}
