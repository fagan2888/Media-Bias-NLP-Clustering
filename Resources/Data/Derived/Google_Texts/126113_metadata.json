As the mother of two children who worked part time for several years before taking this job, I was all-in on this story. Could I really be enjoying peak health while working full time and \u2014 yes \u2014 still raising those kids. (Disclosure that my husband does help: Thanks, dear!)\n\nNPR pointed out that one explanation could be self-selection. From the story:\n\nMothers who were in better health to begin with may have chosen to work regularly. Researchers Adrianne Frech and Sarah Damaske, who conducted the 2012 study, also found that moms who worked steadily had other advantages. They were more likely to have grown up with two married parents, more likely to have completed high school and more likely to be in a stable relationship before the birth of their first child.\n\nThose last three items are true for me.\n\nIn a separate study of 122 working folks, both men and women, Damaske had volunteers collect saliva samples during the day. Researchers then measured the levels of cortisol, a stress hormone.\n\nThe levels were fine during the day \u2014 and spiked when the people got home.\n\nLow-income people and those without children were especially likely to report lower levels of the stress hormone when they were at work.\n\nDamaske has new research that sheds light on another factor that might be in play:\n\nIt\u2019s a factor that sociologists such as [UC Berkeley\u2019s] Arlie Hochschild and psychiatrists such as Sigmund Freud have examined in the past. Hochschild, for one, found that many people find work to be less stressful than their home lives. Work was, in fact, a haven. Freud once said work and love were two wellsprings of emotional satisfaction in life.\n\nDamaske also pointed out that work can be less stressful \u201cbecause we are emotionally entangled at home in a way that we aren\u2019t at work.\u201d\n\nUm, yes. I admit to being more emotionally entangled at home than I am at work.\n\nMore from NPR:\n\nDamaske said the study offered a different window into why women who work steady jobs might experience better physical and mental health than those who work part time, or not at all. It is still possible that women who are healthier to begin with are more likely to hold steady jobs, but Damaske said it might also be the case that work had positive effects on women\u2019s health.\n\nLast week NPR published the results of its nationwide poll on stress \u2014 and reported that \u201cjuggling busy family schedules\u201d ranked right up there as a top source of stress for many people \u2014 other sources were the death of a loved one and health problems.\n\nSo why are tough jobs and difficult bosses such a common topic of conversation? Damaske told NPR that it could be because it\u2019s more socially acceptable to complain about work than to discuss health problems or troubles at home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mothers who work full time report better physical and mental health than mothers who work part time.
