Even if that is the case, then it is an estimate that is off by over $100 million.\n\nThe report summary states, \u201c[a]s a result, it appears that Mr. Slavitt\u2019s testimony before the committee was based on estimates and conjecture, not facts. Mr. Slavitt\u2019s original source for the \u2018over $200 million\u2019 figure he testified to has still not been provided to the committee.\u201d\n\nIn response, Vice Chairman Blackburn said, \u201cCMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt either misspoke to the tune of $178.5 million in taxpayer dollars or he lied under oath in an effort to make the American people believe the President\u2019s health care law is working. The truth is, the Affordable Care Act is in no way affordable and this Administration cannot continue to hide the facts. We will continue our work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to hold this Administration accountable for the billions in taxpayer dollars it has wasted on failed Obamacare exchanges.\u201d\n\nAt the December hearing, Vice Chairman Blackburn questioned CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt about how much grant money was spent and how much would be returned to the taxpayers.

Do you have a proper accounting of that?\u201d\n\nSlavitt: \u201cWe do. In fact, we can provide you with an accounting of every dollar that\u2019s been spent, every dollar that hasn\u2019t been spent that we still have control of, and we are in the process \u2014 in many cases \u2014 of pulling that money back.\u201d\n\nBlackburn: \u201cOK. Then do provide us with that accounting because we will need to see that.\u201d\n\nSlavitt: \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nSections\n\nTopics", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressman Marsha Blackburn 7th District of Tennessee Washington, D.C. - Congressman Marsha Blackburn, Vice Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committ", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Clarksville, TN Online", "description": "Congressman Marsha Blackburn 7th District of Tennessee Washington, D.C. \u2013 Congressman Marsha Blackburn, Vice Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, commented on a new report that c\u2026", "title": "Marsha Blackburn says Obamacare Official Mislead Congress and the American People", "url": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2016/05/13/marsha-blackburn-says-obamacare-official-mislead-congress-american-people/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marsha-Blackburn.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressman Marsha Blackburn 7th District of Tennessee Washington, D.C. - Congressman Marsha Blackburn, Vice Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committ", "creator": "@Clarksville_TN", "image": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marsha-Blackburn.jpg?w=640", "title": "Marsha Blackburn says Obamacare Official Mislead Congress and the American People - Clarksville, TN Online", "site": "@clarksville_tn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Andy Slavitt, Congressman, Marsha Blackburn, Obamacare, Tennessee, Tennessee 7th District, washington d.c.", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-13T09:00:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-13T07:19:46+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Andy Slavitt, Congressman, Marsha Blackburn, Obamacare, Tennessee, Tennessee 7th District, washington d.c."}, "article_summary": "The report summary states, \u201c[a]s a result, it appears that Mr. Slavitt\u2019s testimony before the committee was based on estimates and conjecture, not facts.\nEven if that is the case, then it is an estimate that is off by over $100 million.\nBlackburn: \u201cWhat we want to know is, where is the balance of the money?\nThe truth is, the Affordable Care Act is in no way affordable and this Administration cannot continue to hide the facts.\nThen do provide us with that accounting because we will need to see that.\u201dSlavitt: \u201cWe will.\u201dSectionsTopics"}
