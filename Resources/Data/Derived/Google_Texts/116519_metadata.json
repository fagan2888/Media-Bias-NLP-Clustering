(Despite Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope\u2019s prior appearances on the \u201cStern Show,\u201d the 60-year-old has his pop culture blind spots like anyone else \u2014 he apparently just learned about Phish culture, too.)\n\nWhen playing back Wolfie\u2019s interviews on Tuesday\u2019s show, Stern and news anchor Robin Quivers gave color commentary. They pair came up with a somewhat brilliant notion after listening to one Juggalo\u2019s bragging about \u201cjust drinking it off and going to bed\u201d if he were to ever break his shoulder.\n\nNo ObamaCare for this Juggalo\u2013he\u2019s going into a U.S. special forces unit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this guy\u2019s fucking around ,\u201d Stern said. \u201cStage 3 cancer? Drink it off. Now I know why I stay holed up in my apartment\u2013afraid to go outside. I don\u2019t know from this.\u201d\n\nThen, Wolfie interviewed a Juggalo named a Mr. Rottentree of Delaware as well as a few other angry, don\u2019t-give-a-fuck types from the show, and Quivers and Stern realized the a solution to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria:\n\nQuivers: \u201cWe\u2019re using the wrong people for these attacks and stand-offs.\u201d Stern: \u201cImagine a bunch of guys in clown outfits, like, with hatchets. Those fuckin\u2019 Arab dudes would get right in line.\u201d Quivers: \u201cThey would run.\u201d Stern: \u201cOur military should be dressed as clowns, evil clowns. Boy that would scare ISIS. Because ISIS has that whole cool uniform\u2013they got the black covering over their faces when they behead people.\u201d Quivers: \u201cThe Indians used to paint their faces to scare their enem[ies]. We should be doing that again.\u201d Stern: \u201cThe Juggalos are onto something.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Howard Stern to Obama: Send Juggalos to fight ISIS", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Imagine a bunch of guys in clown outfits, like, with hatchets, Stern said.
