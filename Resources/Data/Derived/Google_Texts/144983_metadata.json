You wouldn\u2019t know it, but we are,\u201d the president said Friday.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the president \u2014 the president of the United States, mind you \u2014 says Americans are better off, they just don\u2019t know it.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama ignores Boehner\u2019s lawsuit threat: \u2018I\u2019ll keep taking actions on my own\u2019\n\nThat is the height to which the president has raised his level of mendacity. He has the sheer audacity to tell Americans that he has successfully turned the economy around, that things are all good, but that there are no real quantifiable indicators by which they could ever know that.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Obama says Americans have never had it so good.\n\n\u201cOver the past 51 months, our businesses have created 9.4 million new jobs,\u201d he said at a feel-good stop in Minnesota. \u201cOur housing market is rebounding. Our auto industry is booming. Our manufacturing sector is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We\u2019ve made our tax code fairer. We\u2019ve cut our deficits by more than half. More than 8 million Americans have signed up for private insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: 2014 Midterms: Vulnerable Democrats\n\nOf course, as usual with the president, none of that is true. In 2007, there were 146.6 million Americans employed. Last month, there were 145.7 million people in the workforce. But it\u2019s all worse than that. The labor force participation rate dropped more than 3 percentage points, which equals nearly 8 million people. Now, just 62.8 percent of working-age Americans hold jobs, a dismal number that\u2019s the lowest in 35 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Candidate Obama (is he ever anything else?) promised an unemployment rate of 5 percent as the impetus to pass his $1 trillion stimulus plan. While his minions now cooking the books claim the rate is 6.3 percent, millions of Americans have simply fallen out of the workforce \u2014 disappeared. The number of \u201cunderemployed\u201d \u2014 those who want to work full time but can find only a part-time job \u2014 is 16 percent, Gallup says.\n\nMeanwhile, home sales nationwide have fallen 5 percent versus last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Washington Post, one of the most Obama-friendly newspapers in the country, recently offered this headline: \u201cTwo charts that show why the housing market is off track.\u201d Right now, home sales are running at 2010 levels.\n\nThe number of employees in the auto industry, while rising, is still below those in 2008. That year, there were 880,000 workers in auto manufacturing; today, there are 850,000. Dealers are also down from 1.83 million to 1.82 million. Not bad, but not good \u2014 not even treading water.\n\nOn the deficit, Mr. Obama fudges the numbers as only he can. He ran a $1 trillion-plus deficit each of his first three years in office. Then in fiscal year 2013, that dropped to $680 billion (so roughly a 32 percent drop). His \u201ccut our deficits by more than half\u201d comes from comparing that number to the deficit he inherited when he took office, $1.4 trillion. He\u2019ll surpass $5 trillion in debt this year, but to him, it\u2019s all good.\n\nMost astute Americans know the Obamacare numbers are absurd. But Mr. Obama also words the claim carefully, as skilled liars often do.\n\n\u201cMore than 8 million Americans have signed up for private insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act.\u201d While no administration official has ever provided proof of that claim, millions were forced out of their insurance plans. Get it? \u201cSigned up\u201d?\n\nOne thing Mr. Obama didn\u2019t mention in Minnesota was the brand new number released on the gross domestic product, a key indicator on the state of the U.S. economy. Obama economic gurus had predicted 2.6 percent growth in the first three months of 2014. When they released a preliminary number, those gurus said the economy had grown by 0.1 percent. When they revised the number last month, it had become a 1.1 percent contraction. And last week, the final number came out: The economy contracted by 2.9 percent.\n\nSo despite Mr. Obama\u2019s lofty claims, the economy has done \u2014 nothing. In fact, it\u2019s all getting worse \u2014 and Americans know it.\n\nStill, he plans events next week pushing the economy and his policies. And there\u2019s only one reason: It\u2019s election time. Maybe Democrats can borrow the president\u2019s brilliant words as their slogan this midterm election: \u201cYou\u2019re Better Off, You Just Don\u2019t Know It.\u201d\n\nIt certainly will be the epitaph of this miserably failed president.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
