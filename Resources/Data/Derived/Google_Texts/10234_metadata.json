His name surfaced as a presidential contender after his speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast drew widespread media attention. An aide to Carson told The Texas Tribune he would probably announce his candidacy for president by May 1.\n\nThe importance of education was a central theme of Carson\u2019s remarks Thursday, as he advocated for the expansion of charter schools and criticized entitlement programs. He recounted his rags-to-riches story of growing up poor in Detroit \u2014 his mother, one of 24 children, married at age 13, he said \u2014 to becoming one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent neurosurgeons.\n\nBut Carson\u2019s position on health reform were perhaps most interesting to his audience. At the conference, hospital association members discussed their priorities for the 2015 legislative session, especially how to get lawmakers to consider a \u201cTexas way\u201d to expand health insurance to low-income adults. Such a proposal would use Medicaid funds made available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is Medicaid is underfunded. We need the Legislature to step up and address this situation,\u201d said David Huffstutler, president and CEO of St. David\u2019s HealthCare in Austin. \u201cTo be blunt, the current system is broken.\u201d\n\nCarson called for reforms to Medicaid but did not provide specifics. \u201cRecipients of the Medicaid dollars in many cases are treated as second-class citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet the amount of money we are spending could easily make them first-class citizens.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: The Texas Hospital Association and St. David's HealthCare are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.
