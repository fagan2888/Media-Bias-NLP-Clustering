You want to have something to fall back on.\"\n\nIf you are interested in applying for the program call the Trellis office, formerly known as Phoenix Neighborhood Housing Services, at 602-258-1659.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The nonprofit housing assistance group Trellis, announced this week, that the FirstBank Holding Company, has invested $1 million to make housing more affordable for low and middle income families.", "og": {"url": "http://www.azfamily.com/story/28581562/new-program-aims-to-help-arizona-home-buyers", "type": "article", "description": "The nonprofit housing assistance group Trellis, announced this week, that the FirstBank Holding Company, has invested $1 million to make housing more affordable for low and middle income families.", "title": "New program aims to help Arizona home buyers"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nonprofit housing assistance group Trellis, announced this week, that the FirstBank Holding Company, has invested $1 million to make housing more affordable for low and middle income families.", "card": "summary", "title": "New program aims to help Arizona home buyers"}, "wnreadableurl": "new-program-aims-to-help-arizona-home-buyers", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2015/03/21", "fb": {"app_id": 139300592813627}, "owner": "KTVK", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5ae\"", "article_summary": "By Jason BarryPHOENIX -- There are a lot of hard working Arizonans who can't afford a new home.\nTrellis president Patricia Garcia Duarte said that the program will not only help hard working Arizonans buy a home, it should also give a boost to the Valley's housing market.\nIf you are interested in applying for the program call the Trellis office, formerly known as Phoenix Neighborhood Housing Services, at 602-258-1659.\nFuller said he's encouraged by any new program that's helps home buyers with their down payment.\nThe new program will provide qualified home buyers up to $25,000, to be used as a down payment towards the purchase of a new home."}
