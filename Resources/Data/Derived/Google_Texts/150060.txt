I support Hillary Clinton, even though she has given ambiguous answers to questions about email, sources of funding, use of money and the positions she has taken in companies. Health care is important. It's also important to have a president who has experience in foreign policy. I do remember when she was first lady and tried with her husband to reform health care. I support her support of the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders would dismantle it into a single payer system. I prefer it, but it won't happen, and he is dismantling something that is working. While Sanders is straightforward regarding the use of big money and super PACS I guess Clinton is more electable in the end. As a professor of theology and women's studies, I'm pleased to see a strong woman candidate. She is someone with intelligence and experience in foreign policy and can speak intelligently on the issues. She is not just a reality show persona. Louise Prochaska
