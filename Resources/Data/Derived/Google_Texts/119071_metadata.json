It represents 1.9 million workers primarily in the service and healthcare industries. It is also very politically active and often opposed to Republicans. The union asked its members in an action alert message what they fear most about a president that doesn\u2019t stand with working families.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear if we elect a president in 2016 who doesn\u2019t stand with working families?\u201d the action alert noted. \u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, with many Republican presidential candidates moving more and more to the extreme right and the GOP-controlled leadership in Congress is joining them.\u201d\n\nMembers can list that they are fearful of attacks on immigrant families, attacks on women\u2019s reproduction rights, minimum wages, climate change and voter identification laws. All the policies listed are areas Republicans and labor unions tend to disagree on.\n\n\u201cThe Republican-controlled Congress repeals Obamacare and a new president fails to veto it, reversing all the gains we\u2019ve made in getting families covered with health insurance,\u201d the action alert continued. \u201cAs a country, we fail to deal with factors that cause the catastrophic climate change affecting our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, no major Republican presidential candidate has explicitly said they stand opposed to working families. For instance, while unions and Democrats tend to support raising the minimum wage, Republicans are opposed out of concern it may cause job loss and higher cost for goods and services.\n\nHealthcare is another issue Republicans and unions disagree on. While supporters of Obamacare argue it will help more people afford health insurance, critics warn it is more likely to cause major problems. There have even been reports the law has made it harder for some to get healthcare.\n\nThe SEIU did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
