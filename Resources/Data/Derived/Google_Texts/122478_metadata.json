In particular, more restrictions on access would decrease the risk of a breach by a malicious or compromised insider, according to the GAO.\n\nFurthermore, although CMS has taken steps to oversee the security controls governing the state-based health insurance exchanges, the report criticizes the agency's triennial testing frequency and the lack of a clear definition of its responsibilities, procedures and, in some cases, time frames for correcting deficiencies.\n\nThree state-based exchanges also had \"significant weaknesses\" related to the potential compromise of data, according to the report.\n\nOne state had authentication servers that accepted unencrypted connections, making it susceptible to outside surveillance and possible information gathering. Another state did not filter URL requests through a firewall, and a third did not enforce high-level encryption on its Windows servers.\n\nGAO issued a separate report with limited distribution that includes 27 recommendations aimed at improving oversight on the part of CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Those recommendations address implementing stronger monitoring practices, bolstering security weaknesses in the data hub and other ideas for better securing the state-based marketplaces.\n\nHHS officials concurred with all GAO's recommendations and said they are taking steps to address them. The three states generally concurred with their recommendations as well.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "FCW,federal computer week, government technology news, fcw, fcw.com, federal computer weekly, federal computer week magazine, federal computer news, federal computer, federal weekly, fcw daily, fed 100, federal 100, fed 100 awards, federal 100 awards, fed 100 winners, rising star awards, government employment news, federal cio, chief information officer, chief technology officer, government executive, federal executive, fisma, vivek kundra, Federal 100 awards, white house, obama, NSPS, security clearance, gpo, sbinet, nmci, recovery.gov, intellipedia, conflicker, future combat systems, registered traveler, homeland security, e-verify, dhs, homeland security, cybersecurity, gsa, alliant, fisma, cyber command, nmci, kelman, fcw insider, john klossner, dod techipedia, cloud computing, virtualization, dod cyber command, fdcc compliance, disa, ngen navy, grants.gov, dhs eagle ii, forge.mil, fose, telework, government 2.0, obama", "og": {"url": "https://fcw.com/articles/2016/03/28/gao-healthcare-dot-gov.aspx", "image": "https://fcw.com/~/media/GIG/FCWNow/Topics/Health/HealthCare.gov%20snapshot.jpg", "site_name": "FCW", "description": "The nonpartisan Capitol Hill watchdog greeted the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act with a bracing dose of oversight about the security weaknesses of HealthCare.Gov.", "title": "GAO calls for improved security for HealthCare.Gov -- FCW"}, "description": "The nonpartisan Capitol Hill watchdog greeted the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act with a bracing dose of oversight about the security weaknesses of HealthCare.Gov."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3df4\"", "article_summary": "OversightGAO calls for improved security for HealthCare.GovA Government Accountability Office report released on the six-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act highlights several potential security weaknesses and oversight deficiencies for the HealthCare.gov website.\nNevertheless, the GAO report outlines areas in which CMS could bolster the security and privacy of the data processed via HealthCare.gov.\nThose recommendations address implementing stronger monitoring practices, bolstering security weaknesses in the data hub and other ideas for better securing the state-based marketplaces.\nAuditors identified potential security weaknesses in technical controls and software for the Federal Data Services Hub, the portal for exchanging personal health information between the Federally Facilitated Marketplace and other government agencies.\nThe hub's potential weaknesses include insufficient timeliness in patching security vulnerabilities, insufficient security configuration of the hub's administrative network and the need for more restrictions on the functions CMS administrators are allowed to access."}
