I felt bad for all the housewives-in-training from the 1940s and 1950s who were forced to wear boy-cut shorts and tragic \"bikinis\" that only showed a finger's length of midriff.\n\nBut then I realized how good they had it. Covering up meant you could actually play in the ocean or sit on a towel without hating on your poochy belly. Sadly, one-pieces back then were mostly boring razorbacks that steamrolled over any cleavage.\n\nKeep the retro details minimal, like in this Profile by Gottex Belle Curve Halter Two-Piece ($100) at SouthMoonUnder.com.

A search for \"retro swimsuit\" on the crafting website Etsy pulls up more than 4,500 entries.\n\nEven the queen of sultry suits, Victoria's Secret, carries a high-waist mesh bikini for all those angels with stretch marks.\n\n\"Many women were tired of the smaller-the-better approach,\" says ModCloth stylist Emily Seibel. \"Retro-inspired suits provide a respite for women who want to sport a sassy swimsuit without baring it all.\"\n\nCoco Rave Forever Young Bandeau One-Piece Swimsuit ($88) at Macys.com.

The polka dot Beach Blanket Bingo ($90) features a flattering halter neck and ruched body that extends past the bikini line. Bathing Beauty ($90), also by Esther Williams for ModCloth, has a similar cut and shape except in solid colors. Both come in plus sizes.\n\nLike Mom jeans, retro swimwear can go from fad to oh-so-bad if you select dated designs and cuts. Sailor stripes with anchor buttons can border on costumey in a cheap fabric. Kitsch is best used in small doses: A ribbon here, a long-line bustier there.\n\nIt's important for retro wearers to feel confident rocking the gingham, cherries, hibiscus or pineapples.\n\n\"Women who slip on vintage-inspired swimsuits instantly feel gorgeous and glamorous,\" says Seibel.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/culture/2015/05/24/retro-swimsuits-return/27887175/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Retro-inspired swimsuits offer figure-flattering cuts in quirky prints.", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "Retro-inspired swimsuits offer figure-flattering cuts in quirky prints.", "title": "Not your mama's swimsuit: Rock a retro look", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/culture/2015/05/24/retro-swimsuits-return/27887175/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Retro-inspired swimsuits offer figure-flattering cuts in quirky prints.", "title": "Not your mama's swimsuit: Rock a retro look", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fac5ab574443a61a06813c618af97a68a653bd0c/c=0-158-2933-3091&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Salisbury/B9317391006Z.1_20150524151250_000_GPHAOMQG7.3-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "summer, retro, Eastern Shore, Delmarva"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4024\"", "article_summary": "A search for \"retro swimsuit\" on the crafting website Etsy pulls up more than 4,500 entries.\n(Photo: Courtesy of Macy\u2019s)The two bestselling suits on ModCloth are \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 one-pieces.\nLike Mom jeans, retro swimwear can go from fad to oh-so-bad if you select dated designs and cuts.\n\"Retro-inspired suits provide a respite for women who want to sport a sassy swimsuit without baring it all.\"\nCoco Rave Forever Young Bandeau One-Piece Swimsuit ($88) at Macys.com."}
