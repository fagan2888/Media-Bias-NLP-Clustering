A candidate like Donald Trump would be popular in a country where emoticons are popular. A. Barton Hinkle writes:

Emoticons are knee-jerks; like many of Trump's supporters, they express reactions rather than thoughts. So it should come as no surprise that a society in which emoticons are a popular mode of communication would see the rise of a candidate whose policy ideas contain all the detail and refinement of a Mr. Yuck poison label.

Language, by contrast, evolved to convey complexity; sloppy language thus indicates sloppy thinking—as when Trump told Anderson Cooper, "Sometimes they'll say Donald Trump wants single payer because there's a group of people—as good as these plans are and by the way your insurance will go way down, you'll have better plans, you'll get your own doctor, which Obama lied."

Well put, sir!
