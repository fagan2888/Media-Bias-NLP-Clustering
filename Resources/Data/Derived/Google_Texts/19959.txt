senator sanders rallying thousands in madison and

telling me tonight in a one-on-one interview that

he's got a lot at stake in wisconsin.

2 SOTW1 45

we need to win and win big, I think the victories

that we have seen so far in the west are suggesting

to me that we can take that momentum into Oregon and

into California ;07 and back east into new York state

so I think we have a path toward victory :11

3 SOTW2 45

11;18 jessicamadison mayor paul soglin endorsed you

earlier today, he's one of the first elected officials

in Wisconsin to step forward and support your campaign,

theres a lot of them that have supported your opponent

here, why do you think that is in Wisconsin :28

4 SOTW3 46

12;29 SANDERSfirst of all I thank the mayor for his

support, this has been the case all over this country

:33 hillary Clinton is the establishment's candidate,

she's the candidate of superpac money, the candidate

of almost all of the elected officials :44 but we

have taken them on in state after state:47

1 VO/MINI-DISCW4 55

WE ALSO ASKED SENATOR SANDERS ABOUT HIS PLAN FOR FREE

COLLEGE TUITION AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES.

1 SOTW5 46

JESSICApart of that plan the state picks up a portion

of the cost and in the state of WI we've seen a governor

here that's cut back on some of the funding, the university

systems in Wisconsin are in some cases are struggling,

so how do you see states being able to pick up the

tab :39

1 SOTW6 46

SANDERSwell 2/3 of the cost comes from the federal

government and those states that are not prepared

to support young people and students, they're going

to see a migration of their best and brightest young

people going to the states that do :49 and I don't

think any governor will want to see his best and brightest

young people leaving the state :55

1 SOTW7 45

JESSICAbut we've seen governor walker with Medicaid

not choose to go ahead and take some of that federal

expansion :16

1 SOTW8 46

well, I think that the young people of the state will

have something to say about it and will have something

to say about the republicans who support that decision

;24 my view is that it is not jus young people, it

is their parents, the peplle of this country who know

that in the year 2016 if we are going to be competitive

in the global economy we need the best educated workforce

and we don't have it right now :37 making public colleges

tuition free is one way to do that, :40 those governors

and politicans who do not support that idea will pay

a political price :46

2 SOTW9 45

the sanders campaign says they will be back in wisconsin

before wisconsin's primary on april 5th.
