The employee \u2014 a midlevel content manager \u2014 won $350,000 at rival site FanDuel that same week.\n\nRelated: Why Daily Fantasy Sports Games Are for Suckers\n\nThe incident has raised questions about who at daily fantasy companies has access to valuable data, how it is protected and whether the industry can \u2014 or wants \u2014 to police itself.\n\nIn most popular DFS leagues you pick a new team every week \u2014 in the NFL, at least \u2014 and compete against others for that week of games only. In traditional fantasy football, you might get together with friends and draft one team that you stick with and tweak throughout the season. That's the difference.\n\nThe stakes are huge.\n\nAs explained by Chris Grove at LegalSportsReport, the narrative of the alleged scandal goes like this: a DraftKings employee \"inadvertently released data\" about DraftKings' biggest tournament before the NFL games started, which showed \"the prevalence of particular players across all submitted lineups for the contest.\" This is huge because to win in DFS, you need to pick players nobody else has.\n\nRelated: Daily fantasy sports land in gambling industry crosshairs\n\n\"Access to this kind of data prior to the start of a contest would provide a DFS player with a massive edge over players lacking such data,\" Grove writes.\n\nDraftKings and FanDuel are the two biggest companies in DFS. As in regular fantasy sports, in DFS you \"draft\" a team of real players and get points for how they perform on the field. If your collection of players gets better statistics than your opponents' players, you win.\n\nThe difference is that in many popular DFS formats, you're sometimes playing against hundreds of people in large tournaments for different payouts based on how much money everyone put in. And rather than stretching out for the whole season, it's just one day (or one week's worth of football).\n\nThe Times quotes industry analyst Eilers Research, which estimates that daily fantasy sports companies will bring in $2.6 billion in entry fees in 2015 and climb to over $14 billion in 2020.\n\nRelated: Microsoft\u2019s Sports Algorithm Is Probably Better at Picking NFL Winners than You Are\n\nThe DFS commercials show users who have won $300 to $2 million playing the game. \"On my third week of playing, I won $15,000 off of a $5 entry,\" user Scott H. says in a testimonial for FanDuel.\n\nAs we've reported before, DFS has quickly become popular. Some people risk $5; others put down more than $100,000. On the whole, fantasy football is valued at $11 billion, and DraftKings and FanDuel have each raised more than $300 million at valuations over $1 billion, Bloomberg reports.\n\nWhile online gambling is illegal in most US states, fantasy sports are legal because they're considered games of skill instead of luck, according to a 2006 federal law \u2014 though a New Jersey congressman wants a hearing to reconsider the relationship between fantasy sports and gambling.\n\nFanDuel PR rep Justine Sacco previously told Tech Insider that \"more of our users are sports fans than anything else, and they play because it is a sports entertainment product.\"\n\nFanDuel has posted the below statement on its site:\n\nWhile there has been recent attention on industry employees playing on FanDuel and DraftKings, nothing is more important to DraftKings and FanDuel than the integrity of the games we offer to our customers. Both companies have strong policies in place to ensure that employees do not misuse any information at their disposal and strictly limit access to company data to only those employees who require it to do their jobs. Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams, and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it.\n\nHowever, we continue to review our internal controls to ensure they are as strong as they can be. We also plan to work with the entire fantasy sports industry on this specific issue so that fans everywhere can continue to enjoy and trust the games they love.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nRead more from Business Insider:\n\nMicrosoft just unveiled its first-ever laptop \u2014 and it says it's twice as fast as a Macbook Pro\n\nThe global economy has the 7 year itch\n\nAmazon Prime is wreaking havoc on college mailrooms", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "News has broken about a scandal in the booming daily fantasy-sports industry, or DFS.", "title": "Daily Fantasy Sports Scandal: How Costly Will This Fumble Be?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Daily-Fantasy-Sports-Scandal-How-Costly-Will-Fumble-Be", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08302012_fantasy_football_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Daily-Fantasy-Sports-Scandal-How-Costly-Will-Fumble-Be", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08302012_fantasy_football_money_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "News has broken about a scandal in the booming daily fantasy-sports industry, or DFS.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "News has broken about a scandal in the booming daily fantasy-sports industry, or DFS.\nRelated: Why Daily Fantasy Sports Games Are for SuckersThe incident has raised questions about who at daily fantasy companies has access to valuable data, how it is protected and whether the industry can \u2014 or wants \u2014 to police itself.\nAs in regular fantasy sports, in DFS you \"draft\" a team of real players and get points for how they perform on the field.\nIn traditional fantasy football, you might get together with friends and draft one team that you stick with and tweak throughout the season.\nWe also plan to work with the entire fantasy sports industry on this specific issue so that fans everywhere can continue to enjoy and trust the games they love."}
