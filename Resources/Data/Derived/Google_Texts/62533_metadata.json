(Photo: Jim Matthews/P-G Media/@jmatthe79 )\n\nHail yeah\n\nWhen it comes to that Hail Mary, we still can't get enough.\n\nThe endless replays. The funny memes. The SportsCenter chatter. That GIF of Calvin Johnson dropping to his knees on the sideline.\n\nThe thrilling \u2014 and almost unbelievable \u2014 finish to Thursday's game against the Detroit Lion energized the Packers and it energized us, too.\n\nNo matter what happens with the rest of the season, we have this memory. And what a great feeling it is. Congrats to the players for sticking it out to the very, very, very end.\n\nExpo center advances\n\nA belated congratulations to the organizers of the Fox Cities Exhibition Center and Appleton Mayor Tim Hanna. All 10 communities in the Fox Cities tourism zone have agreed to raise their room taxes to pay for the building slated to be built to the south of the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel.\n\nMunicipal boards across the Fox Cities voted \u2014 some of them unanimously \u2014 for the project because they see how it can benefit their residents. A vibrant downtown Appleton equals a vibrant Fox Cities.\n\nFor the most part, this project will be paid for with money from visitors. Unless you're staying in a hotel room nearby, you're not paying for the bulk of the construction.\n\nWe look forward to the day it opens.\n\nLawmakers' take-home pay increases\n\nIt was an empty promise.\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos told voters that a change in the way lawmakers are compensated for staying in Madison overnight when they're on state business would save the state money. It seemed like a good idea.\n\nThen, Gannett Wisconsin Media took a look at the real numbers.\n\nSince the change was enacted in January, it's costing us a lot more money.\n\nThe perk cost taxpayers about $738,000 through September. The bill during the same span in 2013 and 2011, when similar budget debates were happening, was about $49,000 and $63,000 lower, respectively.\n\nWe're not questioning our lawmakers' dedication to their jobs. They spend a lot of time in Madison away from their hometown and families. We are, however, questioning why we're being told a change will save money and then more lawmakers are walking away with additional cash in their bank accounts.\n\nIt's time to change it back.\n\nBald eagles stage a comeback\n\nLook up in the sky. If you see a bald eagle, you have federal and state authorities to thank.\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources counted about 1,400 nesting pairs of bald eagles this year. That's up from a low of 108 in 1973.\n\nRegulation of the pesticide DDT and eagle protection laws have helped tremendously. But the threat of lead poisoning remains here in Wisconsin, in part because of discarded gun ammunition.\n\nWe're encouraged by the trend and can't wait for the day when we see even more of these majestic birds soaring above the Fox River.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1XRgiWX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hail Mary, expo center and bald eagles led the way this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Hail Mary, expo center and bald eagles led the way this week.", "title": "Editorial Board's Final Thoughts", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/05/editorial-boards-final-thoughts-dec-6/76741430/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hail Mary, expo center and bald eagles led the way this week.", "title": "Editorial Board's Final Thoughts", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a8c39a901389267b9b1bb5afc3b29fe3627df62/c=0-127-1480-1607&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/04/WIGroup/PackersNews/635847846747858692-JIM-7927A.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Municipal boards across the Fox Cities voted \u2014 some of them unanimously \u2014 for the project because they see how it can benefit their residents.\nA vibrant downtown Appleton equals a vibrant Fox Cities.\nExpo center advancesA belated congratulations to the organizers of the Fox Cities Exhibition Center and Appleton Mayor Tim Hanna.\nAll 10 communities in the Fox Cities tourism zone have agreed to raise their room taxes to pay for the building slated to be built to the south of the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel.\nThe thrilling \u2014 and almost unbelievable \u2014 finish to Thursday's game against the Detroit Lion energized the Packers and it energized us, too."}
