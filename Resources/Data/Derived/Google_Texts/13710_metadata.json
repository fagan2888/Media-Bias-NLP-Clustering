The webinar was held by the National Patient Safety Foundation, and was centered on an NPSF report released in December, Free from Harm: Accelerating Patient Safety Fifteen Years after To Err Is Human.\n\nResponding to a question about the possible creation of a national clearinghouse of quality statistics, both indicated that enough data has been collected. \u201cWe already know a ton,\u201d Berwick says, continuing a theme he promoted at last month's IHI conference. \u201cReporting\u2019s good in moderation, action is better.\u201d\n\nShojania went a step further. \u201cIncident reporting has been one of the bigger disappointments of the last 15 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sorted of ended up that there\u2019s such an emphasis on just reporting and reporting and reporting, and not actually learning from these events. I would rather see us move on some of the events we know about, rather than just recording more and more, and aggregating them and not being clear what the benefit of it is.\"\n\nAnd while the hospital field has been moving closer to broad use of patient advisers, Berwick described them as being almost a foundational element to managing or acting as a board member to a hospital or health system.\n\nHe urged the quality-focused webinar attendees to invite patients who have been harmed to meet directly with executives and board members to bring attention to the issue of patient safety. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to turn away when they\u2019re in the room,\u201d he says.\n\nThe beneficiaries will be the hospital field representatives, Berwick says. \u201cAny board of trustees and any executive would be well advised to spend a lot of time having patients talk in both public and private ways about their experiences in care in really authentic ways,\u201d Berwick says. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about focus groups or hearings or testimony, but inviting people in to really talk.\u201d\n\nThe American Hospital Association and other groups offer tools that can assist in that task.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital field leaders seeking to improve patient safety and quality have a couple of in-house resources that could be used more effectively: their own patient safety and quality data and their own patients, according to two leading quality experts.
