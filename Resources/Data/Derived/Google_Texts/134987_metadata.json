It also could be the biggest \u201cwho cares?\u201d event of the decade.\n\nIn all likelihood, it will become both simultaneously, enthralling devotees of the \u201csweet science\u201d while being ignored by legions of other people who couldn\u2019t care less about it.\n\nMillions of fans the world over will be shelling out about $100 for pay-for-view broadcasts or crowding into sports bars that will be showing the fight on their big-screen TVs. (Be forewarned: Not all the usual proprietors will be showing the fight because of the cost to them. Many will be featuring hockey and basketball playoffs instead. Among those promising to air the fight are the Minneapolis establishments Sneaky Pete\u2019s downtown and Ray J\u2019s Northeast. If you want to make sure the fight is on, call your favorite watering hole beforehand.)\n\nFor every person who is counting down the hours until the first punch, there\u2019s someone else who is appalled by the very notion of the bout. There are people drooling over the prospect of a fight that has all the makings of a punishing marathon, but there also people who, in light of the recent focus on the dangers of sports-related concussions, question the very notion of cheering on men who are pounding each other in the head.\n\nThe sport\u2019s supporters point out that the training exceeds that of any other athletes, with boxers spending months getting ready for single fight. Fans also are intrigued by the nature of the competition: two people facing off one-on-one with, literally, no place to hide. It\u2019s a sport that is often a test of will as much as skill.\n\nWhich camp are you in? If you\u2019re still among the undecided, here are five arguments in favor of each stance.\n\nYou should care because \u2026\n\n1. This has all the makings of a battle for the ages. Mayweather and Pacquiao are considered far and away the two best boxers in the world, and neither wants to be ranked second. The juxtaposition of their styles also is intriguing. Mayweather is primarily a defensive fighter, while Pacquiao is extremely aggressive. Both fighters are renowned for their hand speed.\n\n2. The potential prize money is outrageous, even by pro boxing\u2019s outrageous standards. Mayweather could collect upwards of $180 million for his night\u2019s work, some number crunchers estimate. Pacquiao will get a smaller cut of the pot, but he won\u2019t be clipping coupons next week, either. He\u2019s predicted to get as much as $120 million. Tickets to attend the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas started at $1,500 for seats in the back row of the top deck. And ticket income is a molehill compared with the mountain of money that pay-per-view is expected to bring in \u2014 as much as $300 million in North America alone, according to some projections. Toss in sponsorship fees and the foreign rights, and the bout\u2019s total revenue will start to rival the gross national product of a small country.\n\n3. This showdown has been highly anticipated for years. Mayweather was the world champion when he announced his retirement in 2008. While he was sitting on the sidelines, Pacquiao took over as champ. Mayweather came out of retirement in 2009, and boxing fans could hardly control their enthusiasm over the prospect of a faceoff between the two. In fact, Ring magazine listed the failure of promoters to arrange a fight between them as the \u201cevent of the year\u201d in 2010.\n\n4. Mayweather has been the world\u2019s highest paid athlete the past three years \u2014 and after he cashes his paycheck for this fight, he\u2019s guaranteed to keep that ranking for 2015. He is clearly the king of the hill.\n\n5. Everyone will be talking about the fight Monday at work.\n\nYou should not care because \u2026\n\n1. They\u2019re welterweights, which means that they weigh 147 pounds or less. Throughout the history of boxing, the classic fights have involved heavyweights, the giants who stand as larger-than-life modern-day gladiators. While we\u2019re not questioning the two fighters\u2019 toughness, we can\u2019t help but notice that many of us have mothers-in-law bigger than they are.\n\n2. Boxing is pass\u00e9. Sure, it was huge back in the day when boxers such as Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano (no, he wasn\u2019t the guy in \u201cRocky\u201d) were headlining bouts. And it was still pretty big when the superstars were Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. (Yes, millennials, Foreman had another career before he became a guru of kitchen gadgets.) But the trendy combative sports these days involve martial arts. You\u2019re much more likely to hear people talking about MMA (mixed martial arts) and the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) than the welterweight championship. And, while we\u2019re on the topic, what sort of measurement is welterweight, anyway? There\u2019s already enough confusion over the metric system. Do we really need to add yet another completely fabricated quantification?\n\n3. Ring magazine listed the lack of a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight as the event of the year in 2010. A nonevent qualifying as event of the year? There would seem to be a lot of other nonevents of greater nonmagnitude, including the comet that didn\u2019t smash into Denver or the tsunami that didn\u2019t wash away Los Angeles.\n\n4. Mayweather is hardly known outside of boxing circles. Even nonsports fans know about Ali, and names such as Brett Favre, Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek at least ring a bell with people, even if they can\u2019t detail those athletes\u2019 accomplishments. Most members of the general public couldn\u2019t tell Mayweather from Papa Smurf.\n\n5.
