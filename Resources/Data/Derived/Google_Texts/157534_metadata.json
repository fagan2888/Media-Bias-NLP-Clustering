The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims.\n\nChina has rejected diplomatic protests by the Philippines and Vietnam and criticism from the United States over its reclamation work on reefs and tiny islands, saying it falls \"within the scope of China's sovereignty\".\n\nLast month, China's coast guard fired water cannon on Philippine fishermen in a disputed shoal. In the past, it has challenged Japan's coast guard near a disputed island in the East China Sea.\n\nLater this year, the Philippines will take delivery of the first of ten 40-metre (130-foot) patrol boats Japan is building, said Coast Guard spokesman Commander Armand Balilo.\n\n(Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Additional reporting by Adam Rose and Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Both nations face a challenge from China's growing assertiveness over territorial clai", "title": "Philippines, Japan coast guards hold anti-piracy drills", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/06/Philippines-Japan-coast-guards-hold-anti-piracy-drills", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/philippines-japan_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/06/Philippines-Japan-coast-guards-hold-anti-piracy-drills", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/philippines-japan_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Both nations face a challenge from China's growing assertiveness over territorial clai", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "China claims most of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year.\nJapan has been helping the Philippines improve its skills in maritime law enforcement, safety and environment protection, Captain Koichi Kawagoe of Japan's coast guard told reporters.\nIn the past, it has challenged Japan's coast guard near a disputed island in the East China Sea.\nLater this year, the Philippines will take delivery of the first of ten 40-metre (130-foot) patrol boats Japan is building, said Coast Guard spokesman Commander Armand Balilo.\nWednesday's drill was the first held by Japan and the Philippines after signing a strategic partnership pact in 2012."}
