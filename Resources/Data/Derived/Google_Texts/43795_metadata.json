With the new space, the total square footage of the facility is now 48,000 square feet.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have made a facility that is a great equalizer in our city,\u201d said Mayor Deberey Hinchey during a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the completion of the yearlong project.\n\n\n\nShe and state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, both highlighted the mental health care provided by UCFS as one of the many ways the nonprofit agency fills a critical need in the community.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need more places like this,\u201d Osten said.\n\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said the new space is \u201call about access to care.\u201d UCFS was among health centers that \u201creally stepped up\u201d to embrace the goals of the federal Affordable Care Act and the state\u2019s Access Health CT online marketplace to sign people up for health insurance, he said. About 1,100 people enrolled in Medicaid, HUSKY or private health insurance through assisters working at UCFS, he said.\n\n\n\nLt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, who oversaw the creation and implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Connecticut, said that half of the 256,000 people statewide who enrolled through Access Health CT never had health insurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of them are going to be coming to a place like this,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they have a place to go with a little pride, because they can say, \u2018Hey, I can pay for my services now.\u2019 Keep up the good work.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe project was funded with an $800,000 donation from the Edward & Mary Lord Foundation and a $3.4 million state grant, said Chuck Seeman, chief executive officer of UCFS. It completes the transformation of the former retail and restaurant space UCFS moved into in 1999 and renovated in phases, at a total cost of $5.5 million. With the expansion, UCFS added 21 new staff positions to its 350-member, $17 million payroll, Seeman said. UCFS is now hoping for similar projects to improve its Plainfield and Griswold clinics, which he said are both at capacity.\n\n\n\nSeeman said patient visits to UCFS rose 22 percent in the past year, to 109,389, and are projected to grow to 120,000 in 2015.\n\n\n\nDuring a tour, Jennifer Granger, chief operating officer of UCFS, showed the modern, professional waiting areas and newly equipped exam rooms, all organized around a central hallway.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe arranged everything around a single long corridor so people can find their way around,\u201d she said. \u201cThe old building was like a maze.\u201d\n\n\n\nPamela Kinder, vice president of marketing and facilities at UCFS, oversaw the project and was presented with a plaque that will be hung outside a new conference room named for her.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has been a labor of love for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOur patients are so thrilled when they walk in with what we\u2019ve built for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nj.benson@theday.com\n\n\n\nTwitter: @bensonjudy\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Norwich \u2014 The best of the many new features of the renovated and expanded space at United Community & Family Services, according to one of", "og": {"site_name": "The Day", "description": "Norwich \u2014 The best of the many new features of the renovated and expanded space at United Community & Family Services, according to one of", "title": "United Community & Family Services marks renovation of medical clinic", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20140813/NWS01/140819846", "image": "http://www.theday.com/storyimage/NL/20140813/NWS01/140819846/AR/0/AR-140819846.jpg&imageversion=16by9&Maxw=960", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Norwich \u2014 The best of the many new features of the renovated and expanded space at United Community & Family Services, according to one of", "title": "United Community & Family Services marks renovation of medical clinic", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20140813/NWS01/140819846", "image": "http://www.theday.comhttp://www.theday.com/storyimage/NL/20140813/NWS01/140819846/AR/0/AR-140819846.jpg&imageversion=16by9&Maxw=960", "site": "@thedayct", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "United Community & Family Services marks renovation of medical clinic, Local News, Norwich CT,Section Front,Breaking News,Web", "article": {"published_time": 20140813111859, "modified_time": 201408140013}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "United Community & Family Services marks renovation of medical clinic, Local News, Norwich CT,Section Front,Breaking News,Web"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc21\"", "article_summary": "She and state Sen.
