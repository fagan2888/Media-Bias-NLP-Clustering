We cannot be entirely certain, but supporters of same-sex marriage have reason to be optimistic. Let\u2019s look at the various factions of the court, and how they will likely vote.\n\nThe No-Hopers\n\nNobody\u2019s vote in these cases is more certain than Antonin Scalia\u2019s. In various dissents to rulings that were favorable to LGBT rights, Scalia has railed against the \u201cso-called homosexual agenda\u201d and criticized his colleagues for \u201cgrim, disapproving hints\" that Americans have been \"guilty of \u2018animus\u2019 or \u2018animosity\u2019 toward homosexuality, as though that has been established as Unamerican.\u201d\n\nIn his dissents to both Lawrence v. Texas (the 2003 decision that struck down bans on \u201csodomy\u201d) and United States v. Windsor (the 2013 case that ruled key provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional), he asserted that the decisions logically required the court to ultimately recognize same-sex marriage rights \u2014 an eventuality that he clearly did not relish. (Some federal judges have trolled Scalia right back, gleefully citing this portion of his dissent when striking down bans on same-sex marriage.)\n\nWe can be very confident that Scalia will not find a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. The only outstanding question is how much spittle the court\u2019s staff will have to clean up if Scalia decides to read his dissenting opinion from the bench.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas has been quieter about his opposition to same-sex marriage \u2014 he even wrote a short dissent in Lawrence distancing himself from Scalia\u2019s homophobia \u2014 but he\u2019s joined all of Scalia\u2019s key opinions and will not break from Scalia here. Justice Samuel Alito is an even more consistent conservative party-liner than Scalia and Thomas, and argued in his own Windsor dissent, \u201cThe Constitution...does not dictate that choice [of whether to recognize same-sex marriages]. It leaves the choice to the people, acting through their elected representatives at both the federal and state levels.\u201d He\u2019s a certain third vote against same-sex marriage rights.\n\nThe Liberals\n\nAll four Democratic nominees to the court \u2014 Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan \u2014 are almost equally certain to find in favor of same-sex marriage rights. While the effect of Barack Obama\u2019s postmature support for gay marriage tends to be overstated, it has played a decisive role in making that position an unshakable part of mainstream liberalism. It\u2019s enormously unlikely, given the current partisan nature of the court, that any of the Democratic nominees will depart from the Democratic mainstream.\n\nThe only reason supporters of same-sex marriage might worry is that Justice Ginsburg has frequently, in the context of Roe v. Wade, spoken of the dangers of the court going too far, too fast in recognizing controversial rights claims. But now that same-sex marriage is legal in a majority of states, and public support has continued to increase, it's hard to see Ginsburg ducking the issue.\n\nThe Swing Vote\n\nWith the federal right to same-sex marriage almost certain to have four votes, the decision, as always, is likely to come down to the country\u2019s most powerful judge, Anthony Kennedy. On its face, this is good news for liberals. Kennedy has a long history of sympathy for gay and lesbian rights \u2014 it was one reason conservatives distrusted him when Ronald Reagan gave him the nod. Kennedy has also written landmark opinions striking down anti-LBGT state initiatives, \u201csodomy\u201d laws, and key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act. If Kennedy were to side with his typical conservative allies on this issue, it would be unprecedented.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily make Kennedy a mortal lock for advocates of same-sex marriage. Making gay marriage legal in all 50 states would have an impact that goes well beyond, say, striking down rarely enforced bans on oral and anal sex. This case is somewhat unchartered waters. But still, it\u2019s hard to imagine the 78-year-old Kennedy wanting his legacy to be defined by writing the Plessy v. Ferguson of gay and lesbian rights.\n\nThe Wild Card\n\nThe vote of Chief Justice John Roberts is the hardest to pin down. It\u2019s also probably beside the point. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision upholding much of the Affordable Care Act is the only time he\u2019s joined the four liberals in a 5-4 opinion, and given that Kennedy is far more liberal on LBGT rights than he is on federalism and economics, it\u2019s impossible to imagine a scenario in which Roberts votes to uphold a right to same-sex marriage and Kennedy doesn\u2019t.\n\nAll things being equal, one would expect Roberts to join with his natural allies Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Brianne Gorod and Judith E. Schaeffer make an interesting argument that Roberts should be considered highly likely to be a sixth vote to legalize same-sex marriage. I\u2019m not entirely convinced, but either way I don\u2019t think his vote will matter.\n\nSpeaking of wild cards: when the Supreme Court agreed to take the case its order asked the parties to address not only whether states are required \u201cto license a marriage between two people of the same sex,\u201d but also whether \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state.\u201d I agree with the legal scholar Michael Dorf that it\u2019s probably unwise to read too much into this. Still, there\u2019s an outside chance that Kennedy and Roberts could compromise by reading the Constitution as requiring states to recognize valid same-sex marriages, but not that they have to license their own. The effects of such a ruling would be similar to a more sweeping affirmation of gay marriage, but would place a burden on poor couples in some states who would have to travel across state lines to become legally married.\n\nOverall, advocates of same-sex marriage rights have good reason to be optimistic. But as fans of the Green Bay Packers will tell you, it\u2019s unwise to celebrate prematurely.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/534342/supreme-court-takes-gay-marriage-how-each-justice-probably-vote", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/SupremeCourt.jpg?itok=GlwnPd9s", "type": "article", "description": "How each justice will (probably) vote on gay marriage", "title": "The Supreme Court takes on gay marriage: How each justice will (probably) vote"}, "twitter": {"description": "How each justice will (probably) vote on gay marriage", "title": "The Supreme Court takes on gay marriage: How each justice will (probably) vote", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/SupremeCourt.jpg?itok=GlwnPd9s"}, "creator": "@LemieuxLGM", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, U.S., analysis, liberal", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T09:55:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda05e\"", "article_summary": "The big question is whether the court will make gay marriage legal in all 50 states.\nOverall, advocates of same-sex marriage rights have good reason to be optimistic.\nWe cannot be entirely certain, but supporters of same-sex marriage have reason to be optimistic.\n(Some federal judges have trolled Scalia right back, gleefully citing this portion of his dissent when striking down bans on same-sex marriage.)\nWhile the effect of Barack Obama\u2019s postmature support for gay marriage tends to be overstated, it has played a decisive role in making that position an unshakable part of mainstream liberalism."}
