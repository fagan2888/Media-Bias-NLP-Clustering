Bryce Harper, the Nationals\u2019 phenomenal right fielder, will win the award, of that I\u2019m sure.\n\nI\u2019m fine with that.\n\nHarper is having a season for the ages. Through Friday, he led the National League with a 1.107 OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage). That is the highest in baseball since 2008, when the Cardinals\u2019 Albert Pujols scored a 1.114 OPS.\n\nSo I\u2019ll applaud when Harper walks away with the hardware. But what really ticks me off is the lack of respect Arenado is getting from national baseball fans and writers.\n\nScouring the various blogs and posts from baseball writers around the country \u2014 some of them very respected \u2014 I found that Arenado barely earns a courtesy nod, if he gets mentioned at all.\n\nWhen I tweet about Arenado\u2019s 42 home runs and 130 RBIs, trolls on Twitter will inevitably call him a \u201cCoors Field creation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just not true. Of the 42 homers he had hit through Friday night, 22 were hit on the road, and 41 of his 88 extra-base hits came on the road. Keep in mind, we are talking about a player with more extra-base hits in a season than any other third baseman in major-league history.\n\nYahoo Sports\u2019 Jeff Passan and Tim Brown, two of the best national baseball writers in the country \u2014 and two class acts, by the way \u2014 barely acknowledge Arenado\u2019s incredible season in their voting. Arenado is ranked 10th among MVP candidates by Brown, and he doesn\u2019t even make Passan\u2019s top 10.\n\nArenado is easily one of the top three position players in the NL this season, and even if you throw pitchers such as Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Jake Arrieta into the MVP mix, Arenado should still be in the top five.\n\nFor the record, as a member of the National Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, I have an NL MVP vote this season. I\u2019ve been asked not to reveal my vote until results are released in November, but I can guarantee you that Arenado will make my top five.\n\nYes, Arenado\u2019s overall home/road splits are relatively big: .316/.350/.610 at Coors vs. .258/.294/.542 on the road. But his Gold Glove plays anywhere, anytime.\n\nManager Walt Weiss, who has unabashedly touted Arenado for MVP, got fired up Saturday when discussing the lack of respect for his third baseman.\n\nTold that Arenado was failing to get recognition from many national writers, Weiss grew animated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dereliction of duty,\u201d he said.\n\nIt burns Weiss, and other members of the Rockies, that pitchers such as Kershaw and Greinke are universally lauded, yet it\u2019s rarely mentioned that they pitch half their games at Dodger Stadium, a place where hard-hit balls that would be home runs almost anywhere else die at the warning track.\n\nWeiss knows that the Coors Field effect is real, but he says the ballpark\u2019s reputation has unfairly branded Arenado.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly because of where we play,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019re a team in our own time zone, and it\u2019s the stigma of our park. We\u2019ve seen it for years.\n\n\u201cPeople have just assumed that Nolan is a product of Coors Field without even looking at the numbers.\u201d\n\nYes, the Rockies are a bad team and don\u2019t deserve a lot of national attention. But the Nationals collapsed in the second half and are the majors\u2019 most disappointing team, yet Harper is not penalized for that.\n\nWeiss simply wants Arenado to get the respect he deserves.\n\n\u201cWe probably are not seen much on a national level, so I don\u2019t think they get to see Nolan a whole lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think if you have a vote, you\u2019re obligated to be well-educated, well-informed before you turn in that vote. If you\u2019re a writer that has Nolan 10th, I don\u2019t think you deserve to be voting.\u201d\n\nWeiss is aware that Harper is a big favorite to win MVP, but he proudly stood up for his own player.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Bryce Harper fan. I love the way he plays. If he\u2019s the MVP, you can\u2019t argue with that,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI just wish that people would give Nolan\u2019s defense the credit it deserves, and the (offensive) numbers are just too big to ignore.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@ denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nJosh Donaldson, third base, Blue Jays\n\nWhat\u2019s up: I wonder if Troy Tulowitzki counts his baseball blessings. In Colorado, he played next to Nolan Arenado, the National League\u2019s best third baseman. Then he got traded to Toronto and now takes the field next to Donaldson, who\u2019s in a down-to-the-wire race with Mike Trout for American League MVP.\n\nBackground: Donaldson has had a monster year, not just statistically \u2014 .301/.375/.575, 41 homers, 123 RBIs \u2014 but as the Blue Jays\u2019 most powerful weapon as they won the AL East and clinched their first playoff berth since 1993. Over the last two months, as Toronto put the Yankees in their rearview mirror, Donaldson hit .310 with 17 homers and 50-plus RBIs.\n\nSaunders take: The Blue Jays are my pick to win the World Series. Their pitching might not quite match some of the other contenders, but it\u2019s plenty good enough and Donaldson anchors an offense that conjures up the 1927 Yankees. More than that, he\u2019s the kind of player who not only sparks his teammates, he carries them on his shoulders to places they never thought possible. Toronto general manager Alex Anthopoulos, the man who brokered the Tulo deal and also acquired ace David Price from Detroit, says there are many reasons for Toronto\u2019s success. However, this is what Anthopoulos told ESPN\u2019s Jayson Stark: \u201cJosh has brought an intensity and focus to our club every day. His passion, energy and the way he goes about his business have set the tone for our club.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: No love for Rockies Nolan Arenado is a three-base error", "title": "Saunders: No love for Rockies Nolan Arenado is a three-base error", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/saunders-no-love-for-rockies-nolan-arenado-is-a-three-base-error/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T23:12:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:32:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado is not going to be the National League\u2019s 2015 MVP.\nBut what really ticks me off is the lack of respect Arenado is getting from national baseball fans and writers.\nIn Colorado, he played next to Nolan Arenado, the National League\u2019s best third baseman.\nTold that Arenado was failing to get recognition from many national writers, Weiss grew animated.\nFor the record, as a member of the National Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, I have an NL MVP vote this season."}
