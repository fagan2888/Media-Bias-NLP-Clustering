President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.

The TechHire initiative combines in-person coding, programming and technology training at universities and community colleges with online education and “boot camps” run by municipalities, local governments and community groups.

Mr. Obama made the announcement in remarks at the National League of Cities on Monday. “I want Americans to win the race for the kind of discoveries that release new jobs, he said.

The effort aims to boost skills among Americans — many without a college degree — and get them work in tech fields, which often command higher salaries.

Mr. Obama said that four-year college degrees in science, computer science and engineering were still crucial to economic development, but that there were plenty of technology jobs that required basic coding and programming skills that could be obtained outside of a four-year college environment.

The president also said that technology jobs were not just clustered in high tech corridors like Silicon Valley or the Route 128 tech corridor in Massachusetts, but that they were located at companies in every community in the country.

“This doesn’t just apply to San Francisco. This doesn’t just apply to Boston. It applies access the board to every part of the country,” Mr. Obama said. He added: “There’s no industry that hasn’t been touched since this technology revolution.”

Administration officials highlighted the efforts of Louisville, Ky.’s “Code Louisville” program, which helps train and place software developers in local tech jobs.

As part of the new TechHire program, the city will launch a new coding bootcamp and partner with local educational institutions. The new program will encourage other municipalities to create similar programs and efforts.
