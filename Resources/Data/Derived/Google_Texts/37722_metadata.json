Even if he hadn't missed the clause, the sound engineer, self-employed and without insurance since 2000, wouldn't have believed that it applied to him. When he purchased his insurance, he didn't have a diagnosis. \"I knew I had a lump, but I didn't know I had cancer,\" he said.\n\nAfter more than a decade without health insurance and more than four years without a visit to a doctor, Popadak bought insurance in September 2013. He was concerned about a lump on his jaw, but his long-ago doctor deemed him a \"new patient\" and refused to see him without insurance.\n\nSince then he has learned that \"pre-existing condition\" is a legal, rather than a medical term. He has kept a log of his bills on an Excel spreadsheet. The vast majority have been denied \u2014 labs, doctor visits, hospital stays \u2014 leaving him responsible for almost $100,000. His insurance has paid $2,739.04.\n\nA timeline:\n\n\u2022 May 2013, Popadak cut himself shaving and felt \"a little bump\" in his neck, about the size of a pea.\n\n\u2022 Summer 2013, the lump grew to about 1 inch by 2 inches; his friends started asking about it.\n\n\u2022 August 2013, he went to a doctor who had given him a physical in 2006. He was deemed a new patient and the doctor wouldn't see him without insurance. He went to an urgent care doctor who didn't want to give him a diagnosis if he didn't have insurance in order to avoid a future problem with a pre-existing condition; the doctor gave him a break and charged the standard co-pay.\n\n\u2022 Sept. 14, 2013 he purchased insurance and received notice on Oct. 2, 2013 that his coverage was effective. \"I picked a plan with a deductible and premium I could afford,\" he said.\n\n\u2022 Oct. 2, 2013 he went to family doctor who scheduled a CT scan. Two weeks passed and he didn't hear anything. His insurance refused it. His doctor sent him to an ENT, ear, nose, throat specialist. Once again, insurance refused a CT scan. Instead, as it didn't need prior authorization, he had an ultrasound-guided biopsy.\n\n\u2022 Oct. 24, 2013 he was diagnosed with cancer. His CT scan was denied again, this time based on \"pre-existing condition,\" under the \"usual and customary\" clause despite his not having had a diagnosis prior to purchase of insurance. \"I knew I had a lump,\" said Popadak. \"I didn't know I had cancer.\" His bill for treatment of high cholesterol was also denied.\n\n\u2022 Nov. 14, 2013, he started a chemotherapy regimen with three kinds \u2014 two were delivered through a drip over five hours; the third was delivered by a pump in a slow feed over five days.\n\n\u2022 Three weeks later, Popadak repeated the regimen. \"It shrank the lump down immediately. It damn near killed me,\" he said.\n\n\u2022 Jan. 1, 2014, he applied for new insurance through the state marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 Jan. 3, 2014 he started a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. He received radiation five days a week for seven weeks and finished on Feb. 28.\n\n\u2022 Feb. 1, 2014, his new insurance took effect.\n\n\u2022 In February, he wrote a check to the oncologist for $650 for February's treatments, the limit of his annual out-of-pocket payments.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Health, News", "og": {"url": "http://articles.dailypress.com/2014-03-11/health/dp-nws-marketplace-people-0311-2-20140311_1_ct-scan-doctor-affordable-care-act", "site_name": "tribunedigital-dailypress", "type": "article", "description": "After more than a decade without health insurance and more than four years without a visit to a doctor, Popadak bought insurance in September 2013.
