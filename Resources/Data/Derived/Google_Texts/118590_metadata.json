It\u2019s the third year of open enrollment for these subsidized plans, established by the Affordable Care Act. Many Texans still oppose the law, even though the state is home to the most uninsured people in the country.\n\nFor the moment, Texas Republicans still consider the Affordable Care Act to be political kryptonite. Sen. Ted Cruz continues to criticize it. Attorney General Ken Paxton just filed another lawsuit attacking part of it. Gov. Greg Abbott has said he won\u2019t consider the Medicaid expansion, because he considers Medicaid a dysfunctional entitlement program that should not be allowed to expand.\n\nBut the story on the local level is different. Harris County is home to Houston, where Judge Ed Emmett, a moderate Republican who is chief executive for the county, has supported it for years. The CEO of the taxpayer-supported Harris Health System, George Masi, says he needs the revenue that Medicaid expansion would bring. He\u2019s had to lay off more than 100 employees and cut back on charity care.\n\n\u201cWhat is even more profound is that money is going to other states that expanded Medicaid, like New York, California, Connecticut,\u201d Masi says. \u201cAnd so the taxpayer of Texas is being penalized, if you will, for not taking advantage of that option.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy emphasizing the impact on taxpayers, Masi and others are framing the issue in terms of economics rather than humanitarian concerns.\n\n\u201cWe call it a paradigm shift,\u201d Masi added. \u201cIt\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d\n\nGovernment leaders and health advocates from across Houston point out that the costs of caring for the uninsured fall heavily on local institutions. Those patients strain the budgets of hospitals, first responders and even jails.\n\nLast week, Masi welcomed Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell to Houston, where she toured a Harris Health clinic.\n\nBurwell said she\u2019s willing to work with state leaders to craft a unique Medicaid plan for Texas. She\u2019s done that with other Republican governors.\n\nShe, too, dangled the economic benefits of accepting more federal money under the law. She pointed to Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIn Kentucky alone, which is obviously a much smaller state than the state I\u2019m now visiting, the expectation is we will see an increase of 40,000 jobs by 2021 and $30 billion into the state\u2019s coffers,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature took no action on Medicaid expansion. The same thing happened this year.\n\nBut more voices are starting to push for change, according to Ken Janda, who runs Community Health Choice, a not-for-profit insurance company in Houston.\n\nJanda says the Texas Medical Association and the Texas Hospital Association are both being more vocal on the issue, as is the Texas Association of Business. The federal Medicaid funds would help the state budget and inject revenue into the medical sector of the economy.\n\n\u201cDoctors\u2019 offices are able to hire more people,\u201d Janda says. \u201cPharmacies are able to hire more people. That becomes an economic multiplier.\u201d\n\nCounty budgets would benefit as well, because they support safety-net clinics and public hospitals such as Ben Taub, part of the Harris Health system.\n\n\u201cIf Texas expanded Medicaid, we would be able to look at reducing local property taxes across the board in all counties, or use those dollars for something besides health care,\u201d says Janda.\n\nJanda says the new emphasis on economics could eventually bring the parties together. \u201cThere is some interest now by some Republican state senators because of the potential to reduce local property taxes,\u201d he adds.\n\nJanda isn\u2019t naming names yet. He also says don\u2019t expect to see any movement on this issue until after the 2016 presidential election. But he says he is \u201cguardedly optimistic\u201d that Republicans will be willing to discuss a possible Medicaid expansion after that.\n\n\u201cThe burden is particularly acute in states that have not expanded Medicaid,\u201d says Beth Feldpush, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy for America\u2019s Essential Hospitals.\n\nFeldpush says the organization has not surveyed its members to find out how many other public hospitals have tightened eligibility as a way to induce patients to enroll in ACA plans.\n\nBut Feldpush says she is sympathetic to the budgetary pressures facing Harris Health.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, hospitals there are really facing a double whammy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got cuts coming at them that are cooked into the law, and yet they don\u2019t see any increase to revenue from Medicaid expansion because it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Houston Public Media and Kaiser Health News.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Alan Cordova", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Masi, CEO of the taxpayer-supported Harris Health System, says it needs the revenue that Medicaid expansion would bring.
