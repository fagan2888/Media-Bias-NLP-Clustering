Ultimately, when the medical team wanted to pull the plug on the severely brain-damaged young man they said was clinically dead, his parents decided that fish oil, which contains a very high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, might just do the trick. And miraculously it did!\n\nWhile their son will never ever be the same person again, he is alive, and this is all that matters right now.\n\nThe Accident That Left Grant Virgin Half Dead\n\nThe accident that nearly killed Grant Virgin of Palm Desert in California was one of those nightmares that no parent ever wants to live through. Grant went for a walk and was hit by a car. While the driver did stop, she is said to have surveyed the scene and taken off again very quickly. She has never been traced.\n\nNot long after, his father John Virgin and younger son Bryce went to investigate the flashing lights at an accident scene near their home. All they saw was a blood-drenched pavement that police had cordoned off. Relating the story to CNN recently, John Virgin said his heart sank and he realized his very worst fear. Perhaps fortunately Grant had already been airlifted to the nearest trauma center. But coming to terms with his injuries was a challenge the family wasn\u2019t prepared for.\n\nGrant Virgin had a torn aorta and his hugely traumatic brain injuries included fractures of the skull as well as bleeding in the brain. His spine and many of his other bones were fractured.\n\nWhen John, Bryce and Grant\u2019s mother JJ got to the hospital they were not prepared for a hopeless prognosis. So while the doctors advised them \u201clet him go,\u201d they said not a chance.\n\nHospital Treatment\n\nHaving refused to pull the plug, the medical team operated on Grant a number of times, and for a long time he was on a ventilator, and in a coma. It became a waiting game to see if and when his brain would heal.\n\nBut John and JJ weren\u2019t there for a wait. Even though Grant\u2019s physical injuries were stabilized, his brain function wasn\u2019t improving very much. That was when a friend suggested progesterone (which has been shown in research studies to reduce brain swellings) and fish oil, which they had learned had been used to help others who had been pronounced brain dead. They started by rubbing a progesterone-based cream on him, and later started administering very high doses of omega-3 fish oil.\n\nNobody really knows why it works \u2013 and it isn\u2019t only Grant who has benefited from the fish oil treatment \u2013 but it is thought to be because the cell wall of the brain contains high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. As Dr Michael Lewis, founder of the Brain Health Education and Research Institute has been quoted as saying, if you supplement omega-3 fatty acids \u201cin substantial doses, you provide the foundation for the brain to repair itself.\u201d One thing Grant\u2019s parents believe is that this miraculous oil helped to heal their half-dead son.\n\nFrom Coma to Conversation\n\nWhile there are concerns amongst medical and other people in terms of the treatment given to Grant Virgin, the only thing his family care about is that he is alive.\n\nJJ and John reportedly sneaked small quantities of fish oil into the tube that was feeding him for several weeks. Then the decision was made to give him huge doses of the oil. Just two days later, Grant was able to phone his mother and talk to her. All she could say afterwards was: \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe most unbelievable part was that, as the family told CNN, it was only two months after doctors had said that they should pull the tube and \u201clet him go.\u201d\n\nHow Fish Oil Works\n\nAccording to Dr. Barry Sears, a leading omega-3 specialist and President of the Inflammation Research Foundation, the fatty acid has a miraculous ability to switch off the inflammation using a metabolite of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that is known as resolvin.\n\nThere are not prizes for guessing that EPA is found in fish oil.\n\nUsed in very high doses, the fish oil with its EPA becomes an incredibly powerful anti-inflammatory agent.\n\nOther Success Stories\n\nGrant Virgin is not the only brain damaged patient to have been given fish oil as a treatment. Other cases include a teenager, Bobby Ghassemi who nearly died in a car accident and was miraculously healed with vast infusions of fish oil; and an eight-year-old girl who nearly drowned after her head was under the water for five minutes or more and who was then treated with high doses of omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nIn fact, according to Dr. Sears there are seven documented cases that can be found in medical literature. However, he also concedes that there are cases when fish oil has not worked.\n\nBut ask the Virgin family for their opinion and they will tell you that fish oil worked where conventional medicine couldn\u2019t. Whether it was a miracle or something based on solid science that we still don\u2019t really understand, the half dead teenage who was taken from an horrific accident scene in 2012 is alive and able to function. Grant Virgin is happy to be alive.\n\nBy Penny Swift\n\nSources:\n\nNY Daily News\n\nCNN\n\nDaily Mail\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "When 16-year-old Grant Virgin was critically injured and left comatose after an horrendous hit and run car accident in 2012, his desperate parents were willing to try anything to bring him back to \u2026", "title": "Fish Oil Used to Miraculously Help Heal Half Dead Teenager", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2014/01/fish-oil-used-to-miraculously-help-heal-half-dead-teenager/", "image": {"width": 649, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Codliveroilcapsules-e1390172655953.jpg", "height": 499}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T23:49:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T23:49:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Codliveroilcapsules-e1390172655953.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf147\"", "article_summary": "They started by rubbing a progesterone-based cream on him, and later started administering very high doses of omega-3 fish oil.\nThe Accident That Left Grant Virgin Half DeadThe accident that nearly killed Grant Virgin of Palm Desert in California was one of those nightmares that no parent ever wants to live through.\nUsed in very high doses, the fish oil with its EPA becomes an incredibly powerful anti-inflammatory agent.\nBut ask the Virgin family for their opinion and they will tell you that fish oil worked where conventional medicine couldn\u2019t.\nHowever, he also concedes that there are cases when fish oil has not worked."}
