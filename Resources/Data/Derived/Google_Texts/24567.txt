TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A Washington state man who used a homeless Denver man’s identity for more than a decade has been sentenced to two years and three months in federal prison.

The News Tribune newspaper reports (http://goo.gl/PqYc2V ) that 62-year-old Richard Alan Dyson, of the Seattle suburb of Kent, used the man’s identity for about 15 years to work in construction while also getting disability benefits.

When the homeless man tried to get Social Security benefits, he was denied at first, because the other man’s work history was under his name.

Dyson pleaded guilty last year to felony theft of public funds and aggravated identity theft. Seattle U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez sentenced him on Thursday.
