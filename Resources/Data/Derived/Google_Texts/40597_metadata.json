The February enrollment period is only for self-plus-one changes, and is not an extension of Open Season, which ended in mid-December, OPM said.\n\n\u201cOnly decreases in enrollment from self and family to self-plus-one will be allowed,\u201d the agency said in a press release.\n\nThe self-plus-one coverage option, included in the 2013 budget deal, gives feds with one eligible family member, such as a spouse or a dependent up to age 26, a new FEHBP enrollment choice. The new offering could save those currently enrolled in FEHBP\u2019s self and family plan on average 6 percent in current premium costs in 2016, OPM has estimated, while self and family premiums are expected to rise by 7 percent on average.\n\nOPM processed more than 600,000 FEHBP enrollment transactions during Open Season this year \u2013 a record high, according to the agency.\n\nThat\u2019s 170,000 more transactions than the previous high of 430,000 in 2014. Feds and retirees can choose or switch plans under FEHBP, as well as sign up for flexible spending accounts, during the annual Open Season, which ran from Nov. 9 through Dec. 14 this year. OPM attributed the increase to the debut of self-plus-one, available beginning in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis year, with the new self-plus-one enrollment type available, it was more important than ever that enrollees review the plans available to them and to make an informed decision . . . and they did,\u201d said John O\u2019Brien, OPM\u2019s director of healthcare and insurance. \u201cWe emphasized the need to shop around, to do what is best for you and your family\u2019s healthcare needs. And, all at the same time, perhaps saving you money.\u201d\n\n(Image via altanaka/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "OPM announces limited enrollment period \u2013 and record number of transactions during Open Season.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "OPM announces limited enrollment period \u2013 and record number of transactions during Open Season.", "title": "Feds Interested In Self-Plus-One Have Another Shot in February", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/12/feds-interested-self-plus-one-have-another-shot-february/124706/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/22/shutterstock_326426522.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "OPM announces limited enrollment period \u2013 and record number of transactions during Open Season.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/22/shutterstock_326426522/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Feds Interested In Self-Plus-One Have Another Shot in February", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-22T16:37:22Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/22/shutterstock_326426522.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Feds Interested In Self-Plus-One Have Another Shot in February", "keywords": "fehbp, open season, self-plus-one", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/22/shutterstock_326426522/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "fehbp,open-season,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "OPM announces limited enrollment period \u2013 and record number of transactions during Open Season."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b77\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOnly decreases in enrollment from self and family to self-plus-one will be allowed,\u201d the agency said in a press release.\nThe February enrollment period is only for self-plus-one changes, and is not an extension of Open Season, which ended in mid-December, OPM said.\nOPM processed more than 600,000 FEHBP enrollment transactions during Open Season this year \u2013 a record high, according to the agency.\nOPM attributed the increase to the debut of self-plus-one, available beginning in 2016.\n\u201cThis year, with the new self-plus-one enrollment type available, it was more important than ever that enrollees review the plans available to them and to make an informed decision ."}
