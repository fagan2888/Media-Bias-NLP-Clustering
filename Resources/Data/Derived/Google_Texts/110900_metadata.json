Emanuel showed KJRH-OK the call logs displaying how long he waited to speak to a representative from the health care exchange. The call logs show that Emanuel waited 131 minutes one time and 126 minutes another time.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield then terminated his wife\u2019s health insurance. \u201cI paid the premiums for our joint policy \u2013 even though I wasn\u2019t supposed to- and then I paid the premiums for my wife\u2019s new policy,\u201d Emanuel explained.\n\nIt took healthcare.gov three months to notify BlueCross BlueShield that Emanuel is covered by Medicare.
