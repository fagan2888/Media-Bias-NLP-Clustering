Five years after moving out of fiscal emergency status Springfield City School District is projecting large positive cash balances for the next five years. Jeff Guerini/Staff\n\nBy Katie Wedell\n\nStaff Writer\n\nFive years after emerging from fiscal emergency and state oversight, Springfield City School District is projecting positive cash balances of more than $20 million for the next five years.\n\nThe school board credited several factors with the turnaround including support of several key levies from voters, concessions made on the part of staff and an uptick in student population for the first time years.\n\nThe district is expecting to bring in about $88.5 million in fiscal year 2015 while spending about $88.4 million.\n\nJust over 75 percent of that revenue will come from the state. Benefits and wages make up nearly 70 percent of the district\u2019s spending.\n\nAt the end of FY14 the district reported an ending cash balance of about $27 million. The same amount is projected at the end of this fiscal year followed by conservative projections for the next four years with ending balances dropping to $22.8 million in FY19.\n\nFor comparison, district Treasurer Dale Miller said the district had an year-end balance of only $7 million in 2006, the first year after projecting a deficit and having the state take over their finances.\n\n\u201cSpringfield\u2019s in a good place,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to provide every student every opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe school board approved the district\u2019s five-year financial forecast last week, which must be submitted to the state by Friday.\n\nThe projections are based on several assumptions, the most critical being the renewal of two operating levies \u2014 a 7-mill levy which expires in 2015 and a 9.59-mill levy which expires in 2018. Combined, the levies generate about $7 million annually.\n\nIt was the passage of the second levy in 2006 which, along with slashing 200 jobs and $15 million from the budget, that helped buoy the district out of fiscal emergency, Miller said.\n\n\u201cThe main reason we were able to do that was the support of our taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\nSince coming out of state supervision in 2009, the district has been successful in keeping controllable expenditures, such as utilities, down, Miller said.\n\n\u201cWe spent several million in updating our heating and cooling systems,\u201d school board President Ed Leventhal said. He added that this has already had an impact in terms of energy cost savings.\n\nOther measures that helped were a three-year salary freeze for staff and a rebound in the student population, he said, which had been on a sharp decline for years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not losing the number of students we had been,\u201d Leventhal said.\n\nIn fact, the district has gained 177 students since 2012.\n\nSCSD doesn\u2019t necessarily get more money for each of those students, said Superintendent David Estrop, because of the state funding cap \u2014 but it gets some.\n\n\u201cWhat it shows is that people are voting with their feet,\u201d he said, referring to them choosing to stay in the district rather than leaving for other options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of people a lot of work \u2026 to go from essentially bankruptcy five years ago to solvency today,\u201d Estrop said.\n\nHe called the looming levy renewal the only cloud on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t financially stable, then we wouldn\u2019t have seen so much improvement in student achievement,\u201d Estrop added.\n\nSome other variables that affect the forecast are out of the district\u2019s control and have been factored into the projections, according to the forecast.\n\nThe most recent reductions in property valuations due to the 2013 reappraisal have been incorporated and the district acknowledges that health care costs could increase as much as 2 percent as additional portions of the Affordable Care Act are rolled out.\n\nThe five-year report also points out that there are provisions in the new state budget which could decrease district revenues and increase expenditures in the form of expanded EdChoice Scholarships, the income-based voucher program and other school choice options.\n\nCurrently about 16 percent of the district\u2019s expenditures are expected to be eaten up by those services. That\u2019s about $14 million in state funds which is designated for the public school district, but is deducted when families choose to take advantage of various choice programs and scholarships.\n\nAbout 11 percent of the projected $88 million in expenditures in fiscal year \u201815 is expected to go to other paid services such as utility costs and property insurance while materials are expected to account for about 3 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after emerging from fiscal emergency & state oversight, Springfield City School District is projecting positive cash balances through 2019.", "og": {"url": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/scsd-5-year-forecast-reflects-positive-momentum/nhshj/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/d7/72/SNS-Facebook-Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Five years after emerging from fiscal emergency & state oversight, Springfield City School District is projecting positive cash balances through 2019.", "title": "SCSD sees positives in 5-year finance plan |Springfield, OH News"}, "twitter": {"site": "@springfieldnews", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/10/27/10/60/School-5.jpg", "description": "Five years after emerging from fiscal emergency and state oversight, Springfield City School District is projecting positive cash balances of more than $20 million for the next five years.", "card": "summary", "title": "SCSD 5-year forecast reflects positive momentum"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "springfieldnewssun", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/scsd-5-year-forecast-reflects-positive-momentum/nhshj/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2669673/news/news/scsd-5-year-forecast-reflects-positive-momentum/nhshj/", "keywords": "community,education,local,SNShomepage,SNShptop,springfield,snsnewslettertop", "google-site-verification": "8vJEEijbdFqCz5Jlhv2SIUUb093Tw1ZWl6RD1VU7ZsU", "news_keywords": "snsnewslettertop, springfield, SNShptop, SNShomepage, local, education, community"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccaf\"", "article_summary": "Currently about 16 percent of the district\u2019s expenditures are expected to be eaten up by those services.\nFive years after moving out of fiscal emergency status Springfield City School District is projecting large positive cash balances for the next five years.\nThe district is expecting to bring in about $88.5 million in fiscal year 2015 while spending about $88.4 million.\nThat\u2019s about $14 million in state funds which is designated for the public school district, but is deducted when families choose to take advantage of various choice programs and scholarships.\nCassidy Roberts, left, and Haley Demana give a biometric presentation for their Human Body System class at Springfield High School."}
