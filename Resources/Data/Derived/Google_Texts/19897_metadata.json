For the fourth year, Consumer Reports is publishing rankings of hundreds of health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, and, for the first time, plans available in Obamacare. Among new choices in the health plan are Medicaid HMOs. This is also the first time for the organization to take additional steps to identify plans that both provide high-quality care and avoid costly care.\n\nThe full report is available in the November issue of Consumer Reports. The latest health plan rankings are also available for free online at www.ConsumerReports.org/healthinsurance.\n\nThe rankings data and the \u201cBest Value\u201d designation come from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), a respected non-profit health care quality measurement group. Overall, Consumer Reports and NCQA have information on more than 1,000 private, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid plans.\n\nDiabetes management key to Best Value rating\n\nThe new Best Value designation for plans is based on how well a plan helps people with diabetes manage their condition. Consumer Reports focused on diabetes for several reasons. The disease has reached epidemic proportions, affecting some 26 million Americans. In addition, managing diabetes requires good, basic care for things like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels\u2014as well as coordination among providers. Plans that get diabetes care right are likely to do a lot of things well.\n\nTip from Consumer Reports I am in Medicare, what do I do about Obamacare? You don\u2019t have to do anything or buy anything extra. Medicare Part A and Advantage plans fully qualify as insurance under the new law. And nothing significant about Medicare is changing in 2014. Benefits and programs will work the same as they do now. But there is one situation in which the new health care law might help: You are a new enrollee and your spouse isn\u2019t on Medicare yet. Once the older spouse enrolls in Medicare, the younger, often nonworking spouse, may suddenly be without insurance. The spouse often has a hard time buying an individual policy because of pre-existing conditions. Now the younger spouse can buy a plan on the marketplace and not worry about getting turned down or charged extra on the basis of a pre-existing condition. Note: If you\u2019re the younger spouse, you\u2019ll need to put down your joint income when applying for marketplace coverage, even though you\u2019re the only one doing the buying. Your subsidy, if any, will be based on that number.\n\nFinally, treating diabetes is expensive, especially if basic care is neglected, so plans that provide good diabetes care for less money should have more resources available to cover other conditions or to reduce premiums.\n\nThe analysis of 997 Medicare plans identified 114 that got a Best Value designation, earning check marks for both providing high quality care and avoiding costly care. Many more - 402 plans - got a check mark for one but not both of those measures. And, 481 plans didn\u2019t get a check mark for either. That could be because they had poor results for these measures or they did not report the data needed for this analysis.\n\nHigh cost not always equal better care\n\n\u201cConsumer Reports\u2019 analysis found that expensive care doesn\u2019t mean better care. Many people incorrectly assume that the more money that\u2019s spent on health care, the better health care will be,\u201d said John Santa, M.D., medical director of Consumer Reports Health. \u201cBut as these ratings show, the data found no connection between cost and quality.\u201d\n\nThe rankings could be especially valuable to consumers this year because health insurance becomes a requirement for just about everyone in the U.S. on January 1, 2014 under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Though much attention is now being focused on the ACA, at least 80 percent of Americans will notice almost no change because they already have insurance that meets the law\u2019s requirements. This includes the 49 percent of Americans who get health insurance through their or someone else\u2019s job, as well as people who get insurance through Medicare or some other type of government plan.\n\nThe centerpiece of the transformed health care system is an entirely new way of choosing and purchasing individual health insurance known generically as marketplaces. They opened for business on October 1, 2013, in every state. In subsequent years, it will take place on the same schedule as Medicare open enrollment: Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.\n\nPlans listed in these new marketplaces and in this Consumer Reports/NCQA insurance ranking aren\u2019t identical. That\u2019s because all the plans in the marketplace are new, so NCQA doesn\u2019t yet have data for them. Nonetheless, a plan\u2019s record in a specific state provides a good indication of how well a new and similar marketplace plan by the same provider may perform.\n\nMedicare Open Enrollment\n\nOct. 15 - Dec. 7 When people with Medicare can choose their plans for 2014 Click to Medicare Site\n\nConsumer Reports\u2019 publication of NCQA ranking of more than 1,000 private, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid health insurance plans nationwide can be viewed through the lens of coverage via an employer (or through a family member\u2019s), through Medicare or Medicaid, or insurance on-your-own through the new health exchange marketplaces.\n\nThe report provides overall scores from 1 to 100 reflecting plans\u2019 performance across many aspects of care. These include cancer screenings, immunizations and other preventative services, and treatments for chronic diseases such as heart disease, osteoporosis and mental illness. Customer satisfaction and results from NCQA accreditation surveys also contribute to the overall scores.\n\nConsumer Reports has created a free online tool at www.HealthLawHelper.org to help consumers better understand how they may be impacted by the Affordable Care Act. After answering a series of questions about family, income and current insurance (if any), consumers receive personalized information on what options they may have. They will not be given a particular insurance plan to buy, but advice on how to make the best decision. www.HealthLawHelper.org is free and confidential and is also available in Spanish at www.AseguraTuSalud.org .\n\nIf you get insurance through Medicare: Americans 65 and older almost always qualify for Medicare coverage. You can also enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO or PPO. To see whether the plans make sense for you, go to ConsumerReports.org/medicare. Then look at the rankings of Medicare Advantage HMOs and PPOs in Consumer Reports to see how the options compare on overall score, their consumer satisfaction score, and whether they earned a Best Value check mark. Also check Medicare\u2019s website, medicare.gov, for the plans\u2019 star rating scores. NCQA\u2019s rankings reflect much of the data you\u2019ll find there, but Medicare also includes some of its own data.--Most important, Medicare pays bonuses to plans that earn three or more stars in its scoring system, so plans that score high in the Medicare star ratings may have more funds to spend on your care. If you get insurance through Medicaid: More people than ever will now be eligible for Medicaid, because of changes from the Affordable Care Act. To see NCQA rankings for Medicaid HMOs, go to ConsumerReports.org/Medicaid.\n\nFinancial Relief for Volkswagen Diesel Owners You may be eligible for money damages if you owned or leased one of these VW, Porsche or Audi vehicles.
