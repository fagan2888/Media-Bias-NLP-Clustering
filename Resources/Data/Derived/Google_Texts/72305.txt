â€” A 92-year-old woman is spreading joy and hope across the Triangle to those who need it most in the new year.

Polly Williams has spent the past 19 years volunteering for cancer patients at Rex Hospital.

Patients describe Polly as a healer with a medicine bag full of smiles, comforting words and hugs.

"This is my life," Williams said. "This is what I want to do."

Williams has logged 20,000 volunteer hours at the hospital and said she has enjoyed every minute.
