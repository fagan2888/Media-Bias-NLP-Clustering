The Court bestowed religious freedom on their corporation as well \u2013 a leap of logic as absurd as giving corporations freedom of speech. Corporations aren\u2019t people.\n\nThe deeper problem is the Court\u2019s obliviousness to the growing imbalance of economic power between corporations and real people. By giving companies the right not offer employees contraceptive services otherwise mandated by law, the Court ignored the rights of employees to receive those services.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\n(Justice Alito\u2019s suggestion that those services could be provided directly by the federal government is as politically likely as is a single-payer federal health-insurance plan \u2013 which presumably would be necessary to supply such contraceptives or any other Obamacare service corporations refuse to offer on religious grounds.)\n\nThe same imbalance of power rendered the Court\u2019s decision in \u201cCitizens United,\u201d granting corporations freedom of speech, so perverse. In reality, corporate free speech drowns out the free speech of ordinary people who can\u2019t flood the halls of Congress with campaign contributions.\n\nFreedom is the one value conservatives place above all others, yet time and again their ideal of freedom ignores the growing imbalance of power in our society that\u2019s eroding the freedoms of most people.\n\nThis isn\u2019t new. In the early 1930s, the Court trumped New Deal legislation with \u201cfreedom of contract\u201d \u2013 the presumed right of people to make whatever deals they want unencumbered by federal regulations. Eventually (perhaps influenced by FDR\u2019s threat to expand the Court and pack it with his own appointees) the Court relented.\n\nBut the conservative mind has never incorporated economic power into its understanding of freedom. Conservatives still champion \u201cfree enterprise\u201d and equate the so-called \u201cfree market\u201d with liberty. To them, government \u201cintrusions\u201d on the market threaten freedom.\n\nYet the \u201cfree market\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in nature. There, only the fittest and strongest survive. The \u201cfree market\u201d is the product of laws and rules continuously emanating from legislatures, executive departments, and courts. Government doesn\u2019t \u201cintrude\u201d on the free market. It defines and organizes (and often reorganizes) it.\n\nHere\u2019s where the reality of power comes in. It\u2019s one thing if these laws and rules are shaped democratically, reflecting the values and preferences of most people.\n\nBut anyone with half a brain can see the growing concentration of income and wealth at the top of America has concentrated political power there as well \u2014 generating laws and rules that tilt the playing field ever further in the direction of corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAntitrust laws designed to constrain monopolies have been eviscerated. Competition among Internet service providers, for example, is rapidly disappearing \u2013 resulting in higher prices than in any other rich country. Companies are being allowed to prolong patents and trademarks, keeping drug prices higher here than in Canada or Europe.\n\nTax laws favor capital over labor, giving capital gains a lower rate than ordinary income. The rich get humongous mortgage interest deductions while renters get no deduction at all.\n\nThe value of real property (the major asset of the middle class) is taxed annually, but not the value of stocks and bonds (where the rich park most of their wealth).\n\nBankruptcy laws allow companies to smoothly reorganize, but not college graduates burdened by student loans.\n\nThe minimum wage is steadily losing value, while CEO pay is in the stratosphere. Under U.S. law, shareholders have only an \u201cadvisory\u201d role in determining what CEOs rake in.\n\nPublic goods paid for with tax revenues (public schools, affordable public universities, parks, roads, bridges) are deteriorating, while private goods paid for individually (private schools and colleges, health clubs, security guards, gated community amenities) are burgeoning.\n\nI could go on, but you get the point. The so-called \u201cfree market\u201d is not expanding options and opportunities for most people. It\u2019s extending them for the few who are wealthy enough to influence how the market is organized.\n\nMost of us remain \u201cfree\u201d in limited sense of not being coerced into purchasing, say, the medications or Internet services that are unnecessarily expensive, or contraceptives they can no longer get under their employer\u2019s insurance plan. We can just go without.\n\nWe\u2019re likewise free not to be burdened with years of student debt payments; no one is required to attend college. And we\u2019re free not to rent a place in a neighborhood with lousy schools and pot-holed roads; if we can\u2019t afford better, we\u2019re free to work harder so we can.\n\nBut this is a very parched view of freedom.\n\nConservatives who claim to be on the side of freedom while ignoring the growing imbalance of economic and political power in America are not in fact on the side of freedom. They are on the side of those with the power.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, contraception, contraception mandate, corporation, freedom, hobby lobby, money, obamacare, politics, religion, religious corporations, religious freedom, robert reich, scotus, scotus hobby lobby", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Freedom is the one value conservatives place above all others, yet time and again their ideal of freedom ignores the growing imbalance of power in our society that\u2019s eroding the freedoms of most people.\n - 2014/07/03", "title": "Freedom, Power, and the Conservative Mind: Robert Reich", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/freedom_power_and_the_conservative_mind_20140703", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/conmind_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Freedom is the one value conservatives place above all others, yet time and again their ideal of freedom ignores the growing imbalance of power in our society that\u2019s eroding the freedoms of most people.", "creator": "@truthdig", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/freedom_power_and_the_conservative_mind_20140703/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/conmind_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "title": "Freedom, Power, and the Conservative Mind | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Freedom, Power, and the Conservative Mind, business, contraception, contraception mandate, corporation, freedom, hobby lobby, money, obamacare, politics, religion, religious corporations, religious freedom, robert reich, scotus, scotus hobby lobby", "article": {"tag": "business, contraception, contraception mandate, corporation, freedom, hobby lobby, money, obamacare, politics, religion, religious corporations, religious freedom, robert reich, scotus, scotus hobby lobby", "published_time": "2014-07-03T03:54:23-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T07:20:24-08:00"}, "description": "Freedom is the one value conservatives place above all others, yet time and again their ideal of freedom ignores the growing imbalance of power in our society that\u2019s eroding the freedoms of most people.\n - 2014/07/03"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e9e\"", "article_summary": "In reality, corporate free speech drowns out the free speech of ordinary people who can\u2019t flood the halls of Congress with campaign contributions.\nThe same imbalance of power rendered the Court\u2019s decision in \u201cCitizens United,\u201d granting corporations freedom of speech, so perverse.\nThe Court bestowed religious freedom on their corporation as well \u2013 a leap of logic as absurd as giving corporations freedom of speech.\nBut the conservative mind has never incorporated economic power into its understanding of freedom.\nConservatives still champion \u201cfree enterprise\u201d and equate the so-called \u201cfree market\u201d with liberty."}
