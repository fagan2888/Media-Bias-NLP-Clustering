Mitchell on 1 November 2013 13:29\n\nYou would think Halloween would be the favorite holiday for leftists. After all, you go to other people\u2019s houses and get free candy.\n\nBut since the entire process is voluntary, that spoils the fun for our coercion-loving statist friends. Which may explain why a lot of Halloween humor has a libertarian bent. My favorite example is the video of a comedian explaining how to teach your kids about taxes after they\u2019re done trick-or-treating.\n\nToday, though, we\u2019re going to enjoy a bunch of cartoons, starting with this Jerry Holbert gem showing Obama and his senior staff putting together his healthcare plan.\n\nThe part about taxpayer wallets is painfully accurate.\n\nSticking with the witch theme, Ken Catalino\u2019s cartoon makes a good point about Obamacare\u2019s economic impact.\n\nThis Tim Hartman cartoon could have been taken directly from today\u2019s headlines.\n\nIt seems kids always have bad experiences when they make Halloween stops at the White House.\n\nThe witch theme returns with this Lisa Benson cartoon featuring Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSteve Kelley mocks the President\u2019s serial dishonesty about Obamacare in this cartoon.\n\nAnd this Henry Payne cartoon reminds us that maybe it\u2019s not a bad idea to shut down the government.\n\nHmmm\u2026I think I\u2019ve already seen that idea.\n\nHere\u2019s Henry Payne again.\n\nYet another example of what happens when you trick-or-treat at the White House.\n\nLast but not least, here\u2019s John McPherson celebrating some very scary costumes.\n\nSpeaking of which, click here if you like mocking politicians.\n\nDaniel J.
