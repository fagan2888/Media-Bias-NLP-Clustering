As the New York Times reports this morning, one of the factors that led to this scandal was the regulatory structure that allows car manufacturers to do their own emission tests or to select the companies with which they will contract to perform them.\n\nIn other words, with self-policing for environmental pollution you inevitably get\u2026wait for it\u2026cheating. The drive for profits often makes the temptation to cook the books is too great.\n\nThis brings us to one of the centerpieces of the so-called \u201cregulatory reform\u201d legislation (aka the \u201cPolluter Protection Act\u201d) that\u2019s currently awaiting final action in the General Assembly as lawmakers move toward adjournment next week. As was explained earlier this week by the good people at the N.C. League of Conservation Voters, the proposed law would enact a regulatory framework that is even weaker than the one that gave rise to the VW scandal. This is from the League\u2019s Weekly Conservation Bulletin:\n\n\u201cThe big environmental fight surely looming over the remainder of this legislative year deals with HB 765, now better known as the Polluter Protection Act. Why is that? In brief, imagine this: A corporate polluter \u2013 one of those occasional bad actors whose irresponsible behavior undercuts the efforts of the more ethical majority of businesses \u2013 has been carelessly dumping unpermitted pollution into your local river. It realizes that it is finally about to be caught, either by concerned citizens or one of the overworked remaining state environmental enforcement staff. It quickly runs a \u2018self-audit\u2019 and confesses to its regrettable \u201cmistake\u201d of dumping excess pollution into the river feeding the local water supply. Hey, presto! Said corporate polluter gets immunity and is let off the hook from fines and penalties on the basis of its promise to do better from now on. This isn\u2019t satire; that kind of provision is actually contained in the Polluter Protection Act.\n\nIn other words, under the proposed new model for North Carolina, a polluter could be as guilty as Volkswagen and then, upon being discovered, simply self-report its behavior as a \u201cmistake\u201d and avoid any liability.\n\nOf course, for every polluter who finally realizes they\u2019re about to get caught and self-reports, there will undoubtedly be many more who will go their merry way, degrading our environment without any consequences at all. Others, like VW, will get away with murder for many years and never even face the kind of consequences that awaits the giant car maker.\n\nThe bottom line: The self-policing provision of the \u201cregulatory reform\u201d bill makes a mockery of our environmental protection laws and citizens will be the ones who will pay the price.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd212f\"", "article_summary": "This isn\u2019t satire; that kind of provision is actually contained in the Polluter Protection Act.\nIn other words, with self-policing for environmental pollution you inevitably get\u2026wait for it\u2026cheating.\nThe bottom line: The self-policing provision of the \u201cregulatory reform\u201d bill makes a mockery of our environmental protection laws and citizens will be the ones who will pay the price.\nThis is from the League\u2019s Weekly Conservation Bulletin:\u201cThe big environmental fight surely looming over the remainder of this legislative year deals with HB 765, now better known as the Polluter Protection Act.\nThis brings us to one of the centerpieces of the so-called \u201cregulatory reform\u201d legislation (aka the \u201cPolluter Protection Act\u201d) that\u2019s currently awaiting final action in the General Assembly as lawmakers move toward adjournment next week."}
