The federal government recently implemented the Affordable Care Act, a nationwide health initiative that's changing the health insurance market. Next year, the Association of American Medical Colleges will roll out a brand new MCAT, an admissions exam that helps determine who gets into medical school and who does not.\n\nAnother major change in the works will shape the way medical students prepare for residencies.\n\nThe Association for American Medical Colleges in June announced the creation of a new set of guidelines, known as the Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency. Medical schools can use them to help students transition to a residency program. In residency, new doctors receive additional training for what usually lasts three or more years.\n\n\"There has been a growing literature that looks at the expectations of program directors versus performance of students or new residents on day one, and showing that there\u2019s a gap there,\" says Bob Englander, the senior director for competency-based learning and assessment at the association. \"What they expect and what they\u2019re actually able to do on day one is not always the same.\"\n\n[Find out how to avoid medical school pitfalls.]\n\nThe new guidelines aim to eliminate this gap. \u200b\n\nThey identify 13 activities that all new resident\u200bs should be able to do on their first day, such as perform a physical exam on a patient, write a medical order \u200b and form clinical questions and retrieve evidence, says Englander.\n\nThose are the kinds of things that have a potentially big impact if people aren't able to do them on arrival, he says. \u200b\n\nIn September the association announced a pilot cohort of 10 schools that will help test the implementation of the guidelines by tweaking their curriculum and possibly establishing new ways\u200b to ensure that students can do the 13 activities. The cohort includes the School of Medicine at Vanderbilt University, \u200bthe School of Medicine at New York University, the College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University \u200band University of Illinois College of Medicine. It will last for five years, Englander says, and have its first group meeting this month. Schools have already started working on how to better prepare residents.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160504_postsecondary\",\"text\":\"There are more than 2,900 four-year, degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Simulations are one tool that medical schools in a pilot program are using to better prepare their students for residency.", "zone": "top medical schools", "author": "Delece Smith-Barrow", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Simulations are one tool that medical schools in a pilot program are using to better prepare their students for residency.", "title": "Medical Schools Change How Students Prepare for Work", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2014/10/06/medical-schools-aim-to-better-prepare-new-doctors-for-residency", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1e/ee/1495c0de4322b218f13c03106123/141003edumedicalstudents-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Medical Schools Aim to Better Prepare New Doctors for Residency - US News", "description": "Simulations are one tool that medical schools in a pilot program are using to better prepare their students for residency.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "Best Grad", "keywords": "medicine,education,medical school,students,graduate schools,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,Delece Smith-Barrow", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3fsav", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-06", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-06"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9205042/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F1e%2Fee%2F1495c0de4322b218f13c03106123%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141003edumedicalstudents-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0751\"", "article_summary": "Another major change in the works will shape the way medical students prepare for residencies.\nMedical schools can use them to help students transition to a residency program.\n[Find out how to avoid medical school pitfalls.]\nNext year, the Association of American Medical Colleges will roll out a brand new MCAT, an admissions exam that helps determine who gets into medical school and who does not.\nSchools have already started working on how to better prepare residents."}
