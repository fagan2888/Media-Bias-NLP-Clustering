Garretson, SD

Fire crews in Minnehaha County worked hard to prevent a garage fire from spreading too far into a rural Garretson home Sunday afternoon.

The garage caught fire late this morning north of Garretson. Pictures shared by the Minnehaha County Emergency Rescue Squad on Facebook show that a vehicle and other contents inside the garage were scorched.

Volunteers from Garretson, Brandon, Valley Springs, Baltic, and Renner came to help prevent it from moving into the family's home. No word on whether anyone was hurt or what caused the fire.
