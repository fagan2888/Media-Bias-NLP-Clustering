Or, watch his remarks above (via The White House)\n\nHi, everybody. Yesterday, we learned that in 2013, our businesses created 2.2 million new jobs \u2013 including 87,000 last month. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since October 2008. And across our broader economy, there are signs of progress. Our manufacturing and housing sectors are rebounding. Our energy, technology, and auto sectors are booming. Thanks in part to the reforms in the Affordable Care Act, health care costs now eat up less of our economy \u2013 over the past four years, costs have grown at the slowest rate on record. And since I took office, we\u2019ve cut our deficits by more than half.\n\n\n\nThanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, our economy is growing stronger. But we know we\u2019ve got more work to do together. Our success as a country depends on more than the success of our broader economy \u2013 it depends on the success of the American people. It depends on your ability to make ends meet, provide for your families, and, with a little hard work, feel like you can get ahead.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got to keep our economy growing, and make sure more Americans have the opportunity to share in that growth. We\u2019ve got to keep creating jobs that offer new opportunity, and make sure those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let you rebuild some security. We\u2019ve got more kids to educate, and families to get covered with health insurance, and an immigration system to fix. And we\u2019ve got to make sure this recovery leaves no one behind.\n\n\n\nThis will be a year of action. I\u2019ll keep doing everything I can to create new jobs and new opportunities for American families \u2013 with Congress, on my own, and with everyone willing to play their part. And that action should begin by extending unemployment insurance for Americans who were laid off in the recession through no fault of their own. This vital economic lifeline helps people support their families while they look for a new job. And it demands responsibility in return by requiring that they prove they\u2019re actively looking for work. But Republicans in Congress just let that lifeline expire for 1.3 million Americans. And if this doesn\u2019t get fixed, it will actually hurt about 14 million Americans over the course of this year. Earlier this week, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate took the first steps toward making this right. But Congress needs to finish the job right away. More than one million Americans across the country will feel a little hope right away.\n\n\n\nWorking folks are looking for the kind of stable, secure jobs that went overseas in the past couple decades. So next week, I\u2019ll join companies and colleges and take action to boost the high-tech manufacturing that attracts the kind of good new jobs a growing middle class requires.\n\n\n\nBusiness owners are ready to play their part and hire more workers. So next week, I\u2019ll be joined by college presidents as we lay out specific steps we can take to help more workers earn the skills they need for today\u2019s new jobs. Later this month I\u2019ll host CEOs at the White House to announce commitments we\u2019re making to put more of the long-term unemployed back to work.\n\n\n\nAnd at the end of the month, in my State of the Union Address, I will mobilize the country around the national mission of making sure our economy offers everyone who works hard a fair shot at opportunity and success. As Americans, that\u2019s what we should expect. And after everything you\u2019ve done to recover and rebuild from crisis these past five years \u2013 after all your hard work and sacrifice \u2013 that\u2019s what you deserve.\n\n\n\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama is calling 2014 \"a year of action\" for creating jobs and economic opportunities for American families.\n\nIn his...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-01-12 10:37:58 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama is calling 2014 \"a year of action\" for creating jobs and economic opportunities for American families.\n\nIn his...", "title": "Obama: 2014 'Will Be A Year Of Action' On Jobs", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/11/obama-2014-jobs_n_4581120.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1556991/images/o-OBAMA-2014-JOBS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1556991/images/o-OBAMA-2014-JOBS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama is calling 2014 \"a year of action\" for creating jobs and economic opportunities for American families.\n\nIn his...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama: 2014 'Will Be A Year Of Action' On Jobs"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-11 10:37:58 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4581120", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "obama jobs,congress Unemployment Insurance,congress,obama 2014,video,obama 2014 jobs,obama unemployment insurance,Obama weekly address,unemployment insurance,obama,obama congress", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "obama jobs,congress Unemployment Insurance,congress,obama 2014,video,obama 2014 jobs,obama unemployment insurance,Obama weekly address,unemployment insurance,obama,obama congress", "published_time": "2014-01-11 10:37:58 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-01-25 16:01:55 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd307b\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve got to keep creating jobs that offer new opportunity, and make sure those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let you rebuild some security.\nSo next week, I\u2019ll join companies and colleges and take action to boost the high-tech manufacturing that attracts the kind of good new jobs a growing middle class requires.\nYesterday, we learned that in 2013, our businesses created 2.2 million new jobs \u2013 including 87,000 last month.\nAnd if this doesn\u2019t get fixed, it will actually hurt about 14 million Americans over the course of this year.\nWorking folks are looking for the kind of stable, secure jobs that went overseas in the past couple decades."}
