They were looking for 22-year-old Bekime \u201cBecky\u201d Elshani.\n\nBecky\u2019s father and friends had called 911 and said they hadn\u2019t seen or heard from her since Saturday morning, 2 1/2 days earlier. Her parents told police she was wearing a pink and white shirt, a black jacket and blue jeans.\n\nSuddenly, as the police officers walked towards the apartment door, they heard a single gunshot.\n\nThe apartment was where Becky lived with her 25-year-old boyfriend, Daniel Dereere.\n\nThe story of Becky\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s volatile relationship has since been widely reported by newspaper and TV reporters. In writing the following account of the ongoing unsolved case, I relied upon their many reports as well as what I recall of the case after writing a few stories for The Denver Post at the time myself.\n\nElshani and Dereere met either in 2002 or 2003 while working at a telephone call center in Colorado Springs. They dated off and on through the years. Becky became involved with another man, briefly marrying him, during a period when Dereere moved to Detroit, The Gazette reported.\n\nDaniel returned to Colorado Springs, and he and Becky moved in together in early 2007.\n\nDaniel Dereere wrote poetry with a possessive tone. He posted his love missives and poetry for the world to see on his MySpace page:\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that we are meant to be together forever, you are everything to me and without you I would be lost in this crazy world.\u201d\n\nA stanza of a poem he wrote, went: \u201cHe needs someone who\u2019s faithful, only his lips may she kiss.\u201d\n\nWhen police entered the apartment of the 25-year-old man they weren\u2019t sure what they would find but there were ample past indications of a troubled relationship between the beautiful divorcee and the young man.\n\nAccusations had become a matter of public record after the two lovers reported violent and vengeful confrontations between each other to the police.\n\nIn May of 2007, Colorado Springs police arrested Becky for assault and harassment after she allegedly punched Dereere in the face during a fight.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bekime", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Colorado Springs police officers drove up to an apartment at 6228 Twin Oaks Dr. on the night of Monday, March 31, 2008.
