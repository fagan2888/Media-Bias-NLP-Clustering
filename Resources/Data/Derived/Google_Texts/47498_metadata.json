It addresses government and user accountability. And, it plans for a pathway for independence from the federal government for both the users and the state of Montana.\u201d\n\n\n\nA key point in the bill is the idea that coverage reduces costs in the long run.\n\n\n\n\u201cThink of this way. You want to see the doctor for your high blood pressure, before you see the ER for your stroke,\u201d Buttrey said.\n\n\n\nThe bill includes malpractice reform, although Al Smith of the Montana Trial Lawyers Association doubted that that would actually reduce costs.\n\n\n\nIt also calls on participants to enter a Labor Department program that would assess them and try to improve their job situation.\n\n\n\nAnd all recipients would have to pay premiums as well as other costs such as co-payments.\n\n\n\nMax Naethe of Kalispell saw his health and finances suffer after a workplace injury a decade ago.\n\n\n\nNow he's in the so-called Medicaid gap \u2014 making too much money for Medicaid and not enough for a subsidy under the Affordable Care Act to make a heath plan affordable \u2014 which Buttrey's bill and House Bill 249, the likely-dead Democratic Medicaid proposal, aim to address.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so here I sit, in need of a heart transplant, which is the only thing that is capable of saving my life,\u201d he said before the hearing. \u201cBut I can't eve get on a list for a heart transplant without any sort of health care. And so this bill if it would cover that gap, in the Obamacare/Medicaid area, would basically save my life.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bill, like HB 249, is pitched as a lifeline to rural hospitals.\n\n\n\n\u201cForty-two percent of the patients that walk through our door have no insurance,\u201d said Louie King, administrator of Teton Medical Center in Choteau. \u201cIt's hard to run a business that way.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill, with three raising concerns about taking federal money, which SB 405 would do.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll you're doing here is accepting a piece of bait and the rules and regulations that come with it,\u201d said Terry Bannon of Bozeman.\n\n\n\nThe House meanwhile on Thursday rejected three bills in a Republican package pitched as an alternative to fuller expansion, leaving Buttrey's bill the one Medicaid measure with the healthiest vital signs.\n\n\n\nThe committee did not immediately act on the measure.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The bill could be a middle path that includes taking on some perceived shortcomings in Medicaid.", "author": "Sanjay Talwani - MTN News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kxlh.com/story/28576593/senate-bill-405-could-expand-medicaid-to-tens-of-thousands-of-montanans", "image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/6567568_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The bill could be a middle path that includes taking on some perceived shortcomings in Medicaid.", "title": "Senate Bill 405 could expand Medicaid to tens of thousands of Montanans"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/6567568_G.jpg", "description": "The bill could be a middle path that includes taking on some perceived shortcomings in Medicaid.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Bill 405 could expand Medicaid to tens of thousands of Montanans"}, "wnreadableurl": "senate-bill-405-could-expand-medicaid-to-tens-of-thousands-of-montanans", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KXLH", "fb": {"app_id": 174347922624716}, "date": "2015/03/20", "KEYWORDS": "Helena, KXLH, continuous news coverage, breaking news, sports, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "news_keywords": "Helena, KXLH, continuous news coverage, breaking news, sports, weather, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd201\"", "article_summary": "Senate Bill 405 could expand Medicaid to tens of thousands of Montanans Posted: Friday, March 20, 2015 8:00 PM EDT Updated: Monday, March 30, 2015 8:00 PM EDT Posted:Updated:64th Legislative Session GraphicHELENA -- A Republican bill that could expand Medicaid to tens of thousands of Montanans brought a crowd of supporters to the Capitol Thursday.\n\u201cBut I can't eve get on a list for a heart transplant without any sort of health care.\n\u201cThe HELP Act addresses reform, it addresses rising health care costs.\nSeanator Ed Buttrey (R-Great Falls) introduced Senate Bill 405, the HELP (Montana Health and Economic Livelihood Partnership) Act, would expand Medicaid, but wouldn't cover as many people as Governor Steve Bullock's proposal earlier this year.\nThe bill could be a middle path that includes taking on some perceived shortcomings in Medicaid."}
