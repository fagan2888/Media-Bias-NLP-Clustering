The speed of cycling is something I love \u2014 just to be cruising along at 20 miles per hour felt like a massive sprint to me because I\u2019ve been so immobile. It\u2019s more rewarding to go outside outside because you\u2019re accomplishing a task, moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a whole new ride.\u201d\n\nCrane sustained a traumatic brain injury, numerous broken bones and facial lacerations in the Stage 7 crash as he raced to catch up to the peleton after a mechanical failure with his bike. He has no memory of the crash. He\u2019s undergone numerous surgeries. His doctor lost count of the number of stitches he\u2019s had sewn in his body. In January, he had surgery just so he could open his mouth a bit wider. His mouth, Crane said, had \u201cpretty much been surgically recreated.\u201d The scars across his face, neck and chest are healing, he\u2019s progressed out of speech therapy and his day-to-day functioning has improved.\n\n\u201cEvery new doctor is pretty shocked where I\u2019m at, given where I should be on paper,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any fear of bike racing.\n\n\u201cRight now, I feel the same as I did seven months ago. I feel like normal Ian. The doctors are very quick to say that once you are a victim of a traumatic brain injury, you\u2019re always going to have that with you. And how that shows itself is kind of a question mark.\n\n\u201cBut the doctor\u2019s favorite line \u2014 \u2018But you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.\u2019 You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come up until it happens.\u201d\n\nOn Friday\u2019s ride he took extra precaution, going through corners slowly and giving himself plenty of time to stop before stoplights. Crane calls the process humbling. His American team, Jamis-Hagens Berman, has signed him to a contract for the 2015 season.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely the biggest challenge, the only tragedy I\u2019ve had to go through,\u201d Crane said. \u201cI\u2019m learning how I react to these sorts of things, and how I deal with it. The biggest thing I\u2019ve noticed: I\u2019m a very positive person now. I\u2019m always trying to find the good or the light in things, whether it\u2019s something completely difficult like riding the trainer indoors all day in the winter. I stayed positive. I\u2019m really relying on that positivity to get through things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ian Crane back on the bike, making remarkable recovery after crash in Pro Challenge", "title": "Ian Crane back on the bike, making remarkable recovery after crash in Pro Challenge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/ian-crane-back-on-the-bike-making-remarkable-recovery-after-crash-in-pro-challenge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228_025916_iancrane.jpg", "height": 872}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228_025916_iancrane.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T14:18:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:13:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cc1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI didn\u2019t stop smiling the whole ride,\u201d Crane said in a phone interview.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re going outdoors, you get to feel the fresh air, temperature changes, and the speed.\n\u201cBut the doctor\u2019s favorite line \u2014 \u2018But you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.\u2019 You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come up until it happens.\u201dOn Friday\u2019s ride he took extra precaution, going through corners slowly and giving himself plenty of time to stop before stoplights.\n\u201cThis is definitely the biggest challenge, the only tragedy I\u2019ve had to go through,\u201d Crane said.\nThe weather in Seattle on Friday was mild, cloudy and dry \u2014 abnormal for winter in the Pacific Northwest, but welcome."}
