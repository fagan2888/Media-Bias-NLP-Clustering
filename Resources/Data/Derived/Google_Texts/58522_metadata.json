Although government officials deemed the e-mails classified after Clinton left office, they could complicate her efforts to move beyond the political fallout from the controversy. They suggest that her role in distributing sensitive material via her private e-mail system went beyond receiving notes written by others, and appears to contradict earlier public statements in which she denied sending or receiving e-mails containing classified information. The classified e-mails, contained in thousands of pages of electronic correspondence that the State Department has released, stood out because of the heavy markings blocking out sentences and, in some cases, entire messages. The State Department officials who redacted the material cited national security as the reason for blocking it from public view.\n\nClinton told Middle East envoy to send classified details from Italy's Foreign Minister to \"my personal email.\" pic.twitter.com/4sPs7DsWjX \u2014 Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) September 1, 2015\n\nIn a separate exchange, Clinton demanded that a staffer email her information that was marked classified at the time, snapping at him after he expressed concerns about following the rules. \"Just email it,\" she wrote.\n\n[Clinton] said the e-mails from Blumenthal were \u201cunsolicited\u201d missives from an \u201cold friend.\u201d This, of course, was a lie. The New York Times\u2019s Peter Baker has a long piece on how Blumenthal was pretty obviously one of her closest foreign-policy advisers, as well as an \u201cinformer on domestic politics, keeping her up-to-date on the latest machinations in the White House and the campaign trail, even offering suggestions for midterm election strategy.\u201d \u2026 Clinton \u201cwelcomed his input outside the normal chain of command,\u201d told him \u201cto keep \u2018em coming\u201d and \u201cnudged\u201d him to follow through on at least one promised memo. I\u2019m no lawyer, but that sounds awfully \u201csolicited\u201d to me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Truths..05/26/2016 4:28:15AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Truths.", "title": "Guy Benson - Surprise: Three More Hillary Email Lies Exposed in Latest Document Dump", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/09/02/surprise-more-hillary-email-lies-exposed-in-latest-document-dump-n2047065", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/245/2015-09-02T134403Z_1_LYNXNPEB810PN_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Truths.", "title": "Guy Benson - Surprise: Three More Hillary Email Lies Exposed in Latest Document Dump", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/09/02/surprise-more-hillary-email-lies-exposed-in-latest-document-dump-n2047065", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/245/2015-09-02T134403Z_1_LYNXNPEB810PN_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Surprise: Three More Hillary Email Lies Exposed in Latest Document Dump, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1f7\"", "article_summary": "The State Department officials who redacted the material cited national security as the reason for blocking it from public view.\nClinton told Middle East envoy to send classified details from Italy's Foreign Minister to \"my personal email.\"\nAlthough government officials deemed the e-mails classified after Clinton left office, they could complicate her efforts to move beyond the political fallout from the controversy.\n[Clinton] said the e-mails from Blumenthal were \u201cunsolicited\u201d missives from an \u201cold friend.\u201d This, of course, was a lie.\nThe classified e-mails, contained in thousands of pages of electronic correspondence that the State Department has released, stood out because of the heavy markings blocking out sentences and, in some cases, entire messages."}
