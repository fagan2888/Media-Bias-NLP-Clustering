I think that has missed him some opportunities, probably served him well in other cases.\u201d\n\nFrom\u2019s observations, in an interview with BuzzFeed the day before the release of a new memoir of the global movement he helped start, mark the ideological muddle of today\u2019s governing party. Bill Clinton represented a revolt against the dominance of labor unions, ethnic lobbies, and the aging New Left. Obama\u2019s roots are on the other side of that bitter divide: Chicago\u2019s social justice politics. From and the DLC first opposed Obama; then, in 2008, From sought for a time, in conversations with reporters (this one included), to make the case that Obama had been misread as a liberal, and was in fact \u201cpragmatic,\u201d and that you could even hear the DLC\u2019s watchwords of responsibility and opportunity in his speeches. In 2009, From left the group, and in 2011 he effectively shut it down, merging it into the Clinton Foundation, where he said elements of it may someday be revived. (\u201cI spent too many years trying to figure out a new mission for the DLC \u2014 I probably should have shut it down sooner,\u201d he said.)\n\nFrom is now 70, slimmer than he was during his time as an intra-partisan warrior, and seems to be more puzzled than alarmed by the president\u2019s ideological leanings. The Affordable Care Act, with its primary role for the private sector, is the sort of thing Hillary Clinton championed and that he supports, and he said the \u201cjury is still out\u201d on its implementation. But Obama \u201chas a hard time explaining these structures in a way people can understand,\u201d he said.\n\nObama, he said, has also failed to explain a clear vision for growing the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the economy growing again. If we don\u2019t do that, then everything becomes a zero-sum game and there\u2019s not any wealth to spread around,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Obama that has been sort of a missing element \u2014 he talks about it a little bit but not really a lot.\u201d\n\nFrom will, of course, back Hillary Clinton if she runs for president in 2016. He\u2019s been with the Clintons since the mid-1980s, and Bill Clinton in 2000 said of him: \u201cIt would be hard to think of a single American citizen who, as a private citizen, has had a more positive impact on the progress of American life in the last 25 years than Al From.\u201d The former president also convinced him to write a book, with the promise that he\u2019d provide a forward, which he did. He\u2019s hosting a book party for From in January.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary runs, I\u2019ll be there 100%,\u201d he said. His advice hasn\u2019t changed in nearly 30 years: \u201cShe just needs to lay out an agenda for tackling the challenges and then she ought to be very comfortable running on a lot of the basic themes \u2014 opportunity, responsibility, community.\u201d\n\nA key challenge she\u2019ll face, he said, is generational. He recalled \u201cblack Wednesday,\u201d in 1976 \u2014 when Jimmy Carter clinched the nomination and a whole generation of senators like Ed Muskie of Maine and Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota realized their time had passed and they would never be president.\n\n\u201cGenerational change is not an unimportant thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t go back to a previous generation for leadership, and there may be circumstances that make that desirable, including a really powerful candidate like Hillary. Part of the appeal is it\u2019s also groundbreaking, which may take the edge off a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible in this very troubled world that the experience issue will trump the generational issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that decision will not be made with me \u2014 I\u2019m already for Hillary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2795123, "userid": 238321}, "description": "The former New Democrat chief says Obama \u2014 and Clinton \u2014 need to get back to growth.
