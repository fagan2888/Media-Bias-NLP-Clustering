Tennessee-based LifePoint Hospitals on Monday said it will change its name to LifePoint Health, a move it says better reflects its portfolio of healthcare service providers.

In fact, LifePoint points to the “continuum of care” in its announcement, invoking a recent buzz phrase in the industry. The term applies to the reform-driven, network-based approach to care that seeks to lower hospital use when treatment could be better provided in clinics, primary care offices and ambulatory centers.

“LifePoint was founded in 1999 with the mission of Making Communities Healthier,” said CEO William F. Carpenter III in a statement. “We began by operating community hospitals and, today, our operations have expanded to include physician practices, post-acute services, outpatient services, and wellness and prevention programs that enhance the health and well-being of those we serve. Our new name is a fitting reflection of our strategic direction for the future.”

Publicly traded LifePoint has more than $3.2 billion in market capitalization. It earned $38.9 million in the first quarter on nearly $1.3 billion in revenue, pointing to higher admissions across the company.

LifePoint runs 60 hospitals, more than 1,100 physician practices and 40 post-acute service providers including home health and hospice services, long-term care services, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. It also runs 30 outpatient centers. Its footprint spans 20 states.
