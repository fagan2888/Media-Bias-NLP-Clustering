As a result, the nation\u2019s largest privately-owned payroll and human resources services provider, PrimePay LLC has created the free New Business ACA Starter Kit to help lessen confusion and ensure compliance for businesses large and small.\n\n\u201cThe ACA was instituted to make health care more affordable for the masses,\u201d said Mitchell Geiger, Special Counsel to PrimePay. \u201cHowever, with that came a labyrinth of compliance regulations and associated penalties. Most business owners - particularly startups - are not experts in the complexities of the ACA nor do they have the resources available to help navigate those waters effectively. Having served these types of companies for thirty years, PrimePay recognized that and created the ACA Starter Kit.\u201d\n\nGeiger, who advises PrimePay on complex issues surrounding ACA compliance and administration of employee benefit plans, had tremendous input in the construction of PrimePay\u2019s ACA Starter Kit. Under his direction, the kit includes a timeline of events that shaped the law into what it is today, a compliance checklist, a full-time equivalent calculator to determine staffing provisions, and coverage requirements and penalties.\n\n\u201cThe millions of individuals who have started businesses in the United States have shaped the business world as we know it today,\u201d Geiger added. \u201cThey have created jobs, sparked innovation and provided opportunities for many people to achieve financial success and independence. The ACA Starter Kit is just one more way PrimePay strives to serve them.\u201d\n\nTo download the free ACA Starter Kit, visit http://www.PrimePay.com.\n\nAbout PrimePay\n\nPrimePay is an employee management solutions provider offering a full range of integrated payroll and HR support services.
