Power & Associates. That same report, however, found that many Americans don\u2019t fully comprehend their credit card rewards. Of those surveyed, 62 percent said they didn\u2019t completely understand their rewards, 43 percent said they don\u2019t know if their rewards have a maximum limit, and 21 percent said they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re earning extra rewards for specific purchases.\n\nSpending money on a credit card to get rewards \u2013 no matter how lucrative \u2013 only makes sense when you\u2019re able to pay off all purchases and avoid racking up debt. Credit card rates are averaging around 13 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nHere\u2019s what to look for:\n\n1: Rewards are getting more flexible. Consumers have griped that credit card reward programs often have rigid rules about blackout dates or specific retail partners. \u201cThe latest rewards programs allow consumers to earn and redeem rewards in a really flexible way,\u201d says Lindsay Konsko, a credit card analyst with NerdWallet.\n\nRelated: Millennials Give Credit Cards the Cold Shoulder\n\nThe Discover It Miles Card, for example, allows consumers to earn rewards \u2013 in the form of a statement credit \u2013 that they can use for any type of travel purchase. Citi has started to let some customers transfer their Thank You points to certain frequent flier programs, Konsko says.\n\n2: Cash back programs are getting more generous. Card companies know that good old cash back rewards are the top choice among wealthy (read: big spending) cardholders.\n\nThe industry standard for cash back is still 1 percent, but savvy card users can earn 2 percent or more. The Citi Double Cash card, for example, debuted last year and allows customers to earn 1 percent on purchases and another 1 percent for paying them off.\n\nOther great cashback cards include the Capital One Quick Silver, which offers 1.5 percent cash back on everything. Several other cards promise customers 1 percent cash back, with up to 5 percent cash back on specific purchases throughout the year. That\u2019s a great offer if you\u2019re the kind of customer that will hold off on a purchase until you can get the greatest reward.\n\nRelated: Surprise! Personal Finance Experts Take Their Own Advice\n\nJust remember that most of those cards require you to opt-in to get the extra cash back. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit gimmicky, but if you play the game and watch the categories, it takes two seconds to opt in, and it\u2019s a cool way you maximize your rewards,\u201d says Curtis Arnold, editor in chief of CardRatings.com.\n\n3: Better introductory offers. In a bid to lure new customers, credit card issuers are sweetening the terms they offer first-timers. Initial cash bonuses increased 7.45 percent over last year, and miles-based offers increased more than 10 percent, according to the CardHub 2015 Credit Landscape Report.\n\nThey\u2019re also continuing to offer lengthy 0 percent balance transfers to people for signing up by lengthening the period of 0 percent interest that they offer. \u201cYou\u2019re not earning points or miles there, but the savings on interest can be their own reward,\u201d Konsko says.\n\n4: Free credit scores are pretty common. As Americans become increasingly aware of the importance of a good credit score, several companies are now letting customers see their credit score for free either on a monthly basis or at any time by logging onto the bank\u2019s web site or app. \u201cThe fact that these cards are regularly giving away your actual FICO score for free is a big deal for consumers,\u201d Schulz says.\n\nRelated: The Secret Science Behind Doubling Your Money\n\n5: Store-brand cards continue to lag. It can be tempting to sign up for your favorite retailers\u2019 credit card, especially when you\u2019re offered a 20 percent or more discount at the register. \u201cThose cards are more lenient in terms of who they will accept application-wise, and that\u2019s why the rewards are not the best,\u201d Gonzalez says.\n\nStore cards tend to have higher interest rates and lower limits, so one big shopping spree could throw your credit-utilization ratio out of whack and hurt your credit score.\n\n6: It\u2019s all about the experience. As more consumers look to spend their money on experiences rather than things, card companies are answering the call with rewards programs that provide exclusive access to things like concerts and sporting events.\n\n7: Apps can help. Most of the major cards have their own apps that allow you to track and redeem rewards in real-time. If you need help managing more than one rewards card, check out a third-party app such as AwardWallet.com, which tracks rewards and notifies you before the expire, and Wallaby, which tells you before you make a purchase which of your cards offers the most lucrative reward.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For Americans with good credit, it\u2019s a great time to earn rewards with plastic.", "title": "7 Ways to Decode the Best Credit Card Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/17/7-Ways-Decode-Best-Credit-Card-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/17/7-Ways-Decode-Best-Credit-Card-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For Americans with good credit, it\u2019s a great time to earn rewards with plastic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf6f\"", "article_summary": "That same report, however, found that many Americans don\u2019t fully comprehend their credit card rewards.\nIn a bid to lure new customers, credit card issuers are sweetening the terms they offer first-timers.\nConsumers have griped that credit card reward programs often have rigid rules about blackout dates or specific retail partners.\nCredit card rates are averaging around 13 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\n\u201cThe latest rewards programs allow consumers to earn and redeem rewards in a really flexible way,\u201d says Lindsay Konsko, a credit card analyst with NerdWallet."}
