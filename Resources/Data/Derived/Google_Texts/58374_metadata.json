The initial April estimate of GDP for the first quarter showed the US economy stagnating, at only a 0.1% growth rate. Last week\u2019s revised data showed, however, a significant further downward revision of first quarter GDP to a negative -1.0% growth, i.e. a contraction.\n\nPoliticians and analysts had initially forecast in April a slowing of GDP growth to around 1.2%. They then adjusted that in May to a slight -0.5% contraction of growth for the first quarter. But the -1.0% GDP revision last week was twice as bad as their consensus estimates. Despite their missed forecasts, which initially explained that \u2018bad weather\u2019 was the cause behind the GDP decline, forecasters continue to insist that the -1.0% GDP contraction was due to bad weather during January-March 2014.\n\nFrom Bad Metaphors to Bad Forecasting\n\nWhen economists, pundits, and politicians can\u2019t explain real causes\u2014or wish to avoid bringing them to public light\u2014they blame the weather. But weather metaphors are an excuse, not an explanation. If the bad weather were the cause of last week\u2019s revised -1.0% GDP decline, then forecasters\u2019 estimate of only a -0.5% drop in GDP would still leave a remaining -0.5% decline to be explained. But no explanation has been put forward to explain the additional -0.5% contraction. How the economy can go from a 4% growth rate in the third quarter 2013 to a -1.0% barely three months later, a swing of 5% in a matter of a few m onths, has not been explained\u2014except of course to blame it on \u2018the weather\u2019.\n\nWhile weather might have been perhaps a minor factor in some east coast regions of the country, it was certainly not a factor nationwide. The bad weather metaphor approach to economic explanation also fails to explain why luxury retail sales, at Tiffany\u2019s and other high end retailers, expanded at double digit rates throughout the bad weather months. Apparently the rich aren\u2019t as deterred by weather from spending while middle Americas are. Buying milk at the grocery store is somehow postponed by bad weather, but buying diamonds and baubles at the jewelry store is not. Nor does \u2018bad weather\u2019 in January-February explain why a number of key economic indicators continued to decline in March and even April, when \u2018bad weather\u2019 was not a factor. Somehow bad weather deterred home sales more than usual this past winter, even though home sales were declining well before, and have continued to do so after March 2014. Or \u2018bad weather\u2019 advocates argue that industrial production slowed in the winter because of the weather, when one would suspect bad weather would boost energy utilities\u2019 output and industrial production during such weather. So much for bad weather forecasting.\n\nA Non-Weather Explanation of Recent GDP\n\nAs far back as last November 2013 this writer was forewarning that the 4% growth rate of third quarter 2013 did not represent any real future growth trend; it was not indicative of any kind of sustained economic recovery. (see my \u2018Economic False Positives: US GDP & Jobs Reports\u2019, Counterpunch, November 11, 2013).\n\nThe growth in the third quarter was comprised in large part of business inventory investment bouncing back from low first half 2013 levels, on the one hand, and drive further at the same time by businesses moving up into the quarter inventory spending that would have otherwise occurred in early 2014. This latter shift occurred because businesses were anticipating\u2014in retrospect incorrectly\u2014that consumer retail spending would surge in the holiday season in the fourth quarter.\n\nFor example, after contributing only .18 to GDP in the first half of 2013, inventories surged to .71 contribution to the third quarter 2013 total GDP gain. That\u2019s almost three-fourths of the third quarter\u2019s 4% GDP gain in July-September 2013. But the year end 2013 consumer sales surge businesses anticipated, and stocked up for, never happened. Overall retail sales grew only 0.2% in December. Given no consumer response to the prior inventory buildup during the holidays, the contribution of inventories to fourth quarter GDP dropped to virtually zero. Not surprising, business inventory spending thereafter contracted even more sharply in January-March 2014 once again.\n\nBut the January-March 2014 decline of -1.0% was due not only to slowing of business inventory investment. It was due even more to the slowing global economy and its related effect on US net exports. Both US exports and business equipment investment also contracted sharply from the last quarter of 2013. An economic explanation for the -1.0% GDP fall would thus have to account for why both business inventory and business equipment investment declined and why exports weakened. It would also have to take into account that consumer spending in the January-March period was itself due largely to a one time factor\u2014i.e. a big increase in health care services spending as the Affordable Care Act took effect. Without this health care spending effect (which will not be a factor in the second quarter 2014), the -1.0% GDP decline would have been even worse.\n\nThe point is that none of these factors\u2014the business inventory, business equipment, exports slowdown, or healthcare spending due to ACA\u2014were particularly sensitive to \u2018weather\u2019, good or bad. What that in turn means is that forecasters\u2019 \u2018weather argument\u2019, i.e. that good weather during April-June will mean a GDP \u2018snap back\u2019 growth of 3-4% once again (see the lead business page article, The New York Times, of May 30, 2014), is as absurd a prediction as the same forecasters\u2019 original \u2018bad weather\u2019 argument was erroneous.\n\nA non-weather metaphor explanation of the -1.0% GDP is: businesses overestimated households\u2019 consumption recovery in the face of the latter\u2019s continuing disposable income decline last year, a decline that has been occurring for five years now every year. Businesses overstocked inventory in late summer 2013 in anticipation of a holiday season retail sales surge that never occurred. They then responded by quickly reducing investment, both on inventory and business equipment. (This is a pattern, by the way, that has been evident at least three times in the US economy since 2009).\n\nSimultaneous with the business inventory and equipment pull back, the global economy continued to slow over the winter, with particular problems emerging in China, Europe and Emerging Market economies. These negative factors were temporarily dampened by consumer spending on healthcare in the first quarter 2014, on the ACA sign ups in particular. However, other areas of consumer spending slowed, as did residential construction and state-local government spending.\n\nGoing into the second quarter 2014, the consumer factor is weakened; the US dollar is rising in value and thereby threatening exports further, and business inventory and equipment spending will continue to slow until it becomes more clear that consumers are really spending again. The latter is not likely, however, given continued real disposable income decline for average consumer households, now in its fifth consecutive year. Meanwhile, and state-local government spending may be expected to continue to slow as well, continuing their trend of the first quarter, and no housing recovery is in sight after its slowing.\n\nWithout the ACA healthcare spending in the first quarter it is certain the -1.0% GDP decline would have been much greater. But that -1.0% was an overestimation for other reasons as well.\n\n1st Quarter GDP Even Worse Than -1.0%\n\nFirst, included in it is the overestimation of GDP growth due to the redefinition of GDP that occurred last summer 2013.\n\nA number of progressive economists have been pointing out that real investment in equipment has been in a long run declining trend in the US for at least since 2000. That means a declining contribution of investment to GDP over the longer term. This decline was recently \u2018upward adjusted\u2019 in part by US government in 2013 by redefining what constitutes investment.\n\nAs described in a previous article (\u2018Economic Recovery by Statistical Manipulation\u2019, Counterpunch, July 31, 2013), effective beginning last year (and retroactively to prior years) the US now counts as business investment certain categories of what were once considered business \u2018expenses\u2019 and not investment. In addition to counting expenses as investment, businesses can also now put an arbitrary price on the value of certain \u2018intangibles\u2019, like copyrights, trademarks, patents and other such items, and now consider them business investment as well. In this manner, business investment appears larger than it actually is, and the long term trend decline is offset to some extent. Every GDP estimate therefore now has, all things equal, a higher business investment contribution to GDP than before.\n\nIt was recently estimated by the business periodical, The Financial Times, March 12, 2014, that this redefinition adds about 3.6% to US GDP. On a $17 trillion US economy that amounts to about $600 billion a year. That\u2019s not any actual new activity added to US growth, just an increase in growth by redefining it. Without this redefinition, the first quarter 2014 GDP decline of -1.0% would no doubt have experienced an even greater decline, to roughly around -1.3%.\n\nGlobal Rush to Redefine GDP\n\nThe US changes in GDP represent just one of many such redefinitions designed to boost lagging GDP numbers in a number of countries in the past year. At one extreme is Nigeria\u2019s recent redefinition, which effectively doubled its GDP to $510 billion annually overnight, making it the largest economy in Africa. China\u2019s methods for estimating its GDP have for years been viewed with some doubt. Most economists consider that around 1 to 1.5% of China\u2019s GDP represents an overestimation for various reasons of definition and data gathering difficulties. A number of other developing markets have similar problems with their GDP definitions.\n\nOther redefinitions and changes have been occurring in the European Union, including east Europe, the Baltics, and even Austria. Most recently, however, are the economies of Italy and the United Kingdom, where economic recovery has been lagging for more than five years and where official double dip recessions and GDP growth rates of less than 1% have been the norm for most of the years.\n\nAs reported in the global Financial Times just last week, for example, both the UK and Italy are adding income from prostitution and from drug dealing to their GDP estimates. Britain estimates that prostitution services will add $17 billion to its GDP. That and other changes concerning drug dealing and other previously unaccounted for services will boost the UK GDP by 5%, according to the Financial Times of May 30, 2014.\n\nProstitution, Drug Dealing, and Future GDP Growth\n\nExactly how one would estimate the price of prostitution and gather the data on price and volume of activity for such critical services will no doubt prove interesting. Will UK statisticians go out and survey their 60,000 estimated prostitutes and drug dealers, as to how much they charge their \u2018Johns\u2019 and how much the dealers are \u2018marking up\u2019 their smuggled shipments of cocaine and heroin into the UK from offshore? Not likely. What they\u2019ll probably do is simply \u2018throw a statistical dart\u2019 at the wall and cherry pick a price and volume of activity that suits them.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all that different from a good many methods now for estimating GDP. For example, a good part of the Rent component in US GDP involves the assumption that homeowners pay themselves rent, which is then rolled up into GDP estimates. Another assumes that quality improvements in smartphones are going up so fast that prices are actually going down. You didn\u2019t actually pay $800 for that iphone 5, in other words. Despite the charge on your credit card, it was really much less. And change your business logo, says it\u2019s worth whatever you think, add it to your investment costs, and get a government investment tax credit for it while you\u2019re at it.\n\nGoing forward, in the case of the UK and its newly accounted for prostitution drug dealing services, there will be the additional question of estimating how much the \u2018prices\u2019 for these services have actually risen every year in order to adjust to real GDP. Perhaps the bureaucrats will do a survey phone call instead of a direct interview? For certain the drug dealers will be glad to speak to a government official. Then there\u2019s also the problem of quality changes affecting price for a prostitute\u2019s \u2018trick\u2019 or a drug dealer\u2019s \u2018bag\u2019 of goods. What constitutes a quality change, and therefore a reduction in inflation and subsequently a rise in real GDP? No doubt some bureaucrat in charge will simply \u2018guestimate\u2019 price, quality, and amount of activity to get to a real number to plug into UK GDP growth.\n\nOne can only speculate how much recently lost economic growth might be restored to the US economy, should the US in turn copy the UK by including prostitution and drug dealing. No doubt hundreds of billions, perhaps a trillion, might be added to US GDP growth estimates. That\u2019s even greater than including research & development expenses as \u2018investment\u2019. The possibilities for further growth are limitless. The US could restructure college education curricula to reflect these new occupational opportunities of the future. After all, \u2018contingent\u2019 labor is the new dominant labor market trend in the US. Adding curricula for these new GDP services couldn\u2019t be any more obscene than training students for finance and how to create new forms of financial securities that end up in bankrupting cities and school districts, and destroying grandma\u2019s 401k.\n\nThe US economy has been rapidly replacing real jobs in goods producing industries with service jobs for decades now. Only 12% of the economy now comprises goods production and less than 8% construction. Service jobs have been replacing higher paid goods producing jobs for decades, followed in recent y ears by even lower paying service jobs replacing service jobs, as part time & temp service jobs with no benefits are becoming the new norm. At least prostitution and drug dealing pay well, one can set one\u2019s own hours of work, and there\u2019s enough income left maybe even to buy an Obama\u2019s health insurance plan.\n\nJack Rasmus is the author of the book, \u2018Obama\u2019s Economy: Recovery for the Few\u2019, Pluto Press, 2012, and \u2018Epic Recession: Prelude to Global Depression, Pluto, 2010.
