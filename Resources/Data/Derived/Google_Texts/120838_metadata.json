A key portion of it said the joint defense force could be used to combat terrorists, including Sunni groups such as the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL.\n\n\u201cIt is an important resolution given all the unprecedented unrest and threats endured by the Arab world,\u201d Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby told reporters Sunday. Other officials said the force likely will have headquarters in Cairo or Riyadh.\n\nThe West has viewed the Arab League for decades as ineffective when it comes to galvanizing such military alliances. But analysts say an era may be opening in which Sunni powers align against Iran and engage in unprecedented horse-trading in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cEgypt has promised to send troops into Yemen, but they would only do that if they were getting something in return,\u201d said Joshua Landis, who heads the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cThey would do it because Saudi Arabia is currently underwriting the Egyptian government to a tune of at least $10 billion a year, but just as importantly because Cairo wants to get Riyadh to finance an Egyptian-led force to go in and fight the jihadists in Libya,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Landis cautioned that wider risks associated with a Saudi-driven military alliance are grave.\n\n\u201cThe conservative forces in the region are trying to come up with an answer because America has refused to go and do all their dirty work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if they have any better results than the U.S. has had.\u201d\n\nEgypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Sudan, Algeria and perhaps other Sunni-majority nations are banding more closely together under Saudi Arabia\u2019s fear of Iran \u2014 the region\u2019s top Shiite power.\n\nLeaders at the gathering Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh spoke repeatedly of the threat posed to the region\u2019s Arab identity by foreign or outside parties to stoke sectarian, ethnic or religious rivalries in Arab states \u2014 all thinly veiled references to Iran.\n\nBut Mr. Elaraby was unequivocal in singling out Iran for what he said was its intervention \u201cin many nations.\u201d\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels swept in and captured the nation\u2019s capital of Sanaa in September. Embattled Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, a close U.S. ally against a powerful local al Qaeda affiliate, first fled to the southern city of Aden before escaping the country last week as the rebels closed in.\n\nSpeaking at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit Saturday, Mr. Hadi accused Iran of being behind the Houthi offensive. Iran and the Houthis deny that Tehran arms the rebel movement, though both acknowledge that the Islamic republic is providing humanitarian and other aid.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition began bombing Yemen on Thursday, saying it was targeting the Houthis and their allies, which include forces loyal to former Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nYemeni military officials have said the campaign could pave the way for a ground invasion, a development that Egyptian military officials say likely would commence after the airstrikes significantly diminish the military capabilities of the Houthis and their allies.\n\nIran has condemned the airstrikes but has not responded with military action, though diplomatic and military officials said Iranian retaliation could not be ruled out.\n\nSome analysts say Saudi Arabia and the Western media are overstating Iran\u2019s influence in Yemen.\n\n\u201cTalk of a proxy war risks over-estimating the level of power Saudi Arabia and Iran wield, and overlooking the local actors who truly shape the conflicts in question,\u201d Nussaibah Younis, a senior research associate at the Project on Middle East Democracy, wrote in an op-ed published by The Guardian on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Houthi movement has been able to advance across Yemen largely because of its alliance with the ancien regime of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and because of its ability to tap into disillusionment with the poor performance of\u201d the Hadi government, Mrs. Younis wrote. \u201cThough Iran may have helped to hone the effectiveness of the Houthi movement, it is neither the cause of nor a major player in the emerging Yemeni civil war.\n\n\u201cThat reality,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis lost on a Saudi Arabia that is so fearful of Iran\u2019s mounting influence in the region that it has instigated air strikes that are more likely to exacerbate than to resolve the conflict.\u201d\n\nMr. Landis said Saudi Arabia seems to be moving headlong into an unwinnable military campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a quagmire for Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Sunday. \u201cHere they are sending their military directly in without great planning with the U.S. They\u2019re moving on their own and they\u2019re going to get sucked into a trap in Yemen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a broken country that\u2019s been on the verge a long time, with some 24 million people that are desperately poor and have a median age of about 19 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have resources and are so young and uneducated. To think that something good is going to come out of this is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seeking to combat threats from Iran and the Shiite rebels it is supporting in the Middle East, Arab leaders meeting in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, agreed in principle Sunday to forge a NATO-like alliance of Sunni powers to engage in regional military action with or without leadership from the U.S.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Seeking to combat threats from Iran and the Shiite rebels it is supporting in the Middle East, Arab leaders meeting in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, agreed in principle Sunday to forge a NATO-like alliance of Sunni powers to engage in regional military action with or without leadership from the U.S.", "title": "Arab League to forge NATO-like military alliance of Sunni powers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/29/arab-league-to-forge-nato-like-military-alliance-o/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/3_292015_mideast-egypt-108201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/3_292015_mideast-egypt-108201.jpg", "description": "Seeking to combat threats from Iran and the Shiite rebels it is supporting in the Middle East, Arab leaders meeting in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, agreed in principle Sunday to forge a", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Arab League to forge NATO-like military alliance of Sunni powers"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24b8\"", "article_summary": "Yemeni military officials have said the campaign could pave the way for a ground invasion, a development that Egyptian military officials say likely would commence after the airstrikes significantly diminish the military capabilities of the Houthis and their allies.\n\u201cIt is an important resolution given all the unprecedented unrest and threats endured by the Arab world,\u201d Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby told reporters Sunday.\nIran has condemned the airstrikes but has not responded with military action, though diplomatic and military officials said Iranian retaliation could not be ruled out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a quagmire for Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Sunday.\nThe West has viewed the Arab League for decades as ineffective when it comes to galvanizing such military alliances."}
