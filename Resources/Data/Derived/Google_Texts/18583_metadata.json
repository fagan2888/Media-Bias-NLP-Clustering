The events will include public signing by local residents of a Clean Water Declaration that declares Florida citizens have an \u201cinalienable right\u201d to clean drinking water, safe rivers, streams, lakes and bays, protection from water pollution, access to information about sources of pollution, and protection from water privatization.\n\n\u201cWater policy in Florida is headed in the wrong direction,\u201d said Kent Bailey, a Hillsborough County resident and member of the Sierra Club\u2019s state executive committee. \u201cChange is needed to protect Florida\u2019s people and the state economy. Especially in Hillsborough County, we\u2019re going to run out of water, and when we do, that is going to stop home building and development and economic growth.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 civic and environmental groups, as well as some local officials are taking part in the Wednesday events, according to a press release from the campaign.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been at war with state officials over clean water protections for decades. In 2008, environmental groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, saying the federal government was violating the Clean Water Act by failing to set standards for farm and urban runoff into fresh waters and estuaries.\n\nAs a result, the EPA finally set standards in 2010 for phosphorus and nitrogen. These nutrients originate in fertilizers and untreated or under-treated sewage and can cause algae blooms that reduce oxygen in the waters.\n\nThe federal decision, however, ignited an uproar from state lawmakers, business leaders and utilities who said the EPA regulations were burdensome to business and taxpayers. The state sued the EPA in 2011 in an effort to block the new nutrient limits.\n\nIn February 2012, the state won a judicial decision on a key element of its lawsuit. Last year, the EPA approved the water standards developed by the state; environmentalists say those standards do not provide adequate protections to Florida waters.\n\nDuring that time, however, the 150-mile-long Indian River Lagoon on Florida\u2019s east coast has been devastated by a three-years-long series of algae blooms. Record numbers of dolphins, manatees and pelicans died and the estuary lost 60 percent of its seagrass.\n\nThe pollution entered the lagoon through water released from Lake Okeechobee. Releases from the lake also damaged the ecology of the Caloosahatchee River that empties into the Gulf of Mexico on the state\u2019s west coast.\n\nThe environmental damage on both coasts was so severe that it got the attention of Florida legislators. A state Senate select committee has been looking at possible solutions, and Gov. Rick Scott has proposed $40 million to speed up completion of a project to clean water from Lake Okeechobee and stormwater runoff that fouls the lagoon and the Caloosahatchee River.\n\n\u201cClean water legislation is expected to be part of an early product out of this legislative session; a bill is being written already,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that it be the right kind of clean water legislation.\u201d\n\nWhile the Indian River Lagoon has been getting most of the headlines, environmental groups point out that there are polluted waters in every region of the state. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has designated hundreds of water bodies as \u201cimpaired,\u201d meaning they don\u2019t meet the state\u2019s pollutant limits.\n\nFlorida\u2019s booming population also is requiring more water to be drawn from the Floridan Aquifer, causing sinkholes and saltwater intrusion into the vast freshwater chamber.\n\n\u201cThe problems are long-term and the solutions are long-term,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cFlorida is coming to terms with the fact that our water resources are precious and finite.\u201d\n\nmsalinero@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-8303", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 21:05:02 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Environmental groups will hold 16 rallies across the state Wednesday, including one in Tampa, to pressure state lawmakers into cleaning up Florida\u2019s degraded waterways.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Environmental groups will hold 16 rallies across the state Wednesday, including one in Tampa, to pressure state lawmakers into cleaning up Florida\u2019s degraded waterways.", "title": "Environmentalists to protest water quality in Florida", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/environmentalists-to-protest-water-quality-in-florida-20140120/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140120/ARTICLE/140129925/AR/0/AR-140129925.jpg", "height": 652}, "updated_time": "2014-01-20T21:14:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Environmental groups will hold 16 rallies across the state Wednesday, including one in Tampa, to pressure state lawmakers into cleaning up Florida\u2019s degraded waterways.", "title": "Environmentalists to protest water quality in Florida", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140120/ARTICLE/140129925/AR/0/AR-140129925.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-20T21:05:02Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T21:14:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Clean Water Declaration,Sierra Club"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2beb\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the EPA approved the water standards developed by the state; environmentalists say those standards do not provide adequate protections to Florida waters.\nEnvironmentalists have been at war with state officials over clean water protections for decades.\nThe events will include public signing by local residents of a Clean Water Declaration that declares Florida citizens have an \u201cinalienable right\u201d to clean drinking water, safe rivers, streams, lakes and bays, protection from water pollution, access to information about sources of pollution, and protection from water privatization.\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection has designated hundreds of water bodies as \u201cimpaired,\u201d meaning they don\u2019t meet the state\u2019s pollutant limits.\n\u201cClean water legislation is expected to be part of an early product out of this legislative session; a bill is being written already,\u201d Bailey said."}
