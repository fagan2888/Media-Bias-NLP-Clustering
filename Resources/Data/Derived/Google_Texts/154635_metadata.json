Bush brought health IT into the spotlight by calling for a nationwide system of interoperable electronic health records within 10 years and establishing the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology by executive order.\n\nEleven years later, we still don\u2019t have the interoperability Bush sought, but EHRs are the norm in U.S. hospitals and increasingly common even in the smallest physician practices. The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which created the Meaningful Use incentive program, certainly helped.\n\nWhile the HITECH Act has President Barack Obama\u2019s name at the bottom, it was a plan hatched with bipartisan support during the Bush administration, and the former president remains a fan of health IT, as he showed in a well-received keynote address to HIMSS15 Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make healthcare safer and more efficient. Thank you all for continuing to carry the ball,\u201d Bush said to a nearly packed, 100,000-square-foot ballroom in Chicago\u2019s sprawling McCormick Place. \u201cBy computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce cost and improve care,\u201d he added.\n\nThe self-deprecating ex-president played on his reputation, fair or not, as a simpleton with a little joke about his health IT strategy. \u201cI tried to keep the words short,\u201d Bush quipped. \u201cThen you dropped \u2018interoperability\u2019 on me.\u201d\n\nBush avoided delving into the politics of health IT, but did take a not-so-subtle dig at former Secretary of State \u2014 and Democratic presidential hopeful \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton when he noted that he was the first president to have a BlackBerry, back in 2001, but did not have an e-mail address. Bush joked that it was probably better not to have a record of every communication with his staff, something that became an issue for Clinton last month and continues to dog her.\n\nHe did express an opinion on health reform without slamming the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature law. \u201cTo protect doctor patient relationships and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful medical lawsuits,\u201d Bush said.\n\nHe also addressed the high cost of healthcare by noting that he had two knees replaced at Rush University Medical Center right here in Chicago. He asked why a night at Rush had to be more expensive than a night in the luxury Peninsula hotel.\n\nHIMSS CEO H. Stephen Lieber interviewed Bush, just like Lieber did two years ago with another former president, Bill Clinton, and with Hillary Clinton last year. After two Clintons, it seemed only fair to have Bush speak at HIMSS.\n\nBush did address the inevitable Clinton comparison and the 2016 presidential race, which could come down to his brother Jeb vs. Hillary Clinton. \u201cSo do you want Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama-Bush or Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama-Clinton?\u201d he asked facetiously.\n\n[Photo from Twitter user @HIMSS]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President George W.
