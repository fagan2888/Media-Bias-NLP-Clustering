That other election will drag on into November.\n\nRunoff winners for Republicans and Democrats will be determined Tuesday, mostly on the Republican side. There is only one statewide Democratic race.\n\nTaylor County residents are deciding as many as four races. Locally, Brad Birchum and Dale Morrison are squaring off for Precinct 3 commissioner, while Harriett Haag and Kevin Willhelm are seeking to become judge of Court-at-Law No. 2.\n\nA greater number of voters are weighing in on who likely will be our next our state senator and, for sure, our next congressman.\n\nIn a heated battle for Senate District 24, Republicans Dawn Buckingham and Susan King have campaigned to be their party's candidate to face Democrat Virginia \"Jennie Lou\" Leeder in the fall. King, the current House District 71 representative, gained the most votes in the primary, but not a majority.\n\nFor the 19th Congressional District, Jodey Arrington faces Glen Robertson in an all-Lubbock finale. Robertson polled the most votes in the primary but less than 1,000 more than Arrington and not a majority.\n\nThe Reporter-News and its Community Advisory Board have recommended Arrington, King, Haag and Birchum. We strongly believe Arrington and King are the best candidates. The two local races are closer calls, pitting candidates equally qualified to be judge and commissioner.\n\nMore than 900 Taylor County residents, on average, participated in the five days of early voting. The final tally was 4,844 ballots cast.\n\nWe all have noted the spirit of the presidential election \u2014 that's a polite way to put it. It has been contentious at times, perhaps more bully than bully pulpit.\n\nWhile many have become exasperated at the national process and decried what is viewed as mudslinging and shady tactics, we've seen that in the races that will be determined Tuesday.\n\nBluster and headline-making accusations have long been a part of the election process. But it seems these tactics have gone too far and gotten too personal. Candidates are relying more on taking down opponents rather than taking them on.\n\nOur mailboxes have been filled with cards of all sizes and shapes. Some examples from recent weeks:\n\nBuckingham: An 8 \u00bd-by-12 inch card with a drawing of King injecting \"toxic\" Obamacare into Texas.\n\nKing: A card picturing Buckingham and Hillary Clinton, saying \"both supported current Obama Democrats.\"\n\nRobertson: A card accusing Arrington of being \"courageous\" with plans to cut Social Security: \"There's nothing 'courageous' about stealing from seniors,\" it read.\n\nArrington: The only one we received at home (a 4-by-11 inch door hanger) pictures his family of five ... and Abilene Mayor Norm Archibald giving his support, along with the endorsements of a former governor and coach: Rick Perry and Texas Tech's Spike Dykes.\n\nWhat are you thinking, Mr. Arrington?\n\nPerhaps our favorite is Gary Gates' mailout that accuses opponent Wayne Christian of being a double-dipper and shows him holding two corn chips dipped in salsa. Included is a definition of \"double-dipper.\" More than anything, it made us hungry. Christian answered with a mailout that accuses Gates of being a six-time campaign loser, taxpayer robber (there's a caricature of Gates in a striped shirt holding two moneybags) and a Houston slumlord.\n\nWe've received mailouts picturing terrorists and walls. The fear factor card has been played. A lot.\n\nBoth Buckingham and King have been photographed holding guns. A letter-to-the-editor last week stated King at least looks like she could use hers.\n\nSome say it's time that we elect leaders who will take the offensive, say what they think ... and what many others are thinking, too. That's why Donald Trump has been so successful.\n\nOthers seek a return to civility in political races. Is that a sign of weakness? No, they say. Just a better way for folks to work together to get something done.\n\nWe'll see Tuesday which direction we're headed.", "article_metadata": {"title": "And Back Home: Election pushes bounds of civility", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporternews.com/opinion/editorials/our-opinion-election-pushes-bounds-of-civility-3333b8b7-3ac4-3a58-e053-0100007f2301-380335301.html", "image": {"width": 900, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/election-20161.jpg", "height": 900}, "type": "article", "description": "Texas candidates showing the mean spirit we are detesting in national politicians.", "title": "And Back Home: Election pushes bounds of civility"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reporternews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/election-20161.jpg", "description": "Texas candidates showing the mean spirit we are detesting in national politicians.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "And Back Home: Election pushes bounds of civility"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6d0d\"", "article_summary": "The Reporter-News and its Community Advisory Board have recommended Arrington, King, Haag and Birchum.\nWe all have noted the spirit of the presidential election \u2014 that's a polite way to put it.\nRobertson: A card accusing Arrington of being \"courageous\" with plans to cut Social Security: \"There's nothing 'courageous' about stealing from seniors,\" it read.\nKing, the current House District 71 representative, gained the most votes in the primary, but not a majority.\nFor the 19th Congressional District, Jodey Arrington faces Glen Robertson in an all-Lubbock finale."}
