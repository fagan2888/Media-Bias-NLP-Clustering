The toddler was estimated to be around 4 years old and was nicknamed \u201cBaby Doe.\u201d\n\nThe latest scientific testing revealed that the child may have spent time in any of six different New England states before her death. The tests included isotopic analysis, which examined hair and tooth enamels for isotopes coming from the food and water in specific regions of the country. The results suggested Baby Doe may have moved around the country during her short life.\n\n\u201cScientists have not yet compared the biological evidence with drinking water samples in other countries. As a result, investigators are not drawing any specific conclusions on the analysis until it is complete,\u201d said a statement from Massachusetts State Police.\n\nThese results, said authorities, are preliminary and require further testing and study. Prior examination of pollen samples found in the trash bag where she was found suggested she had spent time in the Greater Boston area prior to her death. This, along with the fact that her body did not show advanced signs of decomposition when it was found, led investigators to believe she died in the area rather than a distant location.\n\nAuthorities urge anyone with information concerning the girl to utilize a tip line that has been set up for the case.\n\nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "isotopic, testing, hair, and, tooth, enamels, may, provide, leads, case, unidentified, toddlers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Authorities may be one step closer to identifying a toddler's body that washed ashore in Boston earlier this summer.", "title": "Hair, Tooth Tests May Help Identify 'Baby Doe' Who Washed Ashore In Boston", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/isotopic-testing-hair-and-tooth-enamels-may-provide-leads-case-unidentified-toddlers-350980", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/09/02/baby-doe.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Authorities may be one step closer to identifying a toddler's body that washed ashore in Boston earlier this summer.", "title": "Hair, Tooth Tests May Help Identify 'Baby Doe' Who Washed Ashore In Boston", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/isotopic-testing-hair-and-tooth-enamels-may-provide-leads-case-unidentified-toddlers-350980", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/09/02/baby-doe.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/02/baby-doe.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-02T17:10:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T17:10:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Authorities may be one step closer to identifying a toddler's body that washed ashore in Boston earlier this summer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf17\"", "article_summary": "\u201cScientists have not yet compared the biological evidence with drinking water samples in other countries.\nThe results suggested Baby Doe may have moved around the country during her short life.\nThe tests included isotopic analysis, which examined hair and tooth enamels for isotopes coming from the food and water in specific regions of the country.\nOn June 25, the girl\u2019s body was discovered on a peninsula in Boston Harbor opposite Logan Airport, according to Massachusetts State Police.\nAuthorities urge anyone with information concerning the girl to utilize a tip line that has been set up for the case."}
