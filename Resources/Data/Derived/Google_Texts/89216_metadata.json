Do you feel comfortable talking to your doctor? Could you afford a medical emergency? If you hesitated when answering any of these questions, you\u2019re far from alone. According to a Gallup survey, one-third of Americans don\u2019t believe the health care system works for them. Face time with doctors hovers around 15 minutes, with only five dedicated to whatever ailment originally brought you into the room. Almost half of Americans couldn\u2019t afford an unexpected $400 bill.\n\nFor LGBT Americans, the picture is even worse. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly a quarter of bisexual men are uninsured. Half of transgender Americans have skipped necessary medical care because they couldn\u2019t afford it. As for those with access to care, a stunning 50% of LGBT Americans aren\u2019t out to their doctors.\n\nHealth care in the gay community is a pressing issue, whether it\u2019s affordability or comfort with a provider. For the second year in a row, Frontiers has created a comprehensive guide to health care in Southern California. We\u2019ve expanded the range of providers covered and compiled more information on each. Specifically, we\u2019ve added two new categories\u2014mental health and senior services\u2014and provided a brief summary (albeit not comprehensive) of the insurance each individual or practice accepts.\n\nThe goal of this information is to let you discover a provider you truly like, whom you can afford, and one that offers the services you need. A good doctor-patient relationship is one of the bedrocks of great health care, but finding that great general practitioner or psychotherapist is a challenge most aren\u2019t equipped to take on.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of finding a doctor is finding one you can have a consistent relationship with,\u201d says Dr. Anthony Scarsella, the President and Medical Director of Pacific Oaks Medical Group, one of the most prominent gay-friendly providers in SoCal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s someone you see through an HMO, or if they take your PPO, Medicare or Medi-Cal; you want a doctor who knows you.\u201d\n\nAs the massive health care industry still settles into the laws and requirements of the era-defining Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s becoming harder to maintain a consistent provider. \u201cInsurance can change yearly; that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now,\u201d says Dr. Scarsella, \u201cand it can be confusing and upsetting. As a doctor, it\u2019s not easy to start a relationship and figure out a person\u2019s medical needs in one visit. It\u2019s too daunting.\u201d\n\nFor the LGBT population, this problem is conflated with finding a doctor whom we trust and with whom we feel comfortable discussing intimate details and issues. Most often a person\u2019s sexuality won\u2019t be relevant information, but when it becomes a part of the discussion, doctors unequipped to deal with an LGBT client can make mistakes that either bristles or silences a patient. Dr. Scarsella believes that because most doctors received training years\u2014even decades\u2014ago, their sensitivity training and knowledge can be limited. In fact, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of providers reported that most respondents\u2019 only training regarding gay and lesbian patients was limited to HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cA doctor might be too timid to bring up important information, because they don\u2019t want to offend someone, or they might start asking really uncomfortable questions,\u201d says Dr. Scarsella. \u201cThey might ask if you have HIV, or a drug problem, and the patient might be sitting there thinking, \u2018I wanted to just talk about this other issue!\u2019 It feels like they\u2019re searching you for every possible problem. You don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re seeing you as a whole person. It\u2019s a form of subtle discrimination.\u201d\n\nDr. Scarsella believes gay patients might be more forthright with information if their doctor is also LGBT. However, he points out that finding a doctor who clicks with you should encompass a wide range of choices and could take effort.\n\n\u201cI think that if you meet a doctor and they might not be the right person for you, it\u2019s perfectly OK to give another one a shot, whether it\u2019s in the same practice or elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cA doctor should be someone you feel comfortable with, but a person you\u2019ll listen to when they have to tell you information you don\u2019t want to hear. What works for you is very personal.\u201d\n\nAs for L.A.\u2019s gay population and its health, a trend Dr. Scarsella sees is young men moving to the city alone, attempting to navigate both a new life and their wellbeing. \u201cA lot of the time they don\u2019t have insurance, and their health suffers. They won\u2019t get care because they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about what happens if they get sick, because they don\u2019t know many people,\u201d he says.\n\nFree or low-income clinics can be useful for those without coverage. Ranging from STD testing to low-cost immediate care, these clinics\u2014which are both private and government-run, can have a massive impact on the overall health of the city\u2019s gay population. Even with rigorous testing, proper treatment and the advent of PrEP, gay or bisexual men make up one-half of those living with HIV and an unbelievable two-thirds of new infections. Commitment to care\u2014whatever the form\u2014makes a critical difference in everyone\u2019s quality of life and overall health.\n\n\u201cAccessibility, comfort and consistency are what we need out of health care,\u201d says Dr. Scarsella. \u201cWe should make sure everyone has those opportunities.\u201d\n\nGo to Page 2 for General Practitioners listings\n\nGo to Page 3 for HIV Services listings\n\nGo to Page 4 for Dentists listings\n\nGo to Page 5 for Mental Health Services\n\nGo to Page 6 for Senior Services\n\nGo to Page 7 for Free and Low-Cost Services\n\nGo to Page 8 for Help Navigating Covered California\n\nThis guide was created from reader-generated nominations and research that included information from the Gay & Lesbian Medical Association, the Southern California Lambda Medical Association and the American Academy of HIV Specialists.
