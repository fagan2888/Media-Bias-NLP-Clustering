Other states run their own marketplaces.\n\nBut the federal website has been fraught with problems, leaving users frustrated by errors and slow speeds.\n\nThe portal is intended to help move the United States closer to universal care by subsidizing insurance sold by the private sector for less affluent families.\n\nLushniak said his office had not been intimately involved in setting up the website, but was contributing to the program from a public health perspective.\n\n\"What I'm most concerned about is the number of uninsured and underinsured in our nation, and that ultimately I need to have resolution of that for the good of the public's health,\" Lushniak said.\n\nLushniak said that implementing a national strategy on preventing health problems will be an important job for his successor, Vivek Hallegere Murthy, who has been nominated by Obama to be the next U.S. surgeon general.\n\n\"We're going to expect some great leadership pointing us in the direction of prevention,\" he said, citing early diagnoses and exercise as preventive measures.\n\n(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Phil Berlowitz)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout Politicians React To Obamacare Rollout\n\n1 of 6 Michele Bachmann \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Obamacare is forcing every American to purchase a health-insurance policy they don\u2019t want at a price they can\u2019t afford from a website that doesn\u2019t work.\" Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Daniel Lovering                 CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - The acting U.S. surgeon general said on Tuesday he was \"enthusiastic\"...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-12-04 19:32:00 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "By Daniel Lovering                 CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - The acting U.S. surgeon general said on Tuesday he was \"enthusiastic\"...", "title": "U.S. Surgeon General Lauds Healthcare.gov Progress", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/boris-lushniak-health-care_n_4380749.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1495378/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1495378/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "By Daniel Lovering                 CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - The acting U.S. surgeon general said on Tuesday he was \"enthusiastic\"...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. Surgeon General Lauds Healthcare.gov Progress"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-03 19:32:00 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4380749", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "reuters,healthcare.gov,Affordable Care Act,obama,Boris Lushniak,surgeon general,health care website,Barack Obama,U.S. Surgeon General", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "reuters,healthcare.gov,Affordable Care Act,obama,Boris Lushniak,surgeon general,health care website,Barack Obama,U.S. Surgeon General", "published_time": "2013-12-03 19:32:00 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-02 05:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fb8\"", "article_summary": "Lushniak said his office had not been intimately involved in setting up the website, but was contributing to the program from a public health perspective.\nBut the federal website has been fraught with problems, leaving users frustrated by errors and slow speeds.\nRear Admiral Boris Lushniak, who has been acting as the surgeon general since July, said President Barack Obama's administration had acknowledged there was \"still a way to go\" to fix the site, \"but in fact progress is being made.\"\nThe portal is intended to help move the United States closer to universal care by subsidizing insurance sold by the private sector for less affluent families.\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty ImagesBy Daniel LoveringCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - The acting U.S. surgeon general said on Tuesday he was \"enthusiastic\" about the recent improvements to the troubled HealthCare.gov website, which was designed to allow users to shop for health insurance required under new reforms."}
