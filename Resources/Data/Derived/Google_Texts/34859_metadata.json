The penalty bumps up to $325 or 2 percent in 2015 and goes up to more than $600 in 2016.\n\nBut some people would still pay more for health coverage than the penalty, especially those who earn higher incomes.\n\nFor instance, a 27-year-old making about $23,000 in 2014 would pay $849 a year on health insurance after taking into account subsidies. That person's Obamacare tax would be only $230, however \u2014 a difference of $619, or nearly 3 percent of the worker's annual income.\n\nEven in 2015 the 27-year-old would avoid $391 in additional costs by going without insurance and paying the penalty.\n\n\"While the incremental cost of insurance becomes less significant as the mandate penalty grows, individuals earning more than double the poverty level may continue to forego coverage since paying the fine is still more affordable,\" said Caroline Pearson, Avalere senior vice president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some consumers are willing to pay the penalty for not having health insurance because it is cheaper than getting coverage, according to a new analysis.\nThe analysis from research firm Avalere Health details one reason why the administration has done so poorly in a special enrollment period for Obamacare.
