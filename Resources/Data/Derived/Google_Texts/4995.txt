A scion of the Udall family is losing ground in this year’s Senate contest, but this time it’s Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico.

The Democratic incumbent saw his once-formidable lead over Republican Allen Weh shrink in two polls released Monday. A survey taken by Research & Polling Inc. for the Albuquerque Journal has Mr. Udall ahead by 50 to 43 points, down from 51 to 38 percent in its mid-September poll.

“The momentum is on our side! Let’s go all the WEH!” said a Monday post on Mr. Weh’s Twitter account.

A Vox Populi poll issued Monday showed Mr. Udall leading by an even narrower margin—47 to 43 percent—with 11 percent undecided.

“Our survey shows that the New Mexico Senate race has tightened down to a four-point lead heading into Election Day,” said Vox Populi pollster Brent Seaborn in a statement. “The deteriorating national political environment for Democrats and President Obama has put Senate races like New Mexico at risk for Democrats.”

A retired decorated Marine colonel and CEO of CSI Aviation, Mr. Weh has been trailing by double digits for most of the campaign against the first-term incumbent, but he continues to hammer Mr. Udall over his vote for Obamacare and ties to President Obama.

“A vote for Udall is a vote for Obama,” says a Weh for Senate ad released Monday.

Mr. Udall’s cousin, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, has his hands full this year in his re-election bid against Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who’s leading by several points in recent polls.

Mr. Weh may be benefiting from the coattails of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, who enjoys a sizable lead against Democrat Gary King. An Albuquerque Journal poll issued Sunday shows her ahead by 15 points.

The Rothenberg Political Report lists the New Mexico Senate race as “currently safe Democratic,” while the Cook Political Report calls it “solid D.”
