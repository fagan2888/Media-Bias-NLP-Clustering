The report, by David Squires and David Blumenthal, notes that between 1999 and 2014, mortality rates in the U.S. rose for white Americans aged 22 and 56. Before that, death rates had been falling by nearly 2 percent each year since 1968. Squires and Blumenthal call the difference between the those two mortality trend lines\u2014the expected, declining one and the actual, rising one\u2014the \u201cmortality gap.\u201d\n\nThe authors of that study attributed the trend to what we called \u201c despair deaths :\u201d mainly suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nLate last year, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that middle-aged, white Americans have been getting sicker and dying in greater numbers, even as the rest of the world is living longer and healthier.\n\nBy digging through CDC data, they saw that the reason death rates failed to decline as expected was not entirely due to suicide and substance abuse. Although those factors explained about 40 percent of the gap, the rest was attributable to the leading causes of death\u2014things like heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease. Though there are still fewer people dying from those diseases than there were in the 1960s, according to this analysis, the rate of decline has slowed.\n\nDeath Rate From the 10 Leading Causes of Death\n\nThat means not only are middle-aged white people drinking more, using more opioids, and killing themselves at higher rates, more of them are getting sick with the diseases that usually kill older people. And when they do get sick, they don\u2019t get better.\n\nThis trend was especially concentrated in the South, they found. \u201cIn seven southern states\u2014West Virginia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, and Arkansas\u2014the gap between actual and expected mortality in 2014 exceeded 200 deaths per 100,000 people. In West Virginia, mortality rates were higher than at any time since 1980,\u201d they write. The report was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, and its raw data was not made available.\n\nMortality Gap for Middle-Aged Whites, by State\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, because of historic racial injustice, health outcomes for African Americans still lag behind those of white Americans in many areas. African Americans die an average of four years younger than white Americans do, for example. However, the mortality rate for African Americans is declining, and that of white Americans is increasing\u2014a historically anomalous trend.\n\nSquires and Blumenthal think the worsening economic standing of uneducated, middle-aged whites might have played a role.\n\n\u201cMiddle-aged whites have been falling behind in the 21st century.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a range of social and economic indicators, middle-aged whites have been falling behind in the 21st century,\u201d they write. \u201cThey have lower incomes, fewer are employed, and fewer are married.\u201d\n\nThis does not mean whites are worse off than minorities, they note. But it could mean that they are the canaries of a coal mine of broader societal problems that have deleterious health effects, such as \u201cless-educated workers\u2019 increasing disengagement from the mainstream economy; declining levels of social connectedness; weakened communal institutions; and the splintering of society along class, geographic, and cultural lines,\u201d they write.\n\nThe findings are also concerning because four of the seven worst-off states the researchers highlighted have opted not to expand Medicaid as part of Obamacare. And although health insurance alone likely won\u2019t be enough to turn the tide of premature deaths, it\u2019s certainly one of the few immediate interventions that could help.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report offers one explanation as to why the mortality rate for uneducated white Americans has risen\u2014even as people elsewhere are living longer and healthier.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new report offers one explanation as to why the mortality rate for uneducated white Americans has risen\u2014even as people elsewhere are living longer and healthier.", "title": "Why Are So Many Middle-Aged White Americans Dying?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/AP_123762251317/facebook.jpg?1454080359", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/middle-aged-white-americans-left-behind-and-dying-early/433863/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb051\"", "article_summary": "African Americans die an average of four years younger than white Americans do, for example.\nHowever, the mortality rate for African Americans is declining, and that of white Americans is increasing\u2014a historically anomalous trend.\nMortality Gap for Middle-Aged Whites, by StateIt\u2019s worth noting that, because of historic racial injustice, health outcomes for African Americans still lag behind those of white Americans in many areas.\nLate last year, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that middle-aged, white Americans have been getting sicker and dying in greater numbers, even as the rest of the world is living longer and healthier.\n\u201cMiddle-aged whites have been falling behind in the 21st century.\u201d\u201cOn a range of social and economic indicators, middle-aged whites have been falling behind in the 21st century,\u201d they write."}
