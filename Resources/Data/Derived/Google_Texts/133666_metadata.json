It\u2019s the fifth leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRecovering the ability to move arms and hands often requires hours of physical therapy. What\u2019s more, clinicians lack science-based evidence as to which type and amount of therapy is most effective.\n\nBut a new study led by Carolee Winstein MS \u201984 and published in the Feb. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association has changed that, providing some much-needed scientific data for clinicians. In short, more therapy doesn\u2019t necessarily provide better outcomes.\n\nRehab strategies\n\nIn the study, called the Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Arm Rehabilitation Evaluation (ICARE), researchers compared two different rehabilitation strategies to determine each one\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe first group of stroke survivors underwent three one-hour sessions every week for 10 weeks of an intensive, high-repetition, task-oriented physical therapy intervention called the accelerated skill acquisition program (ASAP). The second group underwent an equivalent dose of usual and customary occupational therapy.\n\nAfter one year, the groups were tested on their arm and hand movements, and researchers discovered there wasn\u2019t that much of a difference between the two interventions.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised that ASAP did not, in fact, accelerate motor outcomes,\u201d Winstein said. \u201cWe were also surprised that more than doubling the dose of usual occupational therapy did not appear to have an impact either.\u201d\n\nClinicians can be comfortable knowing that they can choose the best treatment for patients with stroke, Winstein concluded. \u201cFor the time being, what is happening right now in usual care \u2014 at least in the top-notch places \u2014 is the best.\u201d\n\nStroke survivors\n\nUnlike previous studies, ICARE is the first clinical trial to look at stroke rehabilitation in the outpatient setting, which is where stroke survivors are currently doing the majority of their rehabilitation.\n\nWith health care reform and the shrinking of time for inpatient care, the burden is being placed more and more on the outpatient setting. Carolee Winstein\n\n\u201cWith health care reform and the shrinking of time for inpatient care, the burden is being placed more and more on the outpatient setting,\u201d Winstein said.\n\nThe results could lead to more efficient stroke rehabilitation, eliminating unnecessary or wasteful medical interventions, one of the goals of 2010\u2019s Affordable Care Act in its quest to keep health care costs down.\n\nWinstein cautioned that the results should not to be generalized to different severity subgroups, psychosocial or physiological outcomes. In this article, researchers were looking only at arm movement recovery.\n\n\u201cRecovery is not just about the individual movement of the arm,\u201d Winstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s about integrating the arm movements back into meaningful activities. Survivors want to get back to doing activities that are part of their lives.\u201d\n\nICARE researchers will delve into social-cognitive and physiological outcomes in forthcoming papers.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nICARE began in 2008 after Winstein was awarded a $12.4 million grant by the National Institute of Health. Co-investigators Alexander Dromerick, of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C., and Steven Wolf, of the Emory University Center for Rehabilitation in Atlanta, collaborated on the eight-year project.\n\nWinstein has been a professor of the USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy since 1990. She runs the Motor Behavior and Neurorehabilitation Lab, which is focused on motor control and learning.\n\nWinstein is one of eight USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy faculty members to be named a Catherine Worthingham Fellow of the American Physical Therapy Association.\n\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association is an international, peer-reviewed medical journal. It is one of the most widely circulated medical journals in the world, according to the JAMA website.\n\nMore stories about: Cardiovascular, Physical Therapy, Research", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://news.usc.edu/91796/more-therapy-is-not-always-better/", "image": {"width": 480, "secure_url": "https://news.usc.edu/files/2016/02/physical-therapy2-480x320.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://news.usc.edu/files/2016/02/physical-therapy2-480x320.jpg", "height": 320}, "type": "article", "description": "Hours of physical therapy do not necessarily provide better outcomes, USC researcher says.", "title": "More physical therapy isn\u2019t always better for stroke patients"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Winstein is one of eight USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy faculty members to be named a Catherine Worthingham Fellow of the American Physical Therapy Association.\nRecovering the ability to move arms and hands often requires hours of physical therapy.\nMore stories about: Cardiovascular, Physical Therapy, Research\nWinstein has been a professor of the USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy since 1990.\nThe first group of stroke survivors underwent three one-hour sessions every week for 10 weeks of an intensive, high-repetition, task-oriented physical therapy intervention called the accelerated skill acquisition program (ASAP)."}
