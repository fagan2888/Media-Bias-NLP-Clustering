Leading up to the 2015 CMA Awards, Shelton says that he is prepared to be the subject of some of co-hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood\u2018s on-stage bits \u2014 specifically, about his recent divorce from Miranda Lambert.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s gonna be awkward at the CMAs, speaking of jokes,\u201d Shelton tells Late Night With Seth Meyers. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s gotta be one about me and Miranda. Brad Paisley is not doing his job if he doesn\u2019t look down there and go, \u2018Ha ha!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotta do it. You have to address the elephant in the room. He has to,\u201d Shelton continues. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the conversations, like, \u2018Okay, dude. I\u2019ll go sit there and let you kick me in the face a few times.\u2019 I know it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nPaisley and Underwood will be co-hosting the CMA Awards for the eighth year, and in the past, they\u2019ve poked fun at plenty of country stars (including themselves), \u201cObamacare\u201d and numerous other pop culture goings-on. Still, Shelton insists that there are no hard feelings.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s friends. If you\u2019re in the country industry, it really is a family \u2026 a big, inbred family,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nShelton and Lambert announced their divorce in July, and while neither has delved into the details of their split, Shelton has been open in discussing how he\u2019s coping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a good place. I wasn\u2019t, but I am now,\u201d the The Voice coach said in early October. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly life can turn around for you. I\u2019ve had some pretty cool things in recent times that have happened, and I\u2019m loving it.\u201d\n\nAnd both country stars are adamant that they\u2019re remaining friendly with each other.\n\n\u201cOur whole thing was, we are going to be cool about this, it is what it is,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cWe\u2019re buddies.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 CMA Awards are scheduled to air live from Nashville on Nov. 4 at 8PM ET on ABC.\n\nBlake Shelton\u2019s Best Tweets\n\nTop 9 Unforgettable Blake Shelton Moments\n\nNEXT: Top 10 Blake Shelton Songs", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/10/blake-shelton-2015-cma-awards-jokes.jpg", "sailthru.author": "astefano", "description": "Blake Shelton tells Seth Meyers that he knows there will be jokes about his and Miranda Lambert's divorce at the 2015 CMA Awards.", "og": {"site_name": "The Boot", "description": "Blake Shelton tells Seth Meyers that he knows there will be jokes about his and Miranda Lambert's divorce at the 2015 CMA Awards.", "title": "Blake Shelton Expects to Be Made Fun of at the 2015 CMAs", "url": "http://theboot.com/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-divorce-2015-cma-awards-jokes/", "image": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/10/blake-shelton-2015-cma-awards-jokes.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thebootdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-28 09:30:33", "sailthru.title": "Blake Shelton Expects to Be the Subject of Jokes at the 2015 CMA Awards", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-theboot, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, blake-shelton, cma-awards, cmas, country-news", "fb": {"admins": 59877105906, "app_id": 151086041747752}, "keywords": "blake shelton 2015 cma awards, blake shelton miranda lambert divorce 2015 cma awards, 2015 cma awards jokes about blake shelton and miranda lambert", "sailthru.description": "Blake Shelton tells Seth Meyers that he knows there will be jokes about his and Miranda Lambert's divorce at the 2015 CMA Awards.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/10/blake-shelton-2015-cma-awards-jokes.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3d6\"", "article_summary": "Blake Shelton\u2019s Best TweetsTop 9 Unforgettable Blake Shelton MomentsNEXT: Top 10 Blake Shelton Songs\nBlake Shelton has no trouble dishing out jokes and pranks \u2014 and he has no problem taking them, either.\n\u201cWe\u2019re buddies.\u201dThe 2015 CMA Awards are scheduled to air live from Nashville on Nov. 4 at 8PM ET on ABC.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s gonna be awkward at the CMAs, speaking of jokes,\u201d Shelton tells Late Night With Seth Meyers.\nI\u2019ve had some pretty cool things in recent times that have happened, and I\u2019m loving it.\u201dAnd both country stars are adamant that they\u2019re remaining friendly with each other."}
