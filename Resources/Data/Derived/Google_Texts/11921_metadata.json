His fastest-growing group of patients? Obamacare enrollees.\n\nThough armed with Obamacare health insurance plans, the patients are saddled with high deductibles. Looking for alternatives, some of them fly from around the country to the Surgery Center of Oklahoma, where the cost of care and travel together amounts to less than their deductibles under their Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nThe Surgery Center of Oklahoma is a physician-owned operation that does not take Medicare or Medicaid and only selectively works with private insurance plans. Patients pay in cash or with cashier\u2019s checks.\n\n\u201cEven if someone has this (Obamacare) insurance card in their pocket, they are soon going to find out that it\u2019s worthless,\u201d Smith said, citing both higher prices and doctor shortages under Obamacare. \u201cCoverage doesn\u2019t mean care.\u201d\n\nAs proof, he points to the fact that among his first waves of patients to the center were Canadians, who though covered under their country\u2019s socialized health care system, found themselves in the back of a long line of patients in desperate need of care.\n\nWhen questioned about the influx of Obamacare patients at Smith\u2019s facility, Tasha Bradley, a spokesperson at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, merely pointed to the many financial benefits of enrolling in Obamacare.\n\n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, consumers could face unlimited out-of-pocket expenses for plans with limited benefits and high deductibles, if they could even get coverage without being denied for a pre-existing condition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Marketplace, out-of-pocket expenses are capped for the first time, prescription drugs are now covered, and many consumers may qualify for cost-sharing reductions that reduce their out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nBut Smith and others argue Obamacare is moving America even farther away from the real solution to its health care woes. What\u2019s needed, they say, is a free-market model in which Americans are not just patients, but health care consumers.\n\nBut being a savvy health care consumer doesn\u2019t come easy, even for health care professionals.\n\nDr. James Totoro has been a general surgeon at the Surgery Center for more than 12 years. Recently, he had to have a medical procedure. As he left the doctor\u2019s office and began driving down the street, it suddenly hit him \u2014 he had not asked his doctor how much the procedure was going to cost.\n\n\u201cNow, I know this is about my health and maybe it shouldn\u2019t make a difference,\u201d Totoro said, \u201cbut if I went to buy a car, would I leave the showroom going, \u2018Oh! I forgot to ask them how much that car was going to cost?\u2019\u201d\n\nHealth care is one of the few commodities Americans buy blindly. Because of complicated health care plans and middlemen in the insurance industry, a patient really never knows what the cost will be until the bill arrives.\n\nThe American Hospital Association, in its 2014 report \u201cHospital Pricing Transparency\u201d, presents health care pricing as an impenetrable maze through which hospitals must gently guide patients.\n\nHospitals are encouraged to \u201cpresent information in a way that is easy for consumers to understand and use,\u201d to \u201ccreate common definitions and language to describe pricing information for consumers, and \u201cto include price information as just one of several considerations in making health care decisions,\u201d said the AHA in the report.\n\nAccording to Smith, patients suffer a lack of price transparency because listed prices would empower consumers and force hospitals to be more accountable for waste and high cost.\n\nSarah King is a 27-year-old dental assistant from South Dakota. When she was 11-weeks pregnant with her first child, she had a gallbladder attack that landed her in the emergency room. After her daughter\u2019s birth, she said she realized the gallbladder needed to be removed. Instead of going to the local hospital, she began researching alternatives. The price she ended up paying at the Surgery Center of Oklahoma was more than 50 percent less than the amount she said she would have paid for the same procedure at her local hospital.\n\nKing is a member of a Christian health-sharing group Samaritan Ministries. Rather than pay through a faceless third party, members of the ministry send each other money for medical expenses directly, with little notes of encouragement and well-wishes. Because of the camaraderie she developed with fellow members, King said she felt inclined to keep costs down.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of having surgery and having to have people pay for it, I want to go the cheaper route,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said if the ministry didn\u2019t have the money that month to match up with all of its members\u2019 needs, she would have to foot some of the bill.\n\nBut King said there was another reason she chose the Surgery Center, and it has nothing to do with price. Her local hospital\u2019s infection rate was significantly higher than the Surgery Center\u2019s, which posts its infection rate along with its prices.\n\n\u201cThe money played somewhat of a role, but at the same time, their infections rates were incredibly low compared to surgical centers and hospitals in my area,\u201d King said. \u201cI felt a lot safer going there.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, transparent pricing wouldn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with lower infection rates, but Smith insists \u201cthe dots between transparent, upfront pricing connect to quality and efficiency.\u201d\n\nHis reasoning is that because his listed price is the final price patients pay, he benefits most if his center embraces efficiency. Hospitals, he said, do the opposite.\n\n\u201cThey bill for what they use, not for what they do. They are inclined to embrace waste. They make more money when there are complications because the bill goes even higher. If we waste, we won\u2019t stay open very long.\u201d\n\nAnd high prices in health care actually point to lower quality, Smith said, because high prices likely mean that the hospital is not facing competition and is confident it is going to get all patient referrals.\n\n\u201cIf the price is low, it means that someone has entered the marketplace wanting to compete,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t just compete on price but on quality.\u201d\n\nTotoro said the increased efficiency at the center is \u201csignificant\u201d and that while he can perform about four or five surgeries at the center in about two hours, \u201cin the hospital, if I did five cases, chances are it would take me six to eight hours.\u201d\n\nOne reason it goes faster at the center is because Smith does not accept government funding and is not bound by administrative \u201cred tape\u201d that bog down most hospitals. For example, the center doesn\u2019t have to comply with hospital standards for electronic documentation, an innovation Totoro said is more of a hindrance than a help. Not only is the center\u2019s paper documentation system more efficient, Totoro said, it also allows him to spend more time with his patients and less at a computer.\n\nAlso, doctors at the center are scheduled based on surgeries, not on shifts, so they can go home as soon as they finish. Because a longer operation often results in higher infection rates, the added incentive for efficiency can further account for the low infection rates at the center.\n\nUltimately, Totoro said, it\u2019s a \u201cwin-\u201dwin\u201d for doctors who work fewer hours and are paid more and patients who pay a set price and get quality care.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine someone not wanting to get into this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it not being a firestorm across the country.\u201d\n\nCritics of Smith\u2019s Surgery Center model say that he cherry picks his patients or simply offers \u201cconcierge medicine,\u201d which will never be available to those who don\u2019t have thousands of dollars of cash on hand.\n\nOthers say transparent pricing may be a nice idea for a small surgery center, but it is silly to think the health care industry across the board could really work in the same way. To that, Smith said one need only look at Oklahoma City, which now has a cardiac, spine and full-service hospital with transparent pricing.\n\nShalva Ginsparg is a junior at Stern College for Women in New York City majoring in English Literature and Judaic Studies, and a a graduate of the 2014 Franklin Center Journalism Internship program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Dr. Keith Smith is in expansion mode, looking to build two more operating rooms.
