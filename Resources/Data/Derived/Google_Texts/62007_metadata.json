Kennedy, Inaugural Address, January 20, 1961)\n\nIt isn\u2019t often that a member of the media reveals the philosophy behind his political ideology, but last week, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo outed himself. In an exchange with Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore about Moore\u2019s refusal to adhere to a federal appellate judge\u2019s order to ignore the state constitution and begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Moore said \u201c\u2026our rights contained in the Bill of Rights do not come from the Constitution, they come from God.\u201d\n\nCuomo disagreed: \u201cOur laws do not come from God, your honor, and you know that. They come from man.\u201d\n\nObviously, Cuomo flunked civics. Does he really believe that man is responsible for bestowing rights, and can therefore take those rights away as he sees fit? That a right bestowed today by a governing body of mere mortals can be invalidated by another body, say, following an election? That my rights and yours are as fluid as quicksilver and dependent on who sits in the big chair in Washington?\n\nIt is not a new debate, but a debate worth renewing.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution clearly understood that in order to put certain rights out of the reach of government, whose power they wished to limit, those rights had to come from a place government could not reach.\n\nThomas Jefferson understood this well enough to write in the Declaration of Independence that our rights to \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d are \u201cendowed by our Creator.\u201d He added in the next sentence that the purpose of government is to \u201csecure these rights.\u201d\n\nWhen government believes it can create or take away rights, it becomes a god unto itself and potentially endangers those rights. The only way to preserve them for ourselves and our posterity is to acknowledge they come from a higher place.\n\nThe English jurist, William Blackstone, who once studied in American law schools, understood this. Blackstone was a contemporary of America\u2019s Founders, who referred to him more than any other English or American authority. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the last century that the Supreme Court began repudiating Blackstone and started making law and creating rights.\n\nAs noted on the website Blackstone Legal Fellowship, \u201cBlackstone called this concept (of endowed rights) \u2018ultra vires,\u2019 which means it is beyond the authority of man to write a law that violates God\u2019s law. Blackstone also said that law is fixed, it is uniform, and it is universal. It does not change based on who the president is, or who holds judicial positions. It is the same law for everyone at all times and in all places.\u201d\n\nThe distinction between manmade law and laws that emanate from God is critical. Did civil rights legislation grant rights to African-Americans, or did they already possess those rights and government merely got around to recognizing them? Is not the Authority Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. frequently appealed to higher than any court or Congress?\n\nIf those rights were granted by government, the day might come when the cultural winds and public opinion shift and they could be taken away by the same institution that granted them. If they were endowed, then government has no right to create or remove them.\n\nMan enacted laws sanctioning same-sex marriage. Judge Roy Moore argues that a Higher law, including for human relationships, should prevail, a Higher law that man cannot impeach. I believe he\u2019s right.\n\nSecular progressives believe in a \u201cliving Constitution\u201d that constantly \u201cevolves\u201d to serve the people. The Founders (and Blackstone) believed the people are best served when they conform to laws established by God.\n\nOne doesn\u2019t have to believe in God for this to work, but the alternative potentially puts the rights of everyone in peril should one group, or class, fall out of favor.\n\nThis is why Chris Cuomo is wrong about the source of our laws and Judge Moore is right.\n\nCal Thomas is a syndicated columnist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The framers of the Constitution clearly understood that in order to put certain rights out of the reach of government, those rights had to come from a place government could not reach.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The framers of the Constitution clearly understood that in order to put certain rights out of the reach of government, those rights had to come from a place government could not reach.", "title": "CAL THOMAS: Chris Cuomo: \u2018Our rights do not come from God\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/18/cal-thomas-chris-cuomo-our-rights-do-not-come-god/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/29/9_292014_b3-feulner8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/29/9_292014_b3-feulner8201.jpg", "description": "The framers of the Constitution clearly understood that in order to put certain rights out of the reach of government, those rights had to come from a place government could not reach.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "CAL THOMAS: Chris Cuomo: \u2018Our rights do not come from God\u2019"}, "Author": "Cal Thomas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Christopher Cuomo, Roy Moore, William Blackstone"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3808\"", "article_summary": "Judge Roy Moore argues that a Higher law, including for human relationships, should prevail, a Higher law that man cannot impeach.\nDid civil rights legislation grant rights to African-Americans, or did they already possess those rights and government merely got around to recognizing them?\nDoes he really believe that man is responsible for bestowing rights, and can therefore take those rights away as he sees fit?\nThis is why Chris Cuomo is wrong about the source of our laws and Judge Moore is right.\nThe only way to preserve them for ourselves and our posterity is to acknowledge they come from a higher place."}
