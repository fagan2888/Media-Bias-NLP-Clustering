Similarly, around the same time, House Republicans sought out Dick Cheney for guidance on foreign policy, untroubled by his track record, too.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with seeking out experts for advice \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s generally a good idea \u2013 but the key is identifying reliable, trustworthy authorities who can help others better understand complex issues and add value to a serious conversation.\n\nIt you missed Rachel\u2019s opening segment last night \u2013 and my oh my do I hope you saw this one \u2013 there\u2019s fresh evidence that Republicans\u2019 appreciation for expertise is a little, shall we saw, skewed.\n\nThe House committee responsible for Obamacare oversight asked for expert guidance last week about the troubled launch of the federal Healthcare.gov site from John McAfee, the tech legend once suspected in the murder of his neighbor in Central America, CNBC has learned. That Republican-controlled committee wanted the McAfee Associates founder to \u201cguide our oversight and review of\u201d the implementation of the federal marketplace selling Obamacare insurance, according to an email obtained by CNBC.com. The committee suggested that McAfee might discuss the technologically botched rollout with members of Congress.\n\nFor PC owners, McAfee is probably a familiar brand name, generally associated with anti-virus software. But John McAfee is another story altogether.\n\nRachel documented the sordid tale last night in stunning fashion, but to briefly recap, John McAfee, following some notable drug-induced escapades, moved to Belize, where he surrounded himself with firearms, bodyguards, and teenaged girlfriends. When a neighbor filed a noise complaint against McAfee, the neighbor was soon after shot in the head and killed.\n\nMcAfee then fled Belize, was detained in Guatemala, and was deported back to the United States.\n\nThis is the man House Republicans have sought out for guidance on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMcAfee\u2019s lawyer apparently responded that his client\u2019s schedule is \u201cup in the air,\u201d but he might be available for \u201ca phone breifing [sic].\u201d\n\nA couple of years ago, David Brooks, lamenting the radicalism of congressional Republicans, complained that many on the far-right \u201cdo not accept the legitimacy of scholars and intellectual authorities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "There's nothing wrong with Congress reaching out to experts for guidance.
