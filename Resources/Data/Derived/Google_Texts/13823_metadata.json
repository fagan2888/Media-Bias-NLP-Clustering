Hospitals must prioritize conducting location intelligence, pinpointing close-by possible threats, and identifying vulnerabilities within the hospital, the Times-Union reported.\n\nOne of the first actions hospitals and health systems can take to build resiliency is know which systems are in place that can be expanded on short notice to serve more people in a hurry, said Thomas Frieden, M.D., director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the article.\n\nIt's a problem the government takes seriously. The Hospital Preparedness Program and the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program distributed $840 million to public health care systems in Georgia. The funds ensure local communities can respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, or chemical, biological or radiological nuclear events, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nFunds like those from the federal programs will help facilities that lose power during storms, like those earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia, Adrianne Feinberg, director of emergency preparedness at Georgia Hospital Association, told the Times-Union. \"A concerted effort among healthcare partners and emergency management agencies resulted in generators and other resources being allocated to the affected facilities,\" Feinberg said.\n\nThe American Meteorological Society suggests medical centers examine their structural designs and relocate critical components to higher ground, citing Hurricane Katrina submerging many essential facilities in New Orleans for weeks, leaving behind the bodies of 200 patients who were eventually recovered from area hospitals and nursing homes after the hurricane, according to the article.\n\nIn New Orleans, reconstruction of a Veterans Affairs facility will feature emergency rooms at least 20 feet above base flood levels, along with kitchens, electronic components, and emergency generators on upper floors. In Joplin, Missouri, Mercy Hospital Joplin reconstruction after a devastating tornado two years ago will include construction of safe rooms deep in the core of the building and three different kinds of glass of different wind-protection levels.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Times-Union story\n\n- check out the AMS report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBracing for natural disasters through hospital design\n\nJoplin hospitals share lessons on disaster planning\n\nHHS awards $840M to boost emergency preparedness\n\nIn emergencies, hospital preparedness goes beyond planning", "article_metadata": {"description": "High impact weather events across the country have some experts wondering if hospitals are resilient enough to overcome the aftermath of storms, tornados, hurricanes and floods,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Florida Times-Union.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "High impact weather events across the country have some experts wondering if hospitals are resilient enough to overcome the aftermath of storms, tornados, hurricanes and floods,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Florida Times-Union.", "title": "Hospital resiliency most important after natural disaster, emergencies", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-resiliency-most-important-after-natural-disaster-emergencies/2014-07-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,emergency preparedness,Hospital Preparedness Program,HR & Workforce Management,Natural Disasters,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The Hospital Preparedness Program and the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program distributed $840 million to public health care systems in Georgia.\nTo learn more:- here's the Times-Union story- check out the AMS reportRelated Articles:Bracing for natural disasters through hospital designJoplin hospitals share lessons on disaster planningHHS awards $840M to boost emergency preparednessIn emergencies, hospital preparedness goes beyond planning\nHospitals must prioritize conducting location intelligence, pinpointing close-by possible threats, and identifying vulnerabilities within the hospital, the Times-Union reported.\nJim Blair, president of the Center for HealthCare Emergency Readiness, questions whether hospitals that haven't had a recent disaster are truly prepared.\nFunds like those from the federal programs will help facilities that lose power during storms, like those earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia, Adrianne Feinberg, director of emergency preparedness at Georgia Hospital Association, told the Times-Union."}
