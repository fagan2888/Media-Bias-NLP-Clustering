Many providers share patient satisfaction surveys with the general public instead of relying on popular rankings sites, such as Healthgrades, Vitals, or rateMDs.\n\n\"The general trend in healthcare is toward increased transparency,\" says Anthony Perry, M.D., vice president of ambulatory care and population health at Rush in the announcement. \"We want to embrace that trend, because we believe that information will empower patients who are making important decisions and simultaneously inspire us to be the best we can be on their behalf.\"\n\nRush plans to post patient feedback about any physician for whom the medical center has received 30 or more surveys in a rolling one-year period. Patients are asked about the provider's friendliness, explanations of care, level of concern and understandability. The feedback is presented in the form of stars, ranging from one star for a \"very poor\" evaluation to five stars for \"very good.\"\n\n\"These aspects of care are what patients notice first and most about their physicians, and we want to be accountable to our patients for how we treat them,\" Perry says.\n\nPerry says he hopes that making the patient feedback available will make it easier for patients to choose doctors that will be a good fit for them.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNew York's North Shore-LIJ starts posting patient reviews online\n\nOnline ratings game: To boost PR, many hospitals post their own patient satisfaction info\n\nHospitals' Facebook ratings may reflect quality of care\n\nPatients choose hospitals based on social media\n\nPatients pick hospitals for their social media presence", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rush University Medical Center has become the first organization in the Midwest to post the results of patient surveys in the profiles of individual physicians on its website.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Rush University Medical Center has become the first organization in the Midwest to post the results of patient surveys in the profiles of individual physicians on its website.", "title": "Rush University Medical Center joins online review-posting trend", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/rush-university-medical-center-joins-online-review-posting-trend/2015-09-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Marketing,online ratings,online reviews,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,patient satisfaction,physicians,Rush University Medical Center,surveys", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Marketing,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f5e\"", "article_summary": "Rush plans to post patient feedback about any physician for whom the medical center has received 30 or more surveys in a rolling one-year period.\nRush University Medical Center has become the first organization in the Midwest to post the results of patient surveys in the profiles of individual physicians on its website.\nPerry says he hopes that making the patient feedback available will make it easier for patients to choose doctors that will be a good fit for them.\nAs online ratings play an increasing role in consumer healthcare decisions, many healthcare organizations are getting into the ratings game by posting real patient feedback on their web sites, FierceHealthcare reported in June.\nMany providers share patient satisfaction surveys with the general public instead of relying on popular rankings sites, such as Healthgrades, Vitals, or rateMDs."}
