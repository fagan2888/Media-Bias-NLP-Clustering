Five new doctors joined the clinic that summer bringing new skills to the area. It was a wonderful, heady time. Medicine ceased being work and became a joy. The feeling of community and progress was palpable and a whole new chapter began in the story of Lakeland medicine started by Dr. Torpy, and of course, Dr. Kate.\n\nIn addition to 12 years experience in private practice I brought with me a modest National reputation in the area of emergency room design, and more particularly the training of emergency department nurses. Early in 1973 I received a call from Dr. David Ottensmeyer, a neurosurgeon, and president of the Marshfield Clinic. He told me the clinic was enlarging and asked if I would be willing to offer consultation on design and equipping their anticipated emergency room facility. I told him I\u2019d be happy to do so and a date for my visit was chosen.\n\nNew to Wisconsin, I was aware of the Clinic\u2019s existence, but other than knowing its reputation for high quality care, knew little of the clinic\u2019s history, or organization. On my arrival in Marshfield I found the clinic in the downtown area occupying a large older office building under going extensive repair and expansion. I was introduced to the Medical Director, who, if my memory serves me, was Dr. Russ Lewis. He briefed me on the clinic\u2019s organization that is very, very service and community oriented. The doctors were all on modest, more or less egalitarian salaries and the standard of professionalism was exceptionally high. One couldn\u2019t help but be impressed.\n\nOne leader I did not meet that day, but on another occasion was Ben Lawton, chief of surgery. Dr. Lawton was the soul of professionalism and the \u201cConscience of the Clinic\u201d. When I was appointed to a state job helping set up the emergency services in Wisconsin, I called Dr. Lawton asking for his advice on dealing with State Government. He spent a whole Saturday afternoon explaining the government labyrinth in Madison. It\u2019s a shame some can\u2019t lead forever: I would willingly have followed him to Hell and back\n\nI was shown the proposed ER area, asked questions and spoke with some of the personnel. I was supplied with statistics and other information that I could use to make suggestions. Dr. Ottensmeyer rejoined me around noon and suggested I join some of the other doctors for lunch. We had a pleasant conversation about medicine and the future. Near the end of lunch Dr. Ottensmeyer diplomatically asked, if I would be interested in joining the clinic. I was, of course, very flattered, but respectfully declined the invitation. I was happy in Minocqua/ Woodruff, loved my colleagues there and preferred to stay where I was. We parted as new friends, and I sent them my suggestions in a longish letter mailed several days later.\n\nAt the time of our meeting Medicare was seven years old and beginning to create significant change. With reimbursement based on usual and customary fees physicians and hospitals were being paid very well. Marshfield found, in the next year or two that increased income on \u201cthe outside\u201d was making it very difficult to recruit new physicians into their Clinic. They were forced to abandon the selfless system of their founders and enter the market in a new way. By the late seventies and early eighties they aggressively expanded. A new, much larger clinic building was constructed, and they began acquiring stressed medical practices in central and north central Wisconsin. By 1987 they had some 700 doctors on staff!\n\nIn 1987 on the death of John Danielson, CEO of Howard Young Medical Center (HYMC) I was asked to assume that position. Around the same time, Lakeland Medical Associates (LMA) found itself facing financial pressures. HYMC entered into negotiations to acquire LMA, but after a lengthy study they chose to be acquired by Marshfield. The hospital was disappointed, but pleased the local clinic would be joining a large, well- organized system that could quickly solve the many business problems that had accumulated. Reorganization of LMA and expanded recruitment of new specialists would enhance the service roster at HYMC. It was so good for the hospital that five years later HYMC was named one of the best 100 hospitals in the United States.\n\nBut that was to change. The \u201cfee for service\u201d model was just too expensive. Medicare, Medicaid and the insurance industry, by 1990, began cutting costs by imposing all sorts of \u201cpre-authorization\u201d requirements, as well as making significant reductions in how much would be paid for any given service. To counter this, and to maintain their income, clinics all over the country began to offer services historically provided by the local hospital. Cat Scans, lab work and most importantly out patient surgery were provided in new facilities owned and operated by the clinics themselves. Marshfield Clinic (MC) was no exception.\n\nRecognizing this, HMYC, when expending its own outpatient surgical area, offered to partner the new, expanded facility with MC. They put off any decision saying they wished to study the idea. Months later they announced their own outpatient surgery facility to be attached to their clinic building. By small, incremental reduplication they took over more and more services the hospital already provided. HYMC was able to handle this by increasing efficiency, but efficiency has limits. And then came The Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare\n\nMC\u2019s business plan was already outdated, and Obamacare made it very, very difficult to continue as is, particularly with their proprietary insurance product that had to meet new Federal requirements. The local physicians became unhappy with the resultant austerity and several left. Two of these were excellent men in mid career that had been here nearly twenty years. That\u2019s a very bad sign in any organization. Several satellite MC offices in Rhinelander and Minocqua were closed and non-professional staffing was cut to the bone. Not immune from the distress, and with the loss of key doctors, the hospital with a capacity of ninety-nine beds began running at well below fifty percent occupancy. Morale in both organizations was and is challenged, to say the least.\n\nWhat MC, and for that matter the hospital have not realized is that they must reinvent themselves. The fee-for-service model\u2019s days are numbered. Obamacare is well aware of the rising costs and is doing everything it can to reduce outlays, with the ultimate goal, a single payer (them) system. This effort of MC to build what amounts to a small, specialized hospital, and gain revenue, is doomed from the start. Temporarily there might be a small increase, but that will not last. Re-duplicating existing facilities is very unwise when the future is unclear and revenues are likely to decline.\n\nMC and HMYC, presently at odds with one another, have a common enemy, Obamacare, provoking the discord. They both have to reconfigure themselves in a way that allows them to function with ever decreasing revenue. The medical staff numbers will have to be adjusted to Health Maintenance Organization standards of efficiency. If physicians wish to maintain their incomes, they should have that opportunity, but, if the number of dollars available is fixed, then staffing will have to be adjusted to suit. Significant changes in staffing levels and work- loads are in the offing, and changes in these regards will be very uncomfortable and hard to accept. From its own standpoint the hospital is no better off. They face reductions across the board with ever increasing regulation, itself costly.\n\nFunds for expensive equipment must come from other sources. Philanthropies such as the Howard Young Foundation can help. The Howard Young Trust along with incisive management at the hospital level will also allow for reasonable capital expansion independent of Obamacare\u2019s reimbursement. The two organizations not only have to work together, they must work together for the sake of the community. For the two, attempting to beggar one another in order to survive is madness, and reduplicating existing services and facilities to do so is beyond madness.\n\nHigh quality healthcare, good doctors and philanthropy are part and parcel of Lakeland, and are Dr. Kate\u2019s legacy. Howard Young, a long time summer resident, recognized the fact and left his considerable fortune to build a new and modern hospital for the community. All parties to the controversy must stop and remember who they are and why they are here. Don\u2019t just look at yourselves; look at the community. They are whom you serve, and they are who support your existence.\n\nGeorge T.
