(Times-Call)\n\nTimothy Lim, Gibbs' husband and a fellow plaintiff, printed off from Webtrak.com Mile-Hi's flight paths for the trips the company's plane took while LaBuda was standing in the couple's Gunbarrel backyard.\n\n\"Look at this obtuse path,\" Lim said, pointing to a printout that indicated a flight path rather like an upside down heart with the house in question at the bottom of the map, not crossed by the plane's trajectory. \"That's not normal. They could (fly like that regularly). But they don't unless the judge is here.\"\n\nGibbs added that, usually, she can read the numbers off of the Twin Otter's tail. When they flew over for the judge on Saturday, the Mile-Hi planes were T-shaped dots in the sky.\n\nA screen shot from Webtrak (http://ems02.bksv.com/webtrak/den3) shows Gibbs' home and the flight paths of the two Mile-Hi Skydiving planes on the Saturday one week before Boulder County District Judge Judith LaBuda's visit. Gibbs alleged Mile-Hi flew a different flight pattern for the judge. (Times-Call)\n\nCarla Behrens also said she thought Mile-Hi differed from how it usually flies over her house during the judge's visit from 3 to 3:30 p.m.\n\n\"I feel that's not a realistic picture of what happens every day when they're flying,\" Behrens said at 6 p.m. \"And they're back to normal now. It's reverberating inside the house.\"\n\nBut Mile-Hi owner Frank Casares, who flew one of the planes during the site visit, insisted the two aircraft flew normal flight patterns, as required by the judge.\n\n\"This pattern did not deviate from the typical pattern we fly on any given day with similar wind conditions, which were also typical for this time of year,\" Casares said in a written statement.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28037572/ears-sky-judge-visits-2-homes-longmont-airplane", "modificationDate": "2015-05-05T17:58:37-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0502/20150502__03TCASITEw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n  Staff Writer", "description": "The Twin Otter faintly droned overhead, the sound barely beating out the rustling leaves of a nearby tree, as 11 people listened intently from a back patio in south Longmont on Saturday afternoon.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28037572:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-02T19:41:16-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28037572/ears-sky-judge-visits-2-homes-longmont-airplane", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0502/20150502__03TCASITEw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Twin Otter faintly droned overhead, the sound barely beating out the rustling leaves of a nearby tree, as 11 people listened intently from a back patio in south Longmont on Saturday afternoon.", "title": "With ears to the sky, judge visits 2 homes in Longmont airplane-noise lawsuit"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Twin Otter faintly droned overhead, the sound barely beating out the rustling leaves of a nearby tree, as 11 people listened intently from a back patio in south Longmont on Saturday afternoon.", "title": "With ears to the sky, judge visits 2 homes in Longmont airplane-noise lawsuit", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28037572/ears-sky-judge-visits-2-homes-longmont-airplane", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0502/20150502__03TCASITEw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-02T19:41:16-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-05-02T19:40:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "With ears to the sky, judge visits 2 homes in Longmont airplane-noise lawsuit", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0502/20150502__03TCASITEw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-02T19:44:56-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb96c\"", "article_summary": "Two of the people \u2014 attorney Anthony Leffert and Mile-Hi Skydiving employee Nate Banton \u2014 were there representing the defense in a high-profile lawsuit against the skydiving company.\nWhen they flew over for the judge on Saturday, the Mile-Hi planes were T-shaped dots in the sky.\nGibbs alleged Mile-Hi flew a different flight pattern for the judge.\nA screen shot from Webtrak (http://ems02.bksv.com/webtrak/den3) shows Gibbs' home and the flight paths of the two Mile-Hi Skydiving planes during Boulder County District Judge Judith LaBuda's visit Saturday afternoon.\nMile-Hi denied altering flight paths for the demonstration."}
