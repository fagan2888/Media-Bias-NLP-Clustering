That\u2019s about 7.9 percent of the state\u2019s population. In 2014, the first year of the exchange, state officials estimated based on a survey that the uninsured rate had gotten down to 4 percent. After the second full year, it\u2019s down to 3.8 percent, or about 137,000 individuals. That means an estimated 10,000 residents gained insured in 2015.\n\nThe U.S. Census survey found 6.9 percent of Connecticut residents were uninsured in 2014, but Acturus, the company that did the analysis for Access Health CT, said those self-reported numbers don\u2019t jibe with the hard data. They said when compared with actual data about how many residents received insurance through the exchange or Medicaid expansion the number is closer to 3.8 percent.\n\nEither way the number of uninsured in Connecticut is going down.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for Connecticut,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, who co-chairs the Access Health CT Board of Directors.\n\nThe goal going into the third year of enrollment will be to retain the customers Access Health CT already has and find the dwindling population of uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everybody who can afford health care can get on,\u201d Wyman said.\n\nAccess Health CT CEO James Wadleigh said the second year was \u201ctricky because you have people coming on and off the exchange and those uninsured residents are harder to find and enroll.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not a complaint, because the numbers are going in the right direction, Wadleigh said.\n\nWho are these 3.8 percent?\n\nChris Barnes, senior vice president of Acturus the company which determined the uninsured rate, said a large portion of those uninsured are at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale. But it\u2019s not easy to pinpoint why they are uninsured.\n\n\u201cThey often are uninsured for idiosyncratic reasons,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd the remaining are part of a churn population.\u201d\n\nHe said they continue to run into people who explain they didn\u2019t sign up because they thought their circumstances would be different. He used the example of a woman who was planning to get married and thought she would be on her husband\u2019s insurance plan, but they ended up not tying the knot.\n\nIn general, if you\u2019re someone who had always had insurance through an employer, you\u2019re not paying attention to the marketing Access Health is doing, Barnes said.\n\nWadleigh said they are finding individuals here and there without insurance, but tracking down those individuals in the community is a lot harder today than it was in 2013.\n\nHe said the number of uninsured is significant because it helps inform the organization\u2019s decisions regarding marketing and operations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pride there,\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\nWadleigh said the goal in the first few years of the exchange was to lower the uninsured rate, but as more and more residents get insured, that goal is going to change.\n\nThe new goals may revolve around: \u201cHow do we get to health care literacy? How do we get to primary care physician utilization?\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\nViewed as a pyramid, the bottom is enrollment, but the top \u201cis a healthier Connecticut,\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\nIn 2014, the exchange enrolled about 110,000 residents and saw a 14 percent attrition rate. Wadleigh said he anticipated 105,000 to 115,000 residents will enroll for 2016. He expects enrollment to be on the higher end of that range since the fine for not being insured is bigger than it has been in the past.\n\nUnder the terms of the federal Affordable Care Act, if an individual or family doesn\u2019t have insurance in 2016, they will have to pay a fine equal to 2.5 percent of their annual income, or a maximum of $695 per adult. The maximum family penalty is $2,085. It is assessed through the federal income tax return filing process.\n\nEnrollment for 2016 begins on Nov. 1.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/uninsured_rate_falls_to_3.8_percent_in_2015/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, according to an analysis provided to Access Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "title": "Connecticut Uninsured Rate Falls To 3.8 Percent In 2015 | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a66\"", "article_summary": "by Christine Stuart | Oct 15, 2015 1:43pm Google( ) Comments | Commenting has expiredPosted to: Health Care, InsuranceConnecticut\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, according to an analysis provided to Access Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nChris Barnes, senior vice president of Acturus the company which determined the uninsured rate, said a large portion of those uninsured are at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale.\nIn 2012, the Kaiser Family Foundation found there were about 286,000 uninsured residents in Connecticut.\nIn 2014, the first year of the exchange, state officials estimated based on a survey that the uninsured rate had gotten down to 4 percent.\nViewed as a pyramid, the bottom is enrollment, but the top \u201cis a healthier Connecticut,\u201d Wadleigh said."}
