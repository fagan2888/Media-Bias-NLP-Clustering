There are recipients on both sides of the aisle.\n\nHere we go (in no particular order):\n\n1. President Obama: \u201cI didn\u2019t call the Islamic State a \u2018JV\u2019 team.\u201d\n\nThis statement from the President can be proven wrong by simply looking at the transcript from the interview with The New Yorker, wherein he clearly said it.\n\n2. Rand Paul: \u201cJohn McCain met with Islamic State terrorists.\u201d\n\nRand Paul\u2019s assertion was proven to be absolutely false. On this one, WaPo regretted that Four Pinocchios is the highest level rating they give for falsehoods.\n\n3. President Obama: \u201cRepublicans have filibustered 500 pieces of legislation.\u201d\n\nNo, Mr. President, it was closer to 50, about a tenth of the amount claimed.\n\n4. Paul Ryan: \u201cA boy didn\u2019t want a government lunch but one in a brown paper bag.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s source for this statement got it from a book. Oops. Ryan did say he regretted retelling the story.\n\n5. Alison Lundergan Grimes: \u201cMitch McConnell took $600,000 from anti-coal groups.\u201d\n\nBy the time Alison Lundergan Grimes made this statement, previous accusations like this about McConnell had already earned four Pinocchios. It didn\u2019t help Grimes, as she was trounced in the November elections.\n\n6. David Perdue: \u201cMichelle Nunn funded organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d\n\nDespite this fully-debunked claim, David Perdue (R-GA) went on to win his Senate campaign against Nunn, daughter of long-time Senator Sam Nunn.\n\n7. Super-PAC Advertisement: \u201cRepublican cuts to Ebola research are killing people.\u201d\n\nThis Super-PAC ad was not only untrue, as George W. Bush actually increased public-health spending and both Democrats and Republicans have acted to cut federal spending, it ends with the inflammatory tagline, \u201cRepublican Cuts Kill.\u201d\n\n8. National Rifle Association: \u201cMary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.\u201d\n\nThis NRA ad was emotional in its content, showing an intruder breaking in a home after a mother had just put her baby to bed, but they later admitted that the bill Landrieu was supporting would have still allowed the mother to buy a gun for self-defense.\n\n9. Politicians talking about the Obamacare numbers.\n\nDick Durbin, Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, and John Boehner all earned 4 Pinocchios over the course of the year for various statements they made about enrollments and plan cancelations.\n\n10. Vladimir Putin: \u201cA referendum was held in Crimea in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin was not exempt from earning recognition. The referenced vote did not allow a choice against the motion, and resistance to it was repressed.\n\nThese are indeed whoppers of epic proportions. Rest assured, there\u2019ll be plenty of options to choose from next year this time, too.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "Did these folks KNOW their noses were growing at the time?", "published_at": "2014-12-16T12:53:12+00:00", "author": "Michael Hausam", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "Did these folks KNOW their noses were growing at the time?", "title": "WaPo Reveals Top 10 Political Lies of 2014, and People Really Outdid Themselves This Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 797, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/disney-pinocchio9-nose1.jpg", "height": 471}, "updated_time": "2014-12-16T13:55:43-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2014/12/216769-wapos-list-biggest-political-lies/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Did these folks KNOW their noses were growing at the time?", "creator": "@MPHaus", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/disney-pinocchio9-nose1.jpg", "title": "WaPo Reveals Top 10 Political Lies of 2014, and People Really Outdid Themselves This Year", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 216769, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-16T12:53:12-04:00", "wp-categories": "14101 1471", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Politics", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2014/12/216769-wapos-list-biggest-political-lies/", "wp-category-slugs": "editors-choice, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Editor's Choice", "published_time": "2014-12-16T12:53:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T13:55:43-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MPHaus.US/"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/disney-pinocchio9-nose1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "President Obama: \u201cRepublicans have filibustered 500 pieces of legislation.\u201dNo, Mr. President, it was closer to 50, about a tenth of the amount claimed.\nWell, WaPo just released their list of the top Pinocchios of the year, and it\u2019s something to behold.\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The Washington Post coined the political fact-check phrase \u201cPinocchios\u201d for untrue statements, whether they appear in a campaign advertisement or are spoken by an elected official.\nOn this one, WaPo regretted that Four Pinocchios is the highest level rating they give for falsehoods.\nFor example, 2013\u2019s \u2018Pinocchio of the Year\u2019 was the President\u2019s \u201cif you want to keep your plan\u2026\u201d claim."}
