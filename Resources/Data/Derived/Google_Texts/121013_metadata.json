That can potentially get people in trouble because they can traverse steep slopes that would be difficult to do on a snowmobile,\u201d said Bolin, whose Yamaha dealership in Kalispell, Mont., has sold more than 120 Timbersled snowbike conversion kits in recent years. \u201cYou are able to just putt along in steep terrain that could potentially be dangerous avalanche terrain.\u201d\n\nSnowmobilers who heard the avalanche around 11 a.m. Friday on the heavily trafficked east-facing slope quickly scanned the avalanche debris with their transceivers but did not pick up a signal. The group informed a Chaffee County search-and-rescue team training in the area and those searchers found Brabander buried about six feet deep, according to a preliminary report by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. A piece of the snowbike was visible in the debris.\n\n\u201cI had to ask what it was,\u201d said Chaffee County Sheriff John Spezze. \u201cI pictured him pedaling the thing.\u201d\n\nForecasters with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center investigated the scene on Friday. Their initial analysis indicates either Brabander was not carrying avalanche rescue equipment or, if he was wearing an avalanche beacon, it was not working or turned on.\n\nThey ranked the slide \u2014 which stretched almost 1,300 feet across the ridge near the summit of Cottonwood Pass \u2014 as an R2D2, which means it was relatively small for the size of the slide path and while not large enough to gouge the landscape, level a building or break trees, it was powerful enough to bury a person.\n\nEthan Greene, the executive director of the center, said he has seen snowbikes around the state but not many.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get into complex terrain on of those machines than a snowmobile,\u201d Greene said. \u201cOne person referred to them as the fat skis of snowmobiling.\u201d\n\nWide powder skis have enabled skiers to venture deeper into steep backcountry terrain earlier in the season. The broad, floating skis are easy to use with a slight learning curve, not unlike snowbikes.\n\n\u201cThat poses a concern for me as a retailer knowing that a person who might be more of a dirt biker without much snowmobile experience can walk into the shop, buy this thing and get onto crazy avalanche slopes in less than 20 minutes,\u201d Bolin said.\n\nLast year, snowmobile pioneer Polaris Industries Inc., a powersports Goliath with $4.5 billion in annual sales last year, acquired Idaho\u2019s private Timbersled, a market leader in the blossoming snow bike industry.\n\n\u201cWith Polaris\u2019 financial backing, this sport is not going to get any smaller,\u201d said Bolin, who first rode a Timbersled in 2012. \u201cOnce people swing a leg over one of these, they absolutely cannot believe how fun it is. We are seeing more and more of these things every day.\u201d\n\nOf the 18 avalanche fatalities reported so far in the U.S. for the 2015-16 season, six have involved motorized riders. Snowmobile avalanche deaths vary, from as few as 1 of the 24 total avalanche fatalities in the country in 2012-13 to as many as 17 of the 36 total avalanche fatalities counted in 2009-10.\n\nBut three of Colorado\u2019s four avalanche fatalities this season have involved snowmachines. That\u2019s more than any other state.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unusual for Colorado,\u201d Greene said. \u201cColorado typically has less motorized accidents than the rest of the country but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case this year,\u201d Greene said.\n\nMore troubling for Greene is the number of solo backcountry travelers involved in accidents this season. Two of Colorado\u2019s avalanche fatalities this season \u2014 Brabander and Denver\u2019s Todd Musselman, who was killed in an avalanche while hiking near St. Mary\u2019s Glacier last month \u2013 involved solo travelers.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve had a couple close calls with people traveling by themselves that could easily have been fatal accidents,\u201d said Greene, noting four more solo travelers have been killed by avalanches this season in Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and California. \u201cIt seems like we are seeing more people traveling by themselves.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins\n\nTotal avalanche fatalities in the U.S. / Number of snowmobile avalanche fatalities\n\n2015-16: 18 / 6 (As of Feb. 6)\n\n2014-15 : 11 / 2\n\n2013-14: 35 / 11\n\n2012-13: 24 /1\n\n2011-12: 34 /9\n\n2010-11: 25 /4\n\n2009-10: 36 /17\n\n2008-09: 27/16\n\n2007-08: 36 /13\n\n2006-07: 20/10\n\nSource: Colorado Avalanche Information Center.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Snowbike avalanche fatality is first-ever for Colorado", "title": "Snowbike avalanche fatality is first-ever for Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/snowbike-avalanche-fatality-is-first-ever-for-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205_095638_Fatal-Avalanche-1.jpg", "height": 405}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205_095638_Fatal-Avalanche-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T09:12:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T05:45:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The death of Brabander marks the first-ever snowbike avalanche fatality in Colorado and, according to avalanche accident records, the second-ever in the country.\nSnowmobile avalanche deaths vary, from as few as 1 of the 24 total avalanche fatalities in the country in 2012-13 to as many as 17 of the 36 total avalanche fatalities counted in 2009-10.\n\u201cI pictured him pedaling the thing.\u201dForecasters with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center investigated the scene on Friday.\nTwo of Colorado\u2019s avalanche fatalities this season \u2014 Brabander and Denver\u2019s Todd Musselman, who was killed in an avalanche while hiking near St. Mary\u2019s Glacier last month \u2013 involved solo travelers.\nBut three of Colorado\u2019s four avalanche fatalities this season have involved snowmachines."}
