The elder Cuomo pioneered the notion that politicians could be personally pro-life while in all other ways pro-choice. In his famous (infamous to some) 1984 speech at the University of Notre Dame, he advised the Roman Catholic Church to be \u201crealistic\u201d on abortion in the same way the church had been in the 19th century on the issue of slavery.\n\n\u201cIt is a mark of contemporary liberalism\u2019s commitment to abortion,\u201d Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in his book, The Party of Death, \u201cthat one of its leading lights should have been willing to support temporizing on slavery in order to defend it.\u201d\n\nAs many pro-lifers suspected, being \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d to abortion but supportive of it in every legal and political way was always something of a rhetorical safe harbor rather than a serious intellectual position. In the time span of one generation, as the political climate became more supportive of abortion \u2014 as it has in New York, thanks in part to the diligent work of the \u201cpersonally\u201d pro-life Cuomos \u2014 the once-safe harbor of personal opposition to abortion is closed, at least rhetorically.\n\nOf course, liberal intolerance isn\u2019t rhetorical or limited to hot-button issues; it is woven into mainstream liberal policymaking. The Supreme Court is now pondering whether nuns \u2014 celibate, elderly nuns \u2014 have the right to opt out of Obamacare\u2019s birth-control requirements.\n\nNew York City recently banned the use of e-cigarettes indoors as yet another \u201canti-tobacco\u201d measure (in the words of Reuters), even though \u201cvaping\u201d involves no smoke, no tobacco, and is often an invaluable tool for quitting real cigarettes. The real driver of the ban is the smug intolerance of a New York City Council that sees no reason to accommodate people who want to live in ways it disapproves of.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just policymaking either. Liberalism has a culture all its own. From cities like New York; Madison, Wis.; and San Francisco to countless college campuses in between, that culture can produce people as judgmental as the old church lady character from Saturday Night Live.
