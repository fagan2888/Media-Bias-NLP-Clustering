There\u2019s this fellow, Putin, over there in Russia, he told attendees at a speech in Berlin on Tuesday ahead of visits to Poland and Estonia. And guess what? Jeb Bush simply does not care for this Vladimir Putin guy. Some really bold foreign policy stuff here \u2014 though oddly enough, one area where his foreign policy judgment may differ from that of his brother.\n\nSo Jeb Bush hates Putin and wants to check Russian regional aggression, got it. He does not believe that the Obama administration is doing enough to show Putin that there will be consequences to Russia violating the territorial sovereignty of its neighbors, got it. If he is President, Jeb Bush will stand up to Vladimir Putin, by doing various unspecified things! Got it?\n\n\u201cPutin, [Bush said], must know in advance that there will be consequences to his actions,\u201d the AP writes, \u201cbecause the Russian president is a ruthless pragmatist who \u2018will push until someone pushes back.'\u201d Indeed, this is the precise psychological diagnosis that practically every person in the world has made of Vladimir Putin \u2014 including the current spineless president, Barack Obama. So what does Bush want to do differently re: Putin? He wants to impose sanctions on Russia until it curbs its abuses! As in\u2026 the precise path that the Obama administration is following now.\n\nBush was critical of what he termed a reactive approach to crisis in Eastern Europe by the Obama administration. But his prescriptions were largely along the lines of what the U.S. is already doing, primarily pushing economic sanctions on Russia and sending military equipment and economic aid to Ukraine.\n\nThis, of course, came just after Obama visited Germany himself and dangled the threat of tougher sanctions before Russia.\n\nThis is only the most recent example of a Republican presidential candidate criticizing the Obama administration for not taking a hard enough line, and then pledging to take a harder line that\u2019s more or less exactly what the Obama administration is already doing. (Plus a few extra touches, like boldly calling for Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO, which continues to not seem like a good or properly thought-out idea.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his final pre-campaign tuneup, Jeb is pledging to impose sanctions on Russia.
