In return, researchers will obtain key data that can be used to better understand the origins of complex diseases that have a combination of causes, like heart disease, cancer, and alcohol abuse.\n\nSince the survey's official launch Tuesday, over 1,100 people have already participated in the questionnaires that ask about things like sleep, mood, and exercise. Vrieze noted that, thus far, there's been a bias toward young female respondents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the survey, those who participate at-length will also be eligible to receive a spit kit to use to provide a saliva sample for genetic analysis. Currently, researchers have enough funding to test the samples from 20,000 individuals \u2014 but if the project shows promising results, they hope to be able garner enough support to test an additional 80,000 kits.\n\nWhile the issue with such ambitious genetic research used to lie in a lack of available manpower and resources to test so many DNA kits, the issue is now attracting enough interest in the projects, said Goncalo Abecasis, chair of the University of Michigan School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics.\n\n\"Over time the genetic part of the study has gotten easier, but now the challenge is how can we enroll enough people so we can ask all the interesting questions we'd like about their DNA,\" he said.\n\nEarly on in the study's conceptualization, Facebook emerged as an easy solution. Now, instead of interviewing participants one-on-one in a short amount of time, researchers can ask a few questions each day about an individual's dietary choices or sleep schedule.\n\n\"It's hard to get a good idea of something like diet if we ask what it was like over the past year, as opposed to asking simple questions on a daily basis like, 'Did you skip breakfast this morning?'\" explained Abecasis.\n\nBoth Vrieze and Abecasis also pointed to Facebook's existing integration in most people's daily schedules as the reason for its adoption. If they had hosted the surveys on a separate site, it's unlikely they would receive repeat business.\n\nThough personal DNA testing isn't a new idea \u2014 several commercial enterprises will conduct a gene profile for a fee \u2014 Vrieze said their approach is novel as the data they collect will be widely available to other researchers looking to learn more about diseases and disorders.\n\n\"We don't think of it as our data, we want to give the data back to the scientific community so it can be used widely,\" he concluded.\n\nTo participate in the project, visit apps.facebook.com/genesforgood.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27850255/cu-boulder-professor-assists-marrying-social-media-genetic", "sailthru.author": "By Gloria Dickie \n  For the Camera", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27850255:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-05T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "If you've ever wondered whether you're predisposed to depression, addiction issues, or even diabetes, there's now an app for that.", "title": "CU-Boulder professor assists in marrying social media, genetic sleuthing", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27850255/cu-boulder-professor-assists-marrying-social-media-genetic", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-04-05T09:47:59-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-04T14:33:37-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Gloria DickieFor", "pubDate": "2015-04-04T14:42:49-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-05T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder professor assists in marrying social media, genetic sleuthing", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "If you've ever wondered whether you're predisposed to depression, addiction issues, or even diabetes, there's now an app for that.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27850255/cu-boulder-professor-assists-marrying-social-media-genetic", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "If you've ever wondered whether you're predisposed to depression, addiction issues, or even diabetes, there's now an app for that.", "title": "CU-Boulder professor assists in marrying social media, genetic sleuthing"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2c4\"", "article_summary": "Genes for Good is a large-scale research study based out of the University of Michigan that aims to involve tens of thousands of people in genetic research using one simple tool \u2014Facebook.\nBy answering health-related questions through the Facebook application, participants can learn more about their health, behavior, and ancestors.\nBoth Vrieze and Abecasis also pointed to Facebook's existing integration in most people's daily schedules as the reason for its adoption.\nSince the survey's official launch Tuesday, over 1,100 people have already participated in the questionnaires that ask about things like sleep, mood, and exercise.\nNow, instead of interviewing participants one-on-one in a short amount of time, researchers can ask a few questions each day about an individual's dietary choices or sleep schedule."}
