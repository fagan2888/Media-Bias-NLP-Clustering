He also reflects on his position on a range of issues, including immigration, filibusters, and Obamacare.McConnell emphasized his intention to work with the White House and Senate Democrats, a theme he echoed in his remarks Tuesday night following his victory.\"The first thing we need to do is be a constructive, right of center governing majority in the House and Senate,\" he said in the interview, adding that a priority for 2016 would be maintaining the majority.He added, \"Obviously, winning the White House is the most important thing and I think we\u2019re going to have a good shot at it.\"He gave a list of other top priorities where he thought there would be a bipartisan majority to approve, including the Keystone XL pipeline and repealing Obamacare's medical device tax and the individual mandate.McConnell declined to comment on whether Republicans would reverse the rules put in place by Democrats last year that prevents members from filibustering presidential nominees; the so-called \"nuclear option\" invoked by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid to force through appointments in the face of GOP opposition.\"Also, we're going to want to see what kind of things we might be able to agree on with the president. After all, he's going to be there for two more years,\" he said. \"I'll give you a couple of examples where there may be areas of agreement: comprehensive tax reform and trade agreements.\"McConnell refused to make a prediction on what would happen with immigration reform, saying, \"We're going to discuss that after the election,\" and said another government shutdown would not happen on his watch.\"There is no possibility of a government shutdown. Remember me? I'm the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns,\" he said jokingly.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "McConnell, Obama, Time Magazine, cover, change", "pubdate": "2014-11-05T11:42:16", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Time magazine on Wednesday released a preview of its next cover featuring a picture of new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with the slogan \"Change,\" a redesign of the iconic 2008 political poster of President Barack Obama entitled \"Hope.\"", "title": "Time Magazine Cover: McConnell's 'Change' Replaces Obama's 'Hope'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/McConnell-Obama-Time-Magazine-cover/2014/11/05/id/605414/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/McConnell-Obama-Time-Magazine-cover/2014/11/05/id/605414/", "description": "Time magazine on Wednesday released a preview of its next cover featuring a picture of new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with the slogan \"Change,\" a redesign of the iconic 2008 political poster of President Barack Obama entitled \"Hope.\"", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Time Magazine Cover: McConnell's 'Change' Replaces Obama's 'Hope'"}, "epoch": 1415187736, "keywords": "McConnell, Obama, Time Magazine, cover, change", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-11-05T11:42:16"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/McConnell-Obama-Time-Magazine-cover/2014/11/05/id/605414/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Time Magazine on Wednesday released a preview of its next cover featuring a picture of new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with the slogan  Change,  a redesign of the iconic 2008 political poster of President Barack Obama entitled  Hope."}, "article_summary": "\"I'll give you a couple of examples where there may be areas of agreement: comprehensive tax reform and trade agreements.\nTime magazine on Wednesday released a preview of its next cover featuring a picture of new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with the slogan \"Change,\" a redesign of the iconic 2008 political poster of President Barack Obama entitled \"Hope.\n\"Also, we're going to want to see what kind of things we might be able to agree on with the president.\nHe also reflects on his position on a range of issues, including immigration, filibusters, and Obamacare.McConnell emphasized his intention to work with the White House and Senate Democrats, a theme he echoed in his remarks Tuesday night following his victory.\nI'm the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns,\" he said jokingly."}
