A Maize family is cleaning up broken glass from their home after a deer crashed through their front window.

"We live in a neighborhood with lots of houses and windows and it chooses this exact window in the middle of the day no less," said Debbie Arens, "it's just shocking."

Arens was on pulling into her driveway with her daughter when they noticed the broken window.

"I assumed one of the neighbor kids had kick a ball accidentally...so I asked the neighbor kids what happened," Arens said.

Raequan Benfred lives next door to the Arnes Family and witnessed the deer hit the home.

"I didn't do a thing. It was the deer that came and did it," Benfred said.

The deer left evidence of its entry: fur was left in the home and on the window, and there was also blood on the outside of the home.

Inside the home was only minor damage and many pieces of broken glass.

"There is just glass everywhere. It was a lot to pick up. We vacuum and we still see glass," said 17-year-old Lily McClaren.

The deer was last seen running away along the street.
