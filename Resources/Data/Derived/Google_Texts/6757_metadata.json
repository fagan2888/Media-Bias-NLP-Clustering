It\u2019s especially tricky, since many of these disorders overlap and seem to play off one another.\n\nAccording to a study published in Psychiatry, a large number of bipolar patients (up to 69 percent) are misdiagnosed initially, and up to one-third remain misdiagnosed for a long time afterward. Many bipolar patients are first diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressants \u2014 which can actually be dangerous to bipolar patients, since they can induce hypomania and trigger the mania to depression cycle over and over again.\n\n\u201cMissing the diagnosis of bipolar illness is all too common in clinical practice with devastating consequences for patients and families,\u201d said Dr. Prakash Masand, CEO of Global Medical Education.\n\nBipolar disorder is often confused with borderline personality disorder, so here are the things you should look out for if you or someone you care about is experiencing these muddled symptoms.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nPeople who suffer from borderline personality disorder (BPD) have severe difficulties in regulating their emotions, which often leads to mood swings, impulsiveness, and unstable personal relationships (\u201cI love you!\u201d turns into \u201cI hate you!\u201d quite quickly). In addition to destructive mood swings, BPD patients typically have a very low sense of self-esteem and self-worth, which is manifested in suicidal tendencies like cutting or harming themselves.\n\nThey also tend to have a fear of abandonment by family or friends, impulsive behaviors such as reckless spending or driving, and intense moods comprised of anger, depression, or irritability that can last days. The cause of BPD is unknown, but researchers speculate that it\u2019s likely a number of factors, such as genetics, environment, and brain function.\n\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1.6 percent of Americans have BPD, but it\u2019s likely that number can be as high as 5.9 percent, as there may be undiagnosed or undocumented cases. Interestingly, most of the cases have been among women (75 percent of people diagnosed with BPD are female), but it\u2019s also likely that BPD in males has been mistaken for depression, PTSD, or other mental illnesses. Thus many men may have BPD without a real diagnosis.\n\nBipolar Disorder\n\nBipolar disorder shares many of these symptoms \u2014 the seemingly reckless behavior, mood swings, and impulsiveness. However, the major defining factor of bipolar disorder involves extreme highs and lows in mood; the former is called euphoria, which involves feelings of excitement, extremely high energy, and grandiosity. Low points are the opposite of mania, characterized by days of deep depression and fatigue, with an inability to focus or be productive. A bipolar person will go from being delusional about having powers, to feeling completely hopeless and empty.\n\nExperts note that one of the main differentiating factors between bipolar and borderline personality disorder is that symptoms of personality disorder are pretty consistent and ongoing, while people with bipolar disorder appear to have \u201cbreaks\u201d between their extreme mood swings, in which they experience a mid-range mood where most of the symptoms that are confusing between the two disorders (impulsivity, anger, irritability, extreme emotion) aren\u2019t present.\n\nSecondly, turning to personal relationships can help clarify the difference between the two disorders. According to psychotherapy Russ Federman, writing in Psychology Today, \u201call personality disorder issues manifest in relation to interpersonal relationships.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s likely that personality disorder symptoms may be triggered by conflict within relationships, while bipolar symptoms usually appear out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cWhile there is some overlap here with bipolar disorder in the sense that interpersonal stresses may activate a shift in mood phase, bipolar individuals will also tell you that there are times when the onset of their symptoms, whether elevated or depressed, will seem to come out of nowhere,\u201d Federman writes. \u201cThere is no obvious trigger or precipitant for their mood destabilization. The only reliable explanation is that there\u2019s been an endogenous shift in their brain activity and their neurochemistry.\u201d\n\nPreventing Misdiagnosis\n\nWhile there\u2019s currently no biological factor to test for to diagnose these mental disorders, researchers have been working on ways to detect bipolar disorder earlier than before. Family history can be quite telling and is one of the factors a doctor will screen for when diagnosing bipolar patients. One recent study found that glimpsing \u201csubthreshold manic episodes\u201d \u2014 symptoms that reflect but don\u2019t manifest bipolar disorder completely \u2014 in children of people who have bipolar disorder is a good way to detect it earlier on in people who might be at a higher risk.\n\nThe quicker people with bipolar disorder \u2014 or borderline personality disorder, or other mental illnesses \u2014 can be diagnosed correctly, the quicker effective treatment can be administered. Misdiagnosed patients have a higher risk of worsened symptoms, complications from the disorder or mistreatment, or suicide.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, education about mental illness can help prevent misdiagnoses, as people who are experiencing mood swings or depressive symptoms can be on the lookout for specific features of bipolar disorder (such as the euphoria vs. depression swings) in themselves.
