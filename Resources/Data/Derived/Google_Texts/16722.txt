Santa's revving for Christmas, but he's leaving his sleigh behind in favor of a reindeer-less option. It might be an unusual sight to see, but the Bikers United for Children Toy Run is an annual event that brings in a big crowd. Each year, bikers in the area bring in a toy, and ride over to deliver them to children in need. This is the fourth annual Toy Run for these bikers, and organizer say it's growing more and more each year.

"The word is getting out. More people are coming," head coordinator Billy Tisdale says. "They're coming from a longer distance to come ride with us. Seems like they enjoy it. Last year was kind of cold. This year, we thought we were going to have bad weather, but it turned out to be beautiful so far."

The bikers rode with their load of toys over to College Park United Methodist Church, where they will all be delivered to the Wesley House. Leading the way for this Toy Run was none other than the big man in red, himself.

"These children, unless we do something for them, they won't have much," Santa Claus says. "It's amazing to watch the kids, the look in their eyes whenever they get something. Whether it's a teddy bear or a toy truck or anything."

Organizers say bikers brought in hundreds of toys with around 1,000 already delivered from other agencies. They hope to see it continue to grow in years to come.
