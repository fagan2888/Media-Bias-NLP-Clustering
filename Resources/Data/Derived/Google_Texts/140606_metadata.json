When you think about where our forced dues go \u2014 we\u2019re not a right-to-work state, so we have to pay \u2014 it really starts to make you upset,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn many Ohio schools, teachers like Thompson who opt out of OEA membership are required to pay \u201cfair share\u201d fees to the union to have a job. Thompson has to pay OEA and its affiliates $600 per year.\n\nRELATED: Ohio law forces teachers to fund left-wing union politics\n\nGreg Lawson, a policy analyst for the free-market Buckeye Institute, told Ohio Watchdog teachers should expect transparency and accountability for OEA\u2019s spending.\n\n\u201cIt is legitimate for rank and file union members to question these salaries and ask what exactly it is that they are getting in return for the money that is involuntarily pulled out of their pockets,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nMany of the union\u2019s expenditures, Lawson added, \u201cdo nothing to advance the individual union members\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen not funding fat paychecks for leadership, they often go to fund special interest political efforts that frequently conflict with individuals\u2019 beliefs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Buckeye Institute is a longtime supporter of making Ohio a right-to-work state, which would give every worker the ability to choose whether to pay a labor union.\n\nIn fiscal 2015, the 10 highest-paid OEA officers and employees were:\n\nBecky Higgins, President: $209,039 Sheryl Mathis, Executive Director: $207,790 Scott DiMauro, Vice President: $191,934 Tim Myers, Secretary-Treasurer: $187,911 Kevin Flanagan, Assistant Executive Director: $178,686 Christina Munoz-Nedrow, Regional Director: $177,963 Kristy Spires, Assistant Executive Director: $176,640 Susan Babcock, Assistant Executive Director: $174,771 Linda Fiely, General Counsel: $168,475 Jeanette Cooper, Regional Director: $165,684\n\nIncluding gross salaries and other disbursements, a total of 41 OEA officers and employees were paid more than $150,000.
