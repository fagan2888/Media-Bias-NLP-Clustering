A day ago, Politico reported that incoming House GOP whip Rep. Steve Scalise uses the services of a Washington lobbyist, John Feehery, to help vet potential staffers. Ethical concerns were raised! (E.g., would Feehery, a former leadership aide, help hire people who would then owe him [duh] and maybe help him gain access for his clients?) A \u201cnon-story,\u201d tweeted a New York Times reporter. But the real story was buried on Feehery\u2019s blog. Scalise, it seems, has sought out the counsel of someone filled with a sophomoric rage against the Tea Party faction that forms one backbone of the GOP caucus Scalise aspires to help lead. Here\u2019s a passage from Feehery\u2019s blog post,\u201dThe Tea Party Must Be Crushed\u201d (I\u2019m afraid the title gives it away):\n\nBut today\u2019s Tea Party has morphed into something far different. It has become a collection of wing-nuts, racists, hucksters, extremists, con-men and front-men, who collaborate with Hollywood and left-wing organizations to plot the demise of Republicans in good standing, .\n\nI know what you are thinking: You are thinking maybe Feehery is not talking about immigration when he accuses Tea Partiers of being \u201cracist.\u201d Or maybe he\u2019s just talking about self-appointed Tea Party leaders. No such luck. The Atlantic\u2018s Molly Ball points to this equally level-headed Feehery blog post (\u201cTea Party Treachery\u201d) from February:\n\nThey hate common core standards. Hate Obamacare. Hate extending the debt limit. Hate reopening the government. Hate the NSA. Hate immigrants. Hate the establishment. Hate big corporations. Hate Labor. Hate the Federal Reserve. Hate foreigners. Hate. Hate. Hate. \u2013\n\nNow, Feehery explicitly endorsed \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d in a July, 2013 Ball piece (\u201cMarco Rubio and Paul Ryan get it\u201d) which is fine. But he characterized its opponents in sneering terms that suggest some sort of projection. From Ball:\n\nThe debate over Republicans\u2019 approach to immigration has largely focused on politics\u2014on whether and how the party will be able to woo Hispanic voters in the next presidential election. But the intra-party psychodrama is bigger than that. It\u2019s about whether the pragmatists can seize the reins of the Republican Party, or whether the angry, oppositionist, populist strain retains control. (Feehery calls them \u201cthe haters,\u201d and sees them as the heirs to the Know-Nothings who tried to keep out his Irish ancestors.) [E.A.]\n\nDoes Scalise share these views? If his spokesman denied it now, would you believe him? Legislators who opposed Rubio and Ryan\u2019s immigration plans comprise a good chunk of Scalise\u2019s caucus, after all. Does he consider them \u201chaters\u201d? Legislators who opposed voting on Rubio and Ryan\u2019s plans \u2013whether because they don\u2019t like them or just questioned the timing \u2014 constitute a solid majority of Scalise\u2019s caucus. Are they under the sway of \u201cracists, hucksters, extremists\u201d and \u201ccon men\u201d? Are they racists themselves? And if Scalise, per Feehery\u2019s screed, is going to weed out Republican representatives who \u201chate Obamacare\u201d \u2014 well, he\u2019s not going to have much of a caucus left.\n\nScalise could hardly have picked a more divisive figure to advise him, at least this side of talk radio. Feehery even called for the 12 Republicans who didn\u2019t vote for Boehner as Speaker to be \u201cousted from the party.\u201d (\u201cLet the Tea Party start their own Party.\u201d) Nor would it seem that flopping all over the landscape picking attention-getting fights is the best model for running a Leadership \u201ccommunications\u201d shop \u2014 though it\u2019s a proven route to blog success, I will give Feehery that. In any case, we may now have a clue as to why Scalise blew his first whip count (which was of the immigration/border bill) \u2014 he was reluctant to deal with the people in his own caucus whom he or those around him found distasteful. Unfortunately there were enough of them to deny him a majority.\n\nThe Republican caucus elected this guy.
