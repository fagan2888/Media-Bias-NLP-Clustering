Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, came just two days after he told Congress that the United States would consider dispatching a modest number of American forces to fight with Iraqi troops against the terrorist group.\n\nThe Iraqi military and security forces, trained by the U.S. at the cost of billions of dollars, melted away in the face of the group\u2019s stunning offensive this summer, when it captured most of northern and western Iraq, including the country\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul.\n\nDempsey said Thursday that Iraqi forces were doing a better job now, although an effort to move into Mosul or to restore the border with Syria would require more complex operations.\n\nHe also told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee that the U.S. has a modest force in Iraq now and that \u201cany expansion of that, I think, would be equally modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent,\u201d he said.\n\nDempsey\u2019s spokesman, Air Force Col. Ed Thomas, said the general planned to visit U.S. troops, commanders and Iraqi leaders. \u201cThe primary purpose of his visit is to get a firsthand look at the situation in Iraq, receive briefings and get better sense of how the campaign is progressing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe visit included talks with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and U.S. Ambassador Stuart E. Jones, Thomas said.\n\nDempsey later flew to Irbil, capital of Iraq\u2019s largely autonomous northern Kurdish region, where he met with Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.\n\nDempsey also visited the U.S. joint operations center in Irbil, got a briefing on the Kurdish offensive against the Islamic State group and held a town hall with deployed troops there, Thomas said.\n\nThe Pentagon has plans to establish an expeditionary advise-and-assist center in Irbil where U.S. troops will provide assistance to Iraqi forces at the brigade and higher levels. The U.S. also is planning to set up a training site near Irbil.\n\nDempsey\u2019s visit comes a day after Iraqi forces drove Islamic State terrorists out of a strategic oil refinery town north of Baghdad, scoring their biggest battlefield victory yet.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Top U.S. general, Martin Dempsey, in Iraq to assess situation", "title": "Top U.S. general, Martin Dempsey, in Iraq to assess situation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/top-u-s-general-martin-dempsey-in-iraq-to-assess-situation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A2_ND16DEMPSEYp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A2_ND16DEMPSEYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T19:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:33:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Dempsey said Thursday that Iraqi forces were doing a better job now, although an effort to move into Mosul or to restore the border with Syria would require more complex operations.\nDempsey\u2019s spokesman, Air Force Col.
