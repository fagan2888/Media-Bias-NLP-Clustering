The USNS Millinocket, a high-speed transportation vessel, was delivered to the U.S. Navy on Friday, according to a prepared statement from Austal USA, the defense contractor that built the ship.

The 338-foot aluminum ship will be used by the Navy to transport troops, military vehicles and equipment, according to Austal’s website. It is one of 10 similar ships that Austal was commissioned to build for the U.S. Army and Navy. The USNS Millinocket is the third ship to be successfully completed in this $1.6 million project.

“USNS Millinocket was constructed by some of the finest shipbuilders in the country with incredible capabilities that will serve our combatant commanders and sailors well for many, many years to come,” Austal USA President Craig Perciavalle said in the prepared statement.

The ship has the ability to support humanitarian projects, disaster response efforts or maritime law enforcement activities, the statement said.
