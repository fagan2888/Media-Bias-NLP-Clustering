The focus of the campaign is somewhat of a departure from traditional anti-rape efforts, which have historically been criticized for putting most of the onus on young women to take steps to keep themselves safe.\n\nThe education campaign will be primarily focused on teaching students how to practice effective bystander intervention. \u201cIt\u2019s On Us\u201d encourages students to get involved in situations that seem to be headed in a potentially dangerous direction, like when someone at a party has been cornered by a person making aggressive sexual advances. Tips on the campaign\u2019s website include recognizing that intoxicated individuals cannot consent and remembering that victims should not be blamed.\n\n\u201cMost men are not comfortable with violence against women, but often don\u2019t speak out because they believe that other men accept this behavior,\u201d notes a White House fact sheet released on Friday. \u201cBy getting men involved, we can change this way of thinking and create new social norms.\u201d\n\nAn administration official told the Washington Post that the ultimate goal is to show Americans that sexual assault isn\u2019t an isolated incident of a crime perpetrated against a victim \u2014 but rather \u201ca cultural problem in which we all have a role to play.\u201d\n\nSexual assault prevention activists have long argued that addressing the issue of campus rape involves this type of cultural approach. \u201cDon\u2019t be friends with rapists,\u201d Alexandra Brodsky, one of the founders of Know Your IX, a survivor-led group working to address sexual assault, argued in Feministing earlier this year. \u201cMy honest belief is that social ostracism could do more than our current laws. My senior year, I saw a known repeat offender question his treatment of women for the first time because he wasn\u2019t invited to a big party thrown by one of his victim\u2019s friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s On Us\u201d is a result of the White House\u2019s new task force focused on addressing college sexual assault, an issue that has gained increasing prominence as student activists have filed dozens of federal complaints against their universities for allegedly failing to protect victims. From the beginning of the initiative, which was launched this past winter, the president has framed the issue in terms of what young men can do.\n\n\u201cI want every young man in America to feel some strong peer pressure, in terms of how they\u2019re supposed to behave and treat women,\u201d Obama said in January. \u201cThat starts before they get to college. Those of us who are fathers have an obligation to transmit that information. We can do more to make sure that every man out there \u2014 in junior high, high school, and college \u2014 understands what\u2019s expected of them, and what it means to be a man, and to intervene if they see someone else acting inappropriately.\u201d\n\nThe new education campaign is a project of Generation Progress, a division of the Center for American Progress. Leading sexual assault prevention organizations, as well as celebrities and sports players, have signed on as partners. And student leaders from almost 200 colleges and universities have agreed to bring \u201cIt\u2019s On Us\u201d to their campuses.\n\nCampus activists are glad to see so much national attention on the issue, and hope it will be paired with strong disciplinary policies and victim resources at schools. One of the biggest ongoing controversies in this area is the fact that university administrations don\u2019t always suspend or expel the students who have perpetrated sexual assault, leaving survivors forced to continue attending the same school as their rapist.
