A Douglass High School teacher accused of two counts of Indecent Exposure is now being investigated for throwing drug and alcohol parties with students at her SE OKC home.

Police arrested Victoria Dacalio on Tuesday after school officials notified them of an incident involving the 51-year-old Math teacher and an 18-year-old male student.

In early February Dacalio allegedly sent a lewd video of herself to the student, but claimed she meant to send the video to her husband. However, the student said Dacalio also sent him a lewd photograph of herself back in January as well.

During their investigation of the indecent exposure incident, detectives began hearing about two parties Dacalio allegedly held at her home. Police were told Dacalio provided a buffet of Marijuana products at the parties, including THC oil, and THC-laced chocolate and brownies, as well as alcohol.

Current students from both Douglass and Del City High Schools were said to be at the alleged party.
