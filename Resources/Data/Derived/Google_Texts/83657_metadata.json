It was the best sales year since 2007, when 5,820 homes were sold.\n\nThe average sales price of a home in the Peoria area last year was $145,898, a slight increase from $145,449, the average sales price in 2014.\n\nInterest rates played a big role in making 2015 a strong sales year, said PAAR president Becky Peterson. \u201cMany buyers were able to lock in 30-year fixed rates below 4 percent.\u201d\n\nThe year was a success despite a downturn in the fourth quarter, she said.\n\n\u201cWe lost a little steam in the fourth quarter when home sales were off by 4.1 percent (from last year). This might be attributed to some economic worries by some buyers (over issues) such as Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s announcement to reduce its workforce,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nThere were 210 new construction sales in 2015, down from 215 in 2014. \u201cWe expect to see more gains in new home construction this spring fueled by buyers looking for new housing inventory.\u201d\n\nOne of the big selling points for central Illinois real estate is its affordability, said Peterson, noting that 72 percent of homes sold in the Peoria area last year were priced less than $175,000.\n\n\u201cAffordable real estate is one of the biggest features for this area. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, made that point when he spoke here at a recent real estate conference,\u201d Peterson said.\n\n\u201cYun forecasts that home sales should rise nationally between 1 and 2 percent in 2016. He predicted that the median sale price of existing homes would rise by 5 percent this year.\u201d\n\nThough concerned about employment, the lack of a state budget and the stock market, the organization is cautiously optimistic about home sales in central Illinois this year, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pent-up demand, plus our inventory has dropped. It\u2019s a good time for those interested in making a move to get their home ready for market,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the end of December, there were 2,416 homes for sale in the Peoria market, down from 2,945 homes at the end of October.\n\nDespite an increase in interest rates, Peterson said buyers can still find good deals. Fannie Mae projects that a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will average 4.2 percent in 2016, but lower rates are also available, she said.\n\n\u201cI spoke to an area lender who said that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are still available at 3.75 percent, but a good credit score is needed,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nThe number of first-time home buyers nationally is at its lowest level in three decades, she said. Reasons for that decline include millennials facing large student loans, high rents and employment issues, Peterson said.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that Fannie Mae loans only require a 3 percent down payment, down from 5 percent \u2014 and it can be a gift. If parents or grandparents want to help young people out, it might make home ownership possible,\u201d she said.\n\nSteve Tarter is Journal Star business editor.
