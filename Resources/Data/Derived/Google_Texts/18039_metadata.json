Name: Guy Iverson Age: 52 Town: Chesterville Party: Democrat Profession: Walmart distribution center Education: Mt. Blue High School Political experience: three years Chesterville selectman Name: Russell Black Age: 61 Town: Wilton Party: Republican Profession: Farmer, logger Education: Mt. Blue High School, Wentworth Institute, Central Maine Vocational School Political experience: 19 years Wilton planning board, nine years Wilton selectman, two terms state representative Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nIverson said he became interested in running because, at the town level, there was little he could do to relieve their financial problems he sees as stemming from a decrease in sales taxes distributed to towns through the municipal revenue sharing program.\n\n\u201cI realized how little wiggle room we had financially without raising taxes,\u201d said Iverson.\n\nHis interest in politics grew from three years ago, when during one of his frequent trips to the town office the town clerk recommended that he run for a vacant selectman seat. Iverson said one of the highlights of his political career so far was supporting an ordinance that increased regulations to protect the town\u2019s water supply from contamination.\n\nIverson said politics have been shaped by experience both with the challenges of growing up in poverty and with working in a variety of businesses including as a self-employed sound engineer, a store operations manager and as a Jay police dispatcher.\n\nBlack, a self-employed logger and farmer, has a long history of government involvement, serving on the Franklin County budget committee, the Wilton planning board, the Wilton Selectboard and two terms as a state representative.\n\nBecause he represents a rural region, Black said he focuses much of his time in the Legislature on protecting natural resources vital to rural industries like tourism and hunting.\n\n\u201cA lot of my efforts go into protecting our natural resources, because we need to hang onto the jobs we\u2019ve got there,\u201d said Black.\n\nThe two both said they would like to restore cuts in municipal revenue sharing this session, with Black adding that one of the challenges will be to find a way to retain money shared with the municipalities without making harmful cuts or tax increases somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to return revenue sharing, you\u2019ve got to decrease something else or increase the revenue coming in. Somewhere, somehow, you\u2019ve got to pay for everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI fought hard to keep revenue sharing. In the end, it got cut because it was cut by a bipartisan budget in the 125th (Legislature). We restored more than a third of it in the 126th.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to whether to expand MaineCare under the Affordable Care Act, Iverson said he is in favor of the expansion.\n\n\u201cWe need to fully implement Obamacare. Are there areas that could be fixed? Yes, but in those three years, you don\u2019t wait until it expires. You get to work and see how can you fix this before it expires,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait until the financing runs out.\u201d\n\nTo address issues of poverty, Iverson said he would also be interested in a two-tiered minimum wage requirement, where a smaller business could pay a lower minimum wage than a larger corporation.\n\nHe said if they can\u2019t find ways to increase the wage, then the state will have to continue to pay out government benefits for those who can\u2019t get by on their low incomes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re making 15,000 a year, you\u2019re just not going to make it,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help shore up the state budget, Black said he is interested in looking for ways to reform welfare in a way that keeps spending under control but doesn\u2019t cut from those most in need.\n\nHe said he is not sure at this point how he would vote if a plan for MaineCare expansion is again brought for a vote. Black voted against expansion in the last session, but he said not before weighing costs and benefits of the bipartisan proposal.\n\n\u201cI looked at it long and hard. I was one of the last ones to vote against it,\u201d said Black. \u201cI struggled with that vote. I thought it was moving in the right direction, and I would look at a plan again if it came up for a vote.\u201d\n\nKaitlin Schroeder \u2014 861-9252\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russell Black, of Wilton, is running against Guy Iverson, of Chesterville, to represent their towns and Temple, New Vineyard and Industry.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Russell Black, of Wilton, is running against Guy Iverson, of Chesterville, to represent their towns and Temple, New Vineyard and Industry.", "title": "'Conservative Democrat' challenges incumbent Republican in Maine House District 114 - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iverson-black.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2014-10-17T21:10:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/17/conservative-democrat-challenges-incumbent-republican-in-maine-house-district-114/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iverson-black.jpg", "description": "Russell Black, of Wilton, is running against Guy Iverson, of Chesterville, to represent their towns and Temple, New Vineyard and Industry.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Conservative Democrat' challenges incumbent Republican in Maine House District 114 - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "House", "published_time": "2014-10-17T18:54:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T21:10:40-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e93\"", "article_summary": "A self-described conservative Democrat from Chesterville is challenging the Republican incumbent from Wilton in the race for House District 114 this election.\nAdditional Images Iverson | Black District 114 District 114 Chesterville, Industry, New Vineyard, Strong, Temple and Wilton.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to return revenue sharing, you\u2019ve got to decrease something else or increase the revenue coming in.\nBlue High School Political experience: three years Chesterville selectman Name: Russell Black Age: 61 Town: Wilton Party: Republican Profession: Farmer, logger Education: Mt.\nName: Guy Iverson Age: 52 Town: Chesterville Party: Democrat Profession: Walmart distribution center Education: Mt."}
