In contrast, the uninsured rate among U.S. parents dropped to a record low of 14.3 percent between September 2013 and June 2014, the study found.\n\nUnlike the ACA\u2019s broader health care gains, it may take longer for the Affordable Care Act to notably decrease the number of uninsured children because the numbers are already at historic lows, Genevieve Kenney, the co-director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, explained in a press briefing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe success of these programs over the last decades makes it harder to move the needle,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to move an uninsured rate that is so low so quickly.\u201d\n\nDespite the stagnation in the number of insured children, the report notes that \u201cseveral other components of the ACA\u201d could still work to get more children covered. The option for states to expand Medicaid to more low-income adults, for example, seemed to help children get coverage, the report said. More children gained coverage in states that expanded the program than in states that refused to expand it, like Texas and Florida.\n\nThe authors also found that the majority of America's roughly 7 million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but are not yet enrolled.\n\n\u201cNew outreach and enrollment investments under the ACA may also increase participation,\" the report added.\n\nThe Urban Institute says its study is the first published report on the ACA\u2019s effects on children's health coverage between September 2013 and June 2014.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
