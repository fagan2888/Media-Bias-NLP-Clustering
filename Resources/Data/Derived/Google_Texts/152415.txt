The College of Charleston was warning students to be careful when walking in the neighborhood near the campus after two young women were mugged while they were urinating behind a building early Saturday morning.

About 2:10 a.m. Saturday, according to a bulletin sent to students, two women went behind 123 St. Philip St. to urinate. While they were there, squatting down, a man knocked them over and took their purses and cell phones,

The man jumped over a nearby wall and ran away, the bulletin said.

The College emphasized that the victims were not the cause of the crime, but students were reminded to use well-lit routes, and to avoid dark vacant areas, and areas not frequented by other people.

Students also should avoid walking alone at night and avoid distractions like talking on cell phones, the bulletin said.

The robber was described as a black man, about 24 years old, 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall, wearing a gray shirt and jeans.

Anyone with information about the robbery should call Consolidated Dispatch at 843-743-7200 or the College of Charleston’s Public Safety Department’s anonymous tip line at 843-953-4998.
