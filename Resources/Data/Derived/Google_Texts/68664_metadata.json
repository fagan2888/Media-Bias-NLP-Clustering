No one can fail my class. I'm always there before and after school to do tutoring. I'm always in contact with parents for tutoring contracts. I always have my door open for when students are doing electives so they can come back to me and talk. I'm always accessible no matter what.\"\n\nBurrage says her desire to become a Math teacher began in 7th grade, when teachers had her tutor anyone from middle school to college students. She says since then she has made education an enjoyable time for students.\n\n\"I have a set routine for my classroom, when they come in they have a bell ringer that's in their Chromebook,\" said Burrage. \"After the bell ringer they have a program called I-ready that helps them with their math skills they have lacked in the past years. After that we go over the bell ringer and review homework. They're expected to do homework without fail.\"\n\nBurrage says as technology advances more ways of teaching kids becomes available and she capitalizes that every chance she gets.
