Perhaps the question the Tampa Bay Buccaneers really need to be asking themselves as the 2015 NFL draft draws near is whether they should bother spending the first overall pick on a quarterback at all.\n\nIt is certainly not a sure bet.\n\nIn the past 20 years, 12 quarterbacks were drafted first overall, yet only five \u2014 Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Matthew Stafford, Cam Newton, and Andrew Luck \u2014 have had the type of career that justifies their status as first overall selections.\n\nEveryone else in the group either failed, for one reason or another, to consistently meet his draft-day expectations (David Carr, Carson Palmer, Michael Vick, Sam Bradford and Alex Smith) or flamed out completely (Tim Couch, JaMarcus Russell).\n\nNot that the quarterback-needy Bucs would benefit any more from trading down a few spots and drafting a quarterback later in the first round. History suggests there\u2019s no faster way to ruin an otherwise good draft than by spending a first-round pick on a quarterback.\n\nSure, several teams have hit it big using that strategy. The Packers with Aaron Rodgers and the Ravens with Joe Flacco come to mind immediately. At best, though, drafting a quarterback in the first round has proven to be no better than a 50/50 proposition.\n\nIn the past decade, 27 quarterbacks were drafted in the first round. But only 11 (Rodgers, Flacco, Luck, Newton, Stafford, Jay Cutler, Matt Ryan, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill, Blake Bortles and Teddy Bridgewater) are still starting for the teams that drafted them.\n\nOf the 16 others, a dozen (Smith, Bradford, Jason Campbell, Matt Leinart, Mark Sanchez, Tim Tebow, Josh Freeman, Blaine Gabbert, Christian Ponder, Brandon Weeden, E.J. Manuel and Johnny Manziel) are either backups or with other teams. The other four (Russell, Vince Young, Brady Quinn and Jake Locker) are out of football entirely.\n\nSo, why has the ability of scouts, coaches and general managers to properly project a young quarterback\u2019s success rate diminished at a time when the importance of the position is steadily increasing?\n\nWell, the burning desire on the part of some teams to find that rare bird known as a \u201cfranchise quarterback\u201d might be a big part of the problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake teams make is that they fall in love with the person when they\u2019re not in love with the player,\u201d said Shaun King, a former Buccaneers quarterback who now works as a college and pro football analyst for Yahoo Sports.\n\n\u201cWhen you meet Christian Ponder or E.J. Manuel, you can fall in love with them because they\u2019re both tall guys that are going to say, \u2018Yes, sir\u2019 and \u2018No, sir\u2019 to you. And they\u2019re real coachable. You meet them, and you think they have everything you want in a young quarterback.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s when you forget that before you met them, when you sat down and evaluated the tape of them and looked at them objectively, you really weren\u2019t all that in love with them, because the tape said they\u2019re really not that good.\u201d\n\nThat burning desire to find a franchise quarterback might explain why some teams have a tendency to reach, and thus miss, on young quarterbacks.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t explain why a lot of the quarterbacks that truly are worthy of first-round selections don\u2019t make it either.\n\nThe problem there, according to Bill Polian, a 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee who was president and general manager of the Bills, Panthers and Colts, is that too much is expected of legitimate first-round quarterbacks, especially during the earliest stages of their careers.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the hoopla that surrounds these guys, fans get spoiled and we all tend to expect far too much out of them,\u201d Polian said. \u201cWe forget that there\u2019s a growth curve, a learning curve, for every rookie NFL quarterback.\n\n\u201cAnd the truth of the matter is, every quarterback struggles coming into the National Football League. Andrew Luck is perceived to have succeeded right away, but if you look at the interception statistics he had his first year, they\u2019re comparable to any other rookie quarterback.\u201d\n\nLuck threw 18 interceptions his rookie season for the Colts, tied for second most in the league in 2012. That\u2019s nothing, though, compared to the 28 that Peyton Manning threw during his 1998 rookie season in Indianapolis.\n\nIn both cases, though, the quarterback\u2019s team had the conviction to stick with the player and continue to build around him, Polian said. Not every team in the league, and certainly not every coach, gets that luxury.\n\n\u201cThe fans have to understand that you can\u2019t go from 2-14 to 14-2 overnight,\u201d Polian said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t happen. We did it in (Indianapolis in 1999, Manning\u2019s second season), but only because we had Marshall Faulk, Marvin Harrison, Tarik Glenn and some veterans on defense.\n\n\u201cBut even then, we still lost our first playoff game. At that time we weren\u2019t prepared, and Peyton wasn\u2019t prepared yet to take the team where we ultimately went. But we knew we\u2019d get there eventually if we stuck with it, and the fans, and especially ownership, has to understand that.\u201d\n\nOwnership. There\u2019s another contributing factor to the demise of young quarterbacks. Often as a result of their impatience, owners have a tendency to change coaches before the quarterback they drafted in the first round is fully developed. And with a change in coaches often comes a change in quarterbacks.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are a good example of the trend.\n\nBefore his second season as coach of the Browns, Pat Shurmer drafted Brandon Weeden in the first round in 2012. Shurmur was fired at the end of that season, though, and not long after taking over for Shurmer, Rob Chudzinski benched Weeden in favor of Brian Hoyer.\n\nA year later, after Chudzinski had been fired and replaced by Mike Pettine, Weeden was released.\n\nThe Browns then drafted Johnny Manziel in the first round, but Manziel lost the starting job to Hoyer, who in turn lost it to Manziel, who spent a good part of this offseason in a rehab facility.\n\n\u201cThe key to having success with a young (quarterback) \u2014 and the Seahawks with Russell Wilson have proven it \u2014 is surrounding him with a great defense and a great running game,\u201d Pettine said. \u201cYou do that and you protect the kid and you teach him how not to lose games first, and then how to win games second.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to win in the NFL. It doesn\u2019t always have to fall on the quarterback. You just have to find a way to make his job easier.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the position the Bucs will find themselves in if they decide to take either Winston or Mariota with the first pick in this year\u2019s draft.\n\nThey\u2019re a team in need of help on defense as well as offense, particularly across the offensive line.\n\nWithout improvements there, the Bucs could be setting their new quarterback up to be another in a long line of failures.\n\nBut coach Lovie Smith doesn\u2019t see that happening this time.\n\nThough he admits to not knowing why half the quarterbacks drafted in the first round never become the franchise players they\u2019re drafted to be, he believes the Bucs\u2019 choice will reach that status.\n\n\u201cThese are different guys coming out this year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd from going through the process and getting to know them, spending time with them, it seems like we\u2019re going to buck that trend a little bit this year.\u201d\n\nrcummings@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7979\n\nTwitter: @RCummingsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 25 Apr 2015 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "In the past 20 years, 12 quarterbacks were drafted first overall, yet only five \u2014 Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Matthew Stafford, Cam Newton, and Andrew Luck \u2014 have had the type of career that justifies their status as first overall selections.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "In the past 20 years, 12 quarterbacks were drafted first overall, yet only five \u2014 Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Matthew Stafford, Cam Newton, and Andrew Luck \u2014 have had the type of career that justifies their status as first overall selections.", "title": "Bucs will try to buck bum first-pick QB trend", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-will-try-to-buck-bum-first-pick-qb-trend-20150425/", "image": {"width": 3848, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150425/ARTICLE/150429472/AR/0/AR-150429472.jpg", "height": 2580}, "updated_time": "2015-04-25T08:23:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "In the past 20 years, 12 quarterbacks were drafted first overall, yet only five \u2014 Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Matthew Stafford, Cam Newton, and Andrew Luck \u2014 have had the type of career that justifies their status as first overall selections.", "title": "Bucs will try to buck bum first-pick QB trend", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150425/ARTICLE/150429472/AR/0/AR-150429472.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-04-25T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T08:23:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc63e\"", "article_summary": "In both cases, though, the quarterback\u2019s team had the conviction to stick with the player and continue to build around him, Polian said.\nYou meet them, and you think they have everything you want in a young quarterback.\nThere\u2019s another contributing factor to the demise of young quarterbacks.\nThough he admits to not knowing why half the quarterbacks drafted in the first round never become the franchise players they\u2019re drafted to be, he believes the Bucs\u2019 choice will reach that status.\nSo, why has the ability of scouts, coaches and general managers to properly project a young quarterback\u2019s success rate diminished at a time when the importance of the position is steadily increasing?"}
