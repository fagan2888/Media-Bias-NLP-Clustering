We\u2019re watching the driveways. We\u2019re watching day cares. We\u2019re watching cribs where kids sleep,\u201d Eric Tamashasky, a St. Joseph County cyber security expert said.\n\nIn fact, a website shows thousands of unprotected security cameras from around the world, including cameras from Michiana.\n\nFrom Notre Dame University\u2019s campus to an Elkhart factory, the live streams provide around the clock footage.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing to think with the internet of things, the ability for people to lose their privacy,\" Tamashasky said.\n\nTamashasky says surveillance cameras broadcast online are a lapse in personal security for their owners.\n\n\u201cThese web cam sites that compile all these insecure places, they\u2019re basically privacy potholes in the information superhighway, and what people don\u2019t understand, is they try to make their lives more convenient, how much they\u2019re giving up into their world,\u201d Tamashasky said.\n\nIn fact, a home close to the Coast Guard Facility in St. Joseph Michigan was unknowingly broadcasting a full view of the facility online.\n\n\u201cWe always take a position that we could potentially be being watched 24 hours a day, and so we act accordingly,\u201d Senior Chief Wes Haslam said.\n\nBut even he was unaware that a neighbor\u2019s security camera was pointed right at their base, and being streamed to a website.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. So it was something I was made aware of,\u201d Haslam said.\n\nBecause the neighbor\u2019s camera was never given a password, its IP address was left open, and eventually showed up on a website, allowing anyone to take a look at one of Michiana's military facilities.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that we felt was an immediate security threat,\u201d Haslam said.\n\nIt's wasn\u2019t quite a national security situation, but there was enough concern to reach out to their neighbors anyway, to protect them.\n\nThat was just one of thousands of cameras broadcast online.\n\n\u201cPeeping Toms have been doing this for thousands of years,\u201d Tamashasky said.\n\nNot only are the cameras at homes, but they\u2019re also at businesses.\n\nHundreds, even thousands, of digital windows are left wide open for anyone, including criminals, to peer into.\n\n\u201cYou can see where they put the most valuable items. You can see when they\u2019re coming and when they\u2019re going, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Tamashasky said\n\nBut the solution is simple.\n\nWhen you purchase a camera, simply change the default password, or create a password if there isn\u2019t one.\n\n\u201cAn ounce of prevention is a pound of cure when it comes to password security,\u201d Tamashasky said.\n\nWhile the solution is simple, the law is more complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s a type of voyeurism that is difficult to prosecute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to shut the camera down then to figure out the 100,000 eyes that are looking at it,\u201d Tamashasky said.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Coast Guard helped their neighbors lock their lens up, so it\u2019s no longer online.\n\n\u201cWe always take a position that we could potentially be being watched 24 hours a day, and so we act accordingly and we talk appropriate security measures. That\u2019s not necessarily something the public does,\u201d Haslam said.\n\nFor extra tips on protecting your camera, click on the blogs attached to this article.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "From baby's rooms, and day cares, to construction sites unlocked lenses are an open door for the world to peer in.
