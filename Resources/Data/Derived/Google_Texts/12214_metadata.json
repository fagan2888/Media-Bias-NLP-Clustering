In Indiana, consumers can choose from 9 issuers in the Marketplace in 2015 \u2013 up from 4 in 2014. And Indiana consumers can choose from an average of 43 health plans in their county for 2015 coverage\u2014up from 23 in 2014.\n\nNearly 8 in 10 current Marketplace consumers can find coverage in the 2015 Marketplace for $100 or less, taking into account any applicable tax credits. In 2014, 89 percent of Indiana consumers who selected a Marketplace plan received financial assistance. For returning customers, it pays to shop. More than 7 in 10 current Marketplace enrollees can find a lower premium plan in the same metal level\u2014before tax credits\u2014by returning to shop. If all returning consumers switched from their current plan to the lowest-cost premium plan in the same metal level, the total savings in premiums would be over $2 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Health Insurance Marketplace is open for business, and Indiana consumers have affordable choices for renewing their coverage and signing up for the first time,\u201d said HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. \u201cIn today\u2019s Marketplace, issuers are competing for business. With additional quality, affordable plans available, returning Indiana customers may find an even better deal if they shop and save.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s report finds that premiums for the second-lowest cost, or \u201cbenchmark,\u201d silver plan held stable in Indiana for 2015 coverage, with a 2 percent decrease on average before tax credits. Nationally, premiums for the second-lowest cost, or \u201cbenchmark,\u201d silver plan also held stable for 2015 coverage, with only a modest 2 percent increase on average before tax credits in 35 states. Many consumers will be eligible for tax credits to help with the cost of monthly premiums.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, people who purchased health insurance plans in the individual market often saw double-digit rate increases on average, with very limited options for shopping around because plans could deny them coverage, or charge them higher rates based on pre-existing conditions or their gender. This year, consumers have the option to renew their current plan or shop around to select the plan that best meets their needs and their budget.\n\nAnd with the new window shopping tool at HealthCare.gov, it\u2019s easier than ever.\n\nOpen Enrollment in the Marketplace runs from Nov. 15, 2014, through Feb. 15, 2015. Consumers should visit HealthCare.gov to review and compare health plan options. All consumers shopping for health insurance coverage for 2015\u2014even those who currently have coverage through the Marketplace\u2014should enroll or re-enroll between Nov. 15 and Dec. 15 in order to have coverage effective on Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nThe report reflects individual market health plan premium data for 35 states. It does not include Oregon or Nevada, which are using the federal eligibility and enrollment platform this year, and other State-based Marketplaces.\n\nFindings are presented at the county level, rather than by rating area, to better reflect plan service areas and the consumer experience.\n\nFor additional information on Health Plan Choice, Premiums and Affordability in the 2015 Health Insurance Marketplace, including data for states and select counties visit: http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2015/premiumReport/healthPremium2015.pdf\n\nTo preview plans, prices, covered benefits and physician and hospital networks in your area visit: https://www.healthcare.gov/find-premium-estimates/\n\nConsumers can find local help at: Localhelp.healthcare.gov/.
