While the ruling isn\u2019t a final one, though, it is also a bad sign, indicating that the court views the school\u2019s challenge as less likely to succeed.\n\nAfter the passage of Obamacare in 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) promulgated new regulations requiring all employers providing health insurance to also provide coverage for birth control. Exemptions were granted for religious bodies (such as churches), but not for religiously-affiliated entities, such as Catholic universities. Later, after encountering fierce opposition, the Obama administration crafted a compromise that allows non-profits to request an exemption by submitting a form to HHS.\n\nNotre Dame, however, argues that even filing such a request makes it \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the provision of birth control, in violation of its Catholic beliefs, because filing that request will put in motion a government provision that will require the school\u2019s insurers to provide employees birth control for free. The school sued.\n\nThe college initially ran into obstacles, but last year its efforts received a boost from the Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protected the stated religious beliefs of closely-held corporations. In March, the Supreme Court instructed a lower court to revisit Notre Dame\u2019s case in light of the new precedent. The Seventh Circuit, however, has held firm.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s judges didn\u2019t buy the school\u2019s argument. Since Notre Dame isn\u2019t being made to the pay for the birth control, they said, it isn\u2019t serving as a \u201cconduit\u201d and so its claim of complicity cannot stand.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana released a statement bashing the ruling.\n\n\u201cRequiring faith-based institutions to betray the fundamental tenets of their beliefs is unconstitutional and contrary to the cherished American tradition of religious liberty,\u201d said Coats. \u201cWhether it is Notre Dame or many other faith-based institutions of higher learning, the thread of faith that runs through these schools is essential to their religious beliefs and successful administration of a faith in learning education. This same thread of faith is vital to food banks, homeless shelters and many important organizations addressing social needs in Indiana and across the country.\u201d\n\nNow, Notre Dame can appeal once again to the Supreme Court, or it could request an en banc review by the entire Seventh Circuit.\n\nNotre Dame was the first school President Barack Obama served as a commencement speaker at after he became president. The move outraged many of its Catholic alumni, but doesn\u2019t appear to have bought it any favors from the Obama Administration.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
