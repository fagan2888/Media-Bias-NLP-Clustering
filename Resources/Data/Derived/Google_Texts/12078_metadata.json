Long ties to controversial lobby raise concern\n\nThe Wisconsin governor said on Thursday he would cancel the deal \u201con day one\u201d in the White House and pick apart other Obama achievements, including healthcare reform.\n\nWalker laid out an ambitious conservative agenda in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) , one of the nation\u2019s most controversial and powerful lobbying networks, in San Diego.\n\nHe promised to curb organised labour, slash taxes and regulations, and inject Ronald Reagan-style \u201csteel\u201d into US foreign policy, saying Islamic extremism, not climate change, was the leading security threat.\n\n\u201cWe fight to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the world must know there is no greater friend and no worse enemy than the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe governor, a leading contender in a crowded GOP field, made numerous references to his religious faith and boasted of defunding Planned Parenthood, drawing cheers from the audience of legislators and lobbyists.\n\nWalker, who has close ties to the lobbying network, also won applause vowing to dismantle the administration\u2019s Iran deal \u2013 a deal secretary of state John Kerry and other senior officials were concurrently trying to sell on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe radical regime that took US embassy staff hostage in Tehran in 1979 remained a foe, said Walker: \u201cIran has not changed much since then. I will terminate the deal with Iran on my very first day.\u201d\n\nIn a shot at Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, he said an \u201cObama-Clinton doctrine\u201d had let Russia, China and terrorists threaten US security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for true safety,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe commander in chief has a sacred duty to protect the American people.\u201d\n\nIn one of four references to Reagan, he promised to \u201cgo back\u201d to an era of strong American values and peace.\n\nThe governor mocked Obama\u2019s focus on climate change as a security threat, eliciting guffaws from the audience. \u201cThe greatest threat is radical Islam,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather take the fight to them rather than wait for them to bring the fight to us.\u201d\n\nWith Mexico just 20 miles away, Walker cited a \u201cneed to secure our borders\u201d. But he otherwise steered clear of immigration, a fraught topic for Republicans which Donald Trump was due to stir anew on Thursday on a visit to the Texas border. Walker did not mention Trump or any of the 14 other GOP hopefuls.\n\nSan Diego is far from Wisconsin but Alec\u2019s conference was home ground for Walker. He has maintained close ties with the group, and promoted its policy positions, since taking public office in 1993 as a state legislator.\n\nMany of his most contentious actions \u2013 a tough-on-crime bill that sent incarceration rates soaring, stand-your-ground gun laws, protection of corporate interests, attacks on union rights and many more \u2013 have borne the Alec seal of approval.\n\nAs governor since 2011, Walker no longer officially belongs to Alec but according to the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), in his first year as governor he signed into law 19 bills that reflected, to some degree, Alec thinking.\n\nThe CMD, which monitors the lobbying group, has speculated Walker could become the \u201cfirst Alec president\u201d.\n\nThe network matches state legislators \u2013 overwhelmingly Republican \u2013 with major US corporations, facilitating meetings behind closed doors and drafting business-friendly bills which often become law.\n\nHundreds of protestors marched on Wednesday to the Manchester Grand Hyatt hotel in San Diego, where the three-day conference was being held. The mix of labour groups, Democrats and environmentalists chanted slogans and brandished banners against corruption and corporate money in US politics.\n\n\u201cThey want to destroy labour unions,\u201d Dolores Huerta, a veteran labour leader, told the Guardian. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have labour unions you don\u2019t have redistribution of wealth, and then you don\u2019t have a middle class. And without a middle class you don\u2019t have democracy.\u201d\n\nHuerta assailed Walker, saying he would roll back social progress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a disaster for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nJim Mickelson, 46, a firefighter and union leader, brought his wife and three daughters to the protest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to let them know they\u2019re not welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: What might Scott Walker's America look like? Just see what he did to Wisconsin\n\nAddressing a packed ballroom, Walker joked that the protest was a mere \u201cwarm-up act\u201d compared to the huge, raucous backlash he faced in Wisconsin after dismantling the collective bargaining rights of public sector workers. He said he had faced down death threats.\n\n\u201cWe took on the unions and won,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believed they could win by intimidating local officials.\u201d\n\nHe talked up his controversial record in Wisconsin, saying \u201cbig, bold reforms\u201d lowered taxes by $2bn and improved education standards.\n\n\u201cWe can hire and fire based on merit,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics accuse him of wrecking the budget and gutting educational institutions.\n\nWalker vowed to repeal Obamacare, saying the path to a greater America was transferring power from Washington to state level, moving people from welfare to work and slashing federal regulations, which he said were \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\nHe said the US should build the Keystone pipeline, and use the energy \u201cabundance God has given us\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "Republican presidential candidate also tells the annual meeting of powerful lobbying network Alec that Isis is a greater security threat than climate change", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Rory Carroll", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Republican presidential candidate also tells the annual meeting of powerful lobbying network Alec that Isis is a greater security threat than climate change", "title": "Scott Walker's presidency: Iran nuclear deal goes 'on day one', then Obamacare", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/23/scott-walker-alec-iran-deal-obamacare-isis-climate-change", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc02e9ba8f30ea410ad2ec20bb43e0fcb0ef623f/0_172_4445_2667/master/4445.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ccc7ba9e460c20dfba9e3a848509a171", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@guardian", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/23/scott-walker-alec-iran-deal-obamacare-isis-climate-change?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/23/scott-walker-alec-iran-deal-obamacare-isis-climate-change", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/23/scott-walker-alec-iran-deal-obamacare-isis-climate-change?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc02e9ba8f30ea410ad2ec20bb43e0fcb0ef623f/0_172_4445_2667/master/4445.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rorycarroll72"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/23/scott-walker-alec-iran-deal-obamacare-isis-climate-change?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Scott Walker,Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council),US elections 2016,US news,US politics,US political lobbying,Republicans,Islamic State,Climate change", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-23T18:52:17.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rorycarroll", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:51:58.000Z", "tag": "Scott Walker,Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council),US elections 2016,US news,US politics,US political lobbying,Republicans,Islamic State,Climate change"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc02e9ba8f30ea410ad2ec20bb43e0fcb0ef623f/0_172_4445_2667/4445.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=a7f1d8151d5802e7935c99b7bcb719fe", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Scott Walker,Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council),US elections 2016,US news,US politics,US political lobbying,Republicans,Islamic State,Climate change"}, "article_summary": "Scott Walker has vowed to unravel Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, starting with the Iran nuclear deal, should he become president.\nThe radical regime that took US embassy staff hostage in Tehran in 1979 remained a foe, said Walker: \u201cIran has not changed much since then.\nAnd without a middle class you don\u2019t have democracy.\u201dHuerta assailed Walker, saying he would roll back social progress.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have labour unions you don\u2019t have redistribution of wealth, and then you don\u2019t have a middle class.\n\u201cThey believed they could win by intimidating local officials.\u201dHe talked up his controversial record in Wisconsin, saying \u201cbig, bold reforms\u201d lowered taxes by $2bn and improved education standards."}
