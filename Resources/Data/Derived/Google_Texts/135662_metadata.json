So what\u2019s the obstacle? Men, themselves don\u2019t make their health a priority.\n\nWhy? If a man feels good, he doesn\u2019t feel the need to be checked out. Many men are unaware that simple screenings or lifestyle changes that noticeably improve their quality of life. High cholesterol or blood pressures are not always obvious symptoms, but the fact is that many health issues are not detectable until it\u2019s too late.\n\nAccording the American Heart Association, there are 10 reasons men commonly avoid visiting their health care provider.\n\nDon\u2019t have a doctor. Find a doctor you trust by checking your insurance company listings and asking around to friends and family for recommendations. No insurance. With the Affordable Care Act everyone should have insurance. Nothing is wrong, you feel good. You may be right but \u2026 many health issues or conditions are not detectable until it\u2019s too late. Lack of time. You are busy, but with about 8,766 hours in a year, spend two hours of those hours to visit a health care provider. You don\u2019t want to spend the money. It is better to spend a little now and save a lot later than saving a little now and spend a lot in the future. Doctors don\u2019t do anything. When you get a checkup, the doctor just gives you tests and it may seem like you don\u2019t get anything, but you do. You receive knowledge and news that brings better health, if you take action. Don\u2019t want to hear the truth. Your doctor\u2019s there to help you become healthier and to avoid future disorders. You can deny your reality, but you can\u2019t deny the consequences. Uncomfortable being examined. Don\u2019t let one test stop you from receiving all the benefits of an annual physical. You tough it out. You don\u2019t like to complain about your health, but there are plenty of instances where your symptoms will only get worse if you don\u2019t receive proper treatment. Your significant other encouraging you to get a checkup. A little nudging from your wife, mom or partner nagging you influences your decision to go see the doctor, so go.\n\nJune is Men\u2019s Health month, a time to increase awareness of preventable health problems and encourage detection and treatment of disease among men and boys.\n\nIf you or your men need a health checkup schedule an appointment for breakfast and ESPN during a one-stop medical visit at the Men\u2019s Health Clinic on June 21 at South Jordan Health Center. Get a physical exam and tests, meet with a physical therapist and dietitian; all at one visit mensclinic.uofuhealth.org or call (801) 213-9299 to register.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLori Bonham is a marketing manager at University of Utah Health Care.
