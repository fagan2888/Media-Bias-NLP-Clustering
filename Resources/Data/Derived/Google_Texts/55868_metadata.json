That optimism, at least as it pertained to those states, derived from my failure to take into account one critical factor: the intractability and general dickishness of Republican-controlled state legislatures and the Koch empire.\n\nIn Utah, Republicans in the state legislature are resisting governor Gary Herbert\u2019s plan to accept Medicaid expansion funds, which would cover 146,000 people at a cost to the state of $236 million over five years. Instead, state Republicans are backing a plan that costs slightly less ($203 million over six years) but covers only 16,000 people. Thus, the Medicaid expansion in Utah is stalled because the state legislature is hell bent on throwing away money. In Wyoming, the legislature voted down the governor\u2019s expansion plan on Friday.\n\nBut that\u2019s nothing compared to what just happened in Tennessee. Gov. Bill Haslam, following the lead of several other Republican governors, worked out a compromise with the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow the state to accept expanded Medicaid funds while implementing some conservative policy tweaks. Haslam\u2019s plan, Insure Tennessee, would cover residents up to 138 percent of the poverty level, require small monthly premium payments (up to two percent of income), and impose a six-month disenrollment for failing to pay. It\u2019s obviously not the liberal ideal, but we\u2019re talking about Tennessee, for god\u2019s sake \u2013 this is the best they were going to get.\n\nAnyway, the way the Medicaid expansion works is that the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost at the outset, dropping to 90 percent after a couple of years, leaving the state responsible for the remainder. It\u2019s a good deal any way you slice it, but state Republicans have used this cost burden to argue against the expansion, claiming that state budgets are tight as it is and that the federal government can\u2019t be trusted to live up to its end of the bargain. In Tennessee\u2019s case, though, the state\u2019s portion of the cost was going to be paid by the state\u2019s hospitals. (Hospitals tend to be big fans of expanded Medicaid because it drastically reduces instances of uncompensated care.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee was poised to get a free ride on expanded Medicaid -- but here's how you-know-who stepped in to stop it", "title": "I underestimated the Kochs: How Medicaid expansion was killed in Tennessee for no reason", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tennessee was poised to get a free ride on expanded Medicaid -- but here's how you-know-who stepped in to stop it", "title": "I underestimated the Kochs: How Medicaid expansion was killed in Tennessee for no reason", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/09/i_underestimated_the_kochs_how_medicaid_expansion_was_killed_in_tennessee_for_no_reason/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_koch4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tennessee was poised to get a free ride on expanded Medicaid -- but here's how you-know-who stepped in to stop it", "title": "I underestimated the Kochs: How Medicaid expansion was killed in Tennessee for no reason", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_koch4.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Americans for Prosperity, Bill Haslam, Koch Brothers, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Tennessee, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd837d\"", "article_summary": "In Wyoming, the legislature voted down the governor\u2019s expansion plan on Friday.\nThus, the Medicaid expansion in Utah is stalled because the state legislature is hell bent on throwing away money.\nInstead, state Republicans are backing a plan that costs slightly less ($203 million over six years) but covers only 16,000 people.\n\u201cThe governors of Tennessee, Wyoming, and Utah \u2013 Republicans all \u2013 are working on plans that would allow their states to accept Medicaid expansion funds,\u201d I wrote, exhibiting a degree of optimism that is largely out of character for me.\nIn Utah, Republicans in the state legislature are resisting governor Gary Herbert\u2019s plan to accept Medicaid expansion funds, which would cover 146,000 people at a cost to the state of $236 million over five years."}
