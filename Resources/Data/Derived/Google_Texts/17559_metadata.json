A CMS official said the post was removed because of a website error, not a change in policy, and that it will be reposted soon.\n\nThe notice seeks contractors who can help develop common protocols and guidelines for their Medicaid data, which will make it easier for computer systems to recognize individuals across state and federal data sets. The proposed contract will also include creating common taxonomies between states, which essentially means standardizing the terms states use to describe particular benefits and classifications.\n\nThe proposed contract will also include helping states fill gaps or fix inconsistencies in their Medicaid data.\n\nA sources sought notice doesn\u2019t obligate the government to purchase any new technology or services.\n\nJoint Medicare and Medicaid enrollees account for about $300 billion annually, according to the notice. They make up 19 percent of Medicare enrollees and 27 percent of Medicare spending.\n\n(Image via everything possible/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Marks", "description": "Medicare wants to standardize state Medicaid data.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "Medicare wants to standardize state Medicaid data.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Next Step: Fixing Medicare and Medicaid Data Sharing", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2013/12/obamacares-next-step-fixing-medicare-and-medicaid-data-sharing/74975/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/12/05/120513medicaredataNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare wants to standardize state Medicaid data.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Next Step: Fixing Medicare and Medicaid Data Sharing", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/12/05/120513medicaredataNG/open-graph.jpg", "creator": "@Joseph_Marks_", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-05T18:51:07Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/12/05/120513medicaredataNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare\u2019s Next Step: Fixing Medicare and Medicaid Data Sharing", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov,obamacare,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-short,site-nextgov", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/12/05/120513medicaredataNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "keywords": "healthcare.gov, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "Medicare wants to standardize state Medicaid data."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc96\"", "article_summary": "The sources sought notice was posted and then quickly canceled on the government\u2019s Fed Biz Opps contracting site.\nThe agency that fumbled but seems to have repaired HealthCare.gov is preparing to launch a new program authorized under President Obama\u2019s health care reform initiative to better integrate federal Medicare data with data from state Medicaid offices, contracting documents show.\nThe proposed contract will also include helping states fill gaps or fix inconsistencies in their Medicaid data.\nA sources sought notice doesn\u2019t obligate the government to purchase any new technology or services.\nThe notice seeks contractors who can help develop common protocols and guidelines for their Medicaid data, which will make it easier for computer systems to recognize individuals across state and federal data sets."}
