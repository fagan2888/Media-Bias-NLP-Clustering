In Iowa, Bernie Sanders fought Hillary Clinton to a near tie. In New Hampshire, he rolled to a 22-point victory. It is an extraordinary vindication of an argument liberal Democrats like me have been making since the 1980s, when the Democratic Leadership Council leveraged a truism\u2014candidates win by capturing the center of the electorate\u2014into a bamboozlement: that for the Democrats, \u201cmoving to the center\u201d meant moving closer to Wall Street and abandoning the party\u2019s populist traditions.\n\nSanders has been proving the counterargument in spades, to the shock of the political establishment. Make full-throated appeals to ordinary people\u2019s economic interests and frame what Teddy Roosevelt called \u201cthe malefactors of great wealth\u201d as the enemy, and you could crack the political world wide open.\n\nLook at the facts. Last summer, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver blithely pronounced Sanders was sunk because there weren\u2019t enough self-identified liberals to vote for him\u2014by which he meant \u201caffluent white cosmopolitan.\u201d Now, however, the punditocracy\u2019s other data-driven Nate, Nate Cohn of The New York Times, dared to actually look at the Iowa data. He found Sanders \u201cfares much better among less affluent whites than Mr. Obama did eight years ago, suggesting he\u2019s attracting a group that traditionally supports more moderate establishment candidates.\u201d Given, he says, that \u201cidealistic liberal outsiders\u201d\u2014Cohn\u2019s former pigeonhole for Sanders\u2014traditionally don\u2019t do well among lower-income whites or lower-income blacks, he wonders whether a dam hasn\u2019t broken already. And he speculates that \u201cthe assumption that Mrs. Clinton will easily maintain her strength among nonwhite voters may be shakier than once thought.\u201d (My emphasis.) That\u2019s Sanders\u2019s argument: that he\u2019s uniquely positioned to assemble a cross-racial coalition of lower-income voters. And, even Republican voters\u2014which I myself discovered anecdotally was not a pie-in-the-sky notion. In my reporting in Texas and Indiana this past summer, I kept meeting Republicans who called themselves Sanders fans\u2014one of whom labeled him a \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\nSo why am I not celebrating?\n\nI like Sanders. I love that he\u2019s hammering home this lesson\u2014 that populism is popular\u2014to frightened Democratic elites. I\u2019m gobsmacked that in a mere matter of weeks, he has upended a generation\u2019s cobweb-encrusted psephological cliche\u0301s. What\u2019s more, I distrust Hillary Clinton, and I fear the message that would be sent to those selfsame Democratic elites by the success of a candidate for whom four of the five top contributors to the $712.4 million she\u2019s raised for her campaigns since 2000 were banks.\n\nI just fear what will happen if Sanders becomes president: precisely because he\u2019s proving the economic populism argument right.\n\nI made a detailed argument about the power of economic populism to strengthen the Democratic Party in an essay in the Boston Review in 2004, later published with responses in a book called The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo: How the Democrats Can Once Again Become America\u2019s Dominant Political Party. I compared political parties to corporations. The most successful ones, historically\u2014the great ones\u2014built long-term value by developing a reputation for innovative, quality products. More and more, however, beginning with the rise of the modern \u201cgo-go\u201d stock market in the 1960s, companies began the practice of impressing short-term investors by measuring success in quarterly increments, via expediencies like selling off slow-moving divisions, liquidating excess capacity, and trimming research and development. David Halberstam explained in The Reckoning, his classic history of the auto industry, how the Big Three Detroit automakers destroyed themselves in precisely this way.\n\nAfter the traumas of the Reagan years, that was how the Democrats began to go about things, too: they grabbed desperately at whatever initiative\u2014or abandoned whatever initiative\u2014they felt it would take to nose enough \u201cswing voters\u201d temporarily into their column to garner 50 percent plus one in the next election. But a swing voter is like a short-term shareholder\u2014ready to sell the next time some other blandishment comes along.\n\nAs the alternative, think of the Democrats who created Social Security in 1935\u2014it is still delivering loyalty to Democrats 80 years later. As is Medicare, which was passed in 1965. If it fulfills its promise, Obamacare might still be manufacturing Democrats decades hence.\n\nI called such programs \u201csuperjumbos.\u201d But one characteristic of a superjumbo is that a president doesn\u2019t just order one out of a catalogue. They are almost by definition long in gestation. Much of the great social legislation of the New Deal was conceived in the Progressive Era. All the extraordinary string of laws Lyndon Johnson passed in the first two years of his presidency, like the first bill providing federal aid to education, and Medicare and Medicaid, had been in the hopper for a generation or more\u2014even back to Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe Great Society\u2019s progressive momentum was abruptly halted by the backlash against civil rights, a story I told in my book Nixonland. But I also missed something in Nixonland\u2014the superjumbos kept coming, only in different form. Starting in 1966 with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (its seat-belt requirements save 10,000 lives a year), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and continuing through the Nixon presidency with the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the National Environmental Protection Act, Democrats wrote an entire new story in America\u2019s books of law: that the federal government could act aggressively to protect consumers from corporate malfeasance.\n\n\u201cConsumer legislation\u201d was an entirely new category of statute\u2014but, just like the New Deal and Great Society social legislation, political entrepreneurs, both inside Congress and in the advocacy community, had been working to advance it for years, in faith that their moment would come. In May 1969, for example, only 1 percent of those polled considered \u201cpollution/ecology as an important national problem,\u201d according to University of California, Berkeley, professor David Vogel\u2019s Fluctuating Fortunes. But by December 1970, a survey revealed that the same problem ranked number one in the public\u2019s concern. Senators like Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin and Maine\u2019s Edmund Muskie were ready to act; meanwhile, President Nixon, helpless before the power of public opinion, had no political choice but to go along.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie stands alone: He has proven the power of economic populism, but to a party still deaf to what he has shown", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats\u2019 dilemma: Does the party even care about big ideas anymore?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bernie stands alone: He has proven the power of economic populism, but to a party still deaf to what he has shown", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats\u2019 dilemma: Does the party even care about big ideas anymore?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/bernie_sanders_hillary_clinton_and_the_democrats_dilemma_does_the_party_even_care_about_big_ideas_anymore/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/sanders_hillary17.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie stands alone: He has proven the power of economic populism, but to a party still deaf to what he has shown", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats\u2019 dilemma: Does the party even care about big ideas anymore?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/sanders_hillary17.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rick Perlstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Super Tuesday", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In Iowa, Bernie Sanders fought Hillary Clinton to a near tie.\nTopics: Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Super Tuesday, Innovation News, Technology News, Business News, News, Politics NewsThe grumpy old man with the disheveled hair has revealed himself a veritable political juggernaut.\nAs the alternative, think of the Democrats who created Social Security in 1935\u2014it is still delivering loyalty to Democrats 80 years later.\nI just fear what will happen if Sanders becomes president: precisely because he\u2019s proving the economic populism argument right.\nSanders has been proving the counterargument in spades, to the shock of the political establishment."}
