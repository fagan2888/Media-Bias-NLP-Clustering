That\u2019s down from 2014 and 2009, when 22 percent and 32 percent, respectively, went without needed care due to cost.\n\nSusan Zepeda, president of Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, said having insurance coverage is a great start, but it doesn\u2019t always get the whole job done.\n\n\u201cAlthough more and more Kentuckians are able to get the care they need in a timely manner, they\u2019re is still work to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are still people who are delaying care or finding that they\u2019re unable to handle the medical bills after they receive care.\u201d\n\nKentuckians earning 138 percent or less of the federal poverty level were more likely to delay or forego medical care than those who earned above that, according to the report. Under the Affordable Care Act, Kentuckians earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level became eligible for Medicaid. More than 400,000 residents are now on the rolls, although Gov. Matt Bevin has said he will seek to modify the program.\n\nRelated Story Bevin Announces First Steps Toward Medicaid Expansion Changes\n\nDelaying care was also a common choice among 27 percent of uninsured Kentuckians.\n\nThe poll also asked whether Kentucky adults had any problems paying medical bills. In 2015, 28 percent of respondents said they experienced difficulties paying. When broken down by insurance status, 27 percent of insured and 31 percent of uninsured adults had trouble paying medical bills. In 2014, nearly half of uninsured adults reported having difficulties paying those bills.\n\nZepeda said individuals and families having a tough time paying medical bills should speak with their health care provider.\n\n\u201cAlways the best option is to begin with the care provider to seek some kind of relief either in the form of delaying your payments or perhaps negotiating a lower payment amount,\u201d Zepeda said.\n\nThe poll was produced by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky and Interact for Health, formerly the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2015, one in five Kentucky adults either didn't get care or delayed care due to cost, which is down from previous years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "In 2015, one in five Kentucky adults either didn't get care or delayed care due to cost, which is down from previous years.", "title": "Kentuckians Are Still Having Trouble Affording Health Care", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health2-e1460479549547.jpg", "height": 1000}, "updated_time": "2016-04-12T17:10:41-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentuckians-still-having-trouble-affording-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 2015, one in five Kentucky adults either didn't get care or delayed care due to cost, which is down from previous years.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health2-e1460479549547.jpg", "title": "Kentuckians Are Still Having Trouble Affording Health Care", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2016-04-12T12:46:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-12T17:10:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky adults still have a hard time affording health care, according to a Kentucky Health Issues Poll.\nZepeda said individuals and families having a tough time paying medical bills should speak with their health care provider.\nIn 2015, one in five Kentucky adults either didn\u2019t get care or delayed care due to cost, according to the report.\nThe poll was produced by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky and Interact for Health, formerly the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati.\nWhen broken down by insurance status, 27 percent of insured and 31 percent of uninsured adults had trouble paying medical bills."}
