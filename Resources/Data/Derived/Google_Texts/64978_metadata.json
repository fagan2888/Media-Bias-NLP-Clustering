Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.). (AP)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 At the State of the Union on Tuesday, Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) said that the empty chair President Barack Obama left in the first lady\u2019s box for victims of gun violence should have been left for \u201cthose who\u2019ve had their heads cut off or killed through ISIL, because that was the true cause of the problem in San Bernardino.\u201d\n\nAt the U.S. Capitol, CNSNews.com asked Hartzler, \u201cPresident Obama is leaving an empty seat tonight for victims of gun violence. I wanted to ask, who would you leave an empty seat at the address for?\u201d\n\nRep. Hartzler said, \u201cWell, I think more fittingly it should be those who\u2019ve had their heads cut off or killed through ISIL, because that was the true cause of the problem in San Bernardino.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an issue of a gun, it was an issue of having terrorism come to our shores and we need to address that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is very, very concerning, and so that would symbolize how important it is that we get our foreign policy right.\u201d\n\nHartzler also provided her response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, as well as her thoughts on the current state of the union.\n\nShe told CNSNews.com that the state of the union is \u201cnot near as good as it would\u2019ve been if we had some true leadership in this country and had a President who was wiling to help get Washington out of our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have allies who don\u2019t trust us and enemies who don\u2019t fear us, and this President needs to get serious about addressing the rise of ISIL and developing a real strategy in dealing with terror around the world,\u201d Hartzler continued.\n\nShe went on to address some of the economic problems Americans are facing.\n\n\u201cWe also have less Americans who are working at any time since back in the 1970s,\u201d said Hartzler, adding, \u201cwe can get job growth back in this country as we remove Washington\u2019s over-regulations and encourage growth, and we also have too many people that have been losing their health care due to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHartzler said that Obama\u2019s legacy is \u201chigher unemployment and it\u2019s decreased status around the world.\u201d\n\nHartzler pushed for a bill last week that would\u2019ve repealed Obamacare and defunded Planned Parenthood. Despite passing in both the House and the Senate, the legislation was vetoed by President Obama last Friday.\n\nHartzler also spoke about the GOP\u2019s future plans to accomplish the goal of repealing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt still is a problem in that many, many Americans have had their healthcare taken away from them due to Obamacare, these are policies that people wanted and could afford but they no longer can, their deductibles have gone up and we can do better,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to put forth a bill this year that shows what we think we can do to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to put our positive alternative out there and let America make a choice come November on really who has the best agenda, and we\u2019re going to do that in other policy areas as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "At the State of the Union on Tuesday, Rep.
