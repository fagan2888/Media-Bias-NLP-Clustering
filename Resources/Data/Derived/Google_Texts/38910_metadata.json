It\u2019s a chance for relaxation and honesty. You say things to these people that you wouldn\u2019t to the world at large. And if there\u2019s anything we can conclude from what Republicans say behind closed doors, it\u2019s that they aren\u2019t too fond of poor people.\n\nTake, for instance, Rep. Jack Kingston, who\u2014as part of his bid for the GOP Senate nomination in Georgia\u2014spoke to the Jackson County Republican Party on Saturday. He was among friends, or at least, co-partisans. And as such, he felt free to make a declaration, one he knew his audience might agree with. Commenting on school free lunch programs, he asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have the kids pay a dime, pay a nickel to instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch?\u201d He even suggested that these disadvantaged kids \u201csweep the floor of the cafeteria\u201d as payment for their meals. Why do this and potentially humiliate kids? \u201c[W]e would gain as a society in getting\u2026the myth out of [people\u2019s] head that there is such thing as a free lunch,\u201d he said.\n\nYou could call this a well-meaning but flawed attempt to teach responsibility to low-income children. But even that rankles, since poor children aren\u2019t responsible for their poverty, and have no greater need for responsibility lessons than their wealthier peers. (Indeed, if one Texas judge is to be believed, the scourge of \u201caffluenza\u201d means rich kids are the proper targets for these measures.)\n\nThen again, it\u2019s not as if Rep. Kingston is alone in this rhetoric. Place a Republican amongst his own\u2014or in a situation where he needs to prove or reaffirm his conservatism\u2014and the odds are good that someone will say something disparaging about the disadvantaged.\n\nThe emblematic example is Mitt Romney [comment] on the so-called \u201c47 percent\u201d who \u201cpay no income tax\u201d and \u201cfeel entitled\u201d to \u201chealth care, to food, to housing\u201d (imagine that!). There\u2019s also Newt Gingrich, who\u2014during the GOP presidential primary\u2014proposed a similar idea to Kingston\u2019s: firing janitors at schools in low-income neighborhoods and replacing them with students. As he explained, \u201cThe kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they would have pride in the schools, they\u2019d begin the process of rising.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney\u2019s former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, may have reintroduced himself as someone with an interest in the lives of the poor, but his rhetoric shows someone who still divides the world into \u201cmakers\u201d and \u201ctakers,\u201d the latter of whom are poor and need to lose their \u201cdependence\u201d on social services. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency,\u201d said Ryan last year, as he touted his budget. All of this is why, for all of his new focus on poverty, Ryan still supports huge cuts to our thread-bare safety net.\n\nConservatives will object to this idea that they disdain the poor, and why wouldn\u2019t they? It\u2019s a nasty thing to accuse someone of animosity toward the least fortunate, and it\u2019s not hard to find examples of Republicans who urge compassion and attention for low-income Americans. So, with that in mind, let\u2019s move from what Republicans say to what they do.\n\nIn September, House Republicans passed a plan to slash food stamps by $40 billion over the next ten years, knifing the program and pushing millions of families into food insecurity. The charitable explanation is that this was a misguided attempt at deficit reduction. But then consider this: At the same time they cut food stamps, Republicans also passed agricultural subsidies, a virtual giveaway to large firms and wealthy farmers. If that wasn\u2019t enough, there was also a brief push to require drug tests for welfare recipients, despite the lower incidence of substance abuse among people who receive benefits.\n\nLikewise, Republicans have no desire to extend emergency unemployment insurance, even as the jobless continue to rely on it, a product of our lackluster response to the Great Recession. As Kentucky Senator Rand Paul explained, \u201cWhen you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you\u2019re causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy.\u201d\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be so bad if Republicans were also concerned with short-term economic performance, but they aren\u2019t. For every conservative intellectual who is friendly to counter-cyclical economic policy, there are many more GOP lawmakers who want tight money and spending cuts in an economy starved for demand.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t forget Republican opposition to one of the largest anti-poverty measures in years\u2014the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, which comes almost fully funded by the federal government. Twenty states\u2014all with GOP governors\u2014have rejected the expansion, denying health insurance to 4.8 million low-income Americans for no real reason at all.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201312191945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The worst part about a congressman suggesting that disadvantaged kids should \u2018sweep the floor\u2019 to earn their lunch is that it\u2019s not an unusual sentiment in today\u2019s GOP.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Right's Case of Affluenza", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Right\\\\u0027s Case of Affluenza\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46249539.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-19T19:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-12-19T19:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The worst part about a congressman suggesting that disadvantaged kids should \u2018sweep the floor\u2019 to earn their lunch is that it\u2019s not an unusual sentiment in today\u2019s GOP.", "title": "The Right's Case of Affluenza", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/19/do-republicans-hate-poor-people/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1387486183948.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfeac\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[W]e would gain as a society in getting\u2026the myth out of [people\u2019s] head that there is such thing as a free lunch,\u201d he said.\nSo, with that in mind, let\u2019s move from what Republicans say to what they do.\nAnd if there\u2019s anything we can conclude from what Republicans say behind closed doors, it\u2019s that they aren\u2019t too fond of poor people.\n(Indeed, if one Texas judge is to be believed, the scourge of \u201caffluenza\u201d means rich kids are the proper targets for these measures.)\nTwenty states\u2014all with GOP governors\u2014have rejected the expansion, denying health insurance to 4.8 million low-income Americans for no real reason at all."}
