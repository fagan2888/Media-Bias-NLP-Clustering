Plus, about eight in 10 adults surveyed said they think more people would use birth control if Americans were comfortable talking openly about it \u2014 including information about the different types of contraceptive options and their various health benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why the National Campaign is preparing for its second annual \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day next week. That social media campaign, which encourages people to participate under the hashtag #ThxBirthControl, will be an opportunity to encourage people to speak up about how using birth control has changed their lives.\n\n\u201cBirth control matters: The ability to plan, prevent, and space pregnancies is directly linked to benefits to women, men, children, and society, including more educational and economic opportunities, healthier babies, more stable families, and reduced taxpayer burden,\u201d the website for the campaign explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of life and should not be a taboo topic or the subject of political posturing.\u201d\n\nAccording to previous research in the field, young Americans \u2014 one of the groups most at risk for unplanned pregnancies \u2014 wish they heard about their reproductive health resources more often. A 2013 survey found that, among women between the ages of 18 and 29, about 50 percent said they would like to see more celebrities talk about birth control. Forty six percent of respondents said they would be more personally comfortable using contraception if more of the people around them discussed it in a positive way.\n\nWhen birth control makes headlines, it\u2019s usually accompanied by negative news. The national media frequently covers politicians\u2019 efforts to roll back coverage for contraception, as well as pundits\u2019 assertions that taking the pill makes you a slut. Plus, there are a fair share of scary stories about concerns over birth control\u2019s potential risks. Reproductive health experts say that can leave Americans with the impression that birth control is very controversial, or that it does more harm than good.\n\nBut according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the development of modern contraception was one of the 10 most important public health achievements of the 20th century. The Guttmacher Institute has confirmed that birth control is critical for helping women achieve their financial goals, like finishing school or holding down a job. And there are a host of health benefits, including preventing painful menstrual cramps or clearing up acne, that accompany hormonal contraception. Those are the messages that \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day hopes to emphasize.\n\nThe bipartisan support for birth control has even been evident on the political stage recently. In the lead up to the midterm elections, several Republicans threw their support behind over-the-counter birth control as a method of appealing to female voters.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Plus, policies to expand access to all forms of birth control have broad bipartisan support.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Plus, policies to expand access to all forms of birth control have broad bipartisan support.", "title": "Americans Across Party Lines Think We Should Talk More About Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/06/3589716/bipartisan-birth-control-survey/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plus, policies to expand access to all forms of birth control have broad bipartisan support.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765-321x214.jpg", "title": "Americans Across Party Lines Think We Should Talk More About Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-06T09:02:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e59\"", "article_summary": "Health Americans Across Party Lines Think We Should Talk More About Birth Control CREDIT: ShutterstockCREDIT: Thanks Birth Control DayPolicies to expand access to all forms of birth control have broad bipartisan support, and most Americans think we would benefit from talking more about the positive effects of contraception, according to new research released by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy on Thursday.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why the National Campaign is preparing for its second annual \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day next week.\nThose are the messages that \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day hopes to emphasize.\nThe bipartisan support for birth control has even been evident on the political stage recently.\nWhen birth control makes headlines, it\u2019s usually accompanied by negative news."}
