In recent months, the issue has swept to the front of the immigration policy debate, first among activists, then bubbling over onto Capitol Hill.\n\nTwo weeks ago, under pressure from activists, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was ready to vote on a resolution that threatened to expose a rift within the Democratic Party on deportations for the world to see.\n\nThen the White House intervened. A calm and measured Obama also met with lawmakers from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus last week, seeking to make an emotional connection on the contentious issue. The president subsequently announced an administration review of deportation policy to be led by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\n\u201cThe president was pretty emphatic; he said, \u2018You can tell folks publicly that I said I recognize we should not be in the business of separating families, no one agrees with that,\u2019\u201d Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) told BuzzFeed.\n\nThe House Democratic Caucus chairman described the legal constraints on the administration \u2014 if House Republicans won\u2019t agree to allow votes on the deportation issue.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to do is work within the confines of the law and make enforcement actions work,\u201d Becerra said of the president. \u201cHe pointed out \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to deny \u2014 that if Congress provides through law and budget the authority to do something, the president can\u2019t say I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\n\nBut what the DHS review will entail, and what the next steps on the deportation issue are remain questions.\n\n\u201cThe outcome I\u2019m looking for is humanizing,\u201d said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), who also attended the White House meeting. \u201cA more human, tender, much more humane process of deportations, while still understanding that regardless of what we accomplish, it won\u2019t be over until one man, Mr. Boehner, gives us a vote.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson will meet about the forthcoming deportation review. Activists, impatient, want the review to proceed immediately, rather than lingering for months.\n\nBecerra and Gutierrez hesitated to lay down a timeframe that would be unacceptable but did say it is important to them that the process not be drawn out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a deep discussion with Secretary Johnson on how their executive discretion can be used to enforce the law,\u201d Becerra said.\n\nBoth lawmakers were quick to note that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus advocated for deferred action for DREAMers long before the policy gained widespread attention.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3107613, "userid": 741910}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Both leaders believe deportations are breaking up families, that a review will bear fruit, and that the House GOP needs to vote.
