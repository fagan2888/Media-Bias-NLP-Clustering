Hundreds of people in Oklahoma are with out power as a wet, icy storm makes its way across the state.

Just over 1,500 residents in the Oklahoma City metro were reporting power outages Friday morning. Power has since been restored. The majority of the outages, 1,493, were located just north of the Lake Hefner area. It is unclear if the outages in the metro are weather related.

As of 4:15 p.m., a total of 5,946 OG&E customers across the state are without power so far, with more expected as freezing rain continues to fall.

There are 4,588 outages in Yukon, 593 in Seiling, 85 in Oklahoma City, 233 in Meno, 75 in El Reno, 256 in Enid, and 116 in Kremlin.

The estimated time of restoration for the Yukon outages is 5:21 p.m. and 5:33 p.m., according to OG&E System Watch.

There is no estimation on how long it will take to restore power at this time.
