JLARC released it's annual look at state spending Tuesday, and it re-enforces a number of the general trends the state has seen now for many years.

The state's general fund spending declined by 5 percent, when you adjust for inflation and population change, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2015. The overall budget grew 15 percent, primarily due to increases in federal contributions to the overall state budget.

If you don't account for inflation or population at all, you see 47 percent growth in total state spending. The full report is here.

The figure you may hear quoted quite a bit, though, is 79 percent. That's how much the state's general fund spending at the Department of Medical Assistance Services increased over the period.

To put it another way, Virginia's spending on Medicaid increased almost 80 percent. It drove more than half the general fund's growt over 10 years.

Recall, if you will, one of the Republican Party's key arguments against accepting the $2 billion plus in federal funding that would flow from Medicaid expansion: That it would be too expensive for the state, which would eventually be expected to cover 10 percent of expansion costs.

"The costs are real," House Appropriations Chairman S. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, said during Tuesday's JLARC presentation.

"The alarming rate of Medicaid growth is more proof that Virginia cannot afford to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act," Speaker of the House William Howell said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.

Of course, Medicaid now in Virginia is a 50-50 split betweent he state and the feds. Some would argue that the state has been expanding Medicaid for years, just in a way that's more expensive to the state than it is the federal government.

Maybe that chart's not a GOP argument at all.
