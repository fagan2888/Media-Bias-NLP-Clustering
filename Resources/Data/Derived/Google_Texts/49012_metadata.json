Bernie Sanders launched his presidential campaign nine months ago with big ideas about empowering the little guy and ending \u201cthe collapse of the American middle class.\u201d He had few detailed proposals, but as his message caught on and his campaign raised millions of dollars, he began to fill in the blanks. With the primaries underway, Sanders now has a thorough list of specific plans that would remake the whole U.S. economy were they to go into effect. Here are the biggest elements of his plan, along with cost estimates:\n\n\"Medicare for all,\" or single-payer healthcare funded by the government. This would be a gargantuan change that would put health insurers (which employ more than half a million people) out of business, end employer-provider insurance and disrupt many other elements of the healthcare system. It would cost the government somewhere between $1.4 trillion and $2.8 trillion per year, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. The government spends about $4 trillion today, so Sanders\u2019s plan would add sharply to that.\n\nSanders would pay for this new spending through a series of tax increases: on companies, workers, investors, heirs and the wealthy, with the idea being that most people would save more on healthcare costs than they\u2019d pay in new taxes. Sanders says his tax hikes would be adequate to cover the costs, but CFRB estimates that the Sanders plan could come up short by as much as $1.4 trillion per year. That\u2019s a ton of money and would be a tough hole to fill.\n\nThe \u201cRebuild America Act.\u201d This would fund the sort of infrastructure development President Obama is a big fan of, even though he\u2019s been unable to get such a bill through Congress. Sanders wants to spend about $100 billion per year constructing or shoring up roads, bridges, ports, runways and other types of facilities. To pay for it, he\u2019d tax corporate money being held in offshore tax havens\u2014which would require a new law forcing that money back home, plus aggressive enforcement.\n\nCollege for all. This isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfree\u201d college, as some reports suggest. But Sanders wants to make tuition free at all public universities, leaving students to pay for room, board and other living expenses. Public schools would have to help students from low-income families meet 100% of their financial needs. (Wealthier kids could still pay exorbitant fees to attend private schools.) The cost to the government would be about $75 billion a year in additional grants and loans. He\u2019d pay for this through a new tax on financial transactions, also known as a \u201cRobin Hood tax\u201d because, in theory, it would snatch money from the wealthy (who buy and sell securities) and divert it to the needy.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that a Robin Hood tax could raise up to $50 billion per year, so it might cover the majority of the cost of such a program. But it could also increase volatility in markets (something investors certainly don\u2019t need right now), while depressing the value of assets and creating an incentive to find ways around the tax. And it would probably affect enough ordinary Americans\u2014through pension and 401(k) plans\u2014to garner significant opposition.\n\nMassive tax hikes. Sanders would significantly raise the personal income-tax rates for households with more than $250,000 in income, with the top federal rate going as high as 58%. He\u2019d cap deductions for the wealthy, raise the estate tax and kill the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole that mostly benefits private-equity firms. Tax rates for lower earners would stay the same, but their taxes would still go up because of the 2.2% increase in payroll taxes employees would pay to cover the cost of \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Overall, Sanders\u2019 tax hikes would amount to around $1 trillion a year. \u201cIt is hard to grasp the enormity of the tax increases Bernie Sanders is proposing,\u201d Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Institute wrote recently.\n\nSanders\u2019 fresh-start approach, of course, is a big part of his appeal. But Hillary Clinton\u2014and many others\u2014contend that Sanders\u2019s proposals are so radical they have zero chance of ever going into effect. Given that at least one house of Congress seems sure to be controlled by Republicans for the foreseeable future, a President Sanders would probably meet a brick wall at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposals, in contrast to Sanders\u2019, are mostly incremental. She\u2019d improve upon the Affordable Care Act, instead of scrapping it and starting over. Her tax plan includes targeted tax cuts for some ordinary families, along with modest tax increases on the wealthy, while leaving most of the current tax code in place. She\u2019d make college more affordable by lowering the interest rate on student loans and limiting the maximum payback to 10% of income, a plan that would cost less than half of Sanders\u2019 $75 billion-per-year proposal. Clinton\u2019s Wall Street reforms mostly involve stronger enforcement of rules already on the books.\n\nClinton is undoubtedly right when she says she\u2019s the more pragmatic candidate, with policy proposals designed to improve the system instead of blowing it up. The question is whether voters want that. Sanders\u2019 surprising strength suggests a lot of people wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the next president govern with dynamite, whether it\u2019s practical or not.\n\nRick Newman\u2019s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.
