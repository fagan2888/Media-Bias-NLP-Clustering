Department of Elder Affairs Secretary Sam Verghese said the Sunshine state needs to take the lead on dementia-related issues.\n\n\u201cWe just passed New York in being the third most populated state now in the nation,\u201d said Verghese. \u201cWhen it comes to the percentage of elders, about a quarter of our population are there and we know by the nature of that, we\u2019re going to see proportionally more of a volume of these issues. So it only makes sense that we are leading the way.\u201d\n\nThe initiative will promote research efforts to find a cure and connect people with support services already available. The Department of Elder Affairs will engage with businesses, healthcare agencies and dementia care programs in individual communities around the state to help them become more accommodating to dementia related issues and earn a \u201cCaring Community\u201d designation from the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a healthcare related issue,\u201d said Verghese. It really does effect the businesses locally in many ways.\u201d\n\nElder Affairs staff are working to select their first pilot community for the initiative. That decision will come in October or November. Verghese says part of the aim is to help change the conversation when it comes to how society thinks about dementia.\n\n\u201cWhat we hear about dementia, and of course with Alzheimer\u2019s being the largest of that, we hear that folks often feel like it\u2019s a silent killer, said Verghese. \u201cThey\u2019re in their own prison. They just don\u2019t have a way of helping people understand what\u2019s happening internally in a way that\u2019s really in our vernacular now in society; that people just feel like they kind of go into a corner and they want to hide.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Elder Affairs has $20 million in present funding for respite care for people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Verghese says they\u2019ve already made a request for additional money. Funding for the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative comes from the department\u2019s existing budget allocation. The initial announcement was made at the annual Florida Conference on Aging in August.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Department of Elder Affairs recently announced the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative to spread public awareness about dementia and to help make", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/state-launches-dementia-care-and-cure-initiative", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/443402046.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Department of Elder Affairs recently announced the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative to spread public awareness about dementia and to help make", "title": "State Launches \u201cDementia Care and Cure Initiative\u201d"}, "story_id": 443162906, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "John Davis", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "State Launches \u201cDementia Care and Cure Initiative\u201d"}, "nid": 12093, "datePublished": "2015-09-25", "keywords": "dementia, Florida Department of Elder Affairs", "wordCount": 523, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0760\"", "article_summary": "The Florida Department of Elder Affairs recently announced the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative to spread public awareness about dementia and to help make Florida communities more dementia-friendly.\nFunding for the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative comes from the department\u2019s existing budget allocation.\nDepartment of Elder Affairs Secretary Sam Verghese said the Sunshine state needs to take the lead on dementia-related issues.\nThe Department of Elder Affairs will engage with businesses, healthcare agencies and dementia care programs in individual communities around the state to help them become more accommodating to dementia related issues and earn a \u201cCaring Community\u201d designation from the state.\n\u201cWe just passed New York in being the third most populated state now in the nation,\u201d said Verghese."}
