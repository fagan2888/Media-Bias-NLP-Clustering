The benefits of this new media world of ours, this awe-inspiring world of social media and instant online publishing, far outweigh the negatives. One obvious negative is that our politics are becoming a bit more shrill, sometimes to the point where if you haven\u2019t yet taken a side, one will be assigned to you.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me last week while I was away on vacation. National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg extrapolated 4 of my tweets and Voila! I\u2019m a Trump supporter.\n\nNow I don\u2019t mind being labeled a Trump supporter, even on the pages of National Review. In the interest of full disclosure I just think I should make clear that I am not. As of now Trump is 5th on my list of GOP candidates \u2014 here are some tweets to that effect Goldberg missed.\n\nWhat struck me most about Goldberg\u2019s column had nothing to do with me. What struck me is that an objectively brilliant guy, and longtime intellectual hero of mine, is clueless when it comes to Trump\u2019s obvious appeal. Moreover, like too many in the GOP Establishment, his response to Trump supporters is filled with outrage and insults.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious:\n\nTrump Detractors Have Outed Themselves: They Oppose Reagan\u2019s Big Tent\n\nAmong those Goldberg describes as the \u201cTrumpean Proletariat\u201d (for some reason the anti-Trump crowd love Marxist references) there are plenty of high-profile Trump supporters attacking the other GOP candidates. But no one in this group \u2014 and this is important \u2014 has gone so far as to attack and marginalize the everyday voters who oppose Trump.\n\nWhat\u2019s so striking is that the exact opposite is true for the anti-Trumpers among the bourgeois GOP (I\u2019m happy to play along). Ever since the rise of Trump, many among the GOP\u2019s Elite Commentariat, Thought Leaders, Establishment, and the Consultant Class have been on a rampage against \u2014 not just Trump, who is fair game \u2014 but our very own voters. I\u2019ve been watching politics for decades and until now have never seen pundits within either Party attack their own voting base. This is a very disturbing precedent.\n\nApparently, when the Republican Elite think of Reagan\u2019s Big Tent, some are more welcome than others. Illegal immigrants are welcome. Trump supporters can go pound sand.\n\nTo his credit, Goldberg doesn\u2019t hurl names at Trump\u2019s supporters but his sneering (and surprisingly clueless) incredulity does boil them down to unthinking, knee-jerk cretins:\n\nEvery principle used to defend Trump is subjective, graded on a curve. Trump is like a cat trained to piss in a human toilet. \u2026 Karl Marx coined the term lumpenproletariat to describe working-class people who could never relinquish their class consciousness and embrace the idea of a classless socialist society. Hence, they were useless to the revolutionary cause. I\u2019m no Marxist, so I don\u2019t buy the idea that anybody \u2014 never mind a whole class of people \u2014 are beyond persuasion. But I am tempted to believe that Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fans are not to be relied upon in the conservative cause.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by helping our friends among the GOP bourgeoisie with The Obvious:\n\nWhy Trump Is Winning\n\nGoldberg writes, \u201cTrump has the charisma, I\u2019ll grant him that. But there is no evidence he\u2019s thought deeply about the job beyond how much classier it will be once he has it.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean Trump\u2019s supporters should go with the same Jeb Bush who still can\u2019t answer a no-brainer question about Iraq? Scott Walker, who can\u2019t seem to answer any question? How about John \u201cJesus told me to expand the destructive Welfare State\u201d Kasich? Or maybe Mike \u201clibido\u201d Huckabee?\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump\u2019s supporters do know about their guy, and for now at least, that\u2019s good enough:\n\nTrump will build the border wall.\n\nAfter saying he would build the border wall, for two long months our corrupt media, in a desperate bid to disqualify this policy, dropped Trump in The Barrel. He was called every \u201cist\u201d in the book, boycotted by numerous business partners, and more times than I can count, called \u201croad kill\u201d by all The Smart People.\n\nThis media storm (aided by some weak-kneed Republicans) only served to boost Trump because unlike so many in the Republican Party, when confronted by a media attack, Trump not only refused to back down, he effectively fought back.\n\nThose in favor of The Wall are neither racist nor nativist nor rubes. In fact they are smarter than many of the so-called GOP intellectuals hurling those insults because The Rubes \u201cget it\u201d \u2014 they understand that our open border is an existential threat to conservatism, and by extension America. It\u2019s this simple: We either fix this problem or left-wing Democrats win a permanent majority and the Obama-era never ends.\n\nMaybe the bourgeois GOP are too \u201csmart\u201d to grasp such a simple concept. Nevertheless, it is perfectly conservative to be a one issue voter on this one issue.\n\nTrump will kill terrorists.\n\nAgain, maybe the proles aren\u2019t smart enough to grasp why bombing the oil fields funding ISIS is a bad idea. Regardless, Trump is persuasively aggressive on another existential threat to our way of life: Islamic terrorism.\n\nTrump promises to simplify the tax code and lower middle class taxes.\n\nGoldberg is correct that Trump has leapt from the flat tax to the fair tax to taxing the wealthy. But one area where he\u2019s been entirely consistent is simplifying a corrupt tax code.\n\n4. Billionaire Trump says he can\u2019t be bought by special interests.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for some to grasp just what a big deal this is. It also connects directly to simplifying a tax code corrupted beyond human comprehension by the crony capitalism that has created an indefensible tax policy. Sure, other Republican candidates claim they will do the same but Trump supporters have heard this promise many times before, and always from Republican candidates beholden to the same crony contributors who benefit from unlimited corporate welfare.\n\nTrump is a legitimate outsider.\n\nThe media hate him. The GOP establishment hates him. The grifters in the Consultant Class hate him. Newflash: A large and growing part of The Base now hate a Republican Party they see as having repeatedly sold them out on conservative issues like immigration, taxes, controlling the size of government, and kowtowing to special interests like the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThis Establishment hate is for Trump the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nTrump is expanding The Base.\n\nFor decades, as their way of life was buried with only a rusted-out factory for a tombstone, the working class among the Rustbelt have been summarily ignored by both political parties. Trump has been speaking to them for decades (China. Japan. Mexico. Trade.)\n\nWhile the bourgeois GOP push to expand the Party by pandering to millions who came here illegally, Trump hasn\u2019t forgotten the millions who got royally screwed and then forgotten and ignored after doing nothing more than playing by the rules.\n\nTrump fights \u2026 and wins.\n\nGoldberg writes, \u201cAnd now, in a moment of passion, many of my comrades-in-arms are throwing it all away in a fit of pique. Because \u2018Trump fights!\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s is a good line, a line used by many in the Establishment to mock Trump\u2019s supporters. It\u2019s also a dishonest line.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t just fight. Trump wins. The man\u2019s been declared doornail dead by the media and the Establishment more often than all the successors to Leonid Brezhnev (I\u2019m getting good at this) combined. And yet, The Donald always manages to come back stronger and in better shape than he did before.\n\nHe\u2019s beating the media. He\u2019s beating the GOP Establishment. He\u2019s beating Fox News. He\u2019s beating the hundred-million dollar man Jeb.\n\n\u2014\n\nIn summation: the so-called smart people in the GOP are gobsmacked because a large portion of the Republican base is attracted to a legitimate outsider promising to protect the border, lower our taxes, simplify the tax code, and kill terrorists. He also isn\u2019t afraid to take on the media, and he can\u2019t stop winning.\n\nBefore I move on, are there anymore questions about Trump\u2019s appeal?\n\nWhy the Establishment\u2019s Anti-Trump Attacks Aren\u2019t Working\n\nLet\u2019s take Goldberg\u2019s criticisms one by one, which by and large mirror the criticisms from the overall GOP Establishment.\n\nYes, I know Trump has declared himself pro-life. Good for him[.] \u2026 But I\u2019m at a total loss to understand why serious pro-lifers take him at his word.\n\nThis complaint is coming from the same crowd that backed Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2014 you know, the same Mitt Romney who was pro-choice most of his adult life \u2014 until right around the time he ran for president.\n\nYet, when Republicans were told that Donald Trump favors single-payer health care, support for single-payer health care jumped from 16 percent to 44 percent.\n\nFirst off, this is misleading. Trump is no longer in favor of single-payer. He has promised to repeal ObamaCare, allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines (a splendid idea), and use government to take care of the poor. Secondly, once again this complaint sounds absurd coming from the same crowd that backed Mr. Establishment in 2012: Mitt \u201cRomneyCare\u201d Romney.\n\nRick Perry in 2012 saw his candidacy implode when he couldn\u2019t remember the third item on his checklist of agencies he\u2019d close down. Well, even in that \u201coops\u201d moment, Rick Perry comes off as Lincolnesque compared with Donald Trump.\n\nImpotent rage isn\u2019t an argument. And talk about missing the point. Whose fault is it that Perry hasn\u2019t been able to effectively use four whole years to overcome a 20 second brain fart? Is it Trump\u2019s fault? Is it the fault of Trump\u2019s supporters\u2019? Is it the fault of a gnome living in a Mason jar under Roger Stone\u2019s hot tub (you know he\u2019s got one \u2014 a hot tub I mean). No, the fault lies totally and completely with Rick Perry.\n\nPerry was one of America\u2019s great governors. Unfortunately, governors don\u2019t win elections \u2014 candidates do. The reason Donald Trump has been able to triumph over his many gaffes and the rest of the Republican field is because he is a very good politician and by extension a very good presidential candidate. And guess who wins elections?\n\nIn his embarrassing interview with Hugh Hewitt Thursday night, Trump revealed he knows less than most halfway-decent D.C. interns about foreign policy.\n\nThe Hewitt interview was not Trump\u2019s finest moment but Goldberg is way overplaying his hand. While running for president both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush flubbed the exact same kind of quiz. In fact, Bush didn\u2019t completely recover from his until after he had won the nomination and debated Al Gore.\n\nLike those who backed Bush and Reagan through similar flubs, Trump\u2019s supporters know it\u2019s early, know Trump isn\u2019t dumb, and are mainly concerned with Big Picture issues. If he\u2019s going to go all the way, Trump will eventually have to show a firmer grasp of the details. But the petty bourgeois GOP pointing and laughing this early in the game says more about their desperation than anything about Trump.\n\nSo let\u2019s return to the issue of character. \u2026\n\nIf a journalist praises [Trump], that journalist is \u201cterrific.\u201d If the journalist is critical of Trump he is a \u201closer\u201d (or, in my case, a loser who can\u2019t buy pants). Not surprisingly, Hugh Hewitt is now \u201cthird rate\u201d because he made Trump look bad. I\u2019m no fan of Arianna Huffington or Gail Collins, but calling them \u201cdogs\u201d because they criticized you is not a serious ideological or intellectual retort. (It\u2019s not even clever.) I think Trump did insinuate that Megyn Kelly was menstruating during the debate.\n\nI don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s name calling. In the long-term it will undermine his candidacy and is therefore bad strategy, it is also unbecoming. Regardless, Trump is still classier than some of his Republican opponents and many among the Establishment GOP.\n\nTo his credit, Trump attacks The Powerful; people like Megyn Kelly, Gail Collins, Jonah Goldberg, Fox News, and Rosie O\u2019Donnell \u2014 people with the platform and power to hit back.\n\nCompare that to all those in the GOP Establishment currently attacking everyday VOTERS as thick, nativist, racist, and crazy.\n\nCompare that to Establishment Darling Chris Christie yelling at school teachers.\n\nCompare that to Mitt Romney writing off 47% of the American population as lost and hopeless.\n\nCompare that to Rick Perry telling those demanding the law be enforced that they have no heart.\n\nCompare that to Jeb Bush attacking those same people for not recognizing that this lawlessness is an \u201cact of love.\u201d\n\nAt least Trump picks on people his own size.\n\nChew on this piece of Science: Trump can be rude but he still hasn\u2019t gone as far as the Obama campaign in accusing his opponent of murdering someone. He hasn\u2019t gone as far as the media in burning down two black working class neighborhoods to further an agenda. He hasn\u2019t gone as far as the bourgeois GOP in attacking and insulting and marginalizing 30% of our own base.\n\nThe Bourgeois GOP Is Mad For One Reason: They Are Losing\n\nTrump is far from the perfect candidate or the perfect conservative. But he is winning, and that\u2019s why the Establishment is so furious they are now launching feckless and oftentimes hypocritical attacks against him, and in some cases, going so far as to launch suicide attacks against their own voters\n\nThis much is true: Trump does fight like a Leftist \u2014 he fights to win, and I\u2019m sorry if some of those tactics offend the same fuddy-duddies whose approach to politics and candidates have lost the popular vote in 5 of the last 6 presidential elections.\n\nIf Trump is nothing more than a cat trained to piss in a toilet, what does it say about his detractors that they can\u2019t do even that?\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonah Goldberg and the Anti-Trump Bourgeoisie", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jonah Goldberg and the Anti-Trump Bourgeoisie", "title": "Jonah Goldberg and the Anti-Trump Bourgeoisie - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 644, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-485944742.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-08T14:41:42-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/08/jonah-goldberg-and-the-feckless-anti-trump-bourgeoisie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jonah Goldberg and the Anti-Trump Bourgeoisie", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/GettyImages-485944742.jpg", "title": "Jonah Goldberg and the Anti-Trump Bourgeoisie - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Consultant Class, Donald Trump 2016, Jonah Goldberg, National Review,Big Government, Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-08T12:55:16-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-09-08T14:41:42-07:00", "tag": "National Review", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd221\"", "article_summary": "Why the Establishment\u2019s Anti-Trump Attacks Aren\u2019t WorkingLet\u2019s take Goldberg\u2019s criticisms one by one, which by and large mirror the criticisms from the overall GOP Establishment.\nWhat\u2019s so striking is that the exact opposite is true for the anti-Trumpers among the bourgeois GOP (I\u2019m happy to play along).\nCompare that to all those in the GOP Establishment currently attacking everyday VOTERS as thick, nativist, racist, and crazy.\nMoreover, like too many in the GOP Establishment, his response to Trump supporters is filled with outrage and insults.\nHere\u2019s what Trump\u2019s supporters do know about their guy, and for now at least, that\u2019s good enough:Trump will build the border wall."}
