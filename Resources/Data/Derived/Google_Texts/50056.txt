For the first time in more than two years, the Ultimate Fighting Championship will host a mixed martial arts card in Colorado when UFC Fight Night plays out in Broomfield on Valentine’s Day.

The UFC announced Saturday that UFC Fight Night — with a card still to be announced — will take place at the FirstBank Center in Broomfield on Feb. 14. The fights will air nationally on Fox Sports 1.

Tickets for the event will go on sale sometime in December, the UFC said.

The UFC last hosted a major MMA event in 2012, when Benson Henderson won the lightweight championship from Frankie Edgar and Denver native Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone defeated Melvin Guillard.

That event — UFC 150 at the Pepsi Center — celebrated the UFC’s return to Colorado. The first two UFC events, UFC 1 and 2, took place in Denver in 1993 and 1994.

UFC 150, though, suffered a dip in attendance after Colorado struggled through a summer of wildfires and the Aurora theater shooting.
