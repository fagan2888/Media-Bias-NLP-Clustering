Perplexing.\n\nAfter all, I don\u2019t work for an exempted religious organization or a company such as Hobby Lobby, which in a Supreme Court case last year won the right to deny contraceptive coverage because of conflicting beliefs. And the same pills\u2014Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo\u2014cost me nothing under my old health plan. Sure, I had switched insurance companies in the new year (to Aetna, the third largest in the country), but I\u2019d opted for a high-premium Gold plan. A monthly copay on par with the cost of an iPod shuffle seemed hefty and unfair.\n\nSo I left the pharmacy empty handed and went home to call Aetna.\n\nMy happiness was brief when a customer service agent informed me that\u2014while most brand-name pills had a copay\u2014I could simply switch to a free generic version of the same compound. The problem? Turns out there is no generic version of Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo yet. So I was trapped, much like women whose insurance companies have denied them coverage for the NuvaRing, reasoning that they can take generic pills with the same hormones\u2014even though the Department of Health and Human Services has been clear that the ring is a distinct form of contraception (and should therefore be free).\n\nI hesitated to simply choose a different generic for a reason that should not surprise the many other women who have tried multiple birth control methods: Switching from pill to pill in the past caused me side effects, which thankfully subsided once I finally found one that worked for me.\n\n\u201cPeople respond differently to different pills and a change can cause side effects like irregular bleeding and headaches,\u201d says Jill Rabin, an ob-gyn and professor at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine. \u201cThere\u2019s no predicting how someone will do unless they try it.\u201d\n\nThe pressure I felt to switch seemed especially unjust given this aspect of the law: While women can be charged a copay for brand name drugs when an equivalent generic is available, this Department of Labor FAQ explains, \u201cif, however, a generic version is not available, or would not be medically appropriate for the patient\u201d as determined by her doctor, \u201cthen a plan or issuer must provide coverage for the brand name drug \u2026 without cost-sharing.\u201d\n\nWhen I brought my dilemma (and the fact that I was a journalist planning to write about it) to Aetna\u2019s director of communications, Susan Millerick, she took swift action. Within a week, I had my Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo, free of copay.\n\n\u201cIt is always Aetna\u2019s intent to abide by the laws that govern our health benefits coverage, and to fairly interpret and apply all laws and regulatory guidance on behalf of our customers and members,\u201d Millerick wrote in an email.\n\nMillerick\u2019s explanation for what had happened suggests any woman would be wise to question any insurer denial for contraceptive; she said Aetna\u2019s \u201cservice reps erred\u201d in not telling me about the option to appeal the copay. I should have been told that I could just ask my doctor to call and verify that I really needed my pill and that a different generic would not suffice.\n\nThe good news for many women is that simply being informed of your options\u2014and getting your doctor on your side\u2014may be enough to go from paying a wallet-draining copay to nothing at all, says Rabin.\n\n\u201cFiguring out the best contraception that minimizes cost and maximizes efficacy is a conversation that should be between doctor and patient,\u201d Rabin says. \u201cMost doctors don\u2019t want that decision taken out of their hands and would be happy to help make that call for their patients.\u201d\n\nFor those women who encounter more resistance than I did\u2014or find, as Kaiser Health News reported, that certain insurers are even trying to wriggle out of covering generics\u2014there are other resources to turn to, like the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Their website has clear instructions on how to fight back if you think your insurer is unfairly denying you free birth control, with templates for appeal letters and a free hotline (866-745-5487) for additional assistance.\n\nEven with all the progress, thousands of women have been contacting the NWLC\u2019s hotline in recent months after running into problems getting free contraceptives, says Mara Gandal-Powers, a lawyer at the NWLC.\n\nGenerally, the biggest obstacle to free birth control access right now is ignorance, she says. Many women\u2014and their insurance representatives, doctors, and pharmacists\u2014aren\u2019t on the same page about whether their particular contraception should have a copay or not. Instead of doing a double take at the cost of their contraceptives, Gandal-Powers says, some women never question the charge.\n\nThat\u2019s a compelling reason to double check your insurer, pharmacist, and even doctor\u2019s assumptions.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a lot of education that still needs to happen,\u201d says Gandal-Powers, \u201cnot just among women themselves but also among health care providers and pharmacists.\u201d\n\nBeyond a lack of education, a few more obstacles to universally free birth control remain. Besides the religious exemption, there\u2019s also a subset of insurance plans that are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in such a way that they don\u2019t have to cover contraception right away\u2014though they will in coming years. Enrollment in grandfathered plans is dropping, with only 26% of covered workers enrolled in a grandfathered health plan in 2014, down from 56% in 2011, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another exception is self-funded student plans.\n\nThe takeaway? If you\u2019re paying more than $0 for birth control, it can\u2019t hurt to do a little digging. If you are lucky (and persistent), you could end up pushing your insurer to better comply with the law\u2014and save hundreds of dollars a year, to boot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Free contraception is available to most women now, but a lack of information means some are still paying out of pocket\u2014even when they shouldn't be.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Most women with private health insurance can get contraception for free, but a lack of information means some are still paying out of pocket\u2014even when they shouldn't be.", "title": "Why You're Still Paying for Birth Control Even Though It's \"Free\" Now", "url": "http://time.com/money/3672529/free-birth-control-aca-obamacare-insurers-must-cover/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150211_ff_birthcontrol.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150211_ff_birthcontrol.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Most women with private health insurance can get contraception for free, but a lack of information means some are still paying out of pocket\u2014even when they shouldn't be.", "site": "MONEY", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why You're Still Paying for Birth Control Even Though It's \"Free\" Now"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", aca, aetna, affordable care act, birth control, birth control pill, contraception, cost of health care, free birth control, generic, generic birth control, health care, health insurance, how to get free birth control, insurance, iuds, nuvaring, obamacare, ortho tri-cyclen, ortho tri-cyclen lo, ortho tri-cyclen lo generic, the pill", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aca, aetna, affordable care act, birth control, birth control pill, contraception, cost of health care, free birth control, generic, generic birth control, health care, health insurance, how to get free birth control, insurance, iuds, nuvaring, obamacare, ortho tri-cyclen, ortho tri-cyclen lo, ortho tri-cyclen lo generic, the pill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd873c\"", "article_summary": "Generally, the biggest obstacle to free birth control access right now is ignorance, she says.\nIf you\u2019re paying more than $0 for birth control, it can\u2019t hurt to do a little digging.\nA record scratch sounded in my head one weeknight this January, when a pharmacist at my local drugstore told me my birth control pills would\u2014for the first time\u2014cost more than $50 a month.\nTheir website has clear instructions on how to fight back if you think your insurer is unfairly denying you free birth control, with templates for appeal letters and a free hotline (866-745-5487) for additional assistance.\nAnd the same pills\u2014Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo\u2014cost me nothing under my old health plan."}
