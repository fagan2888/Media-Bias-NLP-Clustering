They loaded the man, Ali Reda, into an armored SUV.\n\nThen militia reinforcements descended, surrounded the police and demanded Reda be freed. Weapons were drawn. The minister, Mohammed al-Ghabban, the highest figure in Iraq\u2019s police force, frantically called Baghdad from inside his SUV.\n\nIn the end, al-Ghabban surrendered his prisoner and left empty-handed, angry and humiliated.\n\nThe standoff in mid-January, described to The Associated Press by six different officials and militia leaders, was a stark example of the power that Shiite militias have accrued in Iraq and their boldness in wielding it.\n\nThese militias, many of them backed by Iran, mobilized in 2014 to fight Sunni extremists from the Islamic State group. However, they are now showing no intention of standing down after the battle, demanding instead to be a major force shaping Iraq. That prospect worries not only Iraq\u2019s Sunni minority but also officials in the military and the Shiite-led government, who fear the militias will dominate Iraq the way the Revolutionary Guard does Iran and the guerrilla group Hezbollah does Lebanon.\n\nTwo top generals warned that the army could eventually come to blows with the militias, known collectively as the \u201cHashd,\u201d Arabic for \u201cmobilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey (the militias) have now infiltrated the government and are meddling in politics,\u201d said Ali Omran, commander of the army\u2019s 5th Infantry Division and a veteran of numerous battles against IS. \u201cI told the Hashd people that one day I and my men may fight them.\u201d\n\nThe more than 50 Shiite militias in Iraq have between 60,000 and 140,000 fighters, according to estimates from the government and the Hashd itself. They are backed by tanks and weapons, and have their own intelligence agency, operations rooms and court of law.\n\nThe larger militias, like Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Hezbollah Brigades, Badr and the Peace Brigades, have been in place since soon after the 2003 ouster of Saddam Hussein. They are linked to political parties, effectively forming armed branches for politicians.\n\nBut the ranks of the militias swelled dramatically after IS overran nearly a third of Iraq in the summer of 2014 and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq\u2019s top Shiite cleric, called on able-bodied males to fight IS. At the time, tens of thousands turned out.\n\nThose same militias now want to remain a permanent, independent armed force and are resisting attempts to integrate them into the military or police, the AP found from interviews with more than 15 government officials, army generals and militia leaders and visits to Tikrit and Samarra, Sunni-majority areas where the militias now hold power. The militias insist they have earned a special status, pointing to the 5,000 militiamen killed and 16,000 wounded fighting IS.\n\n\u201cThose who sacrificed more are entitled to more,\u201d said Hamed al-Jazaeery, head of the al-Khorasani Brigades militia. \u201cWhat is written with blood cannot be removed. It is not ink on paper.\u201d\n\nAl-Jazaeery wears the black turban of a cleric and the camouflage fatigues of a fighter. The walls of his office are adorned with photos of the leader of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and its current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Other photos show al-Jazaeery posing with Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani, the powerful Revolutionary Guard figure who helped organize the Iraqi militias against IS.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a third power in Iraq,\u201d alongside the army and police, al-Jazaeery said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the Hashd be like the Revolutionary Guard in Iran?\u201d\n\nThe model of the Revolutionary Guard, often cited by militia leaders, would be a dramatic change for Iraq\u2019s militias. In Iran, the Guard is an elite force independent of \u2014 and better armed than \u2014 the military, tasked with \u201cprotecting\u201d the Shiite cleric-led power structure. It is effectively a state within a state, rivaling the political strength of Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\n\nSunnis fear such militia power would enforce Shiite domination of Iraq. Sunnis already accuse militias of targeting them with abuses. Hundreds of green and red Shiite banners and images of imams \u2014 historic religious leaders revered by the Shiites \u2014 are posted all over Sunni areas under militia control north and east of Baghdad, in a blatant challenge to sectarian sensitivities.\n\nThe militias call themselves \u201choly\u201d or \u201cglorious,\u201d and often talk of their battle as a fight for Shiism rather than Iraq. They give Shiite names to major offensives, only for the government to ban their use.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "title": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "title": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/21/fears_in_iraqi_government_army_over_shiite_militias_power/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/aptopix-mideast-iraq-militias-threat.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "title": "Fears in Iraqi government, army over Shiite militias\u2019 power", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/aptopix-mideast-iraq-militias-threat.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hamza Hendawi and Qassim Abdul-zahra", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Other photos show al-Jazaeery posing with Iranian Gen.
