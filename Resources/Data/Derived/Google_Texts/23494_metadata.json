(Photo: azcentral)\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service warns that unscrupulous tax preparers have told consumers to pay them directly instead of the federal government to settle potential fines assessed to those who don't have health insurance.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, uninsured residents who don't qualify for a coverage exemption are required to make a payment with their 2014 federal income tax return. The IRS has since received several reports of tax preparers instructing clients to make that payment, known as an individual shared responsibility payment, directly to the preparer.\n\nOfficials at the IRS are reminding taxpayers that the payment should only be made with their tax return or in response to a letter from the IRS, never to an individual.\n\nSeveral of those targeted in the scam already have coverage or qualify for an exemption, the IRS said, but scammers use several different methods to convince taxpayers that they still must pay the penalty.\n\nMORE: Arizonans take advantage of free tax filing for refunds\n\nScam artists tend to use a variety of methods to extract the payment, including targeting individuals who speak limited English or telling people that they must pay the individual preparer due to their immigration status, the IRS said in a press release.\n\nSome have also promised a lower payment amount if a client pays them directly, the IRS said.\n\nThe IRS said individuals should choose their tax professional carefully and report scams to the federal agency.\n\nSeveral groups are exempt from the individual shared responsibility payment, including those who don't earn enough to file a federal tax return, members of federally recognized Native American tribes, religious objectors, prisoners, undocumented immigrants and others.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1MDJ7m0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Unscrupulous tax preparers are telling taxpayers to pay fines for lack of health insurance to them instead of the government, the IRS warns.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Unscrupulous tax preparers are telling taxpayers to pay fines for lack of health insurance to them instead of the government, the IRS warns.", "title": "IRS: New tax scam targets health-insurance fines", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2015/03/15/irs-warns-taxpayers-of-new-health-care-fines-scam-abrk/24822103/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unscrupulous tax preparers are telling taxpayers to pay fines for lack of health insurance to them instead of the government, the IRS warns.", "title": "IRS: New tax scam targets health-insurance fines", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d9f72bfa709491868b46553187065cd29b2c7215/c=226-221-736-732&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/03/05//1394001415011-azc-health.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html;
