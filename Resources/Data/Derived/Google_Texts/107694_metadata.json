A protester, using the group\u2019s own speaker system, responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to demand a genuine choice for the territory\u2019s voters.\n\n\u201cDo something good for Hong Kong. We want real democracy!\u201d he shouted.\n\nChina has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government\u2019s crackdown. The clashes \u2014 images of which have been beamed around the world \u2014 are undermining Hong Kong\u2019s image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping\u2019s government. Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party\u2019s monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country\u2019s far west.\n\nThe mass protests are the strongest challenge yet to Beijing\u2019s decision last month to reject open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections for Hong Kong\u2019s leader, promised for 2017. Instead, candidates must continue to be hand-picked by Beijing \u2014 a move that many residents viewed as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nWith rumors swirling, the Beijing-backed and deeply unpopular Leung reassured the public that speculation that the Chinese army might intervene was untrue.\n\n\u201cI hope the public will keep calm. Don\u2019t be misled by the rumors. Police will strive to maintain social order, including ensuring smooth traffic and ensuring the public safety,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWhen they carry out their duties, they will use their maximum discretion.\u201d\n\nThe protest has been spearheaded largely but student-age activists but has gathered momentum among a broad range of people from high school students to the elderly.\n\nProtesters also occupied streets in other parts of Hong Kong Island, including the upscale shopping area of Causeway Bay as well as across the harbor in densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula. The city\u2019s transport department said roads in those areas were closed.\n\nMore than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area. Authorities said some schools in areas near the main protest site would be closed.\n\nLeung urged people to go home, obey the law and avoid causing trouble.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Hong Kong to be messy,\u201d he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday.\n\nThat came hours after police lobbed canisters of tear gas into the crowd on Sunday evening. The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing, though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals.\n\nTo ward off tear gas, demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap, which they used to cover their face and arms, as well as umbrellas, goggles and surgical masks.\n\nThe protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "title": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "title": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/29/pro_democracy_protests_expand_in_hong_kong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/hong-kong-democracy-protest.jpeg14-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "title": "Pro-democracy protests expand in Hong Kong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/hong-kong-democracy-protest.jpeg14-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kelvin Chan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e04\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t want Hong Kong to be messy,\u201d he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday.\nChina has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government\u2019s crackdown.\n\u201cDo something good for Hong Kong.\nA protester, using the group\u2019s own speaker system, responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to demand a genuine choice for the territory\u2019s voters.\nThe clashes \u2014 images of which have been beamed around the world \u2014 are undermining Hong Kong\u2019s image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping\u2019s government."}
