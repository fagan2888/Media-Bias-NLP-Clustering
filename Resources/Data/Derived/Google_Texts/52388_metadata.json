But as Trump and Carson prepare for another crucial Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colorado on Wednesday, the gloves are definitely coming off.\n\nRelated: Carson steals lead from Trump in key state of Iowa: survey\n\nWith two new polls showing Carson surging ahead of Trump in Iowa, Trump has begun lashing out with the same tactics he has used effectively against former Florida governor Jeb Bush earlier this year \u2013 saying that Carson lacks the energy and negotiating smarts to be president and that he is too soft on immigration. \u201cCarson is lower energy than Bush,\u201d Trump declared during a Jacksonville, Florida rally on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCarson immediately retorted in Iowa that \u201cMy energy levels are perfectly fine,\u201d noting that he often spent as many as 15 to 20 hours in the operating room during his career as a nationally renowned surgeon. In an obvious reference to Trump\u2019s showboating, combative political style, Carson added that \u201cjumping up and down and screaming\u201d doesn\u2019t qualify one to be president.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press today, Carson said that Trump and other critics often mistake his soft-spoken manner as a sign of a lack of energy. \u201cI have plenty of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, I am soft-spoken. \u201cI do have a tendency to be relaxed. I wasn't always like that. There was a time when I was, you know, very volatile. But, you know, I changed.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump also veered into more treacherous political territory \u2013 and may have offended the state\u2019s politically active evangelical Christians -- by singling out Carson\u2019s Seventh-day Adventist faith and suggesting that it somehow puts his chief rival on the religious fringes when contrasted with Trump\u2019s more \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d Presbyterian faith.\n\nRelated: The Media Finally Wakes Up to the Ben Carson Phenomenon\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Presbyterian,\u201d Trump said on Saturday in Jacksonville. \u201cBoy, that\u2019s down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventist I don\u2019t know about. I just don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nCarson angrily demanded an apology. He also suggested during an interview on Fox News Sunday that Trump\u2019s outbursts might be a sign of desperation, especially his attack on Carson\u2019s religious faith after complaining two months ago that Carson had improperly questioned his own faith.\n\nBack in September, Carson caused a stir when he credited his faith for his success in life and contrasted that with Trump, who had said that he never asked God for forgiveness and refused to cite his favorite Bible verse. Carson later apologized.\n\n\u201cHe went a little ballistic on that, so it seems a little interesting that he would now be doing that,\u201d Carson said. \u201cYou know, I really refuse to get in the mud pit. You know, Hillary [Clinton] was actually right when she said the Republicans are there trying to destroy each other. I really think that was a huge mistake in the last [presidential election] cycle, and I\u2019m certainly not going to get into that no matter what anybody says.\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP Presidential Campaign Rapidly Turning into a Two-Man Race\n\nEvangelical voters make up a substantial part of the Iowa\u2019s Republican base, and it\u2019s a group that Trump has had difficulty wooing. Why he called out Carson on being a Seventh Day Adventist and further offending evangelicals more generally is hard to fathom.\n\nBy Sunday, Trump was back-pedaling on the controversy, even while refusing to apologize to Carson for having raised the topic in the first place. Questioned by George Stephanopoulos of ABC News\u2019 This Week on why he even brought up the subject, Trump sputtered, \u201cI just don\u2019t know about that particular religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never say bad about any religion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t know about it.\u2019 That\u2019s not an insult.\u201d\n\nFor a front-running candidate who lives and breathes polling results and who has been riding the crest of an anti-establishment movement in his party, Trump suddenly has something to worry about.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Until now, Donald Trump and Ben Carson have been content to co-exist as the two Republ", "title": "Trump Knocks Carson as a Seventh Day Adventist as Iowa Polls Shift", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/25/Trump-Knocks-Carson-Seventh-Day-Adventist-Iowa-Polls-Shift", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/25/Trump-Knocks-Carson-Seventh-Day-Adventist-Iowa-Polls-Shift", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Until now, Donald Trump and Ben Carson have been content to co-exist as the two Republ", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But as Trump and Carson prepare for another crucial Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colorado on Wednesday, the gloves are definitely coming off.\nI mean, Seventh-day Adventist I don\u2019t know about.\nWhy he called out Carson on being a Seventh Day Adventist and further offending evangelicals more generally is hard to fathom.\nUntil now, Donald Trump and Ben Carson have been content to co-exist as the two Republican \u201coutsiders\u201d dominating the presidential campaign scene.\n\u201cCarson is lower energy than Bush,\u201d Trump declared during a Jacksonville, Florida rally on Saturday."}
