That\u2019s about it.\n\nBut those similarities, Pena said, landed him in jail for a crime to which Niemeyer later confessed.\n\n\u201cIt was a big, big mistake by the police department,\u201d said Pena, who owns an auto shop in Tampa.\n\nDavis worked for him until 2011, Pena said. On Jan. 19, police say, Niemeyer borrowed a rental car that was under Davis\u2019 name and robbed three HHGregg appliance stores. Using the license plate on the car, investigators traced it back to Davis, and used their computer system to look up her known associates.\n\nAn old driver\u2019s license photo of Pena came up, and an employee at one of the HHGregg stores told police he was \u201c80 percent sure\u201d he was the thief, Pena was told. So, on Jan. 26, a Tampa police detective knocked on Pena\u2019s front door and put him in handcuffs.\n\nA Hillsborough County sheriff\u2019s deputy arrested Niemeyer on a warrant three days later, and eventually the younger man admitted he was the one who committed the crime, authorities said.\n\nNiemeyer remains in the Hillsborough County jail without bail, while Pena said he still is waiting on official notification that the charges against him have been dropped.\n\nPena could have proven through credit card receipts and transactions that he was with his girlfriend all day when the robberies occurred, he said. The Hillsborough deputy told Pena he didn\u2019t think he did it, and the security guard at the store wasn\u2019t positive he picked the right photo.\n\nSo why was he forced to spend a night in jail?\n\n\u201cI was clearly the wrong person, and they arrested me,\u201d Pena said. \u201cI have no priors, no nothing.\u201d\n\nNiemeyer is accused of robbing three HHGregg stores \u2014 one in Tampa and two in Brandon. Because two were in the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office jurisdiction, a deputy also was investigating the case, police department spokeswoman Laura McElroy said.\n\nAt the Tampa store, the police detective had an ID from the store security guard and some grainy surveillance footage that showed a man similar to the guard\u2019s description of the robber, McElroy said.\n\nThe day after Pena bonded out of jail, new surveillance footage surfaced that showed the robbery from a different, closer angle. The man in that footage \u2014 the 215-pound Niemeyer \u2014 was obviously much bigger than the 190-pound Pena, McElroy said. The department met with the state attorney\u2019s office the next day to start the process of dropping the charges.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Niemeyer confessed to committing the crime, McElroy said. He is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nAfter reviewing the case, the police department found that the detective did not follow proper procedure during the investigation.\n\nPena\u2019s arrest would have been prevented \u2014 even though he was picked out of the photo lineup \u2014 if the detective had gotten the second surveillance video \u201cin a timely manner\u201d like she was supposed to, McElroy said.\n\nThe detective was given a letter of counseling after the internal investigation was concluded, McElroy said.\n\nThe photo lineup was conducted according to the recommendations of The Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating people who have been wrongfully convicted, McElroy said.\n\nA package of six photos \u2014 one of the suspect and five people who resemble the suspect \u2014 are shown to an eyewitness, one at a time. An officer who is not working the case and does not know who the suspect shows the photos, so he or she doesn\u2019t unintentionally give a cue that could potentially influence the witness.\n\n\u201cThe reason for that is to try and prevent misidentification,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cBecause the last thing we want is the wrong person to be arrested.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, those safeguards can fail \u2014 although that rarely happens, McElroy said.\n\nIn December, Tampa police arrested 19-year-old James Allen Wade after a witness mistakenly identified him as a suspect in a murder case.\n\nDepartment officials in both Wade\u2019s and Pena\u2019s cases have been working with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to have the charges expunged from their records, McElroy said. Pena\u2019s mugshot has been taken down from the jail website.\n\n\u201cWitness identification is a difficult process and that\u2019s why they always continue investigating in order to gather physical evidence to corroborate witness statements,\u201d McElroy said.\n\nHuman memory isn\u2019t always accurate, said Karen Newirth, a senior fellow with The Innocence Project. The \u201cbest practices\u201d her organization recommends for photo lineups are simply meant to prevent memory contamination after the fact, she said.\n\n\u201cEven under the best conditions, people make mistakes,\u201d she said.\n\nAt least in terms of the photo lineup, the Tampa Police Department seems to have done everything right, Newirth said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t give any comfort to Pena, who said his business has suffered since his arrest.\n\n\u201cAs far as what they\u2019re doing right, it stops right there,\u201d Pena said.\n\nHe still doesn\u2019t understand how a trained detective could arrest him when the detective had proof Pena didn\u2019t commit the crime. The sheriff\u2019s deputy who was investigating the case didn\u2019t believe it was him, but the police detective told him she was \u201c100 percent sure he did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the interview time, that\u2019s where everything fell apart,\u201d Pena said.\n\nAn officer visited him last week to apologize and explain the error, Pena said. But he doesn\u2019t have a piece of paper proving the charges against him were officially expunged from his record. He also hasn\u2019t been refunded the $200 he paid in bail.\n\nWhat Pena does have are questions about the dependability about the department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is how reliable is the Tampa Police Department when it comes to their detectives,\u201d Pena said.\n\n\u201cThese people can ruin someone\u2019s life in a minute.\u201d\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 22 Feb 2015 15:00:45 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Daniel Pena and David Niemeyer Jr. don\u2019t have a lot in common.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Daniel Pena and David Niemeyer Jr. don\u2019t have a lot in common.", "title": "False arrest causes Tampa business owner to question system", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/false-arrest-causes-tampa-business-owner-to-question-system-20150222/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2015-02-22T15:00:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "False arrest causes Tampa business owner to question system"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-22T15:00:45Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T15:00:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4dd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe question is how reliable is the Tampa Police Department when it comes to their detectives,\u201d Pena said.\nThe man in that footage \u2014 the 215-pound Niemeyer \u2014 was obviously much bigger than the 190-pound Pena, McElroy said.\nSo, on Jan. 26, a Tampa police detective knocked on Pena\u2019s front door and put him in handcuffs.\n\u201cIt was a big, big mistake by the police department,\u201d said Pena, who owns an auto shop in Tampa.\nThe Hillsborough deputy told Pena he didn\u2019t think he did it, and the security guard at the store wasn\u2019t positive he picked the right photo."}
