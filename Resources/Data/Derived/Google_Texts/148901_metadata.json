Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s New York office, that Congress vote against the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\n\u201cChange your vote!\u201d chants reverberated through the crowd after former Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Gillibrand decided to back the accord last month.\n\n\u201cSince the agreement was signed in the middle of July, [Iran] still says at the highest level they\u2019re going to continue to support terrorism, they\u2019re going to annihilate Israel and death to America,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cHow can you make an agreement with a country that wants to kill you?\u201d\n\nLieberman joined Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina along with U.S. veterans, Jewish leaders, and state politicians to protest the accord during the \u201cStop Iran Rally.\u201d\n\nThe 7,000 people police estimated in attendance coalesced to urge lawmakers to reject the agreement among Iran, the U.S., and five other world powers aiming to end Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in return for international sanctions relief.\n\nLieberman said the deal does not accomplish this goal, but instead gives Iran a \u201clegitimate, legalized path\u201d to a nuclear weapon while still lifting U.S. economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis agreement is full of holes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe highlighted the provision allowing Iran to delay international inspections for 24 days and the secret agreement with the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency enabling Tehran to inspect its own sites.\n\nGraham said those who support the deal are \u201ccrazy\u201d to vote for an accord with hidden provisions that allows the Iranians to inspect themselves, backhanding President Barack Obama\u2019s comments calling opponents of the Iran deal \u201ccrazies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy to give the ayatollah a hundred billion dollars. He\u2019s not going to build roads and bridges and schools. You might as well write the check to Hezbollah,\u201d Graham said.\n\nHe vowed to introduce additional sanctions on Iran until it stops supporting terrorism and said he would \u201ccut off every penny\u201d to the U.N. unless they give the U.S. access to the entire agreement.\n\nThe speakers lauded New York\u2019s senior Sen. Chuck Schumer for coming out against the deal while forcefully urging Gillibrand to rethink her support.\n\nThe rally began just hours after Obama cinched critical support from Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware, propelling the accord to nearly assured passage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"How can you make an agreement with a country that wants to kill you?\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"How can you make an agreement with a country that wants to kill you?\u201d", "title": "Thousands Take to New York Streets to Protest Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150901_IranRally_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-02T23:20:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JBBUlC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"How can you make an agreement with a country that wants to kill you?\u201d", "title": "Thousands Take to New York Streets to Protest Iran Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150901_IranRally_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-02T14:02:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T23:20:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran deal, Kirsten Gillibrand, Lindsey Graham, Joseph Lieberman, Chuck Schumer, Chris Coons, Bob Casey"}, "article_summary": "Thousands of protesters poured into Manhattan Tuesday evening to demand, outside Sen.
