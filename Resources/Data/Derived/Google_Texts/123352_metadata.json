The Times observes, \u201cSince 2000, the share of 16-to-19-year-olds who are working has plummeted by 40 percent, with fewer than a third of American teenagers in a job last summer.\u201d\n\nThe Times further points out that this is a low point in historical terms for the workforce\u2019s share of youngsters.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMinimum wage statutes have passed in a large number of states in recent years, driving young people out of the workforce; Obamacare has made it easy to obtain health insurance by not working; and companies simply don\u2019t have the time and cash available to train fresh workers.\n\nNonetheless, the Times finds the phenomenon of unemployed teenagers utterly baffling:\n\nExperts are struggling to figure out exactly why\u2026 What is clear is that those who need a job the most are often the least likely to get one. To a large extent, the higher a household\u2019s income, the more likely a teenager is to get a job. Suburbanites have a better shot than city dwellers, and white teenagers face far better odds than blacks\u2026\n\nYes, racism, as always, is the Times\u2019s answer. Well, racism and the proliferation of summer school, as well as the prevalence of summer vacation. Oh yes, and, as always, the need for more government spending: \u201cthe decline in government support for summer jobs has been steep.\u201d The Times quotes New York City\u2019s acting assistant commissioner of youth workforce development, who says, \u201cThe federal government has walked away from summer jobs nationally.\u201d\n\nThe gall of the federal government! If only New York City had a socialist mayor willing to increase taxes to skyrocket local spending. Oh, wait.\n\nBut the Times\u2019s lamentation continues:\n\nThe absence of work means more than having no money for a mobile phone or a night out with friends. A summer job can provide essential experience that is crucial to snagging better jobs later, experts say\u2026 The drop-off in summer jobs for teenagers is an echo of the outsize drop in overall teenage employment year round. And it is one of several puzzling changes in the American labor force. Across nearly every group, the share of people \u2014 men in particular \u2014 without a paying job has been on the rise. The United States, which once boasted of having one of the highest labor force participation rates among advanced industrialized nations, is now languishing far behind.\n\nThe lack of summer jobs is only puzzling if you are completely invested in the success of President Obama\u2019s economic program. Workforce participation rates are now at three-decade lows. That\u2019s because Obama\u2019s spending programs have misdirected resources, stifled job growth, and driven companies to save rather than hire. It\u2019s because Obama\u2019s allies at state and local levels have increased restrictions on hiring, making it less cost effective to give people a shot while they\u2019re still in high school or fresh out of it.\n\nBut no matter! The riddle may never be solved. Unless, of course, the Times convinces the feds to spend more money. The Soviet Union, after all, had 100 percent teenage workforce participation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Friday, The New York Times seemed completely bewildered by the plummeting rate of teenagers in the workforce.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Friday, The New York Times seemed completely bewildered by the plummeting rate of teenagers in the workforce.", "title": "NYTimes: Where Are the Working Teenagers? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/employment_guide_AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/07/03/nytimes-where-are-the-working-teenagers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Friday, The New York Times seemed completely bewildered by the plummeting rate of teenagers in the workforce.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/employment_guide_AP.jpg", "title": "NYTimes: Where Are the Working Teenagers? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "minimum wage, New York Times, NY Times, Teenagers, workforce, working, Youth Unemployment,Big Journalism, Economics, Obama,teenagers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Youth Unemployment", "published_time": "2015-07-03T20:35:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism,Obama,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28f8\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Friday, The New York Times seemed completely bewildered by the plummeting rate of teenagers in the workforce.\nThe lack of summer jobs is only puzzling if you are completely invested in the success of President Obama\u2019s economic program.\nThe Soviet Union, after all, had 100 percent teenage workforce participation.\nA summer job can provide essential experience that is crucial to snagging better jobs later, experts say\u2026 The drop-off in summer jobs for teenagers is an echo of the outsize drop in overall teenage employment year round.\nWorkforce participation rates are now at three-decade lows."}
