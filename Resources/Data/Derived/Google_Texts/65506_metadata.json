In some ways, the Austin, Texas conference becomes the closest thing America has to Davos, where the World Economic Forum takes place annually.\n\n\n\nYet this time around, SXSW has come to resemble Davos in more ways than one. While technology has always co-mingled with politics, the 2016 SXSW conference kicked it up a notch.\n\nOn Friday, President Barack Obama kicked off the event with a keynote speech, a SXSW first for a sitting president, and his wife is also due to address the conference later this week (also a first). And alongside the president and first lady were a number of White House operatives who were fixtures in several of SXSW's countless panel discussions.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Obama called on the tech community to help solve government issues and increase civic engagement. \"We are at a moment in history where technology, globalization, our economy is changing so fast,\" he said to a packed room at the Long Center in Austin, TX.\n\n\n\nRead MoreObama: 'Absolutist' views on encryption don't work\n\nHe acknowledged that his past political campaigns were known for, \"having really cool technology, and social media,\" and defended his work in the White House.\n\nObama gave a list of his accomplishments during his tenure that boosted the role of technology, including student aid, Social Security, and his controversial health care plan. The Affordable Care Act had a famously rocky roll out, and was plagued with technical difficulties for months.\n\n\n\nWith his time in office growing shorter, Obama asked the conferees \"how can we start coming up with new platforms, new ideas, new approaches across disciplines and across skill sets to solve some of the big problems that we're facing today?\"\n\n\n\nHe also asked attendees to visit the White House website and its platforms to submit ideas.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "This year, the event some refer to affectionately as \"Spring Break for nerds\" is attracting a new brand of geek \u2014 the political kind.", "news_keywords": "SXSW, interactive, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, technology, politics,", "author": "Uptin Saiidi", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The event some refer to affectionately as \"Spring Break for nerds\" is attracting a new brand of geek \u2014 the political kind.", "title": "SXSW's 'Spring Break nerds' get political", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/at-sxsws-spring-break-for-nerds-a-growing-political-contingent.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/17/103396596-RTX26TKG.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The event some refer to affectionately as \"Spring Break for nerds\" is attracting a new brand of geek \u2014 the political kind.", "creator": "@uptin", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/at-sxsws-spring-break-for-nerds-a-growing-political-contingent.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/17/103396596-RTX26TKG.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "At SXSW's 'Spring Break for nerds', a growing political contingent", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Technology, Technology, Politics, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-13T16:07:14-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Technology", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T13:35:53-0400", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 103465360, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "This year, the event to which some refer affectionately as \"Spring Break for nerds\" is attracting a new brand of geek \u2014 the political kind.\nIn his speech, Obama called on the tech community to help solve government issues and increase civic engagement.\nWhile technology has always co-mingled with politics, the 2016 SXSW conference kicked it up a notch.\nYear after year, SXSW has become a sure draw for entertainers, as well as media and technology titans.\nAnd alongside the president and first lady were a number of White House operatives who were fixtures in several of SXSW's countless panel discussions."}
