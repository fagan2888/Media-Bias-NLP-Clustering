In fiscal 2013, there were almost 50,000 more drug offenders in federal prisons than there were in FY 1994.\n\n\u201cThe population growth is driven by both the number of people who are admitted to prison for drug crimes every year and the length of their sentences,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn FY 2013, more people were admitted to federal prison for drug crimes than any other crime type, and the average sentence for those entering prison was almost six years.\u201d\n\nSentences are based on characteristics of the current offense and relevant criminal history information, but at the end of 2013, the average sentence was 11 years, and almost all of those inmates will service at least 87 percent of their sentence.\n\nThe report comes about a month after Sen.

It expands the federal \u201csafety valve,\u201d which allows judges to lower sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenders below existing mandatory minimums.\n\nThough the bill has bipartisan support, not every lawmaker is on board.\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, Sen.
