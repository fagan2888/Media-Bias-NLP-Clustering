Unfortunately I find way too many of them long on schmooze time and short on substance. And if you are lucky enough to latch on to a conference that seems to feature tangible content, it will usually cost you a small fortune to attend!\n\nSo when we created our Secured Cities Conference in 2011 we decided on two important differentiators \u2013 make the event content-driven and make it affordable. That\u2019s why coming to Baltimore on November 14-15 is a good investment.\n\nSecured Cities is the only conference in the United States that provides an interactive forum for all law enforcement and management-level security personnel \u2013 both public and private \u2013 who are responsible for understanding and implementing government funding and grant initiatives, emerging technologies, security and emergency management policy and operations, best practices and peer-led applications.\n\nSecured Cities is not a trade show but rather a solutions summit that serves the public/private partnership initiatives that are driving technology and integrated risk strategies for all stakeholders in this environment including urban business districts, education campuses, healthcare facilities and transit operations.\n\nA Unique Venue\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal with Secured Cities and what makes it an event I highly recommend and certainly urge you to consider:\n\nIt\u2019s content-driven\n\nCovers all the hot security verticals \u2013 municipal and regional government, campus, healthcare and transit\n\nIs the only event in the industry featuring public/private partnership initiatives that include technology, funding and budget issues\n\nThere are more than 60 concurrent sessions packed into two days\n\nIt is the only conference that compliments your classroom sessions with live tours of real facilities hosted by the security professionals that staff them\n\nIt is a peer-to-peer event that doesn\u2019t allow vendors to attend unless they are sponsors\n\nIt is a small venue that allows for intimate interaction with your peers and more than 50 solutions providers you want to see\n\nAnd\u2014it\u2019s affordable!\n\nThat\u2019s right. A conference with substance your budget can handle. This is the 5th Secured Cities event, which initially launched as a niche municipal video surveillance best practices conference. But we quickly saw that the ecosystem of urban public and private partners spanned many areas, as security directors and campus police chiefs from major colleges and universities, public school system administrators, security managers at large healthcare facilities and security directors for city transit authorities joined the event as attendees.\n\nThat\u2019s why we expanded the umbrella to include all of these stakeholders in new Secured Cities Conference for 2013. This year\u2019s comprehensive session tracks are laser-focused to include specific technology and management classes for those in the campus, healthcare, transit and public safety sectors. Most of the sessions are peer-led and interactive.\n\nWe are thrilled to have the IAHSS partnering with Secured Cities for the healthcare security track. From reducing ER tensions to protecting sensitive data, healthcare facilities face numerous threats. The Secured Healthcare features presentations from experts on how to mitigate risks by using technology, training and industry best practices. Some of the compelling topics to be discussed include:\n\nHow Healthcare Construction Projects Compromise Security\n\nCMS Regulations on Use of Force in a Healthcare Environment\n\nDigital Identity in Healthcare\n\nPreventative Care: Leveraging Proactive Technology to Secure Hospital Campuses\n\nWeapons Searches / Metal Detection: A Healthcare Case Study\n\nThreat Management for Healthcare Management\n\nAffordable Care Act and How it Affects Maintaining Your Level of Security\n\nSocial Networking Investigations/Cyber Crimes\n\nWorkplace Violence in a Healthcare Setting\n\nWith the increase in campus-related incidents over the past few years, maintaining a safe and secure campus is becoming increasingly important. Yet with numerous facilities hosting thousands of people daily, managing security on a university campus can be a daunting challenge. That\u2019s why the Secured Campus track is a key portion of this event. Some of the campus risk mitigation issues featured includes:\n\nConnecting Campus/School Security with Law Enforcement\n\nImproving Incident Outcomes with Mobile, Real-time Solutions for Large-Scale Campuses\n\nProtect Schools from Violent Intruders by Applying Best Practices Within the Framework of Emergency Management\n\nCampus Policy, Procedure, Guideline Development and Management\n\nA Layered Approach to Securing Campuses Using Technology that Supports an \"Immediate Responder\" Platform While Waiting for the \"First Responders\"\n\nCampus Policy, Procedure, Guideline Development and Management\n\nEmergency Management Policy & Procedures at Virginia Tech\n\nThe final piece of the Secured Cities collaboration deals with urban transportation and ports. Securing transportation systems is vital to the overall safety of any city. The Secured Transit track offers you the opportunity to learn best practices from security leaders at some of the nation\u2019s largest transit systems. Among the educational opportunities included are:\n\nHow Seattle's Sound Transit Unified Its Security & Communications Operations Center\n\nCollaboration Gets the MBTA Moving into the Security Fast Lane\n\nSurveillance Systems at Scale\n\nCommand and Control at the MDTA\n\nHow Can We Become a More Resilient Nation? Lessons Learned from Hurricane Sandy and Boston Marathon Bombings\n\nSecuring the Port of Houston\n\nOn the conference\u2019s final day, we are hosting on-site tours of Baltimore Police Department\u2019s impressive CitiWatch Command & Control Center, where you will get a behind-the-scenes look at both technology and operations; the acclaimed R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which is one of the highest volume trauma centers in the country; and finally, the Maryland Department of Transportation Authority\u2019s control center, which serves as the security and public safety hub for state-wide operations. These tours will be limited and included with your registration\n\nThe CitiWatch Tour\n\nAttendees will be treated to a 2-hour, behind-the-scenes guided tour of the command and control facility of Baltimore\u2019s CitiWatch program, one of the most sophisticated municipal surveillance networks in the country.\n\nCitiWatch Services provides state-of-the-art video surveillance cameras throughout the City of Baltimore in an effort to assist police and other city agencies with public safety. The cameras are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by certified video surveillance monitors with law enforcement backgrounds.\n\nAccording to Baltimore Police Lt. Samuel Hood, the CitiWatch program was launched in 2005 by former mayor Martin O'Malley with an initial deployment of 50 cameras. The program now integrates 538 cameras from across the city into the Criminal Intelligence Watch Center located inside Baltimore Police Department headquarters.\n\nCitiWatch can also view recorded footage for every camera, which is stored for 28 days. The video is recorded at a rate of 15-30 frames-per-second, and all video evidence is burned offsite, per the city's video policy.\n\nR Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center Tour\n\nLocated in Baltimore City, the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, which serves as the State\u2019s Primary Adult Resource Center (PARC), reported receiving 8,265 patients in FY13, with a 96 percent survival rate. Thomas M. Scalea, MD, FACS, FCCM, serves as the Physician-in-Chief for the Program in Trauma. Karen E. Doyle, MBA, MS, RN, NEA-BC, is the Vice-President of Nursing and Operations.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s first and only integrated trauma hospital, the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center is dedicated to treating the critically ill and severely injured and employs groundbreaking research and innovative medical procedures with one goal in mind \u2013 saving lives. As one of the highest volume trauma centers in the United States, teams of providers are standing by 24/7 to receive, resuscitate, stabilize, and treat those whose lives are threatened by time sensitive injury and illness. These include, but are not limited to, thoracic, intra-abdominal and facial trauma, spinal cord and column injuries, brain injury, and acute complex orthopedic injury. In addition, patients who develop life-threatening respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, soft tissue infection, and sepsis may be transferred to Shock Trauma where expert clinicians and sophisticated technology such as advanced hemodynamic monitoring, continuous renal replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are readily available.\n\nThe Shock Trauma Center is a multidisciplinary clinical, educational and research institution dedicated to world class standards in the prevention and management of critical injury and illness. The trauma center\u2019s highly specialized medical personnel and dedicated resources are focused on a single mission: To eradicate preventable death and disability and thus reduce the personal tragedy and overall costs associated with severe injury. This mission is continuously pursued through state-of-the-art clinical care services, active research, didactic and hands-on clinical education and prevention programs.\n\nThe tour will provide insight to the security and emergency management function of this major healthcare facility and explain how new technologies are aiding in that mission.\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) Tour\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) is responsible for constructing, managing, operating and improving the state\u2019s toll facilities and other transportation services for public use and convenience. The MDTA\u2019s eight toll facilities\u2014two turnpikes, two tunnels, and four bridges\u2014help keep traffic moving in Maryland for the state\u2019s 5.8 million residents and more than 10 million annual visitors.\n\nThe State of Maryland faces a unique set of security challenges because of their critical infrastructure and their waterways. As key portion of the I-95 corridor runs through Maryland, damage or interference with any of its bridges or tunnels has the potential repercussion of slowing or halting transit for much of the Eastern seaboard. Such a scenario could have catastrophic implications in terms injuries, fatalities and economic impacts.\n\nThis tour will feature the innovative MDTA command center in Baltimore that uses 3,000+ sensors, 500+ cameras, video analytics, perimeter intrusion detection, and more. The MDTA will review how its security infrastructure was updated from multiple disparate systems to a consolidated facility with the ability to provide detailed real-time situational awareness from a centralized location using Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) software. The center has increased efficiencies and decreased response times by creating one view of all security and safety related incidents statewide and implementing standard operating procedures and necessary tools for immediate assessment and resolution of events.\n\nYou\u2019ll see how this busy command center continuously monitors its assets and appropriately responds to unfolding security and safety situations in real time.\n\nProminent Key Note Speakers\n\nSecured Cities is also excited to have Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley serving as a keynote speaker at our luncheon on Friday, Nov. 15. Mr. O\u2019Malley is the former mayor of Baltimore and was a huge supporter of the city\u2019s world-class video surveillance system.\n\nSo I encourage any security professional involved in these sectors to make plans to join as at Secured Cities \u2013 the security and public safety conference that provides the most value for your participant dollar!
