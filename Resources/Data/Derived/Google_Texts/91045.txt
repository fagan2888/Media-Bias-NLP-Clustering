In the news business, there's truth in the time-worn axiom, "if it bleeds, it leads." Or, as is more accurate for business reporting, "if it fails, it prevails."

There is something about human nature--the Germans call it schadenfreude--that cultivates an intense fascination with failure. And nowhere is this more apparent than the ever-polarizing Affordable Care Act.

Combine a drama-hungry news cycle with what one recent study termed a "toxic political atmosphere" surrounding the healthcare reform law, and you get headlines predicting certain doom every time there's even a hint of trouble on the ACA's public exchanges.

"Get Ready for Huge Obamacare Premium Hikes in 2017," announces The Fiscal Times. "Which insurer will be next to abandon Obamacare?" wonders a CBS News writer. Even FierceHealthPayer put "death spiral" in a headline.

But with a law as complex as the ACA, concerns about the stability of its signature marketplace often run the risk of oversimplifying the myriad factors keeping it afloat.

So with that in mind, this special report takes a look at some of the main "risk factors" influencing the exchanges in order to parse out what's actually worth worrying about.
