Jeb Bush held his first town hall in New Hampshire today since he announced yesterday that he is running for president.\n\nThe Florida Republican told the audience that he is extremely proud of his family and their accomplishments, but that he is his own person with a unique set of achievements and life experiences.\n\nBush said that he has a record of executive experience that has left him prepared for the White House.\n\n\u201cI know how it\u2019s done because I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI did it as governor of Florida. I cut taxes every year. I reduced the government workforce by 13,000. That\u2019s kind of hard to do. But I did it by reforming how government works.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire is considered a key state for Bush because of its history in bringing out moderate Republican voters.\n\nBush rejected the notion that in order to reduce the size of government, services that help the needy must be cut.\n\n\u201cYou can do both,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou can show how to take care of people that truly need the help of government and create an economic environment where there\u2019s high, sustained growth, cut taxes and reduce the size and scale of government. It can be done, because it happened in Florida.\u201d\n\nBush defended his conservative accomplishments while serving as governor, including balancing the state\u2019s budget \u201ceight years in a row.\u201d\n\nBush stressed his belief in the necessity of \u201ccivility\u201d in the political process, but he said that his executive experience shows that he \u201cactually did things\u201d as governor of Florida, opposed to others in the race who merely \u201ctalk about doing things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people that are really good at talking, much better than me, I wish I could speak as well as some of the people I see on TV, [but] it\u2019s time for someone to be president to fix a few big things so that this nation takes off.\u201d\n\nPrior the event, Bush taped an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.\n\nHannity asked Bush what it was like to run for president against his \u201cgood friend\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little awkward,\u201d Bush joked, before saying that they\u2019ll still be friends after the race.\n\nThe interview airs tonight on Fox News at 10 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DERRY, N.H. \u2013 Former Gov.
