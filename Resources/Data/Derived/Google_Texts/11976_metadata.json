But the burden still falls more heavily on the Democrats to show that the law can become something other than a political weight on vulnerable incumbents this year.\n\nWith 7 million people now signed up under the health-care law, and more likely to join during future enrollment periods, the act is rapidly becoming embedded in the nation\u2019s health-care system. Taking a victory lap on the day the administration announced its sign-up numbers, President Obama declared, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\u201d\n\nThe president asserted that the debate over repealing the law is now over. Republicans dissent, but there\u2019s little question that the GOP\u2019s goal of dismantling the law becomes increasingly difficult. For Obama and the Democrats, however, that also will mean that when problems arise in the health-care system, whether involving cost or coverage, critics will blame them \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 for the law\u2019s complexity and the clumsy hand of government.\n\nThe substantive debate ahead will challenge Republicans most. Democrats contend that the progress that has been made in signing up so many people will force Republicans to temper their message of repeal and instead focus their energies on changes in the law. Outright repeal, they argue, is not only unrealistic, particularly as long as a Democrat is in the White House, but less and less appealing politically.\n\nRepublicans recognize that. They also know that, even if Obamacare isn\u2019t terribly popular overall, many of its provisions are. Among the most popular are the provision that allows students to remain on their parents\u2019 health-care plans until age 26 and the ban on denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.\n\n1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 A last rush to sign up before health care deadline View Photos Aid organizations across the country were jammed with people racing to get insurance under the Affordable Care Act..

Bobby Jindal (R-La.) came forward with a plan last week that he said puts power back in the hands of individuals rather than government. Jindal knows the subject as well as any Republican, having held leadership positions in health-care agencies at the state and federal levels. But what he has in mind is hardly a simple change. He outlined its provisions at a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. The more he described it, the more complex it sounded. It\u2019s hardly a bumper sticker for the party.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, delivered his budget blueprint last week, which included a call to repeal the act. In an interview with Bloomberg News\u2019s Al Hunt that will air on Bloomberg TV over the weekend, Ryan said he still believes the act will collapse under its own weight and said he and other Republicans are working on an alternative.\n\nBut according to The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake, Ryan raised questions about the cost of some of the law\u2019s more popular provisions and suggested Republicans would try to find less expensive ways to accomplish the same goals.\n\nDemocrats are divided, as well, between those who essentially say stand pat with the act as it is and those who, for political reasons, are calling for changes to reduce the political liabilities they see in embracing the law completely.\n\nObama says he\u2019s open to fixing the law\u2019s problems but has proposed no real changes. He has acted unilaterally to postpone deadlines for implementation of specific provisions, which continues to infuriate Republicans. Administration officials claim the delays are simply for administrative reasons; Republicans see it as manipulation to avoid further political damage.\n\nPolitically, Democrats have adopted a message short of fully embracing the act. No, they say, it isn\u2019t perfect. Changes could and should be made. This \u201cmend it, don\u2019t end it\u201d message is increasingly popular among political strategists advising candidates in competitive races this year. Whether it\u2019s anything more than a rhetorical ploy is a different question.\n\nFive centrist Democrats \u2014 Sens. Mark Begich (Alaska), Mary Landrieu (La.), Mark R. Warner (Va.), Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) \u2014 and independent Sen. Angus King (Maine) recently proposed changes designed to ease the impact on small businesses and individuals. They speak for the embattled wing of the Democratic Party, the red state Democrats who face difficult reelections. Democratic leaders, however, have shown no sign that they believe this is either good or necessary.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who chairs the Democratic National Committee, did an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd the day the administration announced it had reached the milestone in new sign-ups. She followed the party\u2019s political playbook, acknowledging that the law isn\u2019t perfect. If only Republicans would sit down with Democrats, she said, the two sides could deal with the law\u2019s shortcomings. Todd then challenged her, asking what she would propose to change. She couldn\u2019t come up with a single thing, proving that political rhetoric doesn\u2019t equal policy.\n\nFor the past four years, Democrats have predicted that, with time, the popularity of the law would increase. So far, they\u2019ve been proven wrong. What they and Republicans are closely watching now is whether that finally begins to happen.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week showed that more people said they supported the act than said they opposed it (although by a single percentage point, 49 to \u00ad48 percent). Last November, at the height of the problems with the rollout, 40 percent said they supported it and 57 percent opposed it. By January, the split was 46 percent supporting, 49 percent opposed.\n\nMost polls don\u2019t show support as high as the new Post-ABC survey does. If future polls show something similar, Democrats will begin to breathe easier. The Post-ABC survey reflects increased support for the act among Democrats. Republicans and independents remain, on balance, opposed.\n\nDemocratic pollster Stan Greenberg argues that people are misreading the polls, that some of those opposed to the act believe it does not go far enough. Subtract them from the equation and the popularity of the law looks better. Be wary, he advises, of assuming that health care is a big problem for Democrats this year.\n\nHis analysis was based on the findings of a poll for National Public Radio that was designed by Democracy Corps, a Democratic firm, and Resurgent Republic, a Republican firm, and conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. Among other things, the survey found somewhat more support for the Democrats\u2019 message than for the GOP\u2019s.\n\nBut the law still energizes opponents more than supporters. In a year in which voter turnout could be decisive in key Senate races, motivation tips in the direction of the Republicans, which was underscored in the GOP analysis of the survey. \u201cTo counter Republican intensity and turnout in this off-year,\u201d Greenberg wrote in an analysis, \u201cDemocrats will have to feel just as strongly about the risks of repeal and the loss of benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether Democrats can translate that into action will determine whether the politics of health care will shift by Election Day in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Debate over health care law enters new stage with complications for both parties.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Debate over health care law enters new stage with complications for both parties.", "title": "Democrats seek to change health-care politics", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-democrats-change-the-politics-of-health-care/2014/04/05/2be9ac58-bccb-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/01/National-Enterprise/Images/Health_Overhaul-02cea-1726.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@danbalz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-democrats-change-the-politics-of-health-care/2014/04/05/2be9ac58-bccb-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, political debate over health care, resurgent republic, democracy corps, jindal health care, ryan health care, paul ryan health care, bobby jindal health care, wasserman schultz chuck todd, post-abc poll on health care, abc-washington post poll on health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo"}, "eomportal-uuid": "2be9ac58-bccb-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, political debate over health care, resurgent republic, democracy corps, jindal health care, ryan health care, paul ryan health care, bobby jindal health care, wasserman schultz chuck todd, post-abc poll on health care, abc-washington post poll on health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9da0\"", "article_summary": "The debate over the Affordable Care Act has entered a new stage, one that will challenge Republicans and Democrats alike.\nBe wary, he advises, of assuming that health care is a big problem for Democrats this year.\n1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 A last rush to sign up before health care deadline View Photos Aid organizations across the country were jammed with people racing to get insurance under the Affordable Care Act..
