We let Brian know of our decision earlier today. Lester Holt will continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cWhile on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian\u2019s position. In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field. As Managing Editor and Anchor of Nightly News, Brian has a responsibility to be truthful and to uphold the high standards of the news division at all times.\u201d\n\nThe memo said it was a \u201chard decision\u201d made by a triumvirate of NBC News executives.\n\n\u201cWe felt it would have been wrong to disregard the good work Brian has done and the special relationship he has forged with our viewers over 22 years,\u201d it said. \u201cMillions of Americans have turned to him every day, and he has been an important and well-respected part of our organization. \u2026 Certainly there will be those who disagree. But we believe this suspension is the appropriate and proportionate action. \u201d\n\nThe memo went on to say: \u201cThis has been a difficult time. But NBC News is bigger than this moment. You work so hard and dedicate yourselves each and every day to the important work of bringing trusted, credible news to our audience. Because of you, your loyalty, your dedication, NBC News is an organization we can \u2013 and should \u2013 all be proud of. We will get through this together.\u201d\n\nNBC Chief Executive Officer Steve Burke added: \u201cThis has been a painful period for all concerned and we appreciate your patience while we gathered the available facts. By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. Brian\u2019s life\u2019s work is delivering the news. I know Brian loves his country, NBC News and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone\u2019s trust.\u201d\n\nWhat do YOU think? Who should be the next anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll!\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cToday\u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie has emerged as the top choice to replace Brian Williams behind the anchor desk at \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d according to the Drudge Report.\n\nExecutives have reportedly narrowed in on Guthrie in recent days, as the beleaguered Williams continues to fight for survival at the network.\n\nWilliams had previously stepped aside as anchor of his nightly broadcast for \u201cseveral days\u201d as a result of the controversy generated by his comments about his reporting during the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMore details about the newsman\u2019s dramatic misremembering of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have emerged, with the manager of the hotel he stayed at directly contradicting his narrative of seeing dead bodies float in the street, being attacked by gangs in his hotel, and contracting dysentery.\n\n\u201cMaybe he misremembered,\u201d Myra DeGersdorff told the Washington Post of Williams\u2019 claims. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him, because it was such an unpleasant week and there were times to be concerned. \u2026 And when there is that kind of concern, you can misremember.\u201d\n\nAs the general manager of the Ritz-Carlton at the edge of the French Quarter in New Orleans, DeGersdorff was in charge of more than 1,200 people.\n\nIn 2006, the company\u2019s corporate office gave her the Ritz-Carlton President\u2019s Award in recognition of her preparation and leadership in the storm\u2019s aftermath.\n\nDeGersdoff says that while it\u2019s possible Williams saw a body, he probably didn\u2019t see one in the French Quarter, which only got \u201ca few inches of flooding.\u201d\n\nA few looters attempted to break into the building, but were chased off by security guards, and three individuals told reporters that gangs never infiltrated the Ritz-Carlton, despite Williams\u2019 claims, reported the Post.\n\n\u201cNone of the guests were in danger of being harmed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd none were.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Brian Williams, the former golden boy anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d has been suspended without pay for six months while rumors of permanent replacements swirl through the media jungle.
