Health Link, Washington\u2019s own Obamacare exchange, in 2016, The Washington Post reports. Aetna is sending letters to customers notifying them that their plans will be canceled at the end of this year. The company says it has \u201cdetermined we can no longer meet the needs of our customers while remaining competitive in the market.\u201d\n\nThat will leave just one company on the exchange, CareFirst, that provides Preferred Provider Organization plans, or PPOs, which offer a wider choice of approved doctors and hospitals to customers. Just two other companies currently offer health maintenance organizations, HMOs, on the exchange.\n\nThat will leave customers looking for greater choice in their health care options with just one insurance company, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which is drastically hiking premium rates across the region.\n\nCareFirst has already proposed rate increases from 3 percent to 17 percent, according to the Post. In nearby Maryland, CareFirst has requested that state regulators allow it to hike rates by up to 30.4 percent in 2016, The Baltimore Sun reports.\n\nDC Health Link\u2019s director, Mila Kofman, told The Post that the shrinking number of options isn\u2019t a loss for the competitiveness of the exchange and that Aetna\u2019s decision to leave the exchange won\u2019t harm residents.\n\n\u201cWhen you have products when there\u2019s not a whole lot of interest to buy, that\u2019s the market telling the carrier what they are selling, people can\u2019t afford. So in terms of competition, it\u2019s not a loss,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that real competition.\u201d\n\nAetna will continue to offer employer-provided plans on the exchange \u2014 including for Congress and its staff. Federal employees make a large part of Washington\u2019s Obamacare customers, as they are required by the health care law itself to purchase coverage on the exchange.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
