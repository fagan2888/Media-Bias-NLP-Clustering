Isn\u2019t that what its own exchanges are meant to do?\u201d\n\nIn 2013, a judge ruled in favor of the universities, but an appellate judge overturned that ruling in April, 2015. The universities have now appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Monday, Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, And West Virginia filed friend-of-the-court briefs in favor of the universities.\n\n\u201cThis strong show of support for HBU and ETBU demonstrates just how important it is that the Supreme Court address the impact of the HHS mandate, particularly on religious groups,\u201d Verm said in a statement. \u201cIt is especially significant that 16 state governments are supporting HBU and ETBU at the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nJust last month a federal court ruled against Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns fighting a similar battle.\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
