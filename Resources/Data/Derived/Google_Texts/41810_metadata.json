Doolittle sings two songs on \"A Boston Pops Christmas \u0097 Live from Symphony Hall,\" which was released in October.\n\n\"I did a Christmas tour with them one year, and they asked me if I could come back and do a live Christmas recording,\" Doolittle said in a recent telephone interview. \"I can't believe I'm part of the 'Boston Pops Christmas' now.\"\n\nSince she was a finalist on the sixth season of \"American Idol\" in 2006, Union High School graduate Doolittle has been working as much as she can at as many projects as she can, including singing with the Boston Pops, working to fight malaria in Africa and releasing her EP \"You're the Reason,\" which Doolittle said is a new direction for her.\n\n\"It is by far my favorite thing that I've released because I can say that it really is me,\" Doolittle said.\n\nShe's come a long way since being the mascot at Union High School.\n\nYes, Doolittle was Union High School's mascot on the field. It was her best excuse to get down close to the action of the sport she loves.\n\n\"At Union, we had the best football team,\" Doolittle said. \"There's just something about being out on that field; I love the school.\n\n\"The fact I got to open the teepee at the game was huge for me. I loved it. I loved every second of it.\"\n\nDoolittle graduated from Union in 1995 and went to college at Belmont University in Nashville. She was a music major and was the mascot there, too.\n\nShe began singing professionally in 1999 but got her biggest national break when she auditioned for the singing talent competition \"American Idol.\"\n\nDoolittle made an immediate impression on the judges and audience with her soulful style and impressive range and strength.\n\nDoolittle finished in third on the competition but has been listed in the top five of several lists of the best \"Idol\" contestants.\n\nHer life post-Idol has continued to grow, but it's a growth she's wanted to make on her own terms.\n\nDoolittle has worked with the charity Malaria No More, including a trip to Africa with former first lady Laura Bush to spread the use of bed nets that help stop the spread of the disease.\n\n\"Sometimes you get involved in things and you can't see the progress,\" Doolittle said. \"I've been really fortunate to be involved with Malaria No More and see the progress and what they've been able to do.\"\n\nLast month, Doolittle released the EP \"You're the Reason,\" which features seven songs, four of which were written by Doolittle.\n\nHer last studio album, 2009's \"Coming Back to You,\" highlighted Doolittle's singing talent, but many of the songs were covers. It wasn't quite the sound she had been searching for.\n\nWith \"You're the Reason,\" she's found it, she said.\n\n\"For me, sound wise, it has a soul feel to it because that's what my voice lends itself to,\" Doolittle said. \"But it's got a more current sound thanks to my producer. He's able to couple my love of pop music with my soul voice and marry the two. That sound is what I've been looking for for years.\"\n\nWhen she's also behind the pen, Doolittle said she gets to focus on singing about what she loves.\n\n\"The whole record is pretty much about love because that's what I love to sing about,\" Doolittle said. \"It becomes the best of all worlds for me.\"\n\nAnd Doolittle isn't done with this sound she's found. She is working on a full album and hopes to eventually make it back to Tulsa, where she still maintains ties.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "For Melinda Doolittle, Christmas is a special time of year, and the Boston Pops Orchestra, in part, helps ring in that feeling.", "title": "Union grad Melinda Doolittle juggles many projects", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/music/union-grad-melinda-doolittle-juggles-many-projects/article_050ef72f-6f82-5416-a438-59dba99b2064.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/fc/afc892fc-ff03-591b-be57-5a557234f408/52b93fd0da9fe.preview-500.jpg?resize=421%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "For Melinda Doolittle, Christmas is a special time of year, and the Boston Pops Orchestra, in part, helps ring in that feeling.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "doolittle,melinda,christmas,union,reason,released,singing,boston,idol,love,music,scene,scenehomepage2", "news_keywords": "doolittle,melinda,christmas,union,reason,released,singing,boston,idol,love,music,scene,scenehomepage2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb23b\"", "article_summary": "For Melinda Doolittle, Christmas is a special time of year, and the Boston Pops Orchestra, in part, helps ring in that feeling.\nWith their numerous Christmas songs, including \"Sleigh Ride,\" \"they spell out Christmas for me,\" Doolittle said.\nDoolittle sings two songs on \"A Boston Pops Christmas \u0097 Live from Symphony Hall,\" which was released in October.\nAnd Doolittle isn't done with this sound she's found.\nLast month, Doolittle released the EP \"You're the Reason,\" which features seven songs, four of which were written by Doolittle."}
