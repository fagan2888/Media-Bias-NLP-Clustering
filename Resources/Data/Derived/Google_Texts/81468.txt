PENNSYLVANIA (CNN) - Check out these Valentine’s Day babies!

Newborns at Pennsylvania’s Washington Hospital were decked out in red hats and tucked in envelopes created just for them.

Volunteers from the American Heart Association knit the hats for all babies born in February - at participating hospitals.

The program is called "Little Hats, Big Hearts."

It raises awareness for heart disease, in addition to celebrating Valentine’s Day.
