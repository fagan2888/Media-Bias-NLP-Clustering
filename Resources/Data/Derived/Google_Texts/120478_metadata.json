Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, Anna Eskamani of Planned Parenthood said the requirements in HB 1411 and SB 1722 are \u201cmedically unnecessary\u201d and could close health care clinics that now provide abortion services.\n\n\"If you were serious about reducing the rates of abortions in the state, you would work with organizations like Planned Parenthood to focus on prevention and access to contraception and sexual health education,\u201d said Eskamani, director of public policy of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida.\n\nThe bill, in part, would require clinics that perform abortions after the first trimester to have patient transfer agreements with nearby hospitals, and it would require physicians who perform abortions at the clinics to have admitting privileges at those hospitals as well. It would also would ensure organizations affiliated with abortion clinics couldn't get public funding - groups such as Planned Parenthood.\n\nAbortion clinics that perform only first-trimester abortions would be required to have transfer agreements or their physicians would be required to have admitting privileges, according to the bill's language, said the one of the bill's co-sponsors in the House.\n\n\"The bill was written an in effort to protect the health and welfare of Floridians and also to make sure the state of Florida is working effectively out in the field with those clinics that perform abortions across our state,\u201d Rep. Colleen Burton, R-Lakeland, said during a subcommittee meeting earlier this week in Tallahassee.\n\nEskamani said those kinds of requirements won't improve women's health. Instead, she proposes lawmakers support another bill, the \"Healthy Adolescents Act,\u201d (HB 859/SB 1056) that requires public schools to provide more comprehensive sex education.\n\nBurton\u2019s bill also would increase the number of abortion case files the state Agency for Health Care Administration would review each year from a relative handful to 50 percent. According to the bill analysis, more than 72,000 abortions were performed in Florida in 2014.\n\nThe bill also would require agencies that counsel women considering abortions to register with the state - unless they are counseling women against having the procedure.\n\nEskamani said the bills are directly related to sting videos last summer accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal tissue.\n\n\"They are politically-motivated attacks based on a smear campaign that has been debunked and the creators have been indicted,\u201d Eskamani said.\n\nBurton said Tuesday at the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee meeting that targeting Planned Parenthood is not her motivation.\n\n\"This bill is not aimed at any one particular organization,\u201d Burton said.\n\nLast fall, an investigation of Florida's 16 Planned Parenthood clinics found no evidence of fetal tissue sales.\n\n--Daylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
