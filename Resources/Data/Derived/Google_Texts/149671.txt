It should not come as a surprise that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), whose state’s been in the news after the staff of state agency was banned from discussing climate change, and who himself is basically owned by the Koch brothers, would appoint a climate denier to the state Public Service Commission — especially when the state Public Service Commission is tasked with overseeing issues related to utilities.

But man, does his appointee, Mike Huebsch, have some weird ideas about climate change.

Speaking at his confirmation hearing Tuesday, the Wisconsin Radio Network reports, Huebsch told members of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy that “humans can have an impact to climate change, but I don’t think it’s anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural progression of our planet.”

“You know, the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding,” he elaborated. “You have to recognize the multiple factors that go into climate change.”

Acknowledging that human actions have consequences is the technically on which ALEC is attempting to stake its claim that it doesn’t deny climate change. But the vast majority of scientists agree that human activity is a main driver of climate change, so pretending that greenhouse gas emissions are just one small factor is still out of keeping with the science.
