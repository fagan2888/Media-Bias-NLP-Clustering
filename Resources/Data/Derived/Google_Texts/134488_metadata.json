The return is a long way from secondary.\n\nWith Jordan Norwood suffering a season-ending knee injury last week and Wes Welker coming off a concussion, Burse can do the Broncos a favor by making their 53-man roster as a returner and No. 6 receiver.\n\nThe Broncos might have considered picking up a returner on the waiver wire when the league engages in final cuts this weekend, but now the team is likely to pick up a kicker to replace Matt Prater, who will be suspended from the season\u2019s first four games.\n\nThis all gives Burse a great chance to make the final roster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d Burse said. \u201cI have to keep working at it. I can do it. I did it in college. Now I have to gain the trust of the coaches here.\u201d\n\nSo far, so good. In his big preseason test Saturday against the Houston Texans, Burse corralled all six punts. Two were fair catches and four for returns.\n\nThere was a low line drive he let bounce and lost a yard as he discovered his first-step that was so quick in college wasn\u2019t all that explosive against Texans\u2019 special teamers.\n\nHis next two returns went for 11 and 16 yards.\n\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t dance,\u201d Burse said. \u201cThere might be a time when I can dance a little, but at this level your first move has to be up field, north and south.\u201d\n\nRoster moves. The Broncos reached their 75-man roster limit Monday by placing Norwood on injured reserve and waiving defensive tackle Cody Larsen.\n\nThe Broncos must trim their roster to 53 players by Saturday afternoon.\n\nKayvon returns. Cornerback Kayvon Webster returned to practice at full speed Monday after missing last week with a sprained ankle. Webster and rookie Bradley Roby figure to be the Broncos\u2019 starting corners for the final preseason game Thursday at Dallas.\n\nBall test. Getting hit never felt so good. Broncos running back Montee Ball got hit eight times Saturday on four carries and four check-down receptions from Manning in the preseason game against Houston. It was Ball\u2019s first action since having his appendix removed on Aug. 4.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get hit again and get that tempo back,\u201d Ball said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. After my plays, I was talking on the sideline, telling them that the speed of the game is fast right now. I have to get that back. I will be ready to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Isaiah Burse looks to make Broncos 53-man roster", "title": "Isaiah Burse looks to make Broncos 53-man roster", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/25/isaiah-burse-looks-to-make-broncos-53-man-roster/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__Isaiah-Bursep1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__Isaiah-Bursep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T19:04:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:10:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Webster and rookie Bradley Roby figure to be the Broncos\u2019 starting corners for the final preseason game Thursday at Dallas.\nThis all gives Burse a great chance to make the final roster.\nThe Broncos reached their 75-man roster limit Monday by placing Norwood on injured reserve and waiving defensive tackle Cody Larsen.\nBroncos running back Montee Ball got hit eight times Saturday on four carries and four check-down receptions from Manning in the preseason game against Houston.\n1, 2, 3 and 4 for a Broncos punt returner is possession."}
