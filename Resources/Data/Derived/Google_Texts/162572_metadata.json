Asked if he would need to win the Iowa caucuses to stay in the race, the former senator said it \u201cdepends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I finish third and half a percent behind first, I think I feel pretty good. If I finish third and I\u2019m ten points out, well, that\u2019s a different story,\u201d he told a small group of reporters in a Washington restaurant Monday afternoon.\n\nThat\u2019s quite an admission from Santorum, who actually won the 2012 Iowa caucuses by a razor-thin margin over Mitt Romney. Initial media reports were that Romney had won, and it took 18 days before the state of Iowa confirmed Santorum\u2019s victory, and the bounce he might have received from winning on caucus day didn\u2019t quite materialize. Even so, he would go on to win ten more states to place second to Romney. On paper, that record might suggest Santorum would have been an obvious \u201cnext in line\u201d candidate for 2016.\n\nBut so far, the Pennsylvania Republican\u2019s been more of an afterthought. According to the Real Clear Politics average of national polls, he\u2019s at two percent support. It\u2019s nowhere close to a sure thing Santorum will make it into the top-ten pool for the first Fox News debate August 6. (He called the Republican National Committee\u2019s debate requirements \u201carbitrary.\u201d) And in Iowa, the state that kept Santorum alive for the long haul in 2012, he\u2019s polling at an average of 4.3 points, putting him in ninth place.\n\nMeanwhile, Santorum, who served two terms in the U.S. House and two in the Senate before losing his seat in 2006, is resolute about his chances in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re in this thing to win it. If I didn\u2019t think I could win it I wouldn\u2019t run,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Iowa voters he\u2019s met this time around, Santorum says there are some differences in what issues these Republicans are concerned about. They\u2019re more interested in talking about national security and immigration than they were in 2012. There\u2019s less anxiety, too, about health care, and he said many Republicans are \u201cconvinced that they\u2019re stuck with Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cYou give me 50 United States senators and a Republican House, and we can de facto repeal Obamacare through reconciliation. Take all the money out and make it impotent. And then replace it with a plan that provides federal support for everybody to be able to go out and get the plan they want. And then put patients and doctors back in charge of the health-care system. That\u2019s the answer.\u201d\n\nA staunch opponent of abortion\u2014he was the chief Senate sponsor of the partial-birth abortion ban\u2014Santorum was critical of the response from congressional leadership of a recent video showing a high-ranking Planned Parenthood official casually discussing the selling of body parts from aborted infants. House speaker John Boehner has called for committee-led investigations into the organization, but Santorum says the Republican Congress should have already voted to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.\n\n\u201cThis is why I sort of scratch my head at our leadership. They are so afraid about these issues that even when you have an issue that is probably an 80 to 90 percent issue in America, they won\u2019t talk about that, because you have a group of members, a group of donors, who will climb down your throat if you do. And they just want to avoid these issues at all costs. They don\u2019t recognize that these issues don\u2019t go away. They don\u2019t go away, and they\u2019re important to people,\u201d he said.\n\nSantorum has called on the GOP to adopt a more populist agenda on economics, even writing a book in 2013 called Blue Collar Conservatives. I asked him how healthy blue-collar conservatism is in the party. \u201cI think you see more Republicans sound like me,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cFour years ago, if you think about it, was there anyone else in the race that really had a focus on a populist economic message, on workers, and being more critical of corporate America?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2012 Elections,2016 Elections,abortion,Congress,House of Representatives,Iowa,Iowa caucuses,John Boehner,Michael Warren,Mitt Romney,Obamacare,Pennsylvania,planned parenthood,populism,Republican primary,Rick Santorum,Senate", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "Rick Santorum is keeping expectations low for his second presidential campaign.
