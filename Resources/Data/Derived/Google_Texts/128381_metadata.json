But it\u2019s also been a good summer for longtime politician John Kasich. In fact, Kasich, who entered the race late, is now second in the RCP poll average in New Hampshire. He\u2019s fractionally ahead of Jeb Bush but trails Donald Trump by a wide margin (24.7-11.0)\n\nKasich has always been near the bottom of my preference list, and he has fallen even lower on two related pieces of news.\n\nFirst, Kasich is the preferred candidate of Tom Rath, a longtime New Hampshire operative who is now advising the Ohio governor. Rath, you may recall, was instrumental in the elevation of David Souter to the Supreme Court. I recounted this sad history here.\n\nRath promoted Souter knowing that he was not a conservative (but he didn\u2019t share this knowledge with President George H.W. Bush or his team). And Rath continued to praise Souter\u2019s jurisprudence even as Souter voted with his fellow liberals in key case after key case.\n\nWhen Souter retired, Rath said that as a Supreme Court Justice, his friend \u201cturned out exactly what we thought he would be\u201d and \u201cdid exactly what I always expected him to to.\u201d For example, Rath characterized Souter\u2019s vote to reaffirm Roe v. Wade as \u201cclassically David Souter.\u201d\n\nGiven Rath\u2019s role in the Kasich campaign, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by the second piece of disturbing Kasich news \u2014 the governor\u2019s embrace of Roe v. Wade. Asked recently whether he would \u201crespect the Roe versus Wade decision.\u201d Kasich responded: \u201cObviously, it\u2019s the law of the land now, and we live with the law of the land.\u201d\n\nBut as Ed Whelan points out, \u201cthe Constitution (together with federal laws \u2018made in Pursuance thereof\u2019 and treaties) is the law of the land.\u201d Supreme Court decisions control the outcome of particular cases, but when they erroneously interpret the Constitution, they need not be \u201crespected.\u201d\n\nEd explained the distinction this way:\n\nIt is one thing for the Supreme Court to decline to apply a law that it deems to be unconstitutional; it is quite another for it to maintain that presidents, members of Congress, and state officials must likewise regard the law as unconstitutional and, further, must accept and follow the rationale of the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nKasich is simply wrong. We don\u2019t \u201clive with\u201d bad Supreme Court decisions; we challenge them \u2014 or should. (Later Kasich said that Roe is \u201cthe law of the land until it changes,\u201d which isn\u2019t much of an improvement).\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that Tom Rath selected John Kasich as his preferred candidate from a large, talented GOP field. (Rath was a Mitt Romney supporter, which was a strike against Romney in my view, but Romney was a friend of Rath and the Republican cupboard was much closer to bare when Romney sought the nomination.) Rath\u2019s support is a strong signal that Kasich is not a good option for conservatives.\n\nThe signal is reinforced by Kasich\u2019s misguided \u201crespect\u201d for Roe v. Wade.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "This has been a good summer for the non-career politicians \u2014 Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorini \u2014 in the GOP presidential field.
