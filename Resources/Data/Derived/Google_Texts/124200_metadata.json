Here\u2019s how to find wine that is seductive and smooth.\n\n\u201cJob characteristics are part of this story, because they make work more or less pleasant, they provide incentives to work and they may actually boost the proclivity to work,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after controlling for financial preparedness (household income and wealth) and other demographic factors, job traits \u2014 such as the perception of age discrimination, the perception that work interferes with one\u2019s personal life, and relationships with co-workers and supervisors \u2014 all play into the retirement decision.\n\n\u201cThe decision to retire is not only driven by the availability of a pension, by pension rules, by Social Security rules, by monetary incentives \u2014 but it\u2019s also driven by other characteristics that are not monetary,\u201d Angrisani said.\n\nFor example, a more physical job means you\u2019re likelier to shift to part time or retire, while a job that largely entails computer work is correlated with staying in the workforce full-time, according to the research.\n\nThe study focused on full-time workers aged 51- to 79-years-old, and revisited them for a number of years to see whether they continued working, shifted to part time, lost their job or retired. The study excluded self-employed workers, as well as disabled workers. See the full September 2013 report here.\n\nTo get at how people feel about their jobs, the researchers asked people to characterize their feelings about work, as opposed to basing job characteristics on typical aggregate job data (where one job category might be labeled \u201chigh stress\u201d and another one \u201cphysical\u201d). The study thus captured situations where a worker perceives his work as, say, stressful, even if he\u2019s in a job type that isn\u2019t generally considered stressful.\n\nNot surprisingly, the availability of health insurance is a big determinant in the decision to retire.\n\nIf health-care insurance is available through work, \u201cthen the likelihood of remaining in full-time employment is way higher and the likelihood of going to part time is way lower,\u201d Angrisani said. (The research was conducted before the availability of insurance under the Affordable Care Act.)\n\nA perception of age discrimination has the opposite effect. \u201cTake two individuals who are equally prepared financially for retirement. They have the same household wealth and the same household income. If one, for instance, is in a job where there is a perception that there is age discrimination, then this person is more likely to retire than the other one,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkplace flexibility also plays a role. \u201cIf the individual wants but cannot reduce hours of work, then the likelihood of remaining in full-time employment is way lower and the likelihood of retiring is higher,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA good relationship with co-workers and with supervisors both have a strong effect on the likelihood that these individuals remain in full-time employment, and a strong effect but negative on the likelihood that they move to part time.\u201d\n\nPersonality plays a part\n\nWith some exceptions, a worker\u2019s personality traits \u2014 such as being outgoing, conscientious or nervous \u2014 don\u2019t directly affect retirement decisions, but they have an indirect effect, according to the study.\n\nIt\u2019s likely, Angrisani said, that \u201cpersonality traits induce people to select into particular jobs with some characteristics, and ultimately these characteristics will have an effect on retirement decisions.\u201d\n\nAnd in specific situations, our personalities may play a role in our retirement decision. For example, the research found that different personality types deal with age discrimination differently. People who described themselves as conscientious were likelier to stay on the job even in a climate of discrimination.\n\n\u201cIf people perceive age discrimination, then they are less likely to remain in full-time employment \u2014 but this negative effect vanishes if individuals are very conscientious. Somehow, these guys are more tolerant,\u201d Angrisani said.\n\nAnother way personality plays into our retirement decisions: While wages play a role in the desire to retire \u2014 if your wages aren\u2019t high you\u2019re likelier to retire \u2014 this effect is reduced among people who describe themselves as active.\n\n\u201cA person who says he is very active, for this person the importance of the wage is somewhat lower. He could get a slightly lower wage than a guy who is not that active and remain in full-time employment,\u201d Angrisani said.\n\n\u201cActive people are less sensitive to this monetary incentive, the hourly wage. They define themselves as active so they probably have a taste for work.\u201d\n\nAlso read:\n\n5 tips to help you retire early\n\nMoney moves to make if you\u2019re forced to retire\n\nHow to retire early \u2014 35 years early\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Job characteristics and the work environment play a big role in the timing of people\u2019s retirement, as do their personality traits \u2014 regardless of whether the retiree is financially prepared.", "creator": "@andreacoombes", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT194_Retire_MG_20140123153329.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Andrea Coombes", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Retirement", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Job characteristics and the work environment play a big role in the timing of people\u2019s retirement, as do their personality traits \u2014 regardless of whether the retiree is financially prepared.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/when-to-retire-its-not-just-about-the-money-2014-01-24", "author": "Andrea Coombes", "parsely-title": "When to retire?
