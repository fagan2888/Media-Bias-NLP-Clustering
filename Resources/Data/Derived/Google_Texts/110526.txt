One Oklahoma state lawmaker has proposed legislation that would throw out all marriage in the Sooner State.

Rep. Mike Turner (R-Edmond) told News 9 constituents in Oklahoma are "willing to have that discussion about whether marriage needs to be regulated by the state at all." Turner said it would "be a realistic opportunity" to outlaw marriage.

"It's something that would be part of the discussion," Turner said.

On January 14, a judge ruled Oklahoma's ban on gay marriage unconstitutional. Days later, Turner filed legislation calling for a vote to ban gay marriage.

He told KFOR-TV after the ruling he thought Oklahoma's opinion hadn't changed much, and called the ruling a "federal intrusion."
