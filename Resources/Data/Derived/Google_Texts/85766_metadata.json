After cleaning up our computer screen, we have been laughing ever since, because\u2026 well, this is just so awesome, even though it is from Politico:\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department told\u2026 Chairman Darrell Issa [R-CA] that it won\u2019t turn over documents related to the security of the Healthcare.gov website because it can\u2019t trust him to keep secret information that could give hackers a roadmap to wreak havoc on the system.\n\nIssa is apparently none too happy, last seen stomping his feet and whining and carrying on, showing his true colors as a shitty little titty-baby. Come, fellow wonkeroos of wonklandia, let\u2019s awesomesplore an agency finally calling out Issa for being the despicable rat-fucking piece of human filth that he is.\n\nIt all started when Issa launched yet another failed investigation into the administration, trying his best to dig up selected pieces of dirt that the media would run until Cap\u2019n Awesomesause, Elijah Cummings, would correct the record and show Issa to be a lying piece of shit. This time around, he is investimigating the glitchy rollout of Healthcare.gov. Issa wants to see \u201cunredacted copies of security-testing documents.\u201d Now HHS has already given him and his staff access to these documents, but in a legal way known as \u201cin camera.\u201d This means that they can look at the documents in a secure room, but can\u2019t have physical copies. Issa wants physical copies, and why in the world would anyone be at all nervous as to those documents being leaked? Oh yeah:\n\nGovernment officials say Issa has been too loose with sensitive information in the past, including with the names of Libyans who were assisting the United States during operations in that nation, the details of secret wiretaps in the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d investigation, and TSA documents that included security information.\n\nIt seems that folks in the administration have finally figured out that Issa\u2019s office is a convenient pass-through for conservative media outlets for leaked information. In a letter to Issa\u2019s office, new Wonket Hero and HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim Esquea told Issa that \u201cthe committee\u2019s unwillingness to commit to undertake measures to address the security risks associated with further disclosure is troubling, particularly in light of reports that sensitive materials were disclosed through various investigations.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen the full letter, but we imagine it goes on like this: \u201cThere are reports that you have termites in your smile, and that you have all the tenderness of a seasick crocodile. Furthermore, multiple sources confirm that your heart is full of unwashed socks and that your soul is full of gunk. When asked how to describe you, the words that best described you are as follows (and we quote): \u2018Stink. Stank. Stunk.\u2019 Given this information, along with the fact that you are a lying liar who constantly lies, we cannot, in good conscience, disclose the various materials for which you ask.\u201d\n\nAnd on this day, the testicles of Mr. Esquea grew ten sizes\u2026 plus two!\n\n[Politico / Dr. Seuss]", "article_metadata": {"description": "When we first read this article about notorious cosmic dingleberry Darrell Issa (R-Satan's Bunghole), we seriously had a newsgasm.
