It seems like only yesterday that Fox \u201cNews\u201d was in its infancy, telling its first fibs to an credulous audience eager to believe. Now Fox \u201cNews\u201d is all \u2018growed up,\u2019 a mendacious teenager old enough to vote and serve in the Armed Forces. Not that it would ever don a uniform. Fox \u201cNews\u201d is content to cheer lead from the sidelines.\n\nFox \u201cNews\u201d fights so many battles simultaneously: The War Against the IRS, Benghazi, Christmas, Fast and Furious, Affordable Care Act, Nutrition, and Illegal Immigrants, to name a few. Boiled down, it\u2019s a never-ending War Against POTUS.\n\nAs last week ended President Obama fired back, leading to headlines like Fox News Hosts Are Furious Over Obama Dig and Fox News Left In Tatters After President Obama Levels Them With An Epic Truth Bomb from our own Jason Easley. Like the other times Obama has slapped around Fox, this played right into the channel\u2019s \u201cnarrative of Conservative victimization,\u201d something else its credulous audience is eager to believe.\n\nThe Fox \u201cNews\u201d Fear-Mongering Industrial Complex launched The War Against The War Against Ebola this week. Eighteen years of a steady the-government-is-not-to-be-trusted drumbeat is now paying dividends, because it no longer seems crazy when Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace Fear Mongers About Ebola Being Spread By Illegal Immigrants; or when avuncular Peter Johnson, Jr., Fox Analyst Suggests The Federal Government Is Holding Back Ebola Treatments. Even Loofah Lad went the full Ebola: O\u2019Reilly Suggests Obama Won\u2019t Protect U.S. From Ebola Because He\u2019s Too Partial To Africans.\n\nIf there hadn\u2019t been an Ebola crisis, Fox would have had to invent one.\n\nLuckily, according to the Pew Poll: Americans Aren\u2019t Buying Fox News\u2019 Ebola Scare Tactics. So far, anyway. Which made Fox \u201cNews\u201d ramp the fear-mongering to an Ebola-fevered pitch:\n\nIt got so bad that Miles O\u2019Brien, PBS\u2019 Science Reporter Slams Fox\u2019s Ebola Coverage: \u2018Level of Ignorance We Shouldn\u2019t Allow in Media\u2019. That\u2019s why Kurtz Slams Media\u2019s Ebola Panic, Glosses over His Own Network, is a punchline even if you don\u2019t get the joke.\n\nSpeaking of ignorance: For the 2nd week in a row Survivor Elisabeth Hasselbeck distinguished herself with an Ebola performances: Fox News host gets embarrassed on live TV by a doctor over her Ebola comments. If I were a Fox & Friends segment producer (a job I performed on a Toronto morning show), I wouldn\u2019t let her do any more interviews requiring critical thinking. She could stick to interviewing persecuted Christians. But then, you\u2019d be left with Doocy or Kilmeade. It\u2019s not like the Foxy Friends have a deep bench in deep thinking. Forget I mentioned it.\n\nWednesday\u2019s had the best Fox \u201cNews\u201d Folly of the Week. It happened on The Five (which I famously predicted would not last). But, like a virus, it infected the channel\u2019s other shows. First, a history lesson: The Ambush Interview is a time-honoured tradition, as old as tee vee news. CBS\u2019 Mike Wallace became known for being one of the earliest, and most persistent, ambushers. Bill O\u2019Reilly, a student of television (if not actual facts), perfected the Ambush Interview by staying out of it. Loofah Lad is not brave enough to do his own dirty work. Whenever he wanted to nationally embarrass someone who disagreed with him, Jesse Watters would be sent to harass them. Most notable was the Amanda Terkel ambush. When Terkel wrote an article for Think Progress excoriating O\u2019Reilly for slut-shaming a rape victim who had been drunk, O\u2019Reilly called out the cavalry. Watters and his crew stalked Terkel unseen for 2 hours, from Washington, D.C., to a town in Virgina. When she left her vacation hotel she was suddenly peppered with questions and chased down the street.\n\nSkip ahead to the present: This week Conservative activist Jason Mattera employed the ambush interview to stalk Lois Lerner while she was walking her dog in her own neighbourhood. Cue the outrage machine: Fox\u2019s The Five Piles on \u2018Punk\u2019 Conservative Activist for Harassing Lois Lerner. However, Sean Hannity had hosted Punk Mattera the previous night to give him an \u201cAtta boy!\u201d Therefore, The Five was implicitly criticizing Bill O\u2019Reilly and Hannity.\n\nBUT WAIT! THERE\u2019S MORE!!! During the segment, the lone, hapless, poor-excuse for a Democratic defender, Bob Beckel, threatened Mattera with physical violence. WATCH:\n\nOn Thursday Stuart Varney engaged in a little feces disturbing by hosting Mattera on Neil Cavuto\u2019s Your World; in effect thumbing his nose at the show that follows. Yet, Jason Mattera to Fox: Why Is an Employee of \u2018Most Trusted Name in News\u2019 Threatening Me? is actually a fair and balanced question. Let\u2019s face facts: Had a Right Wing bloviator threatened a Progressive activist with physical violence the Information Superhighway would be gridlocked by now. Other than Mattera, I hear crickets.\n\nOutnumbered, is the newest & cutest Fox \u201cNews\u201d infant. Like The Five, it\u2019s a loud Outrage Machine. Also like The Five, it\u2019s 4 against 1. But there\u2019s a catch! It\u2019s one lone man \u201cOutnumbered\u201d by 4 women. Hilarity ensues. Another similarity to The Five is how its is used as a bullpen for Fox \u201cNews\u201d bullcrappers. Andrea Tantaros, aka The Tarantula, found herself a break-out performer with the crazies with her off-the-wall (and possibly calculated) The Five idiocy.\n\nSlinging the bullmanure in the Outnumbered bullpen, is Gen X-er, Kennedy, who only uses one name because she\u2019s a former-MTV personality, making makes her the perfect pundit. Then there\u2019s Gen Y-er, Katie Pavlich, who claims to be a Daughter of the American Revolution, but she doesn\u2019t look that old. Both are hoping to break into the Bigs with the type of crazy that made The Tarantula a player.\n\nPavlich offers Fox Host Claims The Rich Can\u2019t Give More To Charity Because Of Obamacare, in which the little DARling says the rich\u2019s Form Of Charity Is \u201cCreating Jobs.\u201d Not to be left behind, Kennedy challenges with Fox News Hosts Say Young People Shouldn\u2019t Vote When \u2018They Don\u2019t Know The Issues\u2019.\n\nHowever, what does that say about tee vee hosts who don\u2019t know the issues? It simply proves that while you can attract more flies with honey than you can with vinegar, manure is still the biggest draw. On the same day that it celebrated its birthday, Fox Takes Out Ad Touting Historic Ratings Victory 1 Year into New Primetime Lineup.\n\nHeadly Westerfield has been writing about Fox \u201cNews\u201d for several years, first for NewsHounds under the nom de troll of Aunty Em Ericann, later for the Not Now Silly Newsroom.
