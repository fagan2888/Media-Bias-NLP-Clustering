He has hosted two \"flying contests\" for North Korean pilots since he came to power in late 2011.\n\nIn addition to various titles, Kim also officially holds the rank of Marshal in the North Korean military.

The inside is plush, with leather chairs, crystal ashtrays and large wooden tables.\n\nAfter inspecting a factory making light aircraft in April, Kim Jong Un \"personally conducted\" a take-off and landing test.\n\n\"I have to try the airplane as it was produced by our working class,\" Kim Jong Un said, according to state media.\n\n(Editing by Tony Munroe and Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - His father was afraid to fly, but North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ha", "title": "The flying marshal: North Korea builds private runways for plane-loving Kim", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/19/flying-marshal-North-Korea-builds-private-runways-plane-loving-Kim", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-kim-airstrips_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/19/flying-marshal-North-Korea-builds-private-runways-plane-loving-Kim", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-kim-airstrips_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - His father was afraid to fly, but North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But Kim Jong Un has paid much attention to aviation during his three-year rule over the isolated and impoverished country.\nHe has hosted two \"flying contests\" for North Korean pilots since he came to power in late 2011.\nIn addition to various titles, Kim also officially holds the rank of Marshal in the North Korean military.\n\"These runways are located near Kim family compounds - sometimes within the security perimeters - and next to private train stations that were used by Kim Jong Il,\" Melvin told Reuters.\n\"I have to try the airplane as it was produced by our working class,\" Kim Jong Un said, according to state media."}
