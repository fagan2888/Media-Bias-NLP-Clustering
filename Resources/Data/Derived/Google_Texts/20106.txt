NBC’s Andrea Mitchell slammed Hillary Clinton saying she ”lacks self-awareness” and is “out of touch” Sunday on Meet The Press.

“The book tour has looked like a political campaign. I think it’s a little bit that she was rusty and a little bit of lack of self-awareness, when she talks about being dead broke and she then tried to fix it. But still, not getting the language – to really understand that she is a little bit out of touch,” Mitchell said.

“She doesn’t quite realize as Ruth Marcus wrote in the Washington Post, she should stop giving paid speeches, should stop asking colleges to pay out of a foundation. She’s got enough money just let it go at this stage, she concluded.

Last week, Mitchell’s colleague Chuck Todd also criticized Clinton over her wealth gaffe.

“Let’s remember how they created their wealth. They didn’t do it in some incredible business creating jobs and all of this- they just acquired wealth for being the Clintons…It’s not like they have acquired their wealth from hard work,” Todd said.
