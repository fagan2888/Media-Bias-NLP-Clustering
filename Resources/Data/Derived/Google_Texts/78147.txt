Update: Video of deer outside hospital, interview with employee

MIDLAND, MI -- A deer took a quick trip through a MidMichigan Health Center-Midland after jumping through a window.

A post from a volunteer-run Facebook page that shares police scanner traffic said the deer arrived about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, April 11, at the hospital, which is located at 4000 Wellness Drive.

The Midland Police Department responded, a call log shows.

Hospital spokeswoman Millie Jezior said the deer jumped through the window of an office area in the Orchard Building on the hospital campus.

"The deer was unhurt, it went through the window, found its way through a couple of hallways and exited the building on its own," she said.

Sarah Myers said she was visiting someone at the hospital when she saw the Facebook post and went downstairs and saw a group of officers.

"They got the deer out safe, no harm," she said. "They had about 10 officers there."

She posted "the deer is out" in a comment on the site about 5 p.m.

The deer disappeared after leaving the building, which is on "180 acres of wooded campus," according to the hospital.
