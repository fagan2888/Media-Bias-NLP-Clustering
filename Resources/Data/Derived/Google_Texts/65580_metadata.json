Opening the body of the soda bottle, he attaches it to the jar to cover the face.\n\n\u201cAll the materials I need are available in Gaza,\u201d he said. But still, \u201ceverything is rare here and prices are skyrocketing.\u201d\n\nAlready isolated and struggling economically, Gaza was hit even harder when Egypt\u2019s military ousted former president and Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi in July. The government that replaced Morsi partly blamed Palestinians and the Islamist Hamas movement, which controls the Gaza Strip, for some of the violence that had gripped the country.\n\nIn addition to shutting its passenger crossing with Gaza, the Egyptian military moved to close the tunnels that ferry goods under the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run government says Egypt has destroyed more than 90 percent of the tunnels, which are used to smuggle fuel, construction materials and other goods to the territory\u2019s 1.7 million residents.\n\nThe head of Gaza\u2019s chamber of commerce, Maher Attabar, says Gazans are finding it nearly impossible to buy Israeli goods \u2014 at nearly double the price.\n\nConstruction on new homes and buildings \u2014 which was booming in 2011 and 2012 \u2014 is now completely stalled as materials from Egypt are blocked. In Gaza City, residents wait for hours in long lines at gas stations for expensive Israeli fuel.\n\nWithout allies, and with an ailing economy and acute shortages, Gazans say they feel stranded in the region.\n\nNow the specter of war \u2014 after the US threatened Syria with military strikes in the wake of a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs Aug. 21 \u2014 is making Palestinians here feel even more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe unrest in Egypt has affected us badly, the problems between Hamas and Israel have made our lives unbearable. And the conflict in Syria may also affect us if the US attacks Damascus,\u201d he said.\n\nThe likelihood of a US attack on Syria decreased in recent days, when the US and Russia announced talks to put Syria\u2019s chemical weapons under international control.\n\nThe US had moved several naval destroyers into the Eastern Mediterranean over the past couple of weeks to ready for a strike, which President Barack Obama said would be aimed at deterring Assad from using chemical weapons.\n\nThe United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed so far in the two-year-long Syrian conflict, pitting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against a largely Sunni Muslim opposition.\n\nHundreds died in the Aug. 21 poison gas attack on rebel-held neighborhoods outside Damascus, which the US, Human Rights Watch and other Western countries say was carried out by Assad\u2019s forces.\n\n\u201cWe are affected by everything happening in the region,\u201d said Mazen Maarouf, a vegetable seller from Beit Lahiya, in north Gaza.\n\nNayef remembers when in 1991, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein fired ballistic missiles at Israel after the US and other troops pushed back an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He also threatened to hit Israel with chemical weapons, prompting Gazans to seal their windows with plastic sheets, Nayef says.\n\nThis time, Nayef, a former policeman, is doing the same \u2014 and also making masks for his friends and other relatives.\n\nNayef\u2019s brother, 35-year-old Nael, says he is less worried about a chemical attack from Syria that eventually reaches Gaza.\n\nHe says it\u2019s more likely that Palestinian militant groups like Islamic Jihad \u2014 which have strong ties to Syria\u2019s main patron, Iran \u2014 would fire rockets at Israel to avenge a US strike against Assad.\n\nIsrael could respond to the rockets by launching another offensive on Gaza. And Nael says he is worried Israel could use white phosphorus on Gaza like it did in the 2008-2009 war here, Operation Cast Lead. White phosphorus is used in incendiary munitions and produces an instant blanket of smoke. International law prohibits its use on civilian areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s protective enough,\u201d Nael, an unemployed car mechanic, said of his mask. \u201cIt\u2019s better than having nothing at all.\u201d\n\nAt Nayef\u2019s house, he is preparing for chemical war, but there are also more pressing concerns.\n\nRight now, Gaza\u2019s power is out for roughly 12 hours each day \u2014 and Nayef has eight children to take care of.\n\n\u201cI can barely get fuel for my generator,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Short of supplies and worried about regional fallout from Syria strikes, Gazans fashion makeshift gas masks in case of a chemical attack.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Ahmed Aldabba", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Short of supplies and worried about regional fallout from Syria strikes, Gazans fashion makeshift gas masks in case of a chemical attack.", "title": "In Blockaded Gaza, Making Gas Masks With Jars, Paper Towels", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/in-blockaded-gaza-making-gas-masks-with-jars-paper-towels/169081/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gaza_gas_masks_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-18T09:54:16-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Short of supplies and worried about regional fallout from Syria strikes, Gazans fashion makeshift gas masks in case of a chemical attack.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gaza_gas_masks_1.jpg", "title": "In Blockaded Gaza, Making Gas Masks With Jars, Paper Towels", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "US strike on Syria", "published_time": "2013-09-16T11:16:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-18T09:54:16-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In Blockaded Gaza, Making Gas Masks With Jars, Paper TowelsShort of supplies and worried about regional fallout from Syria strikes, Gazans fashion makeshift gas masks in case of a chemical attack.\nNayef\u2019s brother, 35-year-old Nael, says he is less worried about a chemical attack from Syria that eventually reaches Gaza.\nHe uses the jar as the filter, stuffing it with paper towels soaked in vinegar to absorb the gas.\nHundreds died in the Aug. 21 poison gas attack on rebel-held neighborhoods outside Damascus, which the US, Human Rights Watch and other Western countries say was carried out by Assad\u2019s forces.\n\u201cAll you need is an empty, 2 liter soda bottle, paper towels, vinegar, a plastic jar and ground coal,\u201d Nayef said."}
