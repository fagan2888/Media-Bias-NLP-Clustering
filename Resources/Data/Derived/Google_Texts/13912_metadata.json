Perhaps not for much longer. Rheavendors and Smart Vend Solutions have unveiled a new \u2018innovative\u2019 vending machine that can use facial recognition, medical records and your age in order to determine whether you will be allowed to buy that soda or bag of chips \u2013 or not.\n\nThat's right fatties, no sugar for you! #ObamaCare & Luce X2 will see to that.
