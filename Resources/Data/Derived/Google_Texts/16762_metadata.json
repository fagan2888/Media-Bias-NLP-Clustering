Although the economy wasn\u2019t roaring back, neither the European banking crisis nor the unrest in the Mideast had caused it to nosedive. Meanwhile, Romney\u2019s ineptness staggered Clinton. After the release of the 47 percent video, he remarked to a friend that, while Mitt was a decent man, he was in the wrong line of work. (\u201cHe really shouldn\u2019t be speaking to people in public.\u201d) As for Obama, Clinton trotted out for his pals the same line again and again: \u201cHe\u2019s luckier than a dog with two dicks.\u201d\n\nAccording to Democratic style coach Michael Sheehan, Obama was \u201ccreepy\u201d in Denver\u2019s debate:\n\nWatching from the set, the renowned Democratic style coach Michael Sheehan scribbled furiously on a legal pad, each notation more alarmed than the last. Reflecting on Obama\u2019s interplay with the questioners, Sheehan summed up his demeanor with a single word: \u201cCreepy.\u201d\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice in response to the Denver debate was \u201cIt\u2019s not about David Brooks; it\u2019s about my mother\u201d:\n\nThe first lady worried about her Maximus and his return to the Colosseum. In truth, she had fretted over the debates even before Denver. In July, around the time her husband\u2019s prep started, she met with Plouffe and expressed firm opinions. That Barack had to speak from the gut, in language that regular folks could understand. Had to avoid treating the debates like policy seminars. Had to keep his head out of the clouds. (Michelle\u2019s advisers paraphrased her advice as \u201cIt\u2019s not about David Brooks; it\u2019s about my mother.\u201d) FLOTUS loved POTUS like nobody\u2019s business, but she knew his faults well.\n\nEven after significant prep, Obama bombed again during a mock debate with campaign staffers. To drive the point home, speechwriter Jon Favreau transcribed the debate and used it to ridicule the president:\n\nThe full transcript was in hand within 45 minutes\u2014and became a source of gallows humor. As the clock ticked well past midnight, Favreau stagily read aloud some of Obama\u2019s most dreadful answers. Soon his colleagues joined in, with Axelrod, Benenson, and Plouffe offering recitations and laughing deliriously over the absurdity and horror of the circumstances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book goes behind the scenes of the 2012 presidential election", "title": "\u201cDouble Down\u201d examines the debate that almost cost Obama a second-term election", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/03/double_down_examines_the_debate_that_almost_cost_obama_a_second_term_election/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "The Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book goes behind the scenes of the 2012 presidential election", "title": "\u201cDouble Down\u201d examines the debate that almost cost Obama a second-term election"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book goes behind the scenes of the 2012 presidential election", "title": "\u201cDouble Down\u201d examines the debate that almost cost Obama a second-term election", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@prachigu"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2012 election, Barack Obama, Books, Debates, Double Down, Mitt Romney", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3da\"", "article_summary": "Even after significant prep, Obama bombed again during a mock debate with campaign staffers.\nAlthough the economy wasn\u2019t roaring back, neither the European banking crisis nor the unrest in the Mideast had caused it to nosedive.\nAs the clock ticked well past midnight, Favreau stagily read aloud some of Obama\u2019s most dreadful answers.\nSoon his colleagues joined in, with Axelrod, Benenson, and Plouffe offering recitations and laughing deliriously over the absurdity and horror of the circumstances.\nIn July, around the time her husband\u2019s prep started, she met with Plouffe and expressed firm opinions."}
