Patton, 29, was emotional when he addressed Chief Circuit Judge Steve Kouri, saying he needed to be there for his children. Patton, whose court file lists no address, maintained he didn\u2019t injure the child on July 30, 2012. He also indicated he had problems with his plea deal, which capped any prison term at 15 years. Aggravated battery to a child has a 30-year maximum sentence.\n\n\n\nKouri noted things could have been far worse.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut for 20 minutes, we would have been here on a murder charge,\u201d the judge told Patton, referring to anticipated testimony from a doctor indicating that had the boy been treated 20 minutes later, he could have died.\n\n\n\nThe judge also noted the strong family support as evident by letters and nearly a dozen people in the courtroom. But Kouri said, \u201cyou are a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u201d type of person.\n\n\n\n\u201cEither you can\u2019t control your anger or you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nWhen Patton pleaded guilty last summer, prosecutors told Kouri that Patton was watching his girlfriend\u2019s son July 30 when he had a potty training accident. Another relative stopped by, noticed the boy looked ill and took him to the hospital.\n\n\n\nThere, doctors found the boy, then 2, suffering from a severely lacerated liver, a broken clavicle, damage to both his pancreas and spleen as well as has having bruises all over his body. The boy suffered from heavy internal bleeding.\n\n\n\nUnder state law, Patton must serve at least 85 percent of his sentence, meaning that with credit for time served, he\u2019ll be in prison for about 12 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Kravetz can be reached at 686-3283 or akravetz@pjstar.com.
