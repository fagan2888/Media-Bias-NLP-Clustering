And some of these cloud-puncturing beanstalks are poised to transform the city\u2019s iconic skyline.\n\nSo far, the thinnest of all is the recently completed apartment tower at 432 Park Ave. The stark white pillar, just south of Central Park, is 1,396 feet tall, but each side is only about 93 feet wide.\n\nThat\u2019s higher than the Empire State Building, but only as wide as the length of a basketball court.\n\nPlans are in place for another tower just a few blocks away that could be the skinniest skyscraper in the world. The tower, at 111 W. 57th St., would be about 1,400 feet tall and under 60 feet wide.\n\nThose tiny footprints are a sharp departure from supertall skyscrapers of the past. The base of the Empire State Building, for example, occupies an entire city block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of advancements that allows us to build,\u201d said Ahmad Rahimian, USA Director of Building Structures at WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering firm that\u2019s worked on these kinds of projects.\n\nHe pointed to high-strength steel and concrete, unavailable a couple of decades ago, which can support higher levels of stress; advances in computing that allows for better modeling and building simulations; and advancements in damping devices, like weights, springs and pendulums which counteract swinging. Damping systems are used in supertall buildings to help control how the structures move with the wind to make it more comfortable for the people inside.\n\nBetter engineering alone isn\u2019t driving the race for thinner towers. In New York City, these days, there is very little land available for building. Buying up a whole block for a huge skyscraper could be prohibitively expensive.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty unique to what\u2019s happening in New York right now,\u201d said Antony Wood, executive director of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a group that studies and promotes tall buildings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "title": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "title": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/22/slender_towers_rise_to_dizzying_heights_on_nyc_skyline/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/super-skinny-skyscrapers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "title": "Slender towers rise to dizzying heights on NYC skyline", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/super-skinny-skyscrapers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Deepti Hajela", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1677\"", "article_summary": "The stark white pillar, just south of Central Park, is 1,396 feet tall, but each side is only about 93 feet wide.\nBetter engineering alone isn\u2019t driving the race for thinner towers.\nThe tower, at 111 W. 57th St., would be about 1,400 feet tall and under 60 feet wide.\n\u201cThis is pretty unique to what\u2019s happening in New York right now,\u201d said Antony Wood, executive director of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a group that studies and promotes tall buildings.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In New York City, there\u2019s no escaping the pressure to be taller and thinner \u2014 not even for the skyscrapers."}
