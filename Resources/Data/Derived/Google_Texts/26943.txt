Drivers for rideshare services like Uber and Lyft will have to carry hefty insurance policies in Louisiana, under a bill headed to Gov. Bobby Jindal's desk.

Rideshare services connect contract drivers, who frequently use their personal cars, with passengers through a smartphone app. These providers have drawn scrutiny in cities around the U.S. where they operate, often because of safety issues that arise from the lack of regulation.

Under Senate Bill 172 by Sen. Dan "Blade" Morrish, R-Jennings, drivers will be required to carry a $1 million minimum insurance policy when shuttling passengers. The insurance requirements take effect Jan. 1.

The proposal won final legislative passage with a unanimous Senate vote Saturday.
