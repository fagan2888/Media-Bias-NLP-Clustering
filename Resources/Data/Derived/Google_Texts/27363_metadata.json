Ramsey's head is spliced into an anti-drug message featuring the cast of 'Saved By The Bell.' [YouTube]\n\nImpatience was apparently the driving force behind a strange public service announcement featuring Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey \u2014 or at least, his head, The New York Daily News reported.\n\n\u201cI just got tired of waiting and crudely pasted the commissioner\u2019s face over the original video,\u201d said the department\u2019s social media manager, Sgt. Eric Gripp.\n\nThe 39-second clip is taken directly from a similar video released in 1991 by NBC featuring the stars of Saved By The Bell and Brandon Tartikoff, who was the network\u2019s head at the time. Ramsey\u2019s face is superimposed over Tartikoff\u2019s.\n\nRamsey can be heard stating his name, before the audio switches to Tartikoff saying, \u201c\u2013 and I\u2019ve got a hit idea for the new fall season: don\u2019t do drugs.\u201d\n\nGripp said he originally wanted to superimpose other officers\u2019 faces over the rest of the cast, but nixed that plan after it became \u201coverly difficult with everyone\u2019s schedules.\u201d\n\nWhile viewers reportedly wondered if the video was real, Gripp said Ramsey took it in good stride.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me the boss is very down-to-earth and has a great sense of humor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the department did something similar this past April, posting a Sizzler infomercial for potential franchise owners with voice-overs recruiting viewers.\n\nWatch the video, as posted on the department\u2019s YouTube channel, below.\n\n[h/t Gawker]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Philly-cops-SBTB-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Philadelphia cops release bizarre ad splicing commissioner\u2019s head into \u2018Saved By The Bell\u2019 PSA"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cea\"", "article_summary": "Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H.
