(ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL)</p>\n\nBy Mike Blackerby of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nIn customary fashion, West High School quarterback Seth Marshall made things happen Saturday for the Tennessee all-stars against Kentucky's all-stars in the annual Border Bowl high school football game.\n\nMarshall threw two touchdown passes as Kentucky edged Tennessee 33-32 at the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Ky.\n\nThe annual all-star bowl series is tied 4-4.\n\nMarshall, who directed West to the state Class 5A championship in December, also led Tennessee in rushing with 30 yards on eight carries.\n\nCentral coach Bryson Rosser, who was Tennessee's offensive coordinator, said that Marshall is a playmaker no matter where he lines up.\n\n\"Seth is a versatile guy who could play a bunch of different positions,\" said Rosser.\n\n\"He was originally on the roster to do some other things, like running back, but I personally thought he was a pretty good quarterback and we wanted to work him into the rotation there. We were able to get some good stuff going with him running the ball.\"\n\nMarshall, Sullivan South's Dylan Wieger and Campbell County's Ethan Jeffers all saw playing time at quarterback.\n\nMarshall connected with Science Hill's Mikey White on a 26-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter.\n\nHe also threw a 61-yard scoring strike to Lucas Harrison of Giles County in the fourth quarter.\n\nTennessee rallied from a 33-19 deficit in the fourth and had a late two-point conversion attempt for the win fail.\n\nMarshall finished 5 of 8 through the air for 110 yards.\n\nThe Tennessee all-star team featured more than 20 players from the PrepXtra coverage area.\n\nFarragut receiver Derek Williams had four passes for 35 yards.\n\nAnderson County running back Matt Fox ran for 16 yards on seven attempts.\n\nDefensively, Rosser said that defensive lineman Hayden Hester of Midway was a force.\n\n\"He plays like a beast,\" said Rosser.\n\n\"He was all over the place. That kid is legit.\"\n\nRosser also lauded the play of defensive tackle Hunter Lane of Gibbs.\n\nMike Blackerby is a freelance contributor", "article_metadata": {"title": "Seth Marshall makes things happen in Border Bowl", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/sports/high-school/seth-marshall-makes-things-happen-in-border-bowl-ep-870813790-353686041.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/marshall_12381691_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 437}, "type": "article", "description": "West High School quarterback threw for two touchdowns and led the Tennessee all-stars in rushing during Satruday's Border Bowl high school all-star game.", "title": "Seth Marshall makes things happen in Border Bowl"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/marshall_12381691_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "West High School quarterback threw for two touchdowns and led the Tennessee all-stars in rushing during Satruday's Border Bowl high school all-star game.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seth Marshall makes things happen in Border Bowl"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ff3\"", "article_summary": "(ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL)</p>By Mike Blackerby of the Knoxville News SentinelIn customary fashion, West High School quarterback Seth Marshall made things happen Saturday for the Tennessee all-stars against Kentucky's all-stars in the annual Border Bowl high school football game.\nMarshall threw two touchdown passes as Kentucky edged Tennessee 33-32 at the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Ky.\n<p>West's Seth Marshall (7) beats tackles by William Blount's Gabe Emert (53) and Jacob Krajnik (17), from left, on a quarterback keep during a high school football game at West High School on Friday, Oct. 10, 2014.\nMarshall, who directed West to the state Class 5A championship in December, also led Tennessee in rushing with 30 yards on eight carries.\nCentral coach Bryson Rosser, who was Tennessee's offensive coordinator, said that Marshall is a playmaker no matter where he lines up."}
