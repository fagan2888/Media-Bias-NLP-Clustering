That could go two ways: either somebody could be receiving less than they\u2019re eligible for, or they could accidentally be claiming more than they should be getting.\n\n\u201cIf that were to happen then when you file your taxes the following year you would need to pay back the amount that you owed the government,\u201d said Get Covered America National President Anne Filipic.\n\nHer organization is a non-profit working to get people enrolled in the exchange nationally, but also urging people already enrolled to register any changes that could affect their subsidy levels.\n\nAnother reason existing enrollees may want to hop back on this year is because there\u2019s more to see. For example, the federally run marketplace will offer 18 health insurance companies, five more than participated last year, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Vice President of Communications Andy Hetzel said the company, which participated last year as well, is offering more plans this time around. Many are.\n\n\u201cWhat people who enrolled in plans last year will see is that competition in Michigan has increased. There are more choices of plan options available to them and their subsidy levels may have changed. So just because you may have enrolled in a plan last year doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t do your homework this year,\u201d Hetzel said.\n\nThe enrollment period for coverage starting in 2015 is much shorter than it was last year. It runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.\n\nGet Covered America is also aiming to enroll more people who have not previously enrolled in the exchange. Filipic said from the last enrollment period they learned that people who used in-person assisters to enroll were twice as likely to complete the process as folks who logged in online. Because of this, Get Covered America is recruiting 75 more of those volunteers in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of folks in Michigan that we know are eligible and did not enroll the first time,\u201d Filipic said.\n\nFor those with no insurance, the penalties are increasing this year. In 2014 you had to pay the higher amount: $95 per person for the year or 1 percent of your yearly household income. In 2015, people without health insurance have to pay the higher of $325 per person for the year or 2 percent of their annual income. In both years, the penalty for uninsured children is half-price.\n\nPeople pay the penalties on their taxes for the year in which they are uninsured. The fee is slated to increase every year.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to pay a significant tax penalty form the IRS essentially to own no financial protection and no health care protection,\u201d Hetzel said.\n\nBut for folks who do take the time to navigate or re-navigate the exchange, the subsidies are significant, Filipic said. For those having to re-do some of the work they did last year, \u201cI think it\u2019s well worth taking those few minutes to update it,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the exchange doesn't open until Nov. 15, people can learn more about subsidies and start making plans for next year at healthcare.gov.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capital/Lansing business reporter for MLive.
