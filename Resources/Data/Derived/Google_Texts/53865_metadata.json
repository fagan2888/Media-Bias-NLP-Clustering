It's about making sure we put Kentuckians back to work,\" she said.\n\nAsked again, Grimes said, \"I was actually in '08 a delegate for Hillary Clinton and I think Kentuckians know I'm a Clinton Democrat through and through. I respect the sanctity of the ballot box and I know that the members of this editorial board do as well.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) campaign has repeatedly portrayed the Democrat as beholden to Obama, including to his health care and energy policies. Asked a final time in the sit-down whether she voted for the president, Grimes maintained that he wasn't on the ballot.\n\n\"I don't think the president is on the ballot, as much as Mitch McConnell might want him to be. It's my name, and it's going to be me holding him accountable for the failed decisions and votes that he has made against the people of Kentucky,\" she said.\n\nGrimes also affirmed her unreserved support for abortion rights. She said the decision is \"between a woman, her doctor and her God.\"\n\nA poll released this week showed Grimes with a 2-point edge in the high-stakes Senate race. HuffPost Pollster, which averages all publicly available polling data, shows McConnell sustaining a lead, however.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014 Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014\n\n1 of 33 Sen.
