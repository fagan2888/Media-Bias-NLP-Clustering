While congressional affirmation of the air war against ISIL, also known as ISIS, and the return of thousands of U.S. troops and advisers to Iraq is not constitutionally necessary, Obama said it would be a welcome show of unity.\n\nObama\u2019s draft Authorization for the Use of Military Force calls for a military campaign consisting of airstrikes and limited ground operations, but no large-scale invasions or occupation. Unlike America\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, authorization for U.S. military action against the Islamic State would be limited to three years, with \u201cenduring offensive ground operations\u201d prohibited.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed the president needs to define what he means by \u201cenduring,\u201d but there will be vigorous disagreements about whether to constrain this commander-in-chief and his successor. On the topic of presidental powers, many Democrats sounded like Republicans, and many Republicans sounded liked Democrats. Democrats worried the AUMF is vague and gives the president too much power, while Republicans were concerned about limiting Obama\u2019s power to fight ISIL \u2013 despite spending most of the this year criticizing him for executive overreach on immigration and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we\u2019re going to authorize the use of military force, the president should have all the tools necessary to win the fight that we are in,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said in a press conference.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is considering whether to seek the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, went even further, suggesting that the authorization should be as broad as possible. \u201cI would say that there is a pretty simple authorization he could ask for and it would read one sentence: \u2018We authorize the president to defeat and destroy ISIL.\u2019 Period. And that\u2019s what I think we should do,\u201d Rubio said on the Senate floor. Other senators considered potential 2016 GOP contenders cautioned against giving the president sweeping authority.\n\nSo did Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the breadth and vagueness of the ground troop language, the limitation against enduring offensive ground combat operations, suggesting that all defensive ground combat operations are okay,\u201d Kaine said at a press conference. \u201cSince everybody works for the Department of Defense, allowing defensive actions without any additional explanation is pretty broad.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats cited military authorizations passed under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2002 as cause for concern when it comes to broad legislative language. They argued that those authorizations have since been used to justify military action beyond what was originally intended, and cautioned against allowing something similar to happen now. The 2001 authorization of force is part of the legal argument the White House has used to defend the campaign against ISIL. Obama asked Congress to leave in place the 2001 language, which dealt with al Qaeda, with possible refinements later.\n\n\u201cThe executive branch\u2019s reliance on the 2001 AUMF to justify such things as indefinite detentions and drone strikes far from Afghanistan has taught that Congress must carefully limit any authority it grants a president to engage in war,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement.\n\nThough some members of Congress were calling for an authorization of military force against ISIL last summer, the can got kicked down the road for six months, with lawmakers hesitant to take such serious votes in the lead-up to the midterm elections. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said he thought lack of congressional action set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\u201cWe were in this long dilemma where the leadership here in the Congress wanted the president to go first, the president wanted Congress to go first, meanwhile our troops had already gone,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cCongress was sitting on the sidelines. From my own point of view, it\u2019s the Congress that really lost in that stalemate.\u201d\n\nSchiff called GOP campaigning for broader executive power on the war \u201cdeeply ironic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the same House and Senate members who are so critical of this so-called imperial president are ready to make him an imperial president when it comes to war-making,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to give him cart blanche.\u201d\n\nTwo of the more hawkish senators, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both said they had problems with the lack of language concerning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Graham said he would not support a military authorization that does not protect Syrian rebels fighting Assad, while McCain said he thought the White House intentionally omitted Syria in its draft.\n\nAsked what happens if Congress can\u2019t find bipartisan agreement to pass an authorization of military force, Graham indicated that current war efforts would be preferable to passing an AUMF he does not agree with.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to do no harm to the war effort,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHarm to the war effort would be passing an AUMF that restricts our ability to win and destroy ISIL.\u201d\n\nThe president described his administration\u2019s draft AUMF as a compromise document specific enough to constrain his running room, and yet flexible enough to adapt to changing events and conditions. He said the limitations sought for the remainder of his presidency and the outset of the next administration create no deadlines or timetables for the mission, and don\u2019t tie his or any future president\u2019s hands.\n\nThe administration believes it has latitude under a new authorization to insert U.S. intelligence agents on the ground, conduct rescue operations (as has already occurred in Syria), and deploy U.S. forces into dangerous territory to help call in airstrikes or advise Iraqi and other allied fighters.\n\nObama insisted the United States and its coalition partners are geographically containing ISIL\u2019s advances, and killing its commanders. He recited statistics about airstrikes since August and targets struck. The president did not dissect, as upcoming hearings on Capitol Hill are expected to do, the instability injected by ISIL into the region, including in Yemen, the refugee crisis, or ISIL\u2019s public-relations use of the U.S. offensive for recruitment and indoctrination purposes.\n\nObama offered no predictions about when \u201cdefeat\u201d of well-financed ISIL fighters, who behead western and Muslim captives and reportedly crucify children for propaganda purposes, may be achieved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas,\u201d the president conceded.\n\nIn his view, the threat of global violent extremism may be enduring \u2013 a word used in the AUMF draft -- but he believes U.S. combat operations, especially with U.S. troops on the ground, cannot be. Nonetheless, Obama\u2019s account of achievements over six months was modest as he argued for \u201ca systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has estimated the military effort is costing American taxpayers more than $8 million a day.\n\n\u201cThe United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East,\u201d Obama repeated at the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s not in our national security interest and it\u2019s not necessary for us to defeat ISIL.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Huey-Burns contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama asked Congress Wednesday to approve his administration\u2019s military campaign to defeat Islamic State terrorists, although he believes failure by Congress to approve a resolution...", "title": "Approval of War Authorization Against ISIL Uncertain in Congress | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/02/12/approval_of_war_authorization_against_isil_uncertain_in_congress.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/282967_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama asked Congress Wednesday to approve his administration\u2019s military campaign to defeat Islamic State terrorists, although he believes failure by Congress to approve a resolution...", "title": "Approval of War Authorization Against ISIL Uncertain in Congress | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Approval of War Authorization Against ISIL Uncertain in Congress | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "U.S. Congress,iraq war,U.S. military,Islamic State,ISIL,ISIS,President Obama,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeacc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East,\u201d Obama repeated at the White House.\nObama\u2019s draft Authorization for the Use of Military Force calls for a military campaign consisting of airstrikes and limited ground operations, but no large-scale invasions or occupation.\nUnlike America\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, authorization for U.S. military action against the Islamic State would be limited to three years, with \u201cenduring offensive ground operations\u201d prohibited.\nThe 2001 authorization of force is part of the legal argument the White House has used to defend the campaign against ISIL.\nObama doesn\u2019t need an OK from Congress \u201cbecause the president believes that Congress has already given him this authority\u201d in the Constitution, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest."}
