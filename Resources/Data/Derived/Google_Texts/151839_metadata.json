He\u2019s also raised just $200,000 this year and spent all but $30,000 of it mostly on strategists, Internet ads and driving nearly 10,000 miles around Colorado.\n\nAt 45 years old, Kopp\u2019s not only the youngest man duking it out in the four-way GOP gubernatorial primary, he\u2019s also the most plugged-in digitally. He\u2019s the only candidate with an Instagram account, for example.\n\nKopp\u2019s spent just more than $5,000 this year on advertising, exclusively on the Internet through Google and Facebook. That\u2019s less than half what\u2019s been spent on advertising by anyone else in the race, particularly Beauprez and Tancredo who\u2019ve invested tens of thousands in printing advertisements and paying canvassers.\n\nIt seems like Kopp\u2019s getting a decent bang for his buck \u2014 his Facebook, with 20,000-plus likes, touts him as \u201cthe most liked Republican candidate in Colorado!\u201d And if you read virtually any political news online, you\u2019ve probably seen him looking like your friend\u2019s nicest, fist-bumping dad via Google AdWords. Google, by the way, has gotten wise to this national shift to online political advertising and now offers services which can not only target viewers by zip code but also by congressional district.\n\nSo Kopp knows about the Internet. The bulk of Kopp\u2019s meager funds have gone to Web-savvy strategists like RedRight out of Dallas and The Wickers Group out of San Francisco, firms that have worked on campaigns like former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee\u2019s.\n\nEven so, Denver-based independent analyst Eric Sondermann says that while online advertising and social media campaigning are certainly trends in politics, they\u2019re hardly the end-all-be-all.\n\n\u201cCandidates with resources do all of the above, they advertise on broadcast television, cable networks and online,\u201d said Sondermann.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have those resources, and Kopp seemingly does not, you go with an all-online strategy not as a first but as a last resort.\u201d\n\nDespite growing up a bull-rider in rugged South Dakota, serving in the military as an Army Ranger, working as a hotshot firefighter across the Rocky Mountain West, training as a Pentecostal minister and being elected state senate minority leader, Kopp\u2019s had trouble raising money. Between campaign finance reports at the beginning and middle of May, he raised less than $10,000. Kopp did manage to pull Republican Assembly no-shows Bob Beauprez and Tom Tancredo\u2019s votes and win the nomination there. But is that enough to win him a line on the November ballot much less the seat behind the governor\u2019s desk?\n\nSondermann\u2019s not sure. He points out that none of the current GOP gubernatorial candidates has raised even a fraction of the cash incumbent Governor Hickenlooper has amassed. Partially, donors are keeping their checkbooks closed until the primary is settled, but Sondermann also noted that most of the GOP cash and energy is flowing to the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mark Udall and upstart Republican Congressman Cory Gardner. Last of all, Sondermann noted, there are more than a few Republican donors on board with Hickenlooper.\n\n\u201cMike Kopp has a very nice 30- to 60-second biography ad. There\u2019s some sense that he\u2019s the guy with the upside, the guy who could grow into the role of giving Hickenlooper a run for his money,\u201d Sondermann said. \u201cBut whether that\u2019s enough to get him over the hump [the GOP primary] is becoming increasingly doubtful.\u201d\n\nPresident of Colorado Christian University and former U.S. Senator William Armstrong thinks Kopp could make it and has endorsed his bid.\n\n\u201cI think if Mike Kopp is nominated, he\u2019s the most likely to win. People who meet Mike like him,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cThey look at his legislative record, his record of public service and how he responded to a very serious personal crisis and they say, \u2018This is the kind of guy we want to lead our state.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Kopp resigned after serving five years in the state senate when Kimberly, his wife of nearly 18 years, died of cancer. He said the move was on behalf of his four kids, aged 4 to 16 at the time. Kopp then returned to his corporate job at the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, one of the largest energy companies in the state.\n\nKopp has since remarried to Shannon, a bike-rides-and-camping enthusiast who Kopp talks about a lot, including in YouTube videos.\n\n\u201cShannon saved my life,\u201d says Kopp in his introductory campaign reel.\n\n\u201cI still think she was an angel sent on a mission to rescue me, to rescue my family.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Colorado Springs Republicans at the home of his former colleague in the state senate, David Schultheis, Kopp also gave his wife credit for his being in the gubernatorial race at all.\n\nThe Kopp campaign denied The Independent access to an event and did not return several emails requesting interviews or information, so when it comes to the candidate\u2019s personality, let\u2019s take Schultheis\u2019s word on Kopp. The two shared an office during their stint in the state legislature, a time when Kopp likes to mention he got a $10 million tax cut passed and Schultheis likes to note the pair\u2019s private prayer sessions each morning before hitting the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s principled, honorable, moral, ethical and well organized,\u201d said Schultheis, introducing Kopp at a Colorado Springs Pikes Peak Patriots Meeting in February.\n\nPraising someone\u2019s principles and/or honorable moral ethics is hardly unusual for an endorser, but \u201cwell organized\u201d stands out as one of those compliments so idiosyncratic, at least in this context, it might just be true.\n\nAcross stump speeches one thing is clear, Kopp is a guy who likes a crisp, consistent structure. His campaign slogan, \u201cDefend Freedom. Fight Washington. Empower You.\u201d is also the structure underpinning his introductory campaign video and the basic outline for his acceptance speech at the Republican Assembly.\n\nKopp sounds like a guy who\u2019s given a sermon or two \u2014 he knows how to keep listeners on track. He tells his audience his numbered points upfront and then back references as he speaks. He uses specific examples, many from his time in the military, to illustrate his values or connect with specific listeners.\n\nIn the spirit of the well-organized candidate, we\u2019ve made a multimedia outline of what Mike Kopp is telling Colorado voters, which you can explore next week. It offers more detail as to what a Kopp administration would look like heading our state.\n\nUntil then, we can tell you that Kopp means to cut taxes and carve TABOR into stone. He plans to slice and dice regulations and government programs, promising to reduce the cost of being a regulated business by 25 percent across sectors and the cost of running the state government by 10 percent. He would push a repeal of the gun control laws passed in 2013 and set a date for the execution of Nathan Dunlap, who murdered four employees at an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s. Kopp doesn\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act and still has plenty of energy to fight it. He would invest in a helicopter-carried wildfire fighting crew that could reach any fire in the state within an hour. And lastly, he wants to be Governor of Colorado.\n\nNote: This is the first in a series of four campaign profiles on the current candidates in the Colorado Republican gubernatorial primary, which will be held on June 24: Mike Kopp, Tom Tancredo, Scott Gessler and Bob Beauprez.\n\n[Photo from Colorado Senate GOP]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "At 45 years old, Kopp\u2019s not only the youngest man duking it out in the four-way GOP gubernatorial primary, he\u2019s also the most plugged-in digitally.
