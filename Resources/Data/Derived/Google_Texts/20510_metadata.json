This is only the second time in American history that a majority of the states of the Union have sued the federal government over a federal law. (The first one was the 2012 Supreme Court case against Obamacare, so Barack Obama has prompted both of these historic cases.)\n\nFederal regulations (or \u201crules,\u201d to use the legal term) can only be created under the process set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). With few exceptions, rules must be nationally published in the Federal Register to give the nation notice of what is being considered, then the American public (usually expert industry groups or think tanks) gets a period of time to examine the proposed rules and send to the agency their comments and objections. Then the agency must respond to those objections before it issues final rules that have the force of law.\n\nObama decided to skip all that with DAPA. Accordingly, the states\u2019 lawsuit makes three claims.\n\nFirst, at minimum, the states argue that issuing a regulation like DAPA without the notice-and-comment process (because evidently the Obama administration did not want to create a paper-trail of legal objections to its actions) violates the APA, and on that ground alone, DAPA must be set aside.\n\nSecond, even if notice and comment were not required, DAPA would still be illegal because it violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Article I of the Constitution explicitly gives Congress complete authority to define who can enter this country and how a foreigner can become a citizen. In 2013, Obama, plus his progressive and business allies, tried to persuade Congress to change the INA and grant an amnesty, but Congress rejected his proposal in 2014. Rules and regulations can only carry out and implement federal law, never violate federal law.\n\nAnd third, DAPA is unconstitutional. The Take Care Clause of the Constitution commands of the president that \u201che shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d It requires the president to do his level best to carry out whatever laws Congress passes. Here, Obama doesn\u2019t like Congress\u2019s law and decided to stop enforcing parts of it. The Constitution forbids him from doing so, said the states\u2019 lawsuit.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen from the Southern District of Texas halted DAPA before it went into effect. He issued a 123-page opinion that explained why the states have standing to sue, and why DAPA violates the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.\n\nObama\u2019s Justice Department appealed to the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, saying that DAPA is merely a system of selectively not enforcing the INA\u2019s deportation process against certain individuals, as a form of \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d No agency has the manpower to fully pursue every lawbreaker, so prosecutors use discretion to go after the higher-priority targets instead of low-priority offenders.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision written by Judge Jerry Smith\u2014who was appointed by Ronald Reagan and is deeply respected nationwide by constitutional conservative lawyers\u2014the Fifth Circuit rejected Obama\u2019s arguments with a 135-page opinion. Judge Smith explained:\n\n\u201cDeferred action, however, is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer \u201clawful presence\u201d and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens. Though revocable, that change in designation would trigger \u2026 eligibility for federal benefits\u2014for example, under \u2026 the Social Security Act\u2014and state benefits\u2014for example, driver\u2019s licenses and unemployment insurance\u2014that would not otherwise be available to illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nIllegal aliens in this country under DAPA would qualify for federal welfare, state welfare, and a host of government benefits, including free or reduced-cost healthcare under Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and tax subsidies. And once in their sixties, they could retire here with Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe appeals court noted that the second count of the lawsuit\u2014the substantive APA count that DAPA illegally violates the INA\u2014was fully briefed and argued before the district court. But because the trial court had not yet issued any ruling on that question the appeals court would not do so either, it said. And it\u2019s a long-settled rule of judicial restraint that a court never decides a constitutional issue if it can\u2014like here\u2014decide the case on statutory grounds. Having held that DAPA violates federal law, the courts need not decide if it is also unconstitutional.\n\nQuoting a recent Supreme Court case, the Fifth Circuit concluded, \u201cWe expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.\u201d Congress did no such thing here to authorize Obama and DHS to fundamentally overhaul America\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nObama\u2019s options are now limited. He can ask the full Fifth Circuit\u2014all 17 judges\u2014to rehear the case en banc, in the hope it will reject this opinion by a three-judge panel. Or he can ask the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgement.\n\nBut time is against him. The cutoff for the Supreme Court taking new cases for the 2015 term\u2014which started in October and will end in June 2016\u2014is mid-January. If he doesn\u2019t file a petition for certiorari within the next few weeks, the High Court could not even hear the case until October 2016, and may not even decide the case before Obama\u2019s replacement is sworn in. The 17-judge en banc process takes months; if Obama goes that route and loses, then there won\u2019t be any time for the Supreme Court to act.\n\nSo Obama probably only has time to go for en banc or go to the Supreme Court\u2014not both.\n\nHe probably has a better chance before the Supreme Court, so that would be the smarter move. But in doing so, the president risks a massive smack-down that would forever destroy one of his top political priorities. If he doesn\u2019t, however, and lets the preliminary injunction against DAPA stay in effect while a full trial plays out before Judge Hanen, then there aren\u2019t enough days left in his presidency to allow DAPA to go into effect.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was a terrible defeat for President Obama. He can either give up on executive amnesty altogether, or double-down and take his chances with another appeal.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
