Under Obamacare, larger employers will be required to provide health insurance to employees who work 30 hours or more, or they will have to pay a fine.

The new rules don’t go into effect for another year, but already businesses and state governments are cutting back workers’ hours to avoid the cost of buying more health insurance.

But one large employer is bucking that trend. The convenience store chain Cumberland Farms, which also owns Gulf Oil, will be increasing employees’ hours and insuring 1,500 more workers.

The move will cost the company 10 percent more in healthcare spending. But John McMahon, head of human resources for Cumberland Gulf Group, tells Here & Now that the investment is well worth it because it should translate into lower turnover and greater employee satisfaction.

“We strongly believe the cost up front will be minimal compared to the return on the investment in the long run.”
