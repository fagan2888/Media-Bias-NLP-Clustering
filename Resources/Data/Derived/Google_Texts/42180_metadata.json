He thought about it for a brief moment and then laughed, \u201cWe\u2019ve got rice and beans. That\u2019s what we eat.\u201d I thought he was exaggerating, but five years later I know all to well that he was not.\n\nIn Costa Rica rice and beans are served with every meal and more often than not ARE the meal. Red beans are the preferred choice in most homes, but the Caribbean side tends to favor black beans. In fact on the Caribbean \u201crice and beans\u201d refers exclusively to rice with black beans. Rice with red beans is called \u201cbeans and rice.\u201d\n\nBreakfast is usually a mixture of rice and beans called \u201cgallo pinto\u201d \u2013 and yes, for all you Spanish-savvy speakers, that translates to \u201cspotted rooster.\u201d Gallo pinto is a great way to use up yesterday\u2019s old rice and to make a dent in that big ol\u2019 pot of beans you\u2019ve made. It\u2019s typically served with a dollop of sour cream, a fried egg on the side and a corn tortilla. We like to add fresh tomatoes and avocado on top of ours, and sometimes we\u2019ll throw in last night\u2019s leftover beef or chicken.\n\nAnd though we eat this almost every day, I honestly never get tired of it. It\u2019s delicious, a great balance of complex and quick carbs, and a good dose of protein for the morning. Add some hot sauce and you\u2019ve got a winner. When I do find myself tiring of gallo pinto I add my own special little ingredient to help liven it up: a sliced banana. Yep. Sounds crazy, and I promise this isn\u2019t crazy pregnant hormones talking, but a sliced banana goes really well on top of rice and beans.\n\nGallo Pinto\n\nServes 4\n\n-- 2 tablespoons cooking oil of choice\n\n-- \u00bd medium onion, diced\n\n-- \u00bd medium bell pepper, diced\n\n-- 2 garlic cloves, minced\n\n-- 2 cups day old rice (fresh is okay too)\n\n-- 1 cup beans with a little bean juice (if using canned beans, just throw in the entire contents of the can)\n\n-- 2 tablespoons Lizano* sauce (optiona)\n\n-- 2 tablespoons minced cilantro\n\n-- Sour cream for garnishing (optional)\n\nIn a large skillet heat the oil and then saut\u00e9 the onion, pepper and garlic until onion is translucent. Add the rice, beans and Lizano and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle in the cilantro. Serve alongside an egg and corn tortilla with a dollop of sour cream.\n\n*Lizano is akin to ketchup here in Costa Rica\u2014it\u2019s used on everything and is every Tico\u2019s preferred condiment. It tastes like a mild A-1 sauce to me and you can find it at most world markets and sometimes even at a regular grocery store.\n\nBuen Provecho!\n\nDarla Antoine is an enrolled member of the Okanagan Indian Band in British Columbia and grew up in Eastern Washington State.
