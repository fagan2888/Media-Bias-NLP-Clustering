Had they succeeded (it now appears Congress will head off disaster at the last moment), it would have been the first time in our history that the nation defaulted, going back to Alexander Hamilton \u2014 and would have placed our economy at risk of another recession. Why did they do it? They\u2019re standing on principles.\n\nMeanwhile, European Union economic policymakers are leading the continent into its worst extended economic performance since governments began keeping national economic statistics. At the current rate, Europe\u2019s recovery from the current slump, between 2007 and 2013, is behind its growth rate from 1929 to 1935 \u2014 of course, those were the years of the Great Depression. Why? Because they\u2019re standing on principles.\n\nAs it turns out, both zealous Republicans and sober EU policymakers are standing on quite similar principles \u2014 balanced budgets, smaller government, lower taxes. As a life-long Republican (I served a political appointment in the Bush 41 administration), I\u2019m disposed to agree with those concepts. But as a pragmatic businessman, I abhor their elevation to the status of \u201cimmutable principles.\u201d I\u2019m for those concepts only as long as they work to achieve the goals they\u2019re intended to serve.\n\n\n\nThe problem with tea party Republicans and EU policymakers is that they believe these concepts are immutable. They always work. They can\u2019t be questioned. They\u2019re the truth. They\u2019re principles.\n\nMen standing on principles gave us Communism and fascism, the great political and social scourges of the 20th century. They\u2019re giving us radical Islam, the great scourge (so far) of the 21st century. No, I\u2019m not comparing EU policymakers or tea party Republicans to Hitler, Stalin or Osama Bin Laden. Those men were evil. But the reality through history is that when men like these (and it is usually men, for what it\u2019s worth) proclaim immutable principles, it attracts masses of misguided people who don\u2019t want to think, who are uncomfortable with reality and all its complexity, who want absolute truths to guide them through the confusions of the real world \u2014 which does describe tea party Republicans and EU policy.\n\nHere are some telltale signs of the problems with principles, whether in the form of political ideology, religious fundamentalism, or other rigid or extreme ideas.\n\nYou Know You\u2019re Standing on Principles If\u2026\n\nPeople who stand rigidly on principle are never open to the possibility that they might be wrong, no matter how badly things are going on their watch.\n\n\n\nPeople who stand on principle don\u2019t seek out varying opinions from intelligent people with different experiences than their own. They demonize those who disagree with them.\n\nPeople who stand on principles stop learning. I once saw a House Republican leader interviewed, and the conversation turned to Ronald Reagan. This Republican leader idolizes Reagan, has studied his career, and regularly touts his own adherence to Reagan\u2019s conservative principles of smaller government and lower taxes. When the interviewer pointed out that Reagan had raised taxes (see around 11:00), the Republican was dumbfounded, like a deer in headlights. He actually turned to his press person, who interrupted the interview. This was information contrary to his sacred principles. He\u2019d filtered it completely out.\n\nPeople who stand on principle don\u2019t \u201ccheck their assumptions\u201d from time to time. They don\u2019t feel the need. When they look for evidence, it\u2019s not to test their assumptions, but to justify their entrenched position. If things aren\u2019t working out, it\u2019s the fault of something else, not their principles. On the other hand, if something good happens, it\u2019s all due to adherence to their principles. Their principles are not \u201cfalsifiable,\u201d as good scientists put it. They can\u2019t be disproven, in the minds of those who stand on them.\n\nWorst of all, people who stand on principle invariably run headlong into absurdities of unanticipated consequences. Abraham Lincoln understood this: \u201cThe occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\u201d\n\nDid the Founding Fathers Give Us \u201cPrinciples\u201d?\n\nHere in the US, many conservative Republicans place great emphasis on immutable principles supposedly laid down by the Founding Fathers. They insist that we must stay true to the Founders and that their principles must guide our actions. But guess what? The Founders laid down no immutable principles. They were sons of the Enlightenment, and were the ultimate experimenters. The United States in their mind was one great experiment, and everything they gave us, even the Constitution, must be amendable to change.\n\nThis applies even to the core founding concepts: equality and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cWe hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nThe great scientist and experimenter, Benjamin Franklin, crossed out \u201csacred and undeniable\u201d and replaced it with \u201cself evident.\u201d Jefferson, himself a superb, pragmatic thinker, immediately agreed, as did John Adams. Even our core founding concepts weren\u2019t immutable. They weren\u2019t unquestionable principles. The \u201ctruth\u201d of even these core concepts \u2014 like everything else about the new republic \u2014 was subject to verification, testing against reality.\n\nIf you have to have a guiding principle, I\u2019d suggest that last one, about testing principle against reality. It\u2019s a great principle for business and the economy. And it would be a great principle for our political leaders.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-name": "Economy", "msapplication-config": "none", "description": "In an uncertain, complex world, our only guiding principle should be that principles must be tested against reality.", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "In an uncertain, complex world, our only guiding principle should be that principles must be tested against reality.", "title": "The Problem with Principles", "url": "https://hbr.org/2013/10/the-problem-with-principles", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvardbiz", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "The Problem with Principles", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "page-category-id": 1407, "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.21866", "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "sid": "ED78A77EBA1E4403E57B555B8451E3FD", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2013-10-16T20:32:40Z", "author": "Bill Lee", "section": "Economy", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T19:14:23Z", "tag": "Leadership"}, "uid": "9ca4227e0792f402c7bf3534481a183e", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "page-type": "ITEM"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffcf\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re principles.\nThey\u2019re standing on principles.\nBecause they\u2019re standing on principles.\nHere in the US, many conservative Republicans place great emphasis on immutable principles supposedly laid down by the Founding Fathers.\nThe Founders laid down no immutable principles."}
