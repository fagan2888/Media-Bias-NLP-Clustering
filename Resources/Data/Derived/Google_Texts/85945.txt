Rapid City, SD

The top fire official in Rapid City wants a new name for the Rapid City Department of Fire and Emergency Services.



Rapid City Fire Chief Mike Maltaverne says that fire officials want to readopt the name of Rapid City Fire Department. The agency changed its name in 2002 when it took over the city's ambulance service.



The department is staffed by more than 130 people.



Maltaverne says the department is working to become accredited and a way to do so is not only by changing its name, but also by revising its mission and changing the titles of some officials. He says the three assistant chiefs in the department will now be referred to as division chiefs.



Maltaverne says the mayor and city council support the changes.
