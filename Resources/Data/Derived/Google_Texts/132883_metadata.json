(AP) - Arkansas\u2019 Jonathan Williams wasted little time last season in deciding to return for his senior season.\n\nThe standout running back will have to wait longer than expected to begin his final year following the announcement by Razorbacks coach Bret Bielema on Sunday that Williams will miss \u201can extended period of time\u201d with a left foot injury.\n\nBielema didn\u2019t announce details of the injury, but he did say surgery would be required - with Williams expected to make a complete recovery.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt Jonathan will come back stronger than ever,\u201d Bielema said. \u201cAnyone that knows Jonathan Williams knows this is just another opportunity for him to prove the man of character and substance that he really is.\u201d\n\nWilliams is the 10th leading rusher at Arkansas with 2,321 yards on the ground, including 1,190 last season when he led the Razorbacks to a 7-6 record and Texas Bowl win over Texas.\n\nHe briefly considered leaving Arkansas for the NFL last season, but he announced his return prior to the 31-7 win over the Longhorns in the bowl game.\n\n\u201cThis is no doubt a tough moment, but I know through my faith and hard work that I will make a full recovery,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams and Alex Collins entered this season as the only major college football teammates to each rush for more than 1,000 yards last season, but now Collins is likely to play a much larger factor this season - as is talented freshman Rawleigh Williams and junior Kody Walker.\n\nJonathan Williams had 11 carries for 66 yards during an Arkansas scrimmage on Saturday, including a 36-yard run. However, he was seen talking with the team\u2019s training staff late during the practice.\n\nWilliams is on the preseason watch lists for the Maxwell and Doak Walker awards, and his loss is a devastating blow to an Arkansas program loaded with expectations entering Bielema\u2019s third season.\n\nBielema said Arkansas was gathering information about how to proceed with treatment of Williams\u2019 injury.\n\n\u201cThere are short- and long-term impacts on how he proceeds, and we want to make sure he does what\u2019s best for him and his family, and his career beyond Arkansas,\u201d Bielema said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas' Jonathan Williams wasted little time last season in deciding to return for his senior season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/arkansas-running-back-williams-injures-foot-surger/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Arkansas\u2019 Jonathan Williams wasted little time last season in deciding to return for his senior season.", "title": "Arkansas running back Williams injures foot, surgery planned"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Arkansas' Jonathan Williams wasted little time last season in deciding to return for his senior season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Arkansas running back Williams injures foot, surgery planned"}, "Author": "KURT VOIGT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Arkansas\u2019 Jonathan Williams wasted little time last season in deciding to return for his senior season.\nJonathan Williams had 11 carries for 66 yards during an Arkansas scrimmage on Saturday, including a 36-yard run.\n\u201cThere are short- and long-term impacts on how he proceeds, and we want to make sure he does what\u2019s best for him and his family, and his career beyond Arkansas,\u201d Bielema said.\nBielema said Arkansas was gathering information about how to proceed with treatment of Williams\u2019 injury.\nBielema didn\u2019t announce details of the injury, but he did say surgery would be required - with Williams expected to make a complete recovery."}
