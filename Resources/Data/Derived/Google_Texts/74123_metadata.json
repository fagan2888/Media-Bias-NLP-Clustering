Seventeen years after a crushingly narrow defeat, ENDA will likely garner the 60 votes necessary to move on to the House. The primary question now is whether the current bill is even worth passing.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nNo version of ENDA has been perfect. In its 2007 iteration, the bill tossed out transgender protections, leading to some truly idiotic in-fighting among gay-rights groups. This time around, the problem isn\u2019t transphobia (yet); it\u2019s religious liberty. The bill\u2019s religious-exemption provision includes the usual exceptions for houses of worship and religious groups. But it also includes a startlingly broad exemption for religiously affiliated organizations that, for whatever ostensibly religious reason, dislike trans or gay people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat exemption, designed to attract moderate Republicans\u2019 votes, is less of a loophole than it is a blank check for blanket discrimination. Several gay-rights groups have already hoisted a red flag over the religious-liberty provision, noting that they give a \u201cstamp of legitimacy\u201d to anti-LGBT discrimination. They\u2019ve noted, too, that the battle cry of \u201creligious liberty\u201d also mirrors conservatives\u2019 blatantly racist attempts to slip similar exemptions into the civil rights bills of the 1960s and \u201970s.\n\nTheir alarm is entirely warranted. Most employment discrimination bills\u2014even the Americans With Disabilities Act\u2014have a \u201cministerial\u201d exception, providing houses of worship wide latitude in employment decisions. That makes good sense, from both a pragmatic and a constitutional perspective. But broaden that exemption to religiously affiliated groups, and ENDA starts to look like a toothless policy recommendation rather than a legal mandate. Under this version of the bill, a Catholic hospital could fire a nurse for being gay, and a Baptist charity could fire an employee for non-traditional gender expression. Even weirder, that Catholic hospital would have free rein to inflict discrimination differently on some strata of employees. It could, for instance, decide to fire all gay nurses (under the theory that they violate the hospital\u2019s religious beliefs), while exempting doctors entirely from its religious tenets.\n\nHow did we arrive at a juncture where this twisted logic is necessary to garner the votes of five Republican senators? It arises, I think, out of the same specious misreading of religious liberty that led to Friday\u2019s calamitous ruling against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth-control mandate. Freedom of religion, a concept created to protect individuals and houses of worship, is now being deployed to shield corporations and private employers from following lawful employment practices. But this doesn\u2019t make any sense: Corporations don\u2019t have souls\u2014not until the Supreme Court says so, at least\u2014and private institutions like hospitals aren\u2019t churches. Forbidding a hospital from firing an employee for being gay does nothing to trammel personal beliefs or encroach upon freedom of worship; it simply prohibits a blindly bigoted employer from imposing his personal prejudice upon his employees. There is, in reality, no logical or constitutional reason to exempt them from laws like ENDA, except as a concession to anti-gay religious leaders and to provide a backdoor to continued discrimination.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "sailthru.author": "Mark Joseph Stern", "description": "After months of speculation and delay, the Senate has scheduled a Monday evening vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, which pro ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "After months of speculation and delay, the Senate has scheduled a Monday evening vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, which pro ...", "title": "Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it/56718340.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After months of speculation and delay, the Senate has scheduled a Monday evening vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, which pro ...", "title": "Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it/56718340.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mjs_DC", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-04T08:42:03Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "sailthru.headline": "Is a Weak LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it/56718340.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"239131104001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-04T08:42:03Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Life\",\n  \"author\": \"Mark Joseph Stern\",\n  \"tags\": [\"lgbt\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Is a Watered-Down LGBT Non-Discrimination Bill Even Worth Passing?", "keywords": "ENDA vote, ENDA pass, ENDA senate, ENDA religious exemption, ENDA history, ENDA religious exception, ENDA churches", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "ENDA vote, ENDA pass, ENDA senate, ENDA religious exemption, ENDA history, ENDA religious exception, ENDA churches", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "After months of speculation and delay, the Senate has scheduled a Monday evening vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, which pro ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/outward/2013/11/04/enda_senate_vote_the_bill_will_pass_but_should_it/56718340.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaece\"", "article_summary": "In its 2007 iteration, the bill tossed out transgender protections, leading to some truly idiotic in-fighting among gay-rights groups.\nMost employment discrimination bills\u2014even the Americans With Disabilities Act\u2014have a \u201cministerial\u201d exception, providing houses of worship wide latitude in employment decisions.\nIt arises, I think, out of the same specious misreading of religious liberty that led to Friday\u2019s calamitous ruling against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth-control mandate.\nThis time around, the problem isn\u2019t transphobia (yet); it\u2019s religious liberty.\nThe primary question now is whether the current bill is even worth passing."}
