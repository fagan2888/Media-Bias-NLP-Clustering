A new study suggests sarcasm is one of those faculties, and it has distinct neurological roots in the white matter of the brain.\n\n\u201cFailure to recognize sarcasm can lead to important miscommunications,\u201d wrote the authors, of Johns Hopkins University, in the study\u2019s abstract. \u201cFew previous studies have identified brain lesions associated with impaired recognition of sarcasm.\u201d To better understand the difficulties in communicating with stroke victims, the researchers wanted to investigate which areas of the brain suffered the most. Their findings may give families some insight into interacting with loved ones who have experienced stroke.\n\nLed by Dr. Argye Hillis, a neurology professor in the JHU School of Medicine, a group of scientists put 24 stroke victims in an MRI scanner. They looked specifically at eight tracts in the brain \u2014 areas that governed people\u2019s ability to pick up on the complex changes in pitch, stress, and tone found in sarcastic remarks and that ferry those signals to other parts in the brain. Each subject listened to 40 sentences and determined which were sincere and which were sarcastic.\n\nResults showed damage to the brain\u2019s right sagittal stratum. \u201cThat\u2019s a big white matter tract that connects some of the frontal and temporal regions to the thalamus, which is an area very important for getting information from auditory areas to the cortex for processing,\u201d Hillis told Medical Daily. People with lesions in this area were able to identify only 22 percent of the sarcastic sentences, compared with 50 percent of people without damage to the area. According to Hillis, roughly 90 percent of the general public can distinguish between sarcastic and sincere statements.\n\nFamilies of stroke victims stand a lot to gain from the findings. Sarcasm can be fun when it\u2019s taken in jest, but it may come across as cold and callous when taken at face-value. Stroke victims may interpret a harmless remark as deeply offensive, Hillis says, all because certain parts of their brain weren\u2019t communicating with one another.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect them to recognize your emotion from your tone of voice or your facial expression,\u201d she said. \u201cJust tell them how you feel.\u201d The same goes for people undergoing counseling, as emotions may be difficult to vocalize. People that seem apathetic or indifferent may actually care a great deal; their brain just doesn\u2019t allow them to show it.\n\nScientists typically don\u2019t try to repair these lesions directly, Hillis said. Instead, future investigations will gauge the potential for restoring the lost sarcasm detection abilities. \u201cThere are some therapies speech pathologists have used, but there have only been very small studies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out if there are treatments that can improve things like sarcasm or understanding different emotions from tone of voice and facial expression.\u201d\n\nSource: Davisa C, Oishi K, Faria A, et al.
