Riverside and San Bernardino counties’ rates for those without health insurance have dropped, the U.S. Census bureau reported Thursday, May 12.

The two Inland Southern California counties were part of a nationwide trend that saw 72.1 percent of America’s counties experience a drop in estimated uninsured.

For adults under 65, Riverside County residents without health insurance was at 17 percent in 2014, the most recent numbers available. It was 21.9 percent in 2013.

San Bernardino County’s rate is now 14.7 percent; it was 20.4 percent in 2013.

California’s rate went from 19.4 percent in 2013 to 14.1 percent a year later.

In states such as California that expanded Medicaid eligibility under a 2014 provision of the Affordable Care Act, 96 percent of counties had a decrease in uninsured rates. In states where the expansion was not provided, 37 percent of counties had a decrease in uninsured rates, the Census Bureau said.
