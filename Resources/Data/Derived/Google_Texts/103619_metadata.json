PAUL, Minn. (AP) - The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a convicted felon sentenced to five years in prison for possessing a BB gun.\n\nDavid Lee Haywood, 27, was charged in Ramsey County in 2013 with possession of a firearm by an ineligible person. He was convicted after the judge told the jury that a BB gun counts as a firearm.\n\nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld his conviction in September. The Minnesota Supreme Court will now consider the issue, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported (http://bit.ly/1IvOtCd ).\n\nCourt papers say Haywood was caught with a BB gun that looks like a small version of the popular Walther P99 pistol. Police found it during a traffic stop. Haywood was deemed ineligible to possess a firearm because of a 2005 drug conviction.\n\nOn appeal, Haywood argued that a BB gun shouldn\u2019t be considered a firearm under a state law that makes it illegal for a felon to possess a firearm but doesn\u2019t define the term. He cited several dictionary definitions, which defined a firearm as a weapon that uses gunpowder or an explosive charge to fire a shot.\n\nBut the Court of Appeals said the state\u2019s appellate courts have consistently interpreted the term \u201cfirearm\u201d to include BB guns. It cited a 1977 state Supreme Court ruling that said the term should be defined broadly to include guns using newer types of propellants, not just gunpowder.\n\nHaywood\u2019s attorneys had argued that the earlier cases were incorrectly decided so the appeals court was not bound to follow those rulings.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Paul Pioneer Press, http://www.twincities.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a convicted felon sentenced to five years in prison for possessing a BB gun.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/26/minnesota-supreme-court-to-consider-if-bb-guns-are/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a convicted felon sentenced to five years in prison for possessing a BB gun.", "title": "Minnesota Supreme Court to consider if BB guns are firearms"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a convicted felon sentenced to five years in prison for possessing a BB gun.", "card": "summary", "title": "Minnesota Supreme Court to consider if BB guns are firearms"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06c0\"", "article_summary": "The Minnesota Supreme Court will now consider the issue, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported (http://bit.ly/1IvOtCd ).\nST.
