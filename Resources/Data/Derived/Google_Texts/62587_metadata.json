Lee, who is no longer affiliated with Pinkberry, was ordered jailed without bail until his sentencing.\n\nProsecutors said Lee confronted Daniel Bolding in June 2011 after he flashed a sexually explicit tattoo to several people in Lee's car, including his fiancee. Lee drove away, and came back with another man who'd been in the car and beat Bolding.\n\nBolding was struck twice in the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack.\n\n\"I think there was a sense of entitlement felt by the defendant to the point where he felt he was disrespected by someone he believed to be below him,\" Deputy District Attorney Bobby Zoumberakis said.\n\nLee's attorneys said their client wasn't the attacker by trying to cast doubt on witness testimony.\n\nBolding also has filed a lawsuit against Lee seeking damages for the attack.\n\nLee, an architect, co-founded Pinkberry with Shelly Hwang and they opened the first Pinkberry store in West Hollywood in 2005. The franchise chain became wildly popular, drawing celebrities and long lines.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
