What will you find on the gay social networking and dating app, Grindr, at CPAC? Young gay conservatives ready for their movement to shift on issues that target gays.

Reason TV took on a social experiment at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this year by searching for gay people on Grindr to talk to about gay politics and the future of gays in the conservative movement.

"For conservatives if they are going to be able to win an election, they are going to need to get younger voters," said one 19 year old gay man. "And to do that they need to be more socially liberal. Essentially, they need to shift libertarian."

The sentiment is in step with a June 2014 Reason-Rupe poll of millennials that found 53 percent of millennials would support a presidential candidate who would be both socially liberal and fiscally conservative.

Run time: 2:48.
