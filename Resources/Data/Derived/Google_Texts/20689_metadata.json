Tournament Director, Cheryl Morgan, and her staff will take a short break before planning next year\u2019s event.\n\nFor 37 years softball teams from all over the Midwest have met in Sioux Falls, SD to take part in the Ringneck Tournament. Although they don't need to change much, the 122 team event still continues to grow.\n\n\"We haven't really changed a lot. We're still looking for teams and it still fills up quick. We begin taking entries in January and the tournament is usually filled in a week and a half. We get a good draw from the Canadians, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Minnesota, and of course our own state of South Dakota getting in it,\" Morgan said.\n\nMorgan admits as busy as she is filling out the standings while putting them out on Twitter, she still loves to get out and see how the Rushmore State stacks up against different competition.\n\n\"It's fun to get out and watch the local teams and how well they are doing against the other teams that come in. It's also fun to see the different caliber of play that the other teams bring in. I think when the younger girls were here on Friday and Saturday they like to see what the older girls can do in a game. It's kind of interesting for everybody,\" Morgan said.\n\nThis tournament has something for everyone from age nine to eighteen. So how long will Morgan continue to put together one of the biggest softball events in the country?\n\n\"As long as they will keep me on the board,\" Morgan said with a chuckle. \"We're having a good time with it and enjoy it as long as we have the passion and drive to be out here supporting softball, while allowing the young kids to get on a team and enjoy the sport.\"\n\nFor more information on the Ringneck Tournament we have attached a link to their website.
