Health politics 2016: Leading Republican candidates vow to repeal and replace Obamacare

The leading candidates for the Republican nomination are all proposing to repeal Obamacare. The difference between them is what they would replace it with.

Businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas both have said they want to increase competition to allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines, but neither has offered a detailed plan for replacing President Obama's signature law.

Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida would provide tax credits to help Americans purchase individual health insurance policies and give states more control of their insurance markets.

Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. John Kasich says the focus should be on improving primary care and rewarding providers that generate better health outcomes and help to hold down costs. | Read Casey Ross' story | Read Ross' story on the Obamacare stances of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders
