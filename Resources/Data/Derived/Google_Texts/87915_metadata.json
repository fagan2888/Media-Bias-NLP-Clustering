Worth area), preached back on January 12, 2014 on the sanctity of life has been making the rounds recently on social media. It is apropos in light of the horrific Planned Parenthood videos that have been released.\n\nIt shines a light on what is truly at stake as we discuss defunding Planned Parenthood, etc. It\u2019s about innocent human life that is being snuffed out, murdered, in the name of convenience.\n\nHere\u2019s the video, and it is worth the 6 1/2 minutes or so to watch:\n\nHere is the transcript of this excerpt of Chandler\u2019s sermon:\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was passed in 1973, there was no 3D sonogram. There was no ability to watch our babies smile at us before they were born.\n\nBy eight weeks\u2026 That\u2019s not even the first trimester. Your wife is probably still throwing up. At eight weeks, babies will suck their thumbs. We see they respond to sound. There is evidence building that they\u2019re dreaming. Here\u2019s a crazy one. Are you ready for this one? They recoil from pain. What really the ability to do sonograms has shown us is when doctors need to draw blood or take a sample and they stick a needle up there to do that, the baby at eight weeks will pull its heel up, will pull back in away from the needle.\n\nWhy? Because at eight weeks, all major organs are functioning, which means you have a nervous system that\u2019s developed, and you have a brain that receives signals that that hurts! We see the heart is pumping. The liver is making blood cells. The kidneys are clearing fluids, and there\u2019s a fingerprint. By 21 weeks, a baby, with just a little bit of help, can live outside the womb. Twenty-one weeks! Listen to me. Nearly all of the 1 million abortions committed in the Western world last year were performed after this period of time.\n\nHere\u2019s what happens. I know argumentation, and here\u2019s what happens. In our head, it\u2019s, \u201cWhat about this? What about this horrific situation? What about this?\u201d Listen to me. Statistically speaking, the majority of abortions are not taking place because of the woman\u2019s life being in danger or because there was some horrific rape. It is purely around convenience. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m not ready for this. I didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d Murder for the sake of convenience.\n\nWhat ends up happening is you\u2019re forced, because you can\u2019t argue with this\u2026 You can\u2019t argue these things are true. What ends up happening is you show your cards. Your cards show this isn\u2019t a rational argument at all anymore. This is now purely driven by the exaltation of self. Let me show you this, just show you how mad things have gone, how insane things have gone. Mary Elizabeth Williams wrote an article on January 23, 2013. Here\u2019s what she said. She is wildly pro-choice. Let me just read you the title of her article.\n\nThe title of her article is \u201cSo What If Abortion Ends Life?\u201d Here\u2019s what she says. \u201cYet I know that throughout my own pregnancies, I never wavered for a moment in the belief that I was carrying a human life inside of me. I believe that\u2019s what a fetus is: a human life. And that doesn\u2019t make me one iota less solidly pro-choice.\u201d Let\u2019s just start thinking about the crazy that just happened there. She basically said, \u201cI have no doubt that what I am carrying is a human life, and yet I have not wavered one iota, one little mark, away from this belief that it is the woman\u2019s right to choose whether or not to terminate the life of this baby.\u201d\n\nDo you want to hear her rationale? I mean, her rationale almost made me weep in my office. \u201cHere\u2019s the complicated reality in which we live.\u201d Listen to this. \u201cAll life is not equal. That\u2019s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-precious-baby storm troopers. Yet a fetus can be a human life without having the same rights as the woman in whose body it resides. She\u2019s the boss. Her life and what is right for her circumstances and her health should automatically trump the rights of the non-autonomous entity inside of her. Always.\u201d Period.\n\nThat\u2019s insane! Who chooses whose life has the most value? Who gets that power? That sounds like Nazi Germany excrement to me. That sounds like the Three-Fifths Compromise, when African Americans, when it was decided how the United States would vote, compromised three-fifths of a man. Who decides this? To whom do we give this power? \u201cWell, it\u2019s the woman\u2019s body.\u201d The baby might be inthe woman\u2019s body, but the baby is not the woman\u2019s body.\n\nIt has its own DNA. It has its own genetic code. It has its own blood type. It has its own functioning brain, its own functioning kidneys, its own functioning lungs, its own dreams. It\u2019s not the woman\u2019s body. It\u2019s in the woman\u2019s body. That\u2019s not the same. The argument is a woman should get to choose what she does with her body. Bull. Go prostitute yourself. See if you get arrested. You don\u2019t! I don\u2019t have the right to do whatever I want with my body. No one does!\n\nThat\u2019s this kind of weird, ethereal argumentation that\u2019s so detached from rational thought that it shows our consciences have been seared. You can\u2019t do whatever you want. I\u2019ll tell you what. Drive 95 mph naked on the way home today. Just do it! Let\u2019s see if you can do whatever you want. See what kind of rights you have. The argument is, \u201cNo, no, no, no. You don\u2019t get to tell me what I get to do with my body.\u201d Of course they do! Our elected democratic republic gets to tell us all sorts of things we can and can\u2019t do. Right now what they\u2019re telling us we can do is murder babies.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/08/who-chooses-whose-life-has-the-most-value/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/matt-chandler-sanctity-of-life-1024x536.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-08-11T05:37:39+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "abortion, matt chandler, murder, planned parenthood, roe v. wade, the village church, cultural issues", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Matt Chandler, pastor of The Village Church in Flower Mound, TX, calls out abortion for what it is.
