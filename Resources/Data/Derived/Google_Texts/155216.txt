With summer league mini-camp set to begin on Monday morning, the Nuggets have finalized their coaching staff under new head coach Michael Malone, according to a source. It is a staff of five new faces, loaded with highly regarded basketball minds.

Ed Pinckney comes to the Nuggets after serving under Tom Thibodeau for five years with the Chicago Bulls. Pinckney, best known for his role on the 1985 Villanova basketball team that upset Georgetown to win the national title, will be the lead assistant. The 52-year-old Pinckney has 12 years of coaching experience, including eight in the NBA with Minnesota and Chicago.

Next is Chris Fleming, an up-and-coming basketball mind who is currently coach of the German national team. He also coached the Brose Baskets Bamberg in the German League from 2008-14. While he was there, his team was four-time German Cup champions, four-time German League champions, three-time German Supercup champions, and he was German League coach of the year in 2011.

Fleming, 45, played college basketball at Richmond.

Wes Unseld Jr. is on the Nuggets staff. He was most recently with the Orlando Magic as part of then-coach Jacque Vaughn’s staff until Vaughn was let go in February. Son of Basketball Hall of Famer Wes Unseld, he was an assistant at Golden State in 2011-12 — alongside Malone.

Prior to that, Unseld Jr. spent 13 seasons with the Washington Wizards, six of those as an assistant coach. Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly and Unseld Jr. both worked for the Wizards at the same time for a number of seasons.

Micah Nori and Ryan Bowen both come to the Nuggets from Sacramento, where they worked under Malone when he was the head coach of the Kings. Bowen returns to Denver, where, as a player he was a fan favorite.
