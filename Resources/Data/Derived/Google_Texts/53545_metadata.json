The tea party-affiliated FreedomWorks argues in a 23-page report that the so-called three-legged stool has become lopsided.\n\nThe poll asked Republican voters what they are most interested in: 40 percent said \u201cindividual freedom through lower taxes and reducing the size and scope of government,\u201d 27 percent picked \u201ctraditional values\u201d and 18 percent chose a \u201cstrong national defense.\u201d\n\nRepublican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran the poll, said she\u2019s seeing a spike in voters who feel the government is too expensive, invasive and expansive.\n\n\u201cThe perfect storm is being created between the NSA, the IRS, the implementation of Obamacare and now Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are looking at the government more suspiciously. They\u2019re looking with deeper scrutiny and reasonable suspicion.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Libertarianism goes mainstream)\n\nFreedomWorks, which is among the groups leading the controversial push to defund the federal health care law even if it risks a government shutdown, argues that GOP voters have limited appetite for grand bargains that would raise taxes. Two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they want their member of Congress to \u201ckeep their promises and stick to principles\u201d as opposed to \u201ccompromise in a bipartisan way to get things done.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Obamacare on down, sticking to principle is where the Republican base is today,\u201d said David Kirby, vice president of opinion research at FreedomWorks. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of how off the Republican establishment is from their base.\u201d\n\nSocial issues have become less salient to GOP voters: 41 percent said gay marriage is not one of their top 10 issues. Asked about abortion, about one-third said it is one of the top three issues they care about; another third said it is not in the top three but somewhere in the top 10 and the final third said it is not one of their top 10 concerns.\n\nOne-quarter of Republicans self-identified as \u201clibertarian\u201d or \u201clean libertarian.\u201d Of Republicans, 42 percent view the term \u201clibertarian\u201d favorably and 10 percent don\u2019t know it.\n\nThe poll surveyed all voters, not just those on the right, and overall 27 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough to offer an opinion of libertarianism. About 40 percent of 18-to-32-year-olds view the word \u201clibertarian\u201d favorably, although about a third don\u2019t know what it means.\n\nTold that libertarians generally believe individuals should be free to do as they like as long as they don\u2019t hurt others and that the government should keep out of people\u2019s day-to-day lives, 58 percent of the full national sample said they agree.\n\nA slight majority, 52 percent, said government should not promote any particular set of values, compared with 40 percent who think government should promote \u201ctraditional values.\u201d\n\nOnly 17 percent said they think they will personally be better off under Obamacare, including just one-third of Democrats. The survey found 49 percent overall oppose the law.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The poll finds 78 percent of Republicans self-identify as fiscally conservative and socially moderate.", "title": "Poll: Republicans go libertarian", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/poll-republicans-libertarian-96576.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/10/cruz_paul_lee_libertarians_compy_328_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans (3934),GOP (509),Libertarian (12)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The poll finds 78 percent of Republicans self-identify as fiscally conservative and socially moderate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc419\"", "article_summary": "One-quarter of Republicans self-identified as \u201clibertarian\u201d or \u201clean libertarian.\u201d Of Republicans, 42 percent view the term \u201clibertarian\u201d favorably and 10 percent don\u2019t know it.\n| AP Photos Poll: Republicans go libertarianA new poll confirms a libertarian renaissance in 2013.\nAbout 40 percent of 18-to-32-year-olds view the word \u201clibertarian\u201d favorably, although about a third don\u2019t know what it means.\nStory Continued BelowIt\u2019s not that Republicans are suddenly self-identifying as \u201clibertarians\u201d and devouring Ayn Rand novels, but more that they seem to be embracing underlying libertarian priorities and views about the role of government.\nThe poll surveyed all voters, not just those on the right, and overall 27 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough to offer an opinion of libertarianism."}
