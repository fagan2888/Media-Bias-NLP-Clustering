Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.\n\nThe marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.\n\nHe said he held the auction to \u201cget rid of it all quick\u201d so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.\n\nWilliams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.\n\nLt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturday\u2019s auction, said it appeared to be well run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing a well-organized event,\u201d Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a circus. I\u2019m not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\u201d\n\nWilliams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that he\u2019d be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.\n\nThe purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.\n\nAlthough Saturday\u2019s auction was the state\u2019s first, Wissing doesn\u2019t expect it to be the last.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different way of moving his product,\u201d Wissing said.\n\nInterest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.\n\nBuyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.\n\nNazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasn\u2019t sure about the quality, he said.\n\n\u201cI was just interested in the whole process,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cTo me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\u201d\n\nSampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is a controlled business environment,\u201d Wissing said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington state's first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.
