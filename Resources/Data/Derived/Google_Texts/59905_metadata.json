The latest example comes from a black-oriented newspaper in Atlanta, called The Atlanta Blackstar (hat tip: Top Right News), which claims they are just alternative forms of the N-word. No kidding! The piece is titled, \u201cThe N-Word, Updated: 6 Code Words or Terms That Often Mean the Same Thing\u201d A favorite tactic is to claim that \u201ccode words\u201d or else \u201cdog whistles\u201d are being used when negative words are used \u2013 that these bad things are rally all about blacks. The Blackstar prefers to \u201ccode word\u201d method. Here are six alleged code words that only, in their fevered imagination, apply to black people.\n\n\u201cThug\u201d Perhaps these geniuses are unaware that this word has its origin in India, with the Thuggeee cult. Nonetheless, they are sure that it really just means black people. \u201cUrban/Inner City\u201d I will grant you that this is a euphemism for black. I sometimes refer to the color my car as \u201curban,\u201d in jest, of course. But a substitute for the N-word? Tell it to the National Urban League \u201cState\u2019s Rights\u201d Since when is calling someone a \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d an insult? I think maybe they mean that people who embrace state\u2019s rights do so in order to discriminate against black people. For people who claim to be updating matters, the reference to the battles of the 1950s and 1960s, when some Southern states resisted federal civil rights laws in the name of state\u2019s rights is awfully archaic. State\u2019s rights is mostly about the Tenth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights. \u201cWelfare and Food Stamps\u201d Here they go again, negatively stereotyping black people. Most welfare and food stamp recipients are white. Can\u2019t they use Google? \u201cLaw and Order\u201d I guess they don\u2019t know that black people are disproportionately affected by crime. In any event, calling someone a \u201claw and order type\u201d has never in my mind been associated with the N-word. It seems as though they think black people are criminals. Talk about negative stereotyping! \u201cCut taxes\u201d Again, \u201ctax cutter\u201d is not a substitute for the N-word, but they explain, \u201ccutting taxes has long been racial code for not using tax payer money to help Black and brown people.\u201d Here they perpetuate the stereotype of black people being dependent on government handouts. Spot the real racists.
