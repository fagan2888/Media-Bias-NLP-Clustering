Thank God Labor Day has come and gone. After such a sleepy summer, maybe we'll finally have some political news to cover in this boring, routine presidential race.

The two sentences above are examples of what we ultra-professional writers call "facetious humor."

In truth, the first furlong of the race has been INSANE. As in: SECRET GEFILTE FISH EMAIL! FEEL THE "BERN!" HE'S BIDEN HIS TIME. AN APOCALYPTIC NEUROSURGEON. A CEO WHO NEARLY SANK BOTH HEWLETT AND PACKARD. AND OF COURSE: DONALD TRUMP! DONALD TRUMP! DONALD TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP!

Now we enter an inescapable garden maze of televised debates, starting with CNN's Republican one on Wednesday of next week at the Reagan Library in California. They'll have a panel of media inquisitors. But why wait? And why them? HuffPost First to Last has its own questions for each of the top 10 candidates.
