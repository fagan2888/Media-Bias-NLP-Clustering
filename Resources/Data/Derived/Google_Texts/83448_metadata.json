At least Trig didn\u2019t eat the dog.\u201d\n\nShe went on to call out PETA\u2019s hypocrisy for failing to criticize PETA Woman of the Year Ellen Degeneres, who has posted a basically identical picture\u2013a tiny child standing on a dog to reach the sink\u2013on her own Facebook page.\n\n\u201cOur pets, including Trig\u2019s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don\u2019t fit your flighty standards,\u201d Palin continued.\n\nShe ended the post with several pictures of her family with their dog, Jill. \u201cJill is a precious part of our world. So is Trig.\u201d\n\nPalin\u2019s initial post with the picture of Trig celebrated his ingenuity and determination to get to the sink without her help.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sarah Palin has aimed her latest Facebook diatribe at a well-deserved target: PETA.", "title": "Sarah Palin brawls with PETA over family dog picture: \u2018Dear PETA...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 408, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/01/SarahandJill-408x400.png", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/04/sarah-palin-brawls-peta-family-dog-picture-dear-peta-chill/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "trig", "published_time": "2015-01-04T11:36:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T11:36:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0032\"", "article_summary": "She ended the post with several pictures of her family with their dog, Jill.\nSarah Palin has aimed her latest Facebook diatribe at a well-deserved target: PETA.\nPETA fired the first shot, issuing a public statement denouncing a picture Palin had shared of her young son, Trig, standing on the family dog in order to reach the kitchen sink and wash the dishes.\nSo is Trig.\u201dPalin\u2019s initial post with the picture of Trig celebrated his ingenuity and determination to get to the sink without her help.\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd that anyone\u2014let alone a mother\u2014would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo,\u201d PETA wrote."}
