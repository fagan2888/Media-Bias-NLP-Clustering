They have been preparing for Obamacare, which opened for enrollment Oct. 1. Coverage starts Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have to report these numbers \u2014 and you are going to take some time away from patient care \u2014 so you will have time to do that, or hire someone to do that for you,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThe mergers will kind of help, because you have a system then to help accomplish whatever we are asked to do.\u201d\n\nSome clinics won\u2019t be able to take patients with the government insurance because they will not be able to offset lost revenue as people start to find the loopholes in the Affordable Health Care Act, Strickland said.\n\n\u201c(Small clinics) don\u2019t have the negotiation power to get good prices from that plan,\u201d he said.\n\nPower of merging\n\nMerging practices to facilitate those changes are underway.\n\n\u201cIt has been happening for some time,\u201d said J.D. Sheffield, who runs the Coryell Memorial Medical Clinic. \u201cWhen they started to talk about the (Affordable Health Care Act), that definitely sped up the mergers and joinings.\u201d\n\nAnother issue that may encourage doctors to consolidate is fees.\n\n\u201cPart of it is having a government-certified system,\u201d Karen Harrison said. \u201cThere is going to be pay for performance, where fees (charged to the doctors) are going to be based on how good a doctor you are.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the performance-based system could cause some problems with doctors, but said doctors who put patients first won\u2019t have a problem.\n\nThe mergers caused by handling the administrative back end of those regulations could have the opposite effect, though.\n\nWebster said he makes money by providing quality care to his patients and often gets new patients through referrals from people pleased with his service.\n\nBusiness models should be based on doing what is best for the patient, he said. But working for a larger organization often means a different focus.\n\n\u201cIf policies are more concerned with saving money and cutting costs, that doesn\u2019t help the patient,\u201d Webster said. \u201cYou will always have a doctor torn between what he has to do to keep his job and what is right for the patient.\u201d\n\nHaving to deal with the changes to health insurance could cause some doctors to leave the field rather than join other, larger practices better equipped to handle the new law.\n\n\u201cOlder physicians like myself are going to retire,\u201d Webster said, adding he has heard that 25 percent to 50 percent of doctors will retire or drop out of the medical field. Losing that many doctors will lessen access to health care, as it will create longer waiting lines to see physicians.\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act, in that respect, will actually make it harder to see a doctor and receive care, Webster said.\n\nWhile changes are coming, none of the doctors expressed immediate concerns about leaving the field or their practices.\n\nHarrison said her clinic plans to cope with the health care law changes in ways that are best for the patients and the practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll eventually figure out what is best for our practice and what is best for patients and what is going to allow us to take the best care of our patients,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was my hometown, and when I completed my residency, I wanted to come here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "Several local doctors with small, private practices have mixed feelings about the Affordable Health Care Act, but most agree it will cause many family doctors to consolidate or leave the field.", "title": "Health care law creates challenges for local doctors", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/news/health-care-law-creates-challenges-for-local-doctors/article_601f6dc8-33cd-11e3-a5d5-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 421, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/be/2beb4cf0-32a8-11e3-8fe9-001a4bcf6878/52584c1c0d9b4.preview-620.jpg?resize=421%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Several local doctors with small, private practices have mixed feelings about the Affordable Health Care Act, but most agree it will cause many family doctors to consolidate or leave the field.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "obamacare,government insurance,family medicine,health law,j.d. sheffield,coryell memorial medical clinic,health care law changes,health insurance,webster family practice clinic,health care law,raymond harrison,karen harrison,chris strickland,patient protection and affordable care act,dave webster,health care,primary care,news,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "obamacare,government insurance,family medicine,health law,j.d. sheffield,coryell memorial medical clinic,health care law changes,health insurance,webster family practice clinic,health care law,raymond harrison,karen harrison,chris strickland,patient protection and affordable care act,dave webster,health care,primary care,news,top_story"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Health Care Act, in that respect, will actually make it harder to see a doctor and receive care, Webster said.\nThe Affordable Health Care Act requires stricter guidelines on documenting and reporting how doctors do their jobs, Dr. Karen Harrison said.\nSeveral local doctors with small, private practices have mixed feelings about the Affordable Health Care Act, but most agree it will cause many family doctors to consolidate or leave the field.\nLosing that many doctors will lessen access to health care, as it will create longer waiting lines to see physicians.\n\u201cWhen they started to talk about the (Affordable Health Care Act), that definitely sped up the mergers and joinings.\u201dAnother issue that may encourage doctors to consolidate is fees."}
