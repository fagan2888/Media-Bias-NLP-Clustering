NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Sarah Harwood loves her job as a registered nurse in the critical care division at the University of Vermont Medical Center.

“I never thought I'd be here for longer than my two year commitment,” says the 33-year-old Harwood. “But here I am going on seven!”

One thing Harwood particularly appreciates about her position is the equal treatment she receives in the field--equal treatment that extends to her wages.

“There is a base starting salary and then depending on ‘steps’ [you take toward] seniority, you get a raise every year,” says Harwood, who explains that there is no difference between her wages and that of her male colleagues. “We are all valued for our knowledge and ability to work together equally.”

But Harwood’s experiences may be the exception rather than the norm.

New research published at the end of March in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that male nurses earned substantially higher salaries than their female counterparts, regardless of specialty--and that this pay gap has persisted for 25 years.

For the study, Ulrike Muench, Ph.D., R.N., of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues analyzed trends in salaries of registered nurses (RNs) in the United States from 1988 through 2013. To do this, they examined representative data from the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) that occurred from 1988 to 2008 (after which it was discontinued) and from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2001 through 2013. The NSSRN sample included 87,903 RNs, of whom 7% were men, while the ACS sample included 205,825 RNs, of whom 7% were also men.
