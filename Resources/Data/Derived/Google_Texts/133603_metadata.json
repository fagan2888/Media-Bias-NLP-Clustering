Weisman cites a number of legislative deadlines that Congress faces next year. But those deadlines aren\u2019t what\u2019s causing this return of fiscal uncertainty. That blame falls squarely on the Republican Party.\n\nTo understand this, just read Weisman\u2019s article and look at the legislation that will require Congressional action in 2015\u2014postponing or eliminating the automatic cuts to Medicare physician payments (the so-called doc fix) in March; replenishing the highway trust fund in May; renewing funding for the Export-Import bank in June; reauthorizing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in September; and renewing the tax extenders at the end of the year. The debt ceiling will also need to be raised sometime late next summer, further spending cuts from sequestration will kick in and both parties will have to agree on a government budget for the 2016 fiscal year. Sounds like a lot, right? It is\u2014but it\u2019s not a lot more than Congress faced this year.\n\nIn fact, many of the issues requiring Congressional action next year were on the agenda this year, as well. They passed a debt ceiling increase in February, a dox-fix in March, a patch for the highway trust fund in July, and an extension to the Ex-Im bank in September. In the next few days, they will likely pass an extension of the tax extenders and an omnibus bill that funds most of the government for the remainder of the 2015 fiscal year. The only real legislative deadline in 2015 that didn\u2019t also exist in 2014 is the expiration of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. But Congress faced other deadlines this year as well, like the farm bill, which don\u2019t come up next year. In other words, 2015\u2019s legislative deadlines aren\u2019t any more worrisome than 2014\u2019s.\n\nSo why has fiscal and policy uncertainty returned? Part of the reason is that Congress already kicked the can down the road with the highway trust fund and Export-Import bank. Can they really do that again? (Yes, but it might be harder to do so.) More importantly, Republicans, reinvigorated by their midterm victories and emboldened by President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, are intent on using budget bills to challenge the president\u2019s authority. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with the government funding bill for the 2015 fiscal year. Republicans are coalescing around a proposal to fund most of the government through September, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security which would be funded until February. That would set up a smaller showdown between Republicans and Obama, but a showdown nonetheless.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On Wednesday in the New York Times, Jonathan Weisman offered a gloomy forecast for the year ahead in Washington and its potential effects on the economy. \u201c[A] dark cloud is threatening to return to otherwise clearing economic skies: fiscal and policy uncertainty,\u201d he writes.
