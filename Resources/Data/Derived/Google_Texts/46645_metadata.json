They're the result of the exchange's implementing a process to adjust or cut off coverage of people who failed to address discrepancies related to the income or citizenship information they provided when applying for coverage.\n\nThe federal government recently began using a similar process for the exchanges it runs, and Wadleigh said federal officials had been pushing Access Health to move forward with the process.\n\nVerifying the income and immigration or citizenship status of people who get coverage under Obamacare has been a controversial issue nationally. Critics of the health law have warned that failing to have processes in place early on to cut off those whose information couldn't be verified made the exchanges vulnerable to fraud and could waste taxpayer dollars.\n\nBut immigration advocates and other groups have raised concerns about efforts to terminate coverage for people with lingering application discrepancies, saying they could hurt people who were trying to provide documentation but had not been able to because of language barriers or other problems.\n\nThe terminations and subsidy adjustments could be a potential source of confusion in the coming weeks as the exchange begins the second sign-up period for private insurance under Obamacare, which starts Nov. 15.\n\nWho's affected and why\n\nThe Connecticut residents affected are those who signed up for coverage through Access Health and who provided income or citizenship information on their applications that could not be verified through the federal and state data sources the exchange uses.\n\nThe federal health law allows people in those situations to receive coverage and financial assistance based on the information they entered. But they\u2019re supposed to provide documentation to back it up within 90 days. After that, if the person still hasn\u2019t provided verification, exchanges are supposed to go by the information they get from official sources, which would most likely mean reducing the amount of financial assistance the person receives or cutting off his or her coverage.\n\nFor example, a person who applied saying he earned $30,000 would qualify for subsidies to discount his insurance premiums. But if the most recent tax returns on file with the federal government show that the person made $60,000, he would lose his subsidy after 90 days unless he could prove that his income is now lower than it was when he filed those tax returns.\n\nThat\u2019s how the verification process is supposed to work. But for most of this year, state and federally run exchanges didn\u2019t terminate people\u2019s coverage or subsidies if they didn\u2019t provide proof. Wadleigh said Access Health's system was not ready to handle the process when it launched last fall, and said officials had been waiting for guidance from the federal government before proceeding. In addition, he said, Access Health officials didn't want theirs to be the first exchange in the country to cut off paying insurance customers.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWadleigh said about 30,000 Access Health customers haven\u2019t provided information needed to verify their income or citizenship or immigration status. That includes about 21,000 people covered by Medicaid and 9,000 with private insurance plans. About two-thirds had discrepancies with their income, Wadleigh said, and the rest needed to address discrepancies in their citizenship or legal residency status.\n\nOver the next week, the exchange will check the information the 30,000 customers provided against federal and state data sources. If discrepancies still exist, the customers will either have their coverage cut off or, if the discrepancy is related to income and has resulted in too steep a discount on private insurance, their premium subsidy will be cut or eliminated. The changes would take effect Dec. 1.\n\nPeople whose subsidies are reduced or eliminated won\u2019t lose coverage, but their next insurance bill -- in December -- would likely be significantly higher than they\u2019re used to.\n\nWadleigh said the affected customers were sent four letters over a 75-day period, asking them to send information to verify what they entered on their applications. The letters were sent in the language people indicated they spoke when they created their accounts to apply for coverage, he said.\n\nDuring the summer, exchange staff called about half the customers who had information that needed to be verified -- which at the time included many who have since provided documentation. In addition, Wadleigh said, the exchange monitors returned mail to ensure that customers don\u2019t miss notices because they\u2019ve moved. It also uses bar codes on forms to track when they\u2019re mailed back, so people won\u2019t be at risk of having their coverage cut off while their paperwork is being processed.\n\n\u201cWe feel as comfortable as can be that we\u2019ve done a lot to reach out to these individuals, to try to get them to come back in and send us this information,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that not all of the 30,000 people will face changes to their coverage status if the information they entered is accurate and can be verified through the upcoming check of federal and state data sources. People who applied for coverage this year were asked to estimate their 2014 income, but the exchange had to rely on tax returns from previous years in its initial checks. Until May of this year, the exchange used 2012 returns, but has since been using 2013 tax information. Access Health now also checks income information against data from the state Department of Labor.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/11/06/30000-could-lose-coverage-or-subsidies-as-exchange-addresses-income-immigration-discrepancies/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, access health, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, exchange, Jim Wadleigh, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/11/06/30000-could-lose-coverage-or-subsidies-as-exchange-addresses-income-immigration-discrepancies/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "As many as 30,000 customers of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange could lose their coverage or see a drop in the subsidies used to discount their premiums next month because they did not submit information needed to verify their eligibility.", "title": "30,000 could lose coverage or subsidies as exchange addresses income, immigration discrepancies", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/11/06/30000-could-lose-coverage-or-subsidies-as-exchange-addresses-income-immigration-discrepancies/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2013/11/Access-Health-logo_0-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/11/06/30000-could-lose-coverage-or-subsidies-as-exchange-addresses-income-immigration-discrepancies/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb99f\"", "article_summary": "What happens nextWadleigh said about 30,000 Access Health customers haven\u2019t provided information needed to verify their income or citizenship or immigration status.\nAccess Health now also checks income information against data from the state Department of Labor.\nOver the next week, the exchange will check the information the 30,000 customers provided against federal and state data sources.\nThe federal health law allows people in those situations to receive coverage and financial assistance based on the information they entered.\nVerifying the income and immigration or citizenship status of people who get coverage under Obamacare has been a controversial issue nationally."}
