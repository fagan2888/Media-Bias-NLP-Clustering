Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich continue to campaign in hopes of garnering enough votes and delegates to at least force a contested convention.\n\nThat is what brought Kasich to Maryland on Tuesday when he held a town hall meeting in Annapolis.\n\nKasich told the Annapolis crowd a little bit of his life story.\n\n\"My father was a mailman, he carried mail on his back,\" Kasich said. \"His father was a coal miner and he died of black lung.\"\n\nBut the current chapter of Kasich's story is all about winning a contested Republican convention. He is hoping to capture some delegates in Maryland's primary next week to convince convention delegates to vote for him.\n\nMost polls show Kasich beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton if he is the nominee.\n\n\"So I think the delegates are going to look and say, 'If we nominate someone who's going to get crushed, we lose the Supreme Court, we lose the United States Senate, and we lose majorities in the state houses,'\" Kasich said. \"I mean it'll be a wipeout.\"\n\nKasich also talked about getting rid of parts of the Affordable Care Act and his belief in climate change. He ended the night wearing boxing gloves given to him by someone in the audience, who seemed to like the fight in the Ohio governor.\n\n\"(I just like) his general way of talking, his common sense approach, the way he relates to people,\" Kasich supporter Mike Hall said.\n\n\"I'm not thrilled with the other options in the Republican party, so I hope he can come through and be successful, because I think with him we can all be successful,\" Kasich supporter Mike Sullivan said.\n\nThe Maryland primary is April 26.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 20 Apr 2016 10:28:15 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "George Lettis", "og": {"site_name": "WBAL-TV", "description": "Maryland is usually not viewed as a battleground state, especially during the primary season when the outcome is usually decided before voters in the state cast their ballots.", "title": "Gov.
