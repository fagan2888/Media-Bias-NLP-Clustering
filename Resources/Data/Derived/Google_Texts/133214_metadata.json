The case underscores the high stakes of the electronic health record incentive program and the audits now underway of hospital and physician compliance with meaningful-use criteria.\n\nCMS has doled out billions of dollars under this program and is taking money back from hospitals that don\u2019t get it right, a compelling argument for them to assess certifications for every core measure and maintain a \u201cbook of evidence\u201d to that effect.\n\nJoe White, former CFO of Shelby Regional Medical Center in Center, Texas, was charged Feb. 6 with making false statements and identity theft in connection with $785,655 in Medicare meaningful use payments, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas says. He pleaded not guilty (see story, p. 6). \u201cIf you alter your data to keep Medicare money, that\u2019s a felony,\u201d says Austin, Texas, attorney Brian Flood, who is with Husch Blackwell.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated environment, as electronic health records take center stage in quality reporting programs but are eyed suspiciously by the government because of their potential to generate meaningless documentation and upcode bills. When EHRs are not properly used and monitored, they could saddle hospitals with overpayment liability or worse, Flood says.\n\nEHR Money Is All or Nothing\n\nThe most pressing recoupment risk is meaningful use because the government is spending a fortune to get the industry to adopt interoperable electronic health records. In 2012, for example, hospitals received $3.5 billion in meaningful-use incentive payments on top of $1.3 billion in 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. CMS is taking an all-or-nothing approach to compliance. Unless auditors determine that hospitals met all meaningful use goals, they have to return their entire payment, which is often in the million-dollar range. \u201cYou don\u2019t get partial credit,\u201d Flood says.\n\nTo get incentive payments, hospitals have to sign an attestation that they will use certified EHR technology to accomplish meaningful use objectives (Stages 1, 2 and eventually 3). Hospitals must satisfy \u201ccore\u201d and \u201cmenu\u201d objectives. Stage 2 core objectives include using computerized provider order entry for medication, lab and radiology orders; recording demographics in the EHR; charting changes in certain vital signs; documenting smoking status; and using clinical decision support \u201cto improve performance on high priority health conditions.\u201d Menu objectives include imaging results; recording patient family history as structured data; and e-prescribing.\n\nTo evaluate meaningful-use compliance, CMS hired an auditor, Figliozzi and Company of Garden City, N.Y. The audits have been frustrating for some providers because any deficiencies will cost them their entire meaningful-use payment for the audit period, lawyers and consultants say.\n\nOf course it\u2019s possible to ace an audit. Kaleida Health in Buffalo, N.Y., got word in January that it satisfied Figliozzi auditors for Stage 1 meaningful use criteria, says Robert Trusiak, chief compliance officer and senior associate general counsel. \u201cThere will be no recoupment,\u201d he says. It took its toll, however, to bring certified EHRs to life and monitor their compliance with meaningful use, Trusiak says. \u201cThis is not for the faint of heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d\n\nHere are four suggestions Trusiak has for improving and monitoring meaningful-use compliance:\n\n(1) Review the certifications at the end of every core measure. Figure out where deficiencies are and fix them well before the end of the meaningful-use year. \u201cDon\u2019t accept the word of the certified EHR representative, which is not a critical comment on the rep. It\u2019s a comment on the fact that core measures are fluid\u201d and technology evolves, he says.\n\n(2) Take good care of your \u201cbook of evidence,\u201d which is proof the hospital satisfied every core measure. \u201cYou need a book of evidence to support the veracity of your attestations,\u201d Trusiak says. Make sure the book of evidence contains both electronic and hard copy proof of every core measure. But don\u2019t think of it as ordinary documentation. \u201cThe book of evidence is a dynamic document and not static or a snapshot of compliance during the course of the meaningful use period,\u201d he says, because core measures may change during the attestation period and EHRs may be upgraded one or more times. Don\u2019t throw anything out. Hospitals must be able to produce documentation to support \u201ccontinuous compliance,\u201d he says. Trusiak suggests keeping duplicate books of evidence in case one gets lost (e.g., an employee takes it home and his car is stolen).\n\n(3) Test the operational aspect of the core measures. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for your meaningful use working group or steering committee to discuss compliance. It\u2019s another thing to ensure the compliance is operationalized,\u201d he says. That requires follow-up audits. For example, check whether the registration department is using software that\u2019s different from the certified EHR, which could mean the gathering of demographic data is not meaningful-use compliant, Trusiak says.\n\n(4) Be wary of foreign EHR platforms that detract from meaningful use requirements and create HIPAA concerns, Trusiak says. Certified EHRs are a one-size-fits-all technology, and hospitals or physicians may go off the reservation when they adapt it. Suppose physicians add a continuity-of-care tool to communicate patient needs between shifts (e.g., the patient in room 203 needs another CBC at 11 a.m. and make sure her white blood count isn\u2019t spiking). But they install software that isn\u2019t certified EHR. \u201cThat will impede the hospital\u2019s ability to meet the meaningful-use threshold measure,\u201d he says. It\u2019s also a HIPAA risk because PHI is stored with a third-party vendor that may not be subject to a business associate agreement.\n\nOther hospitals and physician groups are not faring as well as Kaleida in their audits, lawyers and consultants say. Richelle Beckman, an attorney with the Forbes Law Group in Overland Park, Kan., says auditors are finding meaningful-use deficiencies all over the map. Providers\u2019 attestations have been audited for accuracy of numerators and denominators reported by the EHR for various measures, such as computerized order entry. Auditors have evaluated whether information is truly being entered as \u201cstructured data,\u201d which some measures require. Each EHR product calculates structured data numerators and denominators differently; it is critical to understand how your product captures these values and ensure staff is entering data in a manner that will be captured on the EHR report or, alternatively, work with the vendor if certain data are not being captured when calculating numerators and denominators, Beckman says. \u201cEven if you have met 14 out of 15 requirements, if you don\u2019t meet one, they ask for the entire incentive payment back,\u201d she says.\n\nBeckman advises running reports for core measures for the periods they are attesting to and keeping them on hand. For example, if a measure, such as implementing drug-drug interactions, is a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d attestation, take screen shots demonstrating your system had set these functionalities. \u201cYou can set different levels of drug interactions,\u201d she says. \u201cAuditors want to see that your system will alert providers when certain prescriptions may interact with one another adversely.\u201d Screen shots of the alerts, ideally showing the date the screenshot was taken, or screen shots of the drug-drug interaction settings within the system throughout your reporting period, will help support compliance with this and similar measures.\n\nChris Apgar, president of Apgar & Associates in Portland, Ore., says there is still some denial out there. \u201cProviders think it can never happen to them. We are working with a four-physician specialty practice and it happened to them,\u201d he says. A large health system has had several of its component hospitals audited for meaningful-use compliance. One organization attested to its compliance but never did a security-risk analysis, Apgar says. \u201cIf they are audited, they will fail because you can\u2019t do it after the fact.\u201d\n\nEven in the absence of an audit, hospitals and physicians are at risk from meaningful use noncompliance, Flood says. Two laws \u2014 the Affordable Care Act and Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) \u2014 together created reverse false claim liability, which makes it a false claim to knowingly retain an overpayment, he says. \u201cIf you start to stack up data that clearly show you are not meeting your core measures or maybe not measuring them at all, at some point in time, someone will realize it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are inching up to FERA liability for retaining money you should have given back.\u201d\n\nMeaningful use is not the only way EHRs are posing a risk to revenue and compliance. \u201cThe EHR realm is very dynamic and has oodles of moving parts and has to be linked together,\u201d Flood says. \u201cI don\u2019t mentally divide them.\u201d For example, the physician quality reporting system (PQRS) rewards \u201celigible professionals\u201d for electronically submitting Part B quality data, with penalties after 2015 for failure to report. The next step is auditing the accuracy of the data submissions because they are the basis of Medicare PQRS incentive payments. \u201cCMS is sending out PQRS 2014 notices for validation for reporting. You are supposed to be using the electronic system,\u201d Flood says. \u201cIt\u2019s another place for losing money.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the government\u2019s warnings about the abuse of EHRs and the risk that documentation shortcuts pose to billing and documentation integrity \u2014 which Flood says ties back to meaningful use and its core measures. Medicare administrative contractors are already downcoding claims when documentation has been subject to cloning or copy-paste, which means it hasn\u2019t been updated by clinicians for the patient encounter. If physicians copy and paste to meet a core measure, \u201cthat is a production of a false record,\u201d he says. For example, screening for clinical depression is a 2014 core measure. Suppose a patient presents at the emergency room, talking about suicide, and the physician documents everything appropriately. On subsequent visits, the physician uses \u201crobodocumentation\u201d instead of updating the patient encounter (e.g., medication changes, drug use). That would not be compliant with meaningful use, Flood says, \u201cand if it comes up on audit and someone tries to change the documentation to fix it, you could be creating a felony.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
