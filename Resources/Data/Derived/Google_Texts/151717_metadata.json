The result is plenty of legislation with wholly misleading names. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the more egregious examples of bills and court decisions that are far from what their names suggest:\n\n1. The Patriot Act\n\nThere\u2019s no better place to start than with the USA PATRIOT Act. Many people don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s actually an acronym: Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act. While that\u2019s a decent description of the law, hiding it behind something like patriotism really disguises its true purpose. Once they better understood the legislation, a lot of Americans opposed the extreme surveillance measures and general eroding of rights created by the act. Thanks to the name, though, it became almost unpatriotic to criticize the Patriot Act, which is probably why most of its effects persist to this day.\n\n2. Right to Work Laws\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t support legislation designed to get people jobs, right? Alas, these laws, which just recently became adopted by Wisconsin thanks to its anti-labor governor, have the opposite effect of what they initially seem. Instead, Right to Work laws focus on busting up unions and union protections. Now, workers are actually more in jeopardy of being fired without cause and having their benefits taken away. \u201cRight to work\u201d is a misnomer, unless you expand the name to be \u201cRight to work for poverty wages until your boss finds someone else to do the job for even cheaper.\u201d\n\n3. Protect Life Act\n\nAnti-abortion activists love to tack the word \u201clife\u201d into their arguments, and the Protect Life Act is no exception. The problem with the doomed legislation is that it neglected to protect the lives of pregnant women. By blocking access to affordable abortions, the Protect Life Act would ultimately threaten the lives of women who had valid medical reasons for terminating a pregnancy. So much for that \u201cpro-life\u201d argument.\n\n4. Citizens United\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that our democracy has been corrupted with private interest money, and the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision is the culprit. The \u201cCitizens United\u201d term comes from the conservative lobbying group that won the case to pour endless money into elections as \u201cfree speech,\u201d but, if anything, American citizens are united in overturning this decision. While a firm majority of Americans are against the decision, with a constitutional amendment necessary to undo Citizens United, it\u2019s going to take an actual group of united citizens to make a difference.\n\n5. Defense of Marriage Act\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act may practically be a relic given multiple judiciary decisions ruling parts of it invalid, but that doesn\u2019t make its name any less absurd. The law never \u201cprotected\u201d marriage anyway \u2014 it merely made it an exclusive club by preventing same-sex couples from being able to legally wed. Contrary to this law\u2019s faulty logic, you don\u2019t have to stop marriages to save marriages!\n\n6. The Internet Freedom Act\n\nLest you think Congress is moving past these cheap, misleading names, just last week, U.S. representatives who have received big donations from the telecom industry introduced the Internet Freedom Act. The bill is geared toward destroying the recently established Net Neutrality. \u201cFreedom\u201d always sounds good, but this would take away rights from internet users and give all the power back to internet companies to decide how access to the internet is granted. That\u2019s not really freedom at all!\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you give politicians the ability to name legislation whatever they want, they often choose something misleading in the hope of pushing it through.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3134/3133781.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "laws,politics,deception,congress,united states,legislation,doma,patriot act,pro-life,same-sex marriage,internet freedom act", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Protect Life ActAnti-abortion activists love to tack the word \u201clife\u201d into their arguments, and the Protect Life Act is no exception.\nWhile a firm majority of Americans are against the decision, with a constitutional amendment necessary to undo Citizens United, it\u2019s going to take an actual group of united citizens to make a difference.\nInstead, Right to Work laws focus on busting up unions and union protections.\nBy blocking access to affordable abortions, the Protect Life Act would ultimately threaten the lives of women who had valid medical reasons for terminating a pregnancy.\nCitizens UnitedIt\u2019s no secret that our democracy has been corrupted with private interest money, and the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision is the culprit."}
