The pistol misfired. The gunman pulled a second weapon from his cloak. Though loaded, it too failed to fire. The cane-wielding commander in chief and several bystanders subdued the would-be killer, an unemployed housepainter named Richard Lawrence. Lawrence later informed interrogators that he was King Richard III, that Jackson had killed his father, and that with Jackson dead \u201cmoney would be more plenty.\u201d He was judged insane and committed to an asylum, where he died three decades later. Lawrence was a lone nut.\n\nOr at least that was the official story. It wasn\u2019t long before two witnesses filed affidavits claiming to have seen Lawrence at the home of the Mississippi senator George Poindexter shortly before the attack. Poindexter was a noisy opponent of the Jackson administration, and pro-Jackson newspapers accused the senator of plotting the president\u2019s murder. So did Jackson\u2019s allies in Congress, who quickly convened an investigation. Jackson himself told bystanders after the assault that the shooter had \u201cbeen hired by that damned rascal Poindexter to assassinate me.\u201d\n\nSome of Jackson\u2019s critics countered by suggesting that the president had staged the assault to gain public support and that this explained why both weapons had failed. And many Jacksonians pointed their fingers at John Calhoun, the South Carolina senator and former vice president, arguing that if he had not been directly involved in the assassination attempt, he had at the very least incited it with a speech denouncing Jackson as an American Caesar.\n\nWhen the Republican writer John Smith Dye described the crime 29 years later, he saw an even more devilish plot at work. Calhoun might not have been directly involved in the assault, Dye conceded\u2014or then again, maybe he was. Either way, Dye believed that Calhoun had belonged to a Southern cabal that would have benefited if Jackson had been put in the ground. The Slave Power, Dye informed his readers, was more than willing to kill a powerful man to get its way.\n\nIn 1841, for example, President William Henry Harrison told Calhoun he wasn\u2019t sure he was willing to annex Texas, which Southerners wanted to add to the union as a slave state. Harrison promptly died\u2014officially of pneumonia, but Dye was sure that arsenic was to blame. Nine years later, Dye continued, President Zachary Taylor was poisoned because he opposed the Slave Power\u2019s agenda in Cuba and the Southwest. And when President-elect James Buchanan prepared to make some appointments of which the slaveocrats disapproved, Dye declared, Southern agents poisoned all the bowls containing lump sugar at the National Hotel in Washington. Southerners, he explained, drink coffee; coffee drinkers use pulverized sugar; so the Southern diners would be spared while the tea-drinking Northern diners, including Buchanan, would be wiped out. Buchanan survived, Dye wrote, but he was intimidated into becoming \u201cthe tool of the slave power.\u201d\n\nThere is little evidence for Dye\u2019s explosive charges. But when his book The Adder\u2019s Den was published in 1864, the country was at war with the South, and when an expanded edition appeared two years later, the nation was still reeling from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In that atmosphere, a book that feels like a 1970s conspiracy thriller set in the antebellum era received a respectful notice in The New York Times and was excerpted in the Chicago Tribune.\n\nDye did not invent his theories from nothing: He drew on rumors that had been floating through Whig and Republican circles for years. And other Northerners worried about Southern conspiracies without taking their fears as far as Dye. Lincoln himself believed he could \u201cclearly see\u201d a \u201cpowerful plot to make slavery universal and perpetual,\u201d and in his famous \u201chouse divided\u201d speech he engaged freely in conspiratorial speculation. Meanwhile, Southerners had elaborate conspiracy theories of their own, blaming slave revolts, both real and imagined, on the machinations of rebellion-stoking abolitionists, treacherous land pirates, and other outside agitators.\n\nIt was a paranoid time. In America, it is always a paranoid time.\n\nPundits tend to write off political paranoia as a feature of the fringe, a disorder that occasionally flares up until the sober center can put out the flames. They\u2019re wrong. The fear of conspiracies has been a potent force across the political spectrum, from the colonial era to the present, in the establishment as well as the extremes. They have been popular not just with dissenters and nonconformists but with individuals and institutions at the center of power. They are not simply a colorful historical byway. They are at the country\u2019s core.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the public perception of political paranoia seems frozen in 1964, when the historian Richard Hofstadter published \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics\u201d in Harper\u2019s. In that essay, Hofstadter set out to describe a \u201cstyle of mind\u201d marked by \u201cheated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy,\u201d detecting it in movements ranging from the anti-Masonic and anti-Catholic crusades of the 19th century to the \u201cpopular left-wing press\u201d and \u201ccontemporary right wing\u201d of his time. Half a century of scholarship has built on, refuted, or otherwise amended Hofstadter\u2019s ideas, but that work rarely gets the attention that \u201cThe Paranoid Style\u201d does.\n\nThat\u2019s too bad. The essay does contain some real insights, and if nothing else it can remind readers that conspiracy theories are not a recent invention. But it also asserted that political paranoia is \u201cthe preferred style only of minority movements,\u201d and\u2014just to marginalize that minority some more\u2014that it has \u201ca greater affinity for bad causes than good.\u201d In the Harper\u2019s version of his article, Hofstadter went further, claiming that the paranoid style usually affects only a \u201cmodest minority of the population,\u201d even if, under certain circumstances, it \u201ccan more readily be built into mass movements or political parties.\u201d\n\nHofstadter did not provide numbers to back up those conclusions. We do have some data on the popularity of well-known conspiracy theories, however, and the results do not support his sweeping claims. In a 2006 Scripps Howard survey, 36 percent of respondents\u2014a minority, but hardly a modest one\u2014believed it \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d likely that U.S. leaders had either allowed 9/11 to happen or actively planned the attacks. JFK assassination theories are not a minority taste at all: In 2003, four decades after John F. Kennedy was shot, an ABC News poll found that 70 percent of Americans believed a conspiracy was behind the president\u2019s death. (In 1983 the number of believers was even higher: 80 percent.) According to a 1996 Gallup Poll, 71 percent of the country thought the government was hiding something about UFOs.\n\nTo be sure, there is more to Hofstadter\u2019s paranoid style than mere belief in a conspiracy theory. And there\u2019s a risk of reading too much into those poll answers. You can believe the government has covered up information related to UFOs without believing it is hiding alien bodies in New Mexico. (You might, for example, think that some UFO witnesses encountered weapon tests that the government would prefer not to acknowledge.) There is also a revised version of Hofstadter\u2019s argument that you sometimes hear, one that accepts that conspiracies are more popular than the historian suggested but that still draws a line between the paranoia of the disreputable fringes and the sobriety of the educated establishment. The \u201cfringe,\u201d in this telling, just turns out to be larger than the word implies.\n\nBut educated elites have conspiracy theories too. You wouldn\u2019t guess it from reading \u201cThe Paranoid Style,\u201d but the center sometimes embraces ideas that are no less paranoid than the views of the fringe.\n\nConsider the phenomenon of the moral panic, a time when fear and hysteria are magnified, distorted, and perhaps even created by influential social institutions. Although he didn\u2019t coin the phrase, the sociologist Stanley Cohen was the first to use it systematically, sketching the standard progression of a moral panic in a 1972 book: \u201cA condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests; its nature is presented in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right-thinking people; socially accredited experts pronounce their diagnoses and solutions; ways of coping are evolved or (more often) resorted to; the condition then disappears, submerges or deteriorates and becomes more visible.\u201d\n\nAn essential feature of a moral panic is the folk devil, an evil agent who serves as a scapegoat for the threat. The folk devil often takes the form of a conspiracy: a Satanic cult, a powerful gang, a backwoods militia. The anti-prostitution panic of the early 20th century featured lurid tales of a vast international white-slavery syndicate conscripting thousands of innocent girls into sexual service each year. An influential book by a former Chicago prosecutor claimed, in the space of three paragraphs, that this syndicate amounted to an \u201cinvisible government,\u201d a \u201chidden hand,\u201d and a \u201csecret power,\u201d and that \u201cbehind our city and state governments there is an unseen power which controls them.\u201d\n\nWhile coerced prostitution really did exist, it was neither as prevalent nor as organized as the era\u2019s wild rhetoric suggested. Yet far from being consigned to a marginal minority movement, the scare led to a major piece of national legislation, the Mann Act of 1910, and gave the first big boost in power to the agency that would later be known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Within a decade, the bureau would be extending its purview from alleged conspiracies of pimps to alleged conspiracies of Communists, getting another power boost in the process.\n\nSuch stories are missing from Hofstadter\u2019s account, which drew almost all its examples from movements opposed to the \u201cright-thinking people\u201d Cohen described. The result was a distorted picture in which the country\u2019s outsiders are possessed by fear and its establishment usually is not. The essay had room, for example, for \u201cGreenback and Populist writers who constructed a great conspiracy of international bankers,\u201d but it said nothing about the elites of the era who perceived Populism as the product of a conspiracy. Hofstadter did not mention Charles W. Dabney, the assistant secretary of agriculture who denounced William Jennings Bryan\u2019s Populist-endorsed presidential campaign of 1896 as a \u201ccunningly devised and powerfully organized cabal.\u201d Nor did he cite the respectable Republican paper that reacted to the rise of the Union Labor Party, a proto-Populist group, with a series of bizarre expos\u00e9s claiming that an anarchist secret society controlled the party. \u201cWe have in our midst a secret band who are pledged on oath to \u2018sacrifice their bodies to the just vengeance of their comrades\u2019 should they fail to obey the commands or keep the secrets of the order,\u201d the Winfield Daily Courier warned in 1888. The paper kept up the drumbeat until Election Day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "From the man who tried to shoot Andrew Jackson to The War of the Worlds, a brief history of political paranoia from Jesse Walker's The United States of", "title": "America the Paranoid", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/09/16/america-the-paranoid", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13789129947368.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On January 30, 1835, as Andrew Jackson exited a congressman\u2019s\nfuneral, an assassin drew a gun and pointed it at the president.\nThe pistol misfired.
