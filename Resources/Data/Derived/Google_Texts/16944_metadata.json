Katrina) with no electricity and no backup generator. In this, Paul Walker's last film written and directed by Eric Heisserer, Paul Walker must sustain his newborn daughter's life on a mechanical ventilator while he is deserted by all of the hospital staff. In this picture, we can ask ourselves, how much do we depend upon hospitals and physicians for their emergency care, and to which hospital would we go in a disaster or crisis? Also, how prepared are we, personally, at home and work for a disaster? When electricity fails, how will we communicate and survive? Your homework assignment, should you choose to accept it (it's a Mission Very Possible), is to have your own disaster plan. My suggestion for your plan will be in a future article. For full disclosure, my son Jaron Presant was the Director of Photography, but that did not influence my decision to nominate the film.\n\n\u2022 Dallas Buyers Club is a film written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, which has been nominated as best film of the Year by the Academy. It shows us through the outstanding acting of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto what goes through a person's mind when suddenly confronting a life-threatening diagnosis. Beyond that, it gives us insight about how far people will go to get information about their illnesses, how they will use all means to get life-sustaining drugs or treatments, the problems with limited drug supplies for certain conditions, the effects of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation and restrictions on our drug access for life threatening diseases such as diabetes and breast cancer, off-label usage of drugs in America, and the use of foreign pharmacies to acquire drugs (a very common process in America). One only wonders what effect the Affordable Care Act will have on these issues and we hope that government policies will continue to provide good access to the best medicines in the world.\n\n\u2022 Nebraska is a film that portrays an elderly man, played by Academy Award nominated Bruce Dern, who is confused and shows signs of early dementia. Written by Bob Nelson and directed by Alexander Payne, the film shows us how aging can lead to poor cognitive function, and how important support from family can be in adjusting to cognitive challenges.\n\n\u2022 Blue Jasmine is an Academy nominated story about a woman whose situation is causing anxiety and depression. Written and directed by Woody Allen, it makes us aware of how disrupting such a person, wonderfully acted by Cate Blanchette (Academy nominee), can be in a family, and how much support and medical care is needed is dealing with major life changes.\n\n\u2022 Love is All You Need portrays a woman, acted by Trine Dyrholm, who is recovering from breast cancer and divorce who finds support through a family celebration (wedding) and a new friend, Pierce Brosnan. This displays how much family and friendships mean in helping to readjust, often to actually survive, following a life-threatening illness. As often happens, these crises disrupt marriages, adding the stress of lost love to the fear of fatality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You have not heard about these nominations, because the Academy really doesn't have a category of Best Health-Themed Movie of the Year.
