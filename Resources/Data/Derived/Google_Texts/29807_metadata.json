Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) and John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) released a new report Tuesday evening highlighting Obamacare\u2019s failures, including forcing millions of Americans off their health insurance plans and adding $1 trillion in new taxes.\n\nThe senators, both of whom are physicians, followed up on three previous reports dating back to July 2010 that warned of the dangerous side effects of the health care law.\n\n\u201cFor millions of Americans, Obamacare itself has become a pre-existing condition that has limited their access to quality, affordable health care,\u201d Coburn said in a statement. \u201cAs we warned in our previous reports, Obamacare is fundamentally flawed. The law strengthens the hand of government and weakens the hand of doctors and patients. Obamacare is cutting choices, not costs, and costs will likely continue to rise.\u201d\n\nCoburn and Barrasso predicted in 2010 that millions would lose their health insurance plans. As of January, more than five million Americans have had their insurance cancelled, with 1.1 million notices occurring in California alone.\n\n\u201cDespite President Obama and Democrats\u2019 promises that \u2018if you like your plan you can keep it,\u2019 more than five million people in 35 states have lost their current health insurance plans due to Obamacare,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nThe senators said the outcome was \u201cworse than we imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnforcement of the employer mandate has been delayed, which has pushed back some of the impact the mandate will have on individuals losing their original health insurance plans,\u201d they said.\n\nAdditionally, Coburn and Barrasso predicted the law would bring \u201cskyrocketing\u201d health care costs and trillions in new taxes.\n\nThe pair cites a report from the American Action Forum that found that insurance premiums are rising in all 50 states by an average of 202 percent.\n\nAccording to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, Obamacare is also adding $1.058 trillion in new taxes, including $317.7 billion in payroll taxes, a $111.0 billion tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d high cost plans, and $55 billion for those who do not abide by the individual mandate.\n\nSome of Coburn\u2019s and Barrasso\u2019s predictions are still developing since portions of the law have been delayed numerous times. For instance, because the employer mandate was delayed until 2017, its impact on jobs is not yet clear.\n\nThe senators predicted that the mandate would negatively impact jobs, which was backed up by the CBO estimate that the law will eliminate the equivalent of 2 million jobs.\n\nAnother \u201cprognosis\u201d that is still developing is the law shifting the uninsured to Medicaid, because not all states have expanded their Medicaid programs. However, last week Sen. Mark Udall (D., Colo.) praised Obamacare for adding to the Medicaid rolls.\n\nDemocrats continue to argue that Obamacare is \u201csettled law\u201d and only needs tweaking, though Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is silent on how.\n\nHowever, Coburn and Barrasso said the law\u2019s negative impacts are \u201cnot due to minor imperfections in the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impacts of Obamacare were foreseeable and preventable,\u201d they said. \u201cNow, President Obama\u2019s administration is scrambling to mitigate these negative consequences through administrative actions and delays. However, the flawed policies within the health care law cannot be fixed through administrative adjustments or delays.\u201d\n\nCoburn and Barrasso said their report is \u201cnot an exhaustive list\u201d of Obamacare failures, but highlights that many of its negative impacts were \u201canticipated and preventable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs doctors, we know that Americans should be in charge of their own healthcare decisions\u2014not Washington,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cOver the past four years, we\u2019ve highlighted the negative side effects of the healthcare law for patients, providers and taxpayers. Our new report confirms again exactly how Americans across the country are losing their insurance plan, watching their costs increase, and paying higher taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to repeal this law and replace it with step by step reform that focuses on care instead of coverage,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "$1.058 trillion in new taxes, five million insurance cancellations", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Sens.
