This is what Muslims have brought to Europe.\u201d\n\nSavage added, \u201cThis is what Muslims will bring to America if Obama is allowed to bring his cousins in\u201d (Free audio).\n\nAfter all, he continued, the president is a Muslim, at least by birth.\n\n\u201cBoth his biological father and adoptive father were Muslims,\u201d Savage noted. Under those circumstances, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean someone is a terrorist; it just means that you\u2019re a Muslim.\u201d\n\nDr. Savage mocked the president for praising Islam\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d to \u201cthe fabric of our nation,\u201d during an address commemorating the holiday of Eid.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know George Washington had a prayer rug,\u201d said Savage sarcastically.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what Obama learned in Indonesia, that Muslims built America. That\u2019s your president. Now you understand why the world is in turmoil\u201d (Free audio).\n\nRush Limbaugh\n\nPresident Obama \u201cis really trying to goad the House Republicans into impeaching him,\u201d Rush Limbaugh declared this week.\n\nLimbaugh noted he happened to see a headline on CNN that stated, \u201cGOP wants to impeach Obama.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cCNN and other drive-by media are going to report this \u2013 not as something Obama is trying to make happen \u2013 they\u2019re going to report this as something the Republicans want to happen so that they get creamed by it even if they do nothing. Remember, there is no journalism anymore. There is only advocacy disguised as the news.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh also said that the Republicans\u2019 lawsuit against the president \u201ccould be a disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re suing him for not enforcing the law,\u201d the radio host pointed out. \u201cWhat is the law that he hasn\u2019t enforced? Well, the big one\u2019s Obamacare. So it could be said that the Republicans are suing so that Obama will fully implement Obamacare. Is that what we want?\u201d (Free audio).\n\nAaron Klein\n\nKlein grilled Hatem Bazian, chairman of the American Muslims for Palestine. This group is behind the virulently anti-Israel demonstrations that have been held across the U.S. in recent weeks.\n\nKlein also explained how John Kerry\u2019s \u201ccease-fire\u201d agreements actually favor Hamas by putting Israel\u2019s security at risk. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., told Klein and his audience that the president is using the current Middle East crisis to raise money for a very unlikely cause. Aaron Klein also presents evidence that that surge of illegals was in fact orchestrated by the administration (Free audio).\n\nMark Levin\n\nMark Levin\u2019s special guest this week was Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of the founder of Hamas. According to him, Hamas doesn\u2019t just want to destroy the state of Israel, a goal explicitly declared in the group\u2019s charter; it wants to establish a global Muslim caliphate.\n\nYousef also confirms that Hamas is prepared to kill as many Palestinians as it takes to garner sympathy for their cause (Free audio).\n\nAs far as illegal immigrants are concerned, Levin has a simple solution: \u201cTurn \u2019em around, kick \u2019em in the ass and send \u2019em home\u201d (Free audio).\n\nLaura Ingraham\n\nIs Laura Ingraham considering a career switch, from broadcasting to electoral politics?\n\nThis week, the radio talk show host told Real Clear Politics, \u201cI\u2019ve been approached by various people to get involved. I\u2019m keeping an open mind about running for office in the future.\u201d\n\nAs reporter Jon Terbush noted, that\u2019s \u201ca pretty standard answer for someone gauging interest in a potential bid, so we\u2019ll see how this plays out.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Ingraham continues her efforts to get others elected. She\u2019s recorded a robocall in support of challenger Rep. Joe Carr, who is running against Tennessee\u2019s incumbent senator, Lamar Alexander.\n\n\u201cYou currently have hundreds of illegal aliens being dumped into Tennessee,\u201d she says in the recording, \u201cand Lamar Alexander, your current senator, has done nothing about it. In fact, Lamar voted for the Senate Amnesty bill, which is part of the reason people are coming to this country illegally today\u201d (Free audio).\n\nGlenn Beck\n\n\u201cThe birther thing is over, the black thing is over, so now \u2026 [Obama] needs to be able to call for justice.\u201d\n\nEchoing the thoughts of many other conservative pundits, Glenn Beck says the president is actually stoking impeachment rumors, in order to generate support from his base by positioning himself as an underdog who is being attacked.\n\nBeck, who called for Obama\u2019s impeachment last year, now cautions his audience.\n\n\u201cDo you think anyone in Washington in the GOP is serious about impeachment? Do you think one person? Have you spoken to one person? Not one. So who wants it? The president does. Because then he\u2019ll be able to say, \u2018I demand justice.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Michael Savage Dr. Savage warned his listeners that the blatant anti-Semitism currently raging in Europe could be coming to America. \u201cA caf\u00e9 in Belgium has placed a sign in its window barring Jews from entering,\u201d he reported. \u201cThis is happening in the modern age, in the year 2014.
