A sentence stating this is underlined in Kobach\u2019s letter to Republican congressmen.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that Compact Clause does not require the President's signature \u2014 only Congress need approve,\u201d Kobach wrote in the underlined passage.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote a six-page memorandum obtained by The Topeka Capital-Journal detailing the constitutional arguments laid out by Kobach and ultimately dismissing them, ruling instead that such a compact would, in fact, require the president\u2019s signature.\n\nAndrew Nolan, a legislative attorney with CRS, made his case that compacts require a presidential signature by citing two clauses in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Presentment Clause in Article 1, Section 7 states that \u201cevery bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President\u201d for his signature or veto. The clause goes on to state that a law has been constitutionally enacted only if it passes through both houses of Congress and the president, according to Nolan. While there are exceptions, such as impeachment proceedings, state compacts aren\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe second clause Nolan cites is the Compact Clause in Section 10 of the Constitution. It states, \u201cNo State shall, without the consent of Congress \u2026 enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State \u2026\u201d Taken together, the two clauses require Congress to agree to the compact and send it to the president before it can become law, Nolan contends.\n\nIn an interview Thursday night, Kobach said the Presentment Clause doesn\u2019t apply because the compact isn\u2019t a federal statute, adding that \u201cCRS reports are to be taken with a pinch of salt.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback approved legislation setting up participation in the health care compact. Georgia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Utah, South Carolina and Alabama have passed similar bills.\n\nIn his letter, Kobach concedes that a compact would require the approval of Congress but argues it wouldn\u2019t require Obama\u2019s signature.\n\n\u201cThe Framers wanted these compacts to be possible in the future, but subject to a congressional veto so that the states could not circumvent the federal government,\u201d Kobach wrote.\n\nKobach\u2019s argument amounts to a strict reading of the Constitution, which doesn\u2019t explicitly mention the president in regard to state compacts. Nolan, however, writes that \u201cthe text, structure, purpose and function of the Constitution, coupled with the sustained practice of Congress strongly suggests that legislation approving of the Health Care Compact should be subject to the limitations of the Presentment Clause.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would rather be on the side of the words of the Constitution,\u201d Kobach said, adding that CRS reports \u201care often wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Research Service is an agency within the Library of Congress that conducts nonpartisan research and writes reports at the request of members of Congress and their staff. Its reports are not made available to the public.\n\nAccording to Nolan, state compacts have been subject to a presidential veto \u201csince the founding of the country.\u201d The researcher cites a study by former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter that found every interstate compact approved by Congress between 1789 and 1925 was presented to the president. \u201cThis practice appears to have continued after 1925,\u201d Nolan wrote.\n\nNolan concludes that both the Constitution and the manner in which it has been interpreted for 226 years suggest that the health care compact would have to be approved by the president. Kobach, however, said a strict constructionist judge \u2014 one who prefers a more literal reading of the Constitution \u2014 would side with the states in a future legal battle over the health care compact.\n\n\u201cI don't think this report will scare Congress away,\u201d Kobach said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/cjo/widetile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/cjo/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/cjo/smalltile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/cjo/largetile.png"}, "article_summary": "The benefit of the health care compact, Kobach argued, is that it wouldn\u2019t be subject to a veto by President Barack Obama.\nSam Brownback approved legislation setting up participation in the health care compact.\nA day after Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach publicly called on members of Congress to support a health care compact between several states, the research arm of Congress wrote a memo informing lawmakers that the compact isn\u2019t constitutional.\nKobach, however, said a strict constructionist judge \u2014 one who prefers a more literal reading of the Constitution \u2014 would side with the states in a future legal battle over the health care compact.\nNolan concludes that both the Constitution and the manner in which it has been interpreted for 226 years suggest that the health care compact would have to be approved by the president."}
