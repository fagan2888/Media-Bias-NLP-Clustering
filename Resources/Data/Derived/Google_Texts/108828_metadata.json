According the arresting officer\u2019s report, Hager had called 911 himself and freely admitted his actions after being booked.\n\nAs tragic as this case is on the surface, the death of Hager\u2019s wife, Carolyn Hager, is not so straighforward. While being questioned at the St. Lucie County Sherff\u2019s Office, Hager explained that his wife had a number of illnesses that required various medications.\n\nBecause the couple had become unable to afford her prescriptions, Hager says his wife was in continual pain. He says she had told him that she wished to end her life, though she did not specifically request that he kill her. In his confession, Hager explains that he came to his decision after several days of consideration.\n\nThough medical privacy laws have prevented the public disclosure of Carolyn Hager\u2019s illnesses and medications, records show the couple filed for bankruptcy in 2011. In an effort to bring in money to keep his wife\u2019s prescriptions current, William Hager started working at a Sears, officials say. That paycheck was evidently not enough.\n\nWilliam Hager has yet to face a criminal trial and not all details about the shooting have been made public. However, it\u2019s not difficult to see what happened here \u2014 vulnerable members of our society were left to fall through the cracks and pushed to take desperate measures. One might argue that what William Hager did was not so much homicide but euthanasia \u2014 an act of mercy.\n\nLast year Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated House of Representatives nixed plans for the state to expand its Medicaid program per the Affordable Care Act. This was the third time funds aimed at helping 650,000 Floridians gain health insurance were rejected by the state\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nDespite the fact that the expansion would have come with more than $18 billion in federal funds, one staunch opponent says expanding Medicaid in Florida is \u201csomething we cannot afford.\u201d Republican Rep. Doug Broxson worries about the costs on a national level, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that we could spend all our gross national product on healthcare.\u201d\n\nNoble as it is for Rep. Broxson to fret over the nation\u2019s pocketbook, his position is in dire need of perspective. Here in the United States, the wealthiest nation in history, millions of Americans are still uninsured. Yet at the same time, the United States also has the distinction of spending 33 cents of every dollar spent globally on its bloated military.\n\nAlmost one in four Florida residents \u2014 4.8 million \u2014 lack health insurance. It is entirely possible that Carloyn Hager was one of these people.\n\nSo while her husband pulled the trigger and admitted doing so, was William Hager wholly responsible for Carolyn\u2019s death? Perhaps some blame could be placed at the feet of the conservative Florida lawmakers whose priorities are focused more on expanding and protecting the rights of gun owners rather than keeping its constituents healthy.\n\nIt certainly says something about Florida politics when someone like George Zimmerman can obtain a concealed carry permit and kill an innocent black teen with the law\u2019s protection \u2014 but when the Hagers were forced into an extreme situation, William will now likely spend his remaining years behind bars.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with this picture?\n\nPhoto Credit: KatarzynaBialasiewicz / Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hager says his wife told him, after days of continual pain, that she wished to die.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3179/3178144.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "affordable care act,medicaid,florida,gun violence,crime,euthanasia", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As tragic as this case is on the surface, the death of Hager\u2019s wife, Carolyn Hager, is not so straighforward.\nFlorida man William Hager, 86, was arrested on charges of first-degree, premeditated murder after fatally shooting his wife as she slept.\nBecause the couple had become unable to afford her prescriptions, Hager says his wife was in continual pain.\nOne might argue that what William Hager did was not so much homicide but euthanasia \u2014 an act of mercy.\nSo while her husband pulled the trigger and admitted doing so, was William Hager wholly responsible for Carolyn\u2019s death?"}
