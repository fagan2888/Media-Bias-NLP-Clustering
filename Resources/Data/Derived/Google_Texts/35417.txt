In just his first six months on the job, Pope Francis has distinguished himself as the pontiff most likely to go rogue. This, after all, is a man who just got a used car to tool around in. Last May, during a Vatican radio message, he called atheists “precious allies” and told them, “Do good: we will meet one another there.” Now, in a letter to nonbelievers in La Republica, signed simply “Francesco,” the pope continues on his apparent quest to make Vatican higher-ups go a little bit apoplectic.

The letter was a response to the paper’s editor Eugenio Scalfari, and a call to spark “a sincere and rigorous dialogue” between Christians and atheists. Obviously, the man whose work uniform includes a big pointy hat isn’t going to go all, “Maybe this God thing is a bunch of hooey.” But what Francis did offer was a seemingly sincere and respectful attempt to find common ground. “The question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience,” he wrote. “There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one’s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one’s mind about what is good and evil.” Oh right! Free will! Always a good idea.
