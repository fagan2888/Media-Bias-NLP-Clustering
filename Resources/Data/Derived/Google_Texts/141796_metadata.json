(AP) - On June 7, a Saturday, Glen Coghill perused the photo albums on a table at Steve Farmer\u2019s auction house in Red Lion.\n\nOne of the albums caught his attention. It contained photos, dating to perhaps the early 1950s, of military aircraft, prop planes from, probably, the Korean conflict era. He likes military stuff and has a pretty steady side business, supplementing his income as a manager of a Subway by selling military memorabilia, along with toys and other collectibles, on eBay.\n\nHe\u2019s been doing it for eight or 10 years, going to auctions to buy things for resale. He has a pretty good eye for what will sell and what won\u2019t. The photos of the old aircraft would.\n\nThe albums were part of an estate sale. It just happened that he was sort of acquainted with the person who had owned the items up for action, a local antiques dealer named Mary Pentin, who died last year. He would frequently run into Pentin and her husband, Bill, at sales. They knew each other well enough to say hello or exchange brief pleasantries.\n\nAlong with the photo albums was a scrapbook containing newspaper clippings, photos and some other things. He really didn\u2019t take a good look at it. It was the album of photos of military aircraft that he was really after.\n\nThe bidding opened, and closed. He got the album for $2. He was given \u201cbidder\u2019s choice,\u201d a term that means he could buy the other, similar items for the same price. He exercised the option and bought the four photo albums and the scrapbook for a total of $10.\n\nThat was when he took a closer look at the scrapbook. It contained telegrams, inviting a person named Mary Berg to speaking engagements in New York. The newspaper clippings were also about this Berg woman; some were advertisements for a book she had written. Then, he took a good look at the photos. They were all taken in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Nazi occupation.\n\nHe thought, \u201cOh my God.\u201d\n\nHe went home and Googled Mary Berg, and what he learned blew his mind.\n\nHe had no idea.\n\nNobody had any idea.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Mary Pentin wanted it.\n\n\u2026\n\nSome news articles described her as reclusive. Couple that with the fact that she was an antiques dealer and you\u2019re left with the impression that she lived in an old, rundown Victorian home, surrounded by ancient furniture and a herd of cats.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t reclusive. She was, according to those who knew her, eccentric and quirky. But no recluse. She was a regular at auctions and antique shows.\n\nStill, she guarded her privacy to an acute extent. For instance, when she published a novel on Amazon\u2019s Kindle Store a few years back, she wrote it under a pen name.\n\nEvery now and then, a researcher or reporter would look for her. Very few people knew where she lived, and they guarded that secret. In 2007, the Jewish news website Tablet published a piece titled, \u201cWhat Happened To Mary Berg?\u201d The story concluded, essentially, we don\u2019t know. The reporter did not know if she was even still alive.\n\nShe was.\n\nShe simply didn\u2019t want people knowing who she was. She didn\u2019t want people knowing that, as The New York Times once put it, she was \u201cAnne Frank before Anne Frank.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nMary Pentin was Mary Berg.\n\nActually, she was born Miriam Wattenberg in Lodz, Poland. Her father, Shya, was a painter and an art dealer, and her mother, Lena, was an American-born fashion designer. She was the oldest of two children; her younger sister was named Ann. Mary, as they called her, studied art, literature and theater. She wanted to be a novelist when she grew up.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 1939, the Germans invaded Poland. She was 14.\n\n\u201cThe days that followed brought hunger, death and panic to our people,\u201d she wrote in her diary. She described a scene in which a German aircraft strafed a line outside a bakery. A man waiting to buy bread was shot in the head.\n\nHer family fled Lodz, under heavy German attack, and walked and bicycled the 70 miles to Warsaw. She turned 15 on Oct. 10, 1939, in Warsaw.\n\nHer family was lucky. They had some wealth and were able to escape with some assets.\n\nDuring the siege of Warsaw, she described finding shelter from the bombing in the basement of a burned-out house.\n\n\u201cBeside me lay a little boy convulsed with pain from a wound,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen his mother changed his dressing, one could see that a shell fragment was still embedded in his flesh and that gangrene had already set in. A little further on lay a woman whose foot had been torn off by a bomb. No medical aid was available for these people. The stench was unbearable.\u201d\n\nThe family, at the urging of Mary\u2019s mother, returned to Lodz to find their apartment looted. She described seeing German soldiers beating a Jewish man on the street. They bound his legs with a rope and tied the other end to the bumper of a cab, ordering the driver to drive, dragging the man down the cobblestone street. The road was streaked with his blood.\n\nThey returned to Warsaw.\n\nA year later, the Germans cordoned off the Jewish population into a walled-in ghetto. German guards patrolled the ghetto and its perimeter. She witnessed German guards beating and killing Jews, apparently for sport or amusement.\n\nHunger and disease were rampant. She described seeing frozen corpses in the streets, blue faces, fists clenched. \u201cWhat are the last thoughts of such people, and what makes them clench their fists so tautly?\u201d she wrote. \u201cSurely their last glance was cast at the window of the store across the street from where they have laid themselves down to die. In that shop window, they see white bread, cheese, and even cakes, and they fall into their last sleep dreaming of biting into a loaf of bread.\u201d\n\nWomen and children, barefoot and wearing rags, were housed in refugee homes.\n\n\u201cI have visited a refugee home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOn the floor I saw half-naked, unwashed children lying listlessly. In one corner an exquisite little girl of four or five sat crying. I could not refrain from stroking her disheveled blond hair. The child looked at me with her big blue eyes, and said, \u2018I\u2019m hungry.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was overcome by a feeling of utter shame. I had eaten that day, but I did not have a piece of bread to give that child. I did not dare look in her eyes, and went away.\u201d\n\nNormal life, or what passed for it, continued, striking in its contrast to the horrors. People got married, went to cafes and cabarets where theater groups put on shows, she continued her studies of the graphic arts.\n\nDescriptions of theater performances gave way to scenes like this:\n\n\u201cSometimes a child huddles against his mother, thinking that she is asleep and trying to awaken her, while, in fact, she is dead.\u201d\n\nIn July 1942, her family and others with foreign passports were imprisoned, awaiting deportation. She watched from her window while German soldiers beat and shot Jews, the cries of despair, unrelenting. She watched as Jews were shot and rounded up to be packed into boxcars and sent to Treblinka, the death camp.\n\n\u201cWe are here as on a little island amidst an ocean of blood,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe whole ghetto is drowning in blood. We literally see fresh human blood, we can smell it. Does the outside world know anything about it? Why does no one come to our aid? I cannot go on living; my strength is exhausted. How long are we going to be kept here to witness all this?\u201d\n\nIn January 1943, her family was sent to an internment camp in France, where they awaited a prisoner exchange that would allow them to flee. Their journey to freedom began March 1, 1943, when they boarded a train for Lisbon. There, they boarded the ocean liner SS Gripsholm for the voyage to America.\n\nAs the ship entered the New York harbor, she wrote, \u201cI shall do everything I can to save those who can still be saved, and to avenge those who were so bitterly humiliated in their last moments. And those who were ground into ash, I shall always see them alive. I will tell, I will tell everything, about our sufferings and our struggles and the slaughter of our dearest, and I will demand punishment for German murderers and their Gretchens in Berlin, Munich, and Nuremberg who enjoyed the fruits of murder, and are still wearing the clothes and shoes of our martyrized people.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nMary Berg had barely set foot on American soil when she met Samuel L. Shneiderman, a Yiddish journalist who had fled Europe in 1940.\n\nShneiderman, then 37, had worked in Warsaw and as a Paris correspondent for several Polish dailies before coming to America in 1940. He was on the dock that day to meet the Gripsholm, in search of a story.\n\nAnd he found one.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how he met Berg, then 19. But he did and soon learned that she had brought her diary with her, chronicling the past four years in the Warsaw Ghetto in a dozen spiral-bound notebooks. He immediately knew of the diary\u2019s importance. While other accounts of the persecution and murder of Jews had escaped to the West, this was among the first complete eyewitness accounts to make it to these shores.\n\nShneiderman worked with Berg over the next few months, editing the diary and translating Berg\u2019s shorthand, a kind of code she developed in case the notebooks fell into Nazi hands. He then translated the diary into Yiddish and published it, in serial form, in Der Morgen Zshurnal, one of New York\u2019s leading Yiddish newspapers. He then arranged to have the diary translated into English and had it published in New York\u2019s P.M. newspaper.\n\nIn February 1945, Shneiderman published the diary in full, titling it \u201cWarsaw Ghetto: A Diary.\u201d The author\u2019s last name was shortened to Berg to protect family who may have still been in danger in Poland. Berg designed the book\u2019s cover, the dust jacket a depiction of the red brick wall that enclosed the ghetto.\n\nThe diary was published before the war\u2019s end and before the world knew of the scope of the Nazis\u2019 crimes against humanity. The book was widely hailed as an important work. The New Yorker said it was \u201ca grim book, full of darkness and horror.\u201d It was translated into several foreign languages. It was studied by students in Hebrew school.\n\nBerg was an in-demand speaker and interview subject. In a radio interview in early 1945, asked whether she ever wanted to return to Poland, she said, \u201cNo, I will never go back. America is my country now and I\u2019m going to be a real American.\u201d\n\nThen, in the early 1950s, still in the spotlight in New York, she disassociated herself from her diary. She said she wanted to forget about the past.\n\nAnd then she disappeared.\n\n\u2026\n\nMary Berg\u2019s memoir went out of print in the early 1950s, just as Anne Frank\u2019s diary was published. It remained out of print for decades; Frank\u2019s diary has been widely available since it was published.\n\nWhy Mary Berg dropped out of the public eye remains a mystery. People who knew her speculated that she suffered from acute survivor\u2019s guilt. Others speculated that she didn\u2019t want to be defined by her past. Her family is fairly mum on the subject. A niece, Victoria Powell, who was close to her, said that the accounts that have been reported are inaccurate, but declined to elaborate.\n\nBerg offered some insight in her diary. While her family was detained in the Vittel internment camp in France, awaiting deportation to the United States, she wrote, \u201cWe, who have been rescued from the ghetto, are ashamed to look at each other. Had we the right to save ourselves? Here everything smells of sun and flowers and there - there is only blood, the blood of my own people.\u201d\n\nOver the years, several people attempted to convince her to get her diary back into print, saying it was an important historical document. She declined. In the mid-1990s, when a Polish edition was published, a theater was planning to stage a dramatic reading and invited Mary Berg to attend. Responding through friends, The New York Times reported, she declined.\n\nIn 1995, Susan Pentlin, a professor of modern languages at the University of Central Missouri, approached Berg about republishing her diary. Pentlin, who had a particular interest in Holocaust literature and who taught Berg\u2019s book in her classes, had been in touch with Shneiderman, who then held the rights to the book. Shneiderman put Pentlin in touch with Berg.\n\nBerg, according to Pentlin\u2019s husband, Floyd, \u201cbasically told my wife to buzz off.\u201d\n\nPentlin, who died last Christmas of a heart attack, previously told the Jewish news website The Tablet that when she contacted Berg about republishing her diary in 1992, Berg responded bitterly.\n\n\u201cInstead of continuing to milk the Jewish Holocaust to its limits,\u201d she wrote to Pentlin, \u201cdo go and make a difference in all those Holocausts taking place right now in Bosnia or Chechin. Don\u2019t tell me this is different.\u201d\n\nPentlin went ahead and ushered in a new edition of Mary Berg\u2019s diary in 2007. Shneiderman\u2019s heirs held the rights to the book and the author\u2019s permission was unnecessary.\n\nIn the introduction to the new edition, the professor wrote, \u201cIt is not known if she found happiness in her adult years. We can only hope that she was able to make a life for herself in the post-war world and find solace from her past memories.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen they found out that she was, essentially, Anne Frank before Anne Frank, her acquaintances in York County were kind of shocked.\n\n\u201cI had no idea,\u201d Sarubin said.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many Jews involved in the antiques business in York County - it\u2019s a closely knit group. And Sarubin, who is Jewish, never knew that Mary Pentin was a member of the tribe.\n\n\u201cI would mention that I couldn\u2019t make a show because it fell on a (Jewish) holiday and she never said anything,\u201d Sarubin said. \u201cThere was no recognition at all.\u201d\n\nHer acquaintances in the antiques trade all said that her background explained a lot about her personality. To have gone through that kind of trauma, and witnessed that kind of horror, while still a child, would have a profound effect on a person, they all reasoned. They figured that had all of the people who found Pentin difficult and prickly known her background, they would have been more understanding.\n\nSarubin recalled reading Mary Berg\u2019s diary in Hebrew school and that it was deeply affecting and moving.\n\n\u201cHad I known that was her, I wish I could have given her a big hug instead of just talking about antiques,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish I had known.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe thing was, she didn\u2019t want people to know.\n\nAnd her family has honored her desire for privacy. Relatives initially agreed to share her story, but after checking with other family members, cut off contact. Contacted by phone, her husband, who moved out of the county after Pentin died last year, said, \u201cAll I can say is I have no comment. Do not call this number again.\u201d\n\nWhen Mary Pentin died in 2013, no obituary was ever published. If there was a memorial service, it was private, very private.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe scrapbook is now the property of the National Holocaust Memorial Museum. Coghill, who was hoping it would find a proper home, a museum or collection where it would be publicly available and appreciated, had sent it to Doyle New York, a high-end auction house. After The New York Times did a story about the sale, Doyle canceled the auction and brokered a sale to the holocaust museum for an undisclosed price. (Doyle had previously estimated the value of the scrapbook at between $4,000 and $6,000, the Times reported.)\n\nSteve Farmer said that at the end of the estate sale, Bill Pentin told him to just throw out what didn\u2019t sell.\n\nHad Coghill not bought that scrapbook - he was the sole bidder - it would have been sent to the York County Solid Waste Authority\u2019s trash incinerator.\n\nAnd we would have never known that Mary Berg had lived among us all of these years.\n\nWorse, we would have never known who she was.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1w9fcHs\n\n___\n\nInformation from: York Daily Record, http://www.ydr.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "On June 7, a Saturday, Glen Coghill perused the photo albums on a table at Steve Farmer's auction house in Red Lion.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/holocaust-diary-author-lived-in-york-county-for-ye/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "On June 7, a Saturday, Glen Coghill perused the photo albums on a table at Steve Farmer\u2019s auction house in Red Lion.", "title": "Holocaust diary author lived in York County for years"}, "twitter": {"description": "On June 7, a Saturday, Glen Coghill perused the photo albums on a table at Steve Farmer's auction house in Red Lion.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Holocaust diary author lived in York County for years"}, "Author": "MIKE ARGENTO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ded\"", "article_summary": "And we would have never known that Mary Berg had lived among us all of these years.\nHe thought, \u201cOh my God.\u201dHe went home and Googled Mary Berg, and what he learned blew his mind.\nIt contained telegrams, inviting a person named Mary Berg to speaking engagements in New York.\nShe didn\u2019t want people knowing that, as The New York Times once put it, she was \u201cAnne Frank before Anne Frank.\u201d\u2026Mary Pentin was Mary Berg.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Mary Pentin wanted it."}
