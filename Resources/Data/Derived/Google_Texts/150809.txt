There is no such thing as “denying” climate change, only questioning man’s contribution to it. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Regarding the Jan. 3 oped “Climate science denial fading, except with GOP” by Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, there is no such thing as “denying” climate change. Everyone agrees the climate is always changing. The question is: What is man’s contribution?

O’Malley says that “deniers” are limited to the GOP. Again he is wrong. As an independent, and one with a functioning brain, I tend to think that if the government strongly supports something, then the government is up to something. In other words, follow the money.

When Al Gore starts giving global warming lectures for free and gets to his destination in a Prius or a Tesla, I will consider his position. Like Obamacare, climate change is a money grab.

Some pro-climate change politicians, activists and scientists (who stand to lose their funding if they don’t agree) have clamored for laws to jail the “deniers.” Sounds a lot like the Middle Ages when scientists challenged the “world is flat” orthodoxy of the day. Truth, on the other hand, needs no law to support it.

When it comes to truth, I shall welcome the plant life that has returned to the Sahara Desert for the first time in 10,000 years , and I shall listen to scientists like meteorologists John Coleman and Joe Bastardi, geologist Donald Easterbrook and physicist Ivar Giaever, who is a Nobel laureate. In fact, Giaever has boldly stated that President Barack Obama, much like O’Malley, is dead wrong when it comes to global warm ... er, climate change.
