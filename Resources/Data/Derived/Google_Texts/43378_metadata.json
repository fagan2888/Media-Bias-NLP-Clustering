The \u201cStreet Eats, Safe Eats\u201d study analyzed food inspection reports in seven cities where both are required to adhere to the same standards.\n\n\u201cStreet Eats, Safe Eats\u201d finds that in every city examined \u2026 food trucks and carts did as well as or better than restaurants,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe results suggest that the notion that street food is unsafe is a myth.\u201d\n\nThe law firm, Institute for Justice, said regular city inspections have helped to limit the number of health code violations issued to food truck vendors. However, the researchers recommended that vendors not be subjected to additional regulations, such as limitations on where and when they may operate. Such regulations would only serve to protect restaurant industry interests, rather than serving to make food products safer. Regulations in New York City, for example, supersede those for traditional restaurants, requiring longer waits for permits.\n\n\u201cCity officials often rely on such claims that brick-and-mortar restaurants are safer to justify restrictions on both food trucks and carts, including outright bans on mobile vending as well as limits on when and where vendors may sell,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThese laws not only push food trucks and carts out of cities, they also stifle entrepreneurship, destroy jobs and hurt consumers. As American culture shifts towards re-embracing street food, this report tests the claim \u2014 common but unsubstantiated \u2014 that food trucks and carts are unsafe.\u201d\n\nRather, mobile food vendors driving trucks and pushing carts offer food \u201cjust as safe and sanitary\u201d as restaurants, and are often more so, they said.\n\nBut it\u2019s no wonder traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants wish to shutter as much of the mobile food service industry as possible, as the growth of street food sales outpaced restaurants during this lingering recovery from economic recession over the past five or so years, according to a market researc report from IBISWorld.\n\n\u201cWhile the rest of the food-service sector has been suffering due to lower consumer spending rates, the street vendor industry has made leaps and bounds over the past five years,\u201d IBISWorld said. \u201cStreet vendors were largely able to dodge the recession's blow by offering new and compelling products that attracted a more diverse client base.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "food safety, restaurant cleanliness, food struck safety, food truck cleanliness, food struck hygiene, food trucks cleaner than restaurants", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite a \"street\" reputation, mobile food vendors driving trucks and pushing carts tend to outscore restaurants on cleanliness and hygiene in food safety inspections.", "title": "Food Trucks Win When It Comes To Food Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/food-trucks-just-clean-or-even-cleaner-restaurants-major-us-cities-289350", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/22/food-trucks-safer-restaurants.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite a \"street\" reputation, mobile food vendors driving trucks and pushing carts tend to outscore restaurants on cleanliness and hygiene in food safety inspections.", "title": "Food Trucks Win When It Comes To Food Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/food-trucks-just-clean-or-even-cleaner-restaurants-major-us-cities-289350", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/22/food-trucks-safer-restaurants.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/22/food-trucks-safer-restaurants.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-22T11:21:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-22T11:21:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite a \"street\" reputation, mobile food vendors driving trucks and pushing carts tend to outscore restaurants on cleanliness and hygiene in food safety inspections."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb493\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cStreet Eats, Safe Eats\u201d study analyzed food inspection reports in seven cities where both are required to adhere to the same standards.\nResearchers at a public interest law firm in Virginia reviewed more than 260,000 inspections to find that food trucks were generally cleaner than restaurants in major U.S. cities such as Boston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, and Washington, D.C., whereas in Seattle food trucks and restaurants performed about equally.\n\u201cThese laws not only push food trucks and carts out of cities, they also stifle entrepreneurship, destroy jobs and hurt consumers.\n\u201cStreet Eats, Safe Eats\u201d finds that in every city examined \u2026 food trucks and carts did as well as or better than restaurants,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nAs American culture shifts towards re-embracing street food, this report tests the claim \u2014 common but unsubstantiated \u2014 that food trucks and carts are unsafe.\u201dRather, mobile food vendors driving trucks and pushing carts offer food \u201cjust as safe and sanitary\u201d as restaurants, and are often more so, they said."}
