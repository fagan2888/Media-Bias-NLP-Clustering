Of course, most people have figured that out by now; the only mystery has been, how much more? According to the Congressional Budget Office: at least $136 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe reason the cost projections were so wrong is that other CBO assumptions about Obamacare participation rates were so wrong.\n\nAs The Motley Fool reports, the CBO initially projected that about 21 million people would sign up for health insurance in the exchanges by 2016, but only some 12 million have actually done so. And that\u2019s at the beginning of the year; by the end of the year perhaps 25 percent to 30 percent will drop their coverage for various reasons.\n\nAs an aside, it also turns out that those new enrollees are costing a lot more than the government predicted\u2013as many of us warned at the time, to no avail.\n\nBy contrast, the CBO vastly underestimated the number of Americans who would enroll in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP).\n\nThe CBO estimated in 2010 that about 52 million would be in Medicaid and CHIP by 2016; it now says the number is more like 68 million \u2013 and counting.\n\nAnd when the CBO made that original prediction, it thought virtually every state would join the Medicaid expansion; 19 still haven\u2019t.\n\nSome 16 million extra Medicaid and CHIP participants means that CBO missed its cost estimate by $146 billion over 10 years.\n\nOnce you subtract the federal savings because fewer people than predicted are receiving subsidies in the health insurance exchanges, CBO estimates the cost will be an additional $136 billion over 10 years.\n\nThere are several reasons for the missed projections, but The Fool notes that many lower-income workers are quitting their employer-provided health insurance and enrolling in Medicaid instead, which has much lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn health insurance, we call it the \u201ccrowd-out effect\u201d when government freebies drive people away from private sector options that may cost something out-of-pocket.\n\nThe good news is that we have CBO confirmation for what many of us predicted all along \u2013 that Obamacare would cost a lot more than Obama promised.\n\nThe bad news is that taxpayers will be paying a lot more, and that the president refuses, as he always does, to acknowledge his historic blunder.\n\nDr. Merrill Matthews is a Resident Scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI) in Dallas, Texas.
