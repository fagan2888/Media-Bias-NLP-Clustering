Gordon \u201cDr. Chaps\u201d Klingenschmitt\u2019s nonprofit \u201cPray in Jesus [sic] Name\u201d has failed to file the proper paperwork with the state, a lapse that led the Colorado Secretary of State\u2019s office on October 15th of last year to suspend its registration as a charitable organization. Since then, Klingenschmitt\u2019s group has not been legally eligible to solicit or accept donations, which hasn\u2019t stopped it from sending out fundraiser emails and posting videos asking for donations at a regular clip.\n\n\u201cGod loves a cheerful giver,\u201d Klingenschmitt says at the end of the most recent episode of his YouTube program, \u201cPray in Jesus Name News.\u201d Text runs across the bottom of the screen intermittently asking viewers to make donations.\n\n\u201cThank you for your monthly support,\u201d it says.\n\nKlingenschmitt \u2014 A former Navy chaplain who was discharged for wearing his uniform at a political event \u2014 won election this fall to represent a conservative Colorado Springs district at the Capitol in Denver. He is a Colorado figure that has joined conservative commentators across the country in making regular national headlines for outlandish and often offensive statements. He has said that \u201cObamacare causes cancer,\u201d that the Bible commands people to own guns in order to \u201cdefend themselves against left wing crazies,\u201d and that the FCC allows demonic spirits to \u201cmolest and visually rape your children.\u201d\n\nIn August, Klingenschmitt wrote an email to supporters denouncing Colorado Congressman Jared Polis for demanding equal rights for gay Americans.\n\n\u201cDemocrats like [openly gay] Polis want to bankrupt Christians who refuse to worship and endorse his sodomy,\u201d Klingenschmitt wrote. \u201cNext he\u2019ll join ISIS in beheading Christians, but not just in Syria, right here in America.\u201d\n\nKlingenschmitt this past Sunday sent out an email asking supporters to pressure lawmakers to back Israel in the latest round of its decades-long battle with the Palestinian minority population of the country.\n\n\u201cIf America doesn\u2019t stand with Israel, God won\u2019t stand with us,\u201d he writes. The email includes an ask in the postscript \u2014 \u201cPrefer to donate by mail?\u201d \u2014 and the group\u2019s P.O box address in Colorado Springs.\n\nAn end-of-the-year email sent on December 30 was entirely dedicated to raising money:\n\nPlease select here to donate your best End-Of-Year gift to Pray In Jesus Name Ministries (our 501c3 non-profit, 100% tax-deductible, used for religious education and charity to help the poor, with zero salary to Gordon since its inception in 1999).\n\nThe email said gifts up to $1,200 would draw matching donations.\n\nPray in Jesus Name also accepts donations at its website.\n\nIt is a misdemeanor offense in Colorado for nonprofits not properly registered with the state to ask for donations.\n\nAccording to tax forms on file at the Secretary of State\u2019s office, Pray in Jesus Name \u2014 which also appears in the database under the name Persuade the World \u2014 began doing business in Colorado in 2009, raising between $20,000 and $75,000 a year. A staffer with the Secretary of State\u2019s office said opening up shop before registering as a charity isn\u2019t the way it is \u201csupposed to be done\u201d and that the group can not legally be soliciting donations. She said Pray in Jesus Name began registering with the state last May but never finished the process.\n\nThe Secretary\u2019s office only launches investigations into non-complying nonprofits in response to formal complaints. The office posts an online complaint form that includes guidelines.\n\nKlingenschmitt is president and, for most of the years recorded, the only employee listed for the group. He reports that he works 20 hours a week and receives no salary. His work for the group includes \u201creligious education, inspiration, mobilization, and promoting the kingdom of Christ.\u201d On his videos, he says a main pillar of the group\u2019s mission is to \u201cdiscern the spirits.\u201d\n\nOn a 2013 Pray in Jesus Name 4562 tax form, Klingenschmitt lists a $2.6 million property to be deducted as a place of business. (See page 13 of the posted pdf of the form.)\n\nLuis Toro, director of nonprofit Colorado Ethics Watch, said that, even though Colorado lawmakers are barred from soliciting donations from lobbyists while the General Assembly is in session, lawmakers who head their own nonprofits are certainly allowed to cast their nets as widely as possible for the benefit of their groups.\n\nHe added that the distinction could become fuzzy, however, if the nonprofit is also the lawmaker\u2019s main employer, for example, or landlord.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Controversial state Rep.
