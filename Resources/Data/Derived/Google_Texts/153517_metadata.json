Ted Cruz once looked up to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and called him the best litigator at the highest court in the land.\n\nNow Cruz is imagining a world in which Roberts was never appointed and the Supreme Court struck down the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile addressing the conservative Eagle Forum\u2019s conference in St. Louis on Saturday, Cruz talked about what he thinks would have happened if former President George W. Bush skipped over Roberts, and if Bush\u2019s father never picked retired justice David Souter.\n\n\u201cIf instead of David Souter and John Roberts, the Presidents Bush had nominated Edith Jones and Mike Luttig, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago, and the marriage laws of every state would still be on the books,\u201d said Cruz, according to video from a liberal tracking group.\n\nwidth=\u201d560\u2033 height=\u201d315\u2033 src=\u201dhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Cw1iADEI_xI\u201d frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 allowfullscreen>\n\nJones is a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas. Luttig retired from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.\n\nCruz asked Roberts to serve on the legal team that helped Bush secure the 2000 presidential election, and the senator modeled his argument style after the judge.\n\nBut after Roberts wrote the opinion preserving a key part of the Affordable Care Act in June, Cruz accused him of violating his oath and implied he should resign.\n\n\u201c[Roberts] knows full well that what he did in both of those decisions was not faithfully applied the law but it was to alter the law, to change the law in order to achieve a policy outcome,\u201d Cruz told BuzzFeed in June, also referencing Roberts\u2019 deciding vote in the 2012 case that upheld the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIf members of the court want to write legislation or rewrite it they should resign from the court and run for the Congress,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nCruz, a 2016 presidential candidate, called the Supreme Court\u2019s summer decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage \u201ca decent into lawlessness\u201d and suggested judicial retention elections.\n\nBut when CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Cruz how he\u2019d vote on Roberts, the senator demurred.\n\n\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d said Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS9hZnRlci15ZWFycy1vZi1hZG1pcmF0aW9uLXRlZC1jcnV6LWltYWdpbmVzLWEtc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC13aXRob3V0LWpvaG4tcm9iZXJ0cy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--Sen.
