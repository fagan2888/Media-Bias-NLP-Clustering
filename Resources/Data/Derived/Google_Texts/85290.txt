Refining and petrochemical production will provide a buffer for Houston, but economists say the region is still in for significant economic pain.

The price of a barrel of crude oil has fallen by more than 50 percent since last June. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas developed a model to look at the impact on jobs. It predicts the lower prices will translate to a 1.2 percent drop in Texas employment, which equals about 140,000 jobs.

“So this would be mining jobs, finance, real estate, legal,”says Jesse Thompson, a business economist at the Dallas Fed’s Houston branch. “This would encompass the entire spectrum of employment impacts as a result of the price declines.”

Houston will fare worse than the state on average. But it won’t do as badly as areas closer to the oil fields in South and West Texas.

“We have a lot of construction activity going on as a result of the shale gas production boom in the downstream side, in the refining and petrochemicals, that are going to sort of buttress us against these declines in mining employment,” Thompson says.

The Dallas Fed also forecasts that – even with all the layoffs tied to the oil sector – Texas should still see a gain of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent in total job growth in 2015.
