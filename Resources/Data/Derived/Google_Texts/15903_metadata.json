The legislation is aimed at streamlining the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) process for approving new drugs and treatments, and would increase research funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile that bill is moving forward, Sen.(R-N.C.) said at an event hosted by The Hill and sponsored by PhRMA on Tuesday that the Senate would not just pass the House version.\n\n\u201cI think that the Senate will produce our own bill,\u201d Burr said. While the timeline is still being worked out, Burr said he does not expect a bill for a matter of months.\n\n\u201cI applaud the House\u2019s efforts with the Cures Act,\u201d Burr said, but added, \u201cthe Senate never moves quickly.\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a doctor, said at The Hill\u2019s event that the fall would be a \u201creasonable\u201d timeline for the Senate\u2019s bill, though it could slip.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who is leading the House cures effort, has said he wants legislation passed this year.\n\nIn the Senate, Sen.

Patty Murray Patty MurrayLawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (Wash.).\n\nAlexander has asked NIH and FDA officials to present him with recommendations on how to cut red tape in hopes of incorporating their suggestions into the bill.\n\nIncreasing funding for NIH has received support on both sides of the aisle. The House bill would increase funding by around $5 billion, to around $35 billion, by 2018, and would also include $10 billion over five years in mandatory spending that can help get around spending caps. This funding helped bring Democrats on board in the House.\n\n\u201cNIH is an essential part of what we do,\u201d John Castellani, president and CEO of PhRMA, said at the event. He added that after NIH\u2019s basic research, \u201cour industry then does its job,\u201d with $51.2 billion research and development spending last year.\n\nCassidy and Burr expressed a cautious willingness to increase funding for the NIH.\n\n\u201cI'd love to see an increase the NIH budget as well, but I wouldn't expect different outcomes if we didn't see these other issues change,\u201d Burr said, referring to reforms of the FDA approval process.\n\nPaying for the bill is also an issue.\n\nCassidy said economic growth would help fill up the government\u2019s coffers and make room for the funding.\n\n\u201cYou can't separate our ability to fund priorities like NIH from the overall state of the economy,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nBurr noted that savings from less spending on diseases could be used to help fund the legislation, and Cassidy likewise made the point that spending on Alzheimer\u2019s alone is at $200 billion and rising.\n\nThe House bill has not yet worked out the pay-fors, which is a major obstacle, but Cassidy expressed hope for a bipartisan agreement.\n\nCiting the \u201ccautionary tale\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, he said, \u201cif you force something through on a partisan basis, it continues in rancor and its effectiveness is diminished.\u201d\n\nAsked if Democrats would be involved, he replied, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
