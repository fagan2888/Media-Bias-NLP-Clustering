B. Scott: \"[The 2012 GOP nominee for president] continues to believe that he is the most qualified leader for our times.\" Pictured: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney waves to supporters during his election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2012, in Boston. (David Goldman/AP)\n\nThe scene: Boston Convention Center, election night 2012. The mood: Despair, devastation, disbelief. It was a wake instead of the intended lavish celebration of the victory of Willard Mitt Romney, next president of the United States of America.\n\nVery few true believers saw it coming, in spite of fresh polls indicating otherwise. They\u2019d heard that an eleventh hour Romney surge was in the offing. As the clock ticked on, the faithful prayed in earnest, and often. To no avail.\n\nHe won his party\u2019s nomination, became the first Mormon presidential candidate in history to make it to the general election and ran a competitive race against a popular incumbent. But he lost.\n\nAs he strode on to the stage to concede to Barack Obama, Romney saluted the sea of mourners. It seemed at once an enthusiastic acknowledgement of their loyalty, and a farewell. The man who had been running for president since around 1993 would now quietly fade away, become an historical footnote. Always game, always a team player, and perpetually misunderstood, like his father, George, the estimable former secretary of housing and urban development, governor of Michigan, and CEO of American Motors, a reluctant alternative to Barry Goldwater in 1964 and, briefly, the \u201call in\u201d candidate in 1968.\n\nIt was George who anointed his youngest son heir to the family\u2019s presidential aspirations. Otherwise, close relatives insist, Romney would have been content to be a prominent church leader and successful businessman.\n\nInstead, he surpassed both his father\u2019s record and his expectations. He won his party\u2019s nomination, became the first Mormon presidential candidate in history to make it to the general election and ran a competitive race against a popular incumbent. But he lost. Now, perhaps, he would pass the torch to one strapping son or another.\n\nAfter losing to the iconic and entrenched Democrat from Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy, in 1993, Romney vowed that he would never run for office again unless he was certain he could win. In 2002, he balked when Massachusetts GOP power brokers begged him to hurry home from \u201csaving\u201d the winter Olympic games in Salt Lake City to challenge the faltering female Republican governor, Jane Swift. He relented only after they cleared the decks of opposition and assured him of the party\u2019s endorsement.\n\nA similar strategy may be in motion for 2016.\n\nIn July 2013, as Romney was sizing-up his future, polls revealed that the nation was having serious second thoughts about the president they had elected the previous November. It was then that Romney resumed building and strengthening bridges to Republican leaders throughout the nation, including all of the possible contenders for the presidency in 2016.\n\nHe spoke out vigorously on national, economic and foreign policy issues. He put muscle and money to work, building party cohesiveness and supporting key campaigns, drawing the party toward the middle, where it needs to be to win national elections. And he became more open and candid about his very large, interesting and accomplished family.\n\nThe \u201cwill he or won\u2019t he run\u201d speculation will likely continue for months. Timing matters; there is a danger in jumping in too soon, lest adulation and anticipation devolve into sniping, mockery and criticism. September 2015 would suffice, as disappointing as that may be to those itching to cover a horse race. By then, national party leaders, like their colleagues in Massachusetts in 2002, may be pleading with him to run. Of course, that\u2019s exactly how Mitt Romney would like it: nomination by acclamation.\n\n\u2026national party leaders, like their colleagues in Massachusetts in 2002, may be pleading with him to run. Of course, that\u2019s exactly how Mitt Romney would like it: nomination by acclamation.\n\nThat\u2019s the long way of saying that, unless there is a dramatic change between now and then, Mitt Romney will be a candidate for president in 2016. TWEET There are a few serious equivocations to consider:\n\nAnn Romney\u2019s health. She is a cancer survivor and has been battling multiple sclerosis for more than 15 years. She is fit, healthy and energetic, and she is a credible powerhouse on the campaign trail. Should her health deteriorate, her husband will not be a candidate. Period. Unless Ann insists on it. Just this week she acknowledged that Romney is \u201cthinking\u201d about a run in 2016.\n\nIf it appears the primary will be contentious and divisive, Romney could have second thoughts; he still hates to lose.\n\nMitt Romney continues to believe that he is the most qualified leader for our times. He knows that this election cycle favors Republicans. No other formidable candidate has emerged, although his closeness to the Bushes may convince him to step aside if Jeb enters the race. Some polls indicate that Romney sweeps the combined GOP field of possible contenders, Jeb Bush included, and that he is the only Republican who could beat former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, if she runs.\n\nIt may turn out that those earnest prayers four years ago will yet be answered.\n\n\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2012 GOP nominee for president continues to believe that he is the most qualified leader for our times.", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "The 2012 GOP nominee for president continues to believe that he is the most qualified leader for our times.", "title": "Will Mitt Romney Run In 2016?", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2014/09/26/presidential-race-gop-candidate-mitt-romney-2016", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2014/09/SCOTT-R-B-Romney-2016-Banner-592x323.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2014/09/26/presidential-race-gop-candidate-mitt-romney-2016", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2014/09/SCOTT-R-B-Romney-2016-Banner-592x323.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Mitt Romney Run In 2016?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-26", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd11\"", "article_summary": "Mitt Romney continues to believe that he is the most qualified leader for our times.\nIt was a wake instead of the intended lavish celebration of the victory of Willard Mitt Romney, next president of the United States of America.\nMitt Romney waves to supporters during his election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2012, in Boston.\nThat\u2019s the long way of saying that, unless there is a dramatic change between now and then, Mitt Romney will be a candidate for president in 2016.\nOf course, that\u2019s exactly how Mitt Romney would like it: nomination by acclamation."}
