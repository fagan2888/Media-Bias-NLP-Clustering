The tunes here include the Lemonheads’ peppy version of “Mrs. Robinson”; Simple Minds’ gruff take on the Beach Boys’ “Sloop John B” (the perfect backdrop to a sinking yacht); and the theme from Goldfinger, redone by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings as a wedding ballad.

If Scorsese goes for baroque in his depiction of wretched excess — how many times must we watch someone snort cocaine, toss cash like confetti or cavort with hookers before we get the idea? — so be it. This master of contemporary cinema has earned the right to be self-indulgent, even at the risk of alienating his audience.
