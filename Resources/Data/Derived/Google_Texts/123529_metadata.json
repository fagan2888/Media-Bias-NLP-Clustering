And one peculiar result of that complexity is that Columbia St. Mary's hasn't been paid for a screening mammogram since early January.\n\nThat's when the health system stopped submitting insurance claims for the mammograms because of a hitch involving the intricacies of billing codes, insurance companies' computer systems and Medicare regulations.\n\nOther health systems, including Aurora Health Care and ProHealth Care, haven't been eager to answer questions about how they're dealing with the problem, but some are charging patients extra for 3-D mammography \u2014 an option that's not particularly appealing to Columbia St. Mary's, given that its ad campaign proclaims every woman should have access to the technology.\n\nGlitches in billing for a new technology are not uncommon. Not surprisingly, the United States, with the world's most complicated health care system, probably has the world's most complicated medical bills.\n\nBut in this case, the problem involves one of the most common medical tests and the most common cancer among women.\n\nAn estimated 232,000 women were projected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014, according to the National Cancer Institute. And based on 2009-2011 data, 12.3% of women will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their lives.\n\nColumbia St. Mary's alone does about 32,000 mammograms a year \u2014 and, unlike other health care systems, it now does only 3-D mammography.\n\nThe technology was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be used in combination with standard digital mammography for breast cancer screening in 2011. Hologic introduced the first tomosynthesis equipment in the U.S. GE Healthcare won approval to sell a competing version last year.\n\nThe technology takes multiple X-ray images from many angles and then reconstructs them to produce three-dimensional images. This enables radiologists to see the breast in thin \"slices\" and identify tumors that may be hidden in overlapping tissue.\n\nStudies have shown that digital mammography combined with tomosynthesis helps identify invasive cancers while reducing the false-positive test results that require patients to come back for a second test, said Wendy DeMartini, chief of breast imaging at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nThe technology is very promising, DeMartini said. But more studies need to be done to determine its effectiveness.\n\nThe largest study to date, published in June in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported that for every 1,000 scans, tomosynthesis found on average 5.4 cancers, compared with 4.2 cancers for digital mammography alone. Tomosynthesis also was better at identifying invasive cancers.\n\nBut an accompanying editorial said that despite the promising results from the study, whether women should seek tomosynthesis instead of digital mammography alone still is uncertain.\n\nThe results of other studies have varied but also found that 3-D mammography detected more cancers and resulted in fewer patients' being called back for a second test.\n\nThat's been the experience at UW Health, which has the technology at some sites, DeMartini said.\n\nAt the same time, the health system has opted to be conservative in moving to the new technology until better data is available and potential problems on how insurers will pay for it are worked out.\n\nInsurance not covering\n\nBefore the start of this year, UW Health was billing 3-D mammography at the same rate as digital mammography. So, too, was Aurora Health Care. And so, too, was Columbia St. Mary's.\n\nThen things got complicated.\n\nMedicare gave digital mammography with tomosynthesis a billing code that went into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nOnce that happened, health systems had to bill for 3-D mammography under the new code, as opposed to billing for it the same way they bill for traditional mammography.\n\nThe catch: Most commercial health plans are holding off on covering 3-D mammography until more studies are done to prove its effectiveness.\n\n\"The data still isn't there to show improved clinical outcomes,\" said Phil Colmenares, chief medical officer of WPS Health Insurance.\n\nThere's a difference, he said, between a promising technology and a proven technology.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin, UnitedHealthcare and Humana also are not covering the new technology.\n\nHealth insurers and many health economists tend to be wary of new technology that has yet to be proven effective and that is being promoted in marketing campaigns.\n\nColumbia St. Mary's, though, has embraced the new technology.\n\n\"We are seeing cancers we would not have seen without the 3-D,\" said Patrick McWey, a radiologist and medical director of breast imaging for the health system. \"No question about it. We all have examples.\"\n\nFrom August through October, Columbia St. Mary's upgraded two Hologic machines and bought five new ones. The machines list for as much as $500,000, but health systems typically get discounts. Columbia St. Mary's raised $1 million in charitable contributions to help offset the cost.\n\nThe health system also committed to using the technology for all breast screenings.\n\nAt the same time, many health insurers' computer systems are programmed to reject insurance claims for their commercial health plans with the billing code for tomosynthesis.\n\nWhen that happens, the bill becomes the patient's responsibility \u2014 and for the first week or two of this year, Columbia St. Mary's computer system sent bills to some patients for breast screenings.\n\nTo make all this even more confusing for patients, most health plans now are required under the Affordable Care Act to cover preventive screening tests, such as mammograms, at no cost to the patient.\n\nIn short, patients were getting bills for a test that wasn't supposed to cost them anything.\n\nAfter discovering that some patients were getting billed for 3-D mammography, Columbia St. Mary's stopped submitting claims for the screenings.\n\nThat was two months ago.\n\n\"We are not asking the payers or patients to pay more,\" said Jeff Squier, who oversees contracting with health insurers for Columbia St. Mary's.\n\nBut it would like to get paid something.\n\nColumbia St. Mary's is working with health insurers for a fix, and that could take some time.\n\n\"It is a long process and it takes additional work,\" Squier said.\n\nThe health system wants to ensure that a patient doesn't automatically get billed for 3-D mammograms when an insurer denies a claim. And in the short term it wants health plans to pay at least part of the bill.\n\nTo add to all this, Medicare has agreed to cover 3-D mammography, but it hasn't set a rate or provided rules on how to file a claim. That's supposed to happen next month. So in addition to not being paid by health insurers, Columbia St. Mary's hasn't gotten paid by Medicare, either.\n\nOther providers, choices\n\nProHealth Care and Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare give patients a choice of being screened with conventional mammography or paying extra for 3-D mammography.\n\nWheaton Franciscan, which began offering 3-D mammography two years ago, has the technology at several of its sites throughout the Milwaukee area. The additional cost was $103 until this year, when it dropped to $56.\n\nProHealth Care, which began offering 3-D mammography in March 2012, did not respond to requests for the additional cost. But it said that in the first four months of its fiscal year, 28% of its patients screened for breast cancer opted for 3-D mammograms.\n\nFroedtert Health has yet to move to 3-D mammography.\n\nAurora Health Care was not charging extra for 3-D mammography before the start of this year.\n\nIt did not respond to specific questions about how it was billing for 3-D mammography now. But in a statement, it said that more than 75% of its patients were covered for 3-D mammography \u2014 a surprisingly high percentage given that most health insurers aren't covering the technology.\n\nBut Columbia St. Mary's is the health system that has made the strongest commitment to tomosynthesis \u2014 and built a big ad campaign around it.\n\nThat campaign has been a huge success.\n\n\"We have been at capacity for our breast screening,\" said Lisa Froemming, the health system's vice president of external relations.\n\nFor now, Columbia St. Mary's just isn't getting paid.", "article_metadata": {"title": "New 3-D mammography catching on \u2014 but not with insurers", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/new-3-d-mammography-catching-on--but-not-with-insurers-b99466092z1-297311501.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Columbia St. Mary\u2019s has boosted the \u201ctomosynthesis\u201d technology in southeast Wisconsin with a big advertising campaign, but hasn\u2019t been paid for a 3-D screening since early January.", "title": "New 3-D mammography catching on \u2014 but not with insurers"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Columbia St. Mary\u2019s has boosted the \u201ctomosynthesis\u201d technology in southeast Wisconsin with a big advertising campaign, but hasn\u2019t been paid for a 3-D screening since early January.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "New 3-D mammography catching on \u2014 but not with insurers"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f8d\"", "article_summary": "Insurance not coveringBefore the start of this year, UW Health was billing 3-D mammography at the same rate as digital mammography.\nAfter discovering that some patients were getting billed for 3-D mammography, Columbia St. Mary's stopped submitting claims for the screenings.\nBy of the\"Every woman deserves 3-D mammography,\" declares the advertising campaign by Columbia St. Mary's.\nProHealth Care, which began offering 3-D mammography in March 2012, did not respond to requests for the additional cost.\nColumbia St. Mary's alone does about 32,000 mammograms a year \u2014 and, unlike other health care systems, it now does only 3-D mammography."}
