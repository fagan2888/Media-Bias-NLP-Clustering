Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, in a statement.\n\nJordan was referring to two top conservative policy rider priorities: establishing stricter security protocols for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to the U.S. and defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nWithout a rider to curb Syrian refugees, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., called the omnibus \u201ca total disaster from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nConservative opposition to the spending bill wasn\u2019t inevitable. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., told The Daily Signal that the right combination of policy riders may have induced conservative support.\n\n\u201cI think the more riders that could have been added, the more you would\u2019ve peeled Freedom Caucus members to support the bill,\u201d he speculated.\n\nAt a Wednesday press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., tried to soothe frustration, saying that \u201cin a divided government, no one gets exactly what they want.\u201d But the speaker trumpeted the deal as \u201ca big win for our manufacturers and for our foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAcross the aisle in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the deal \u201cisn\u2019t perfect\u201d but called the legislation \u201ca good product for the American people.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are celebrating increased government spending\u2014free of what they consider \u201cpoison pill\u201d policy riders.\n\nDemocrats were able to cite the absence of more than 150 proposed policy riders they opposed, including provisions to restrict the Syrian refugee program, cut funding for President Barack Obama\u2019s executive immigration action, and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nConservative members of the House say they\u2019re likely to split their vote\u2014backing the tax extenders package,which renews billions of tax breaks for both businesses and lower-income Americans, and opposing the omnibus.\n\nMany voiced support for the extenders bill, characterizing the extenders as necessary and growth-oriented. They balk, though, at an omnibus bill that increases spending and doesn\u2019t include any of their proposed policy riders.\n\nBut Brat and Fleming, like many members of the House Freedom Caucus, don\u2019t blame Ryan for a bill that doesn\u2019t live up to their expectations.\n\n\u201cOverall on process, Ryan get high marks,\u201d Brat said, \u201cbut the product here is an F.\u201d\n\nAfter just six weeks on the job as speaker, Ryan had to hammer out a deal to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. As budget deadlines loomed, the speaker sought and fielded input from rank-and-file members.\n\nAnd Brat says his colleagues understand that \u201cthis deal is not Paul Ryan\u2019s baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a disaster that accumulated over a full year of not following regular order. Ryan just came in 6 weeks ago and had to be the coach while we cleaned the barn.\u201d\n\nPointing to next year\u2019s schedule, Brat says Ryan \u201chas kept his word\u201d by taking steps to begin the process earlier next year.\n\n\u201cThe evidence for that is that next year, he\u2019s already put the calendar on the table. He\u2019s serious about regular order and getting our House product complete.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House conservatives are disappointed with the spending deal revealed early this morning.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House conservatives are disappointed with the spending deal revealed early this morning.", "title": "House Conservatives Deride Spending Bill for Not Including Conservative Priorities", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151216_Omni_Wegmann.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-17T12:35:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ZcSO16"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House conservatives are disappointed with the spending deal revealed early this morning.", "title": "House Conservatives Deride Spending Bill for Not Including Conservative Priorities", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151216_Omni_Wegmann.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-12-16T17:45:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T12:35:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Conservative House lawmakers aren\u2019t happy about the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill released early Wednesday morning.\nRep.
