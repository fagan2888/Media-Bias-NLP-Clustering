Of course, he knows the answer to that challenge. I expect any senior citizen unhappy with the loss of home health care services to be called a stinking, filthy liar and puppet of the Koch Brothers by Harry Reid within hours of speaking up.\n\nNot only will services to the elderly be cut by this move, but as Jim Angle of Fox News reports, it will end up killing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Advance warning: if you work in this industry, and your company folds up because of ObamaCare, Harry Reid will call you a stinking liar. People who lose their jobs because of ObamaCare are un-persons according to Democrat ideology, unless of course they can be portrayed as happy because now they get to live out their secret dreams at taxpayer expense. Really, it\u2019s quite easy to love even the most disastrous and dishonest of Big Government programs, provided you completely ignore everything bad that happens because of it, and invent a few hypothetical virtues that make you feel good. In a similar vein, if you ignore all the withdrawals made from your bank account over the years, you\u2019re practically a gosh-darn millionaire, so cheer up.\n\nA number of America\u2019s senior citizens could use some cheering up right about now:\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius may recently have had her own embarrassing moment akin to President Obama\u2019s promise that everyone could keep their health plan and their doctor, no matter what. Discussing the impact of ObamaCare on jobs, she said last week in Orlando, \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence and every economist will tell you this, that there is any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But Sebelius herself, using discretion granted her by the Affordable Care Act, cut the maximum allowed by law from home health care funds. The cuts were deep enough that officials offered a damaging prediction of the impact saying, it was estimated that approximately 40 percent of providers would have negative margins. And companies with negative margins don\u2019t last long \u2014 or have to cut workers.\n\nEveryone who works for the Obama Administration is probably reading that and wondering what the big deal is. Why, the organization they work for has been running \u201cnegative margins\u201d for decades, really huge ones, and they\u2019re getting along just fine. The city where their \u201cbusiness\u201d is headquartered has become one of America\u2019s richest during the Obama years!\n\nSorry to be the one to explain this to you, kids, but in the private sector, running a \u201cnegative margin\u201d means you lose money and go out of business. The option of printing dollar bills in the basement is not available to private industry.\n\nAs Angle\u2019s report explains, the home health care Sebelius is choking out can be both more convenient, more comfortable, and far more cost-effective than long-term residence in a care facility:\n\nIn fact, those cuts put in jeopardy 498,000 jobs of home health care workers who work just for that 40 percent of firms that will be forced into the red \u2014 the kind of home health workers who allow Yvonne Wightman, 98, to avoid expensive hospital or nursing home stays by getting care at home. \u201cIf she fell like she has a few times,\u201d says her daughter, Janet Connor, \u201ctypically you go to the ER, but because we can call a nurse to come, they can do the wound care here. Because she did have a fall, and it was a bad wound. We didn\u2019t go anywhere we just had people come and dress it at home.\u201d Her mother also came down with pneumonia and was treated at home, but Janet needed help caring for her and turned to home health care workers, again avoiding expensive alternatives. \u201cPhysical therapists and nurses were both here to assist me to get her to the potty and so forth,\u201d says her daughter. \u201cSo I couldn\u2019t have done it without help, but it was over in about a week, she was well. So she didn\u2019t have to be hospitalized.\u201d\n\nHow does all this grab you, seniors who voted Democrat in the last two elections? Is this what you thought you were voting for? Have you been enjoying the black comedy of panicked Democrats like Kay Hagan of North Carolina pretending to forget that they voted for Medicare cuts? You\u2019re about to see an astonishing outbreak of amnesia among Democrats across the land. Just wait until they start pretending to be angry at Kathleen Sebelius for squeezing out home health care.\n\nGeraghty wonders what Sebelius is thinking. I suspect he gets closer to the target as he drops each theory:\n\nSo what\u2019s the administration\u2019s angle here? They never met a dollar they didn\u2019t want to spend, particularly in entitlements, so why are they suddenly putting the screws to the home health care industry, of all professions? Is it that the financial forecasts of Obamacare have been so wildly overoptimistic and unrealistic that they feel they\u2019ve got to make a big-time cut somewhere to prevent their \u201cbending the cost curve down\u201d promise from becoming an even bigger joke? Or does the administration have something ideological against home health care? Is it that by having the health care provider coming to a person\u2019s house, there\u2019s not enough of a role for the government to intervene, manage, and meddle?\n\nI\u2019m sure everything will work out fine, once the geniuses who created Healthcare.gov have a chance to work their managerial magic on home health care.\n\nThe home care industry was thriving before ObamaCare came along. It\u2019s the kind of decentralized, competitive, innovative approach we should be encouraging. There are problems large and small with a topic as huge as \u201chealth care,\u201d which we would probably do better to discuss as several more specific but inter-related subjects, but of course the top-down heavy-handed ObamaCare approach does the opposite \u2013 tying things together until healthy young people are told they must pay insanely high premiums to support discounts for their considerably wealthier grandparents. A review of the past decade would suggest the money going into home care was exceptionally well-spent\u2026 so of course, it has to end.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Thousands of jobs jeopardized by home care cuts.", "title": "ObamaCare throws Granny off a cliff | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sebelius_homecare-480x329.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/02/27/obamacare-throws-granny-off-a-cliff/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Thousands of jobs jeopardized by home care cuts.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sebelius_homecare-480x329.jpg", "description": "Thousands of jobs jeopardized by home care cuts.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2f2\"", "article_summary": "Just wait until they start pretending to be angry at Kathleen Sebelius for squeezing out home health care.\nOr does the administration have something ideological against home health care?\nIs it that by having the health care provider coming to a person\u2019s house, there\u2019s not enough of a role for the government to intervene, manage, and meddle?\nAdvance warning: if you work in this industry, and your company folds up because of ObamaCare, Harry Reid will call you a stinking liar.\nI\u2019m sure everything will work out fine, once the geniuses who created Healthcare.gov have a chance to work their managerial magic on home health care."}
