Last week was a big one for the art world, what with the $142.4 million Francis Bacon sale at Christie's, among other big sales. But on Thursday, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 10th annual Apollo Circle black-tie event, a younger echelon of that world was shedding light on a broader spectrum than just contemporary art.

"It's so important our generation supports the Met," said Bettina Prentice, the founder of Prentice Art Communications, who has been a co-chairwoman of the benefit for several years.

Given the record-breaking Christie's sale, "it's all about contemporary right now," she said. "I think we need to remember it's also about preserving the history of Islamic art, and the history of textiles, all of this. The Met really supports it all."

The reference to textiles is a specific one, as the theme of this year's event was "Between the Seams," inspired by the museum's exhibition "Intervwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800," which opens Jan. 5.

The clothing line Maiyet sponsored the event, and "Girls" actress Zosia Mamet, as well as Ms. Prentice and fellow co-chairwomen Amanda Hearst and Jessica Joffe, wore Maiyet gowns. "I think you have fond memories every time you go to the Met," Ms. Joffe said. "It's a very evocative place."
