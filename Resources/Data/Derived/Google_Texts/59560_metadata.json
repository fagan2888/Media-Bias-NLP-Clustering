For security reasons, the Defense Department asked Defense One and other reporters not to refer to him by name. Doc is tall, slender, patient, and speaks with a slow and calm voice as he shoots down various popular notions about what it\u2019s like to fly robots into war.\n\nHe is frustrated, he said, that some people picture the pilots as disengaged, mindlessly blasting away at targets like a kid playing Halo. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. They are physiologically engaged with what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. Nor are they burn-outs, shell-shocked by scenes of war. \u201cThe vast majority of folks aren\u2019t being traumatized by what they\u2019re seeing,\u201d says Doc.\n\nThe absence of trauma, however, is not the same as the presence of happiness.\n\nRelated: Drone War In Ukraine Forces Big Tech Changes\n\nIn a small base about 45 miles outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, and 63 miles north of a brothel called Sheri\u2019s Ranch, the United States is at war. Since August, the drone operators of Creech Air Force Base have flown more than 3,300 sorties against the Islamic State, dropping bombs, firing missiles, guiding manned jets to their targets, and providing intelligence to coalition forces on the ground. Indeed, there is perhaps no U.S. military entity more directly engaged in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThey\u2019re involved in every engagement that\u2019s taking place in Operation Inherent Resolve, said Col. Jim Cluff, who commands the 432nd Wing and the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing at Creech. And that has many of the men and women at Creech approaching a mental breaking point.\n\nStudies have shown that 4.3 percent of Air Force drone operators report symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. That\u2019s \u201con the low end of rates (4\u201318%) of PTSD among those returning from the battlefield \u2026 and lower than projected lifetime risk of PTSD for Americans (8.7%, American Psychiatric Association, 2013)\u201d according to a 2014 paper from the United Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe unique challenge of this situation is they think about combat a little bit differently,\u201d Doc toldDefense One. \u201cIf there\u2019s a guy lobbing grenades at me, I don\u2019t have time to consider, \u2018What do I think about warfare?\u2019 It\u2019s a survival thing. Here, because we\u2019re so far removed from the battlefield geographically, they\u2019ll think about warfare in more philosophical terms. \u201c\n\nRelated: Death By Drones--Are They Worth the Cost?\n\nCol. Jim Chittenden, a drone pilot who once flew fighter jets, has the bearing of a man in excellent mental health. Flying Predators and Reapers made him feel more \u201cengaged with the battlefield\u201d \u2014 even though he was physically farther away. And the transition from speeding over the fight below at Mach 1 to flying in lazy circles for hours on end made him think about war \u201cdifferently.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one. The waning relevance of multi-million dollar fighter jets, designed to provide close air support or shoot down other aircraft and then rapidly fly back home, show how the wars a nation plans for aren\u2019t the ones it fights. The drones that putter into a combat zone and loiter for a full day with just enough munitions to destroy a clay house are technology\u2019s answer to asymmetrical warfare. Today\u2019s flying robots are a weapon to be used against individuals, not nation-states.\n\n'There\u2019s a part of you that feels like \u2018I know more about this house\u2019s life than I know about my own right now.\u2019\n\nThose who operate the drones are drawn into an intense and intimate form of warfare. A team of drone operators might fly 6,000 hours, watching and waiting, before striking a target. All that time can create a surreal bond between an operator and the subject of surveillance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re tracking an individual house because they think it\u2019s a hotbed for meetings and you watch people drink their tea on the porch,\u201d said Capt. Kristi, a drone operator identified here by her rank and first name only. \u201cYou know what gas station people go to. There\u2019s an odd sense of voyeurism. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s getting to be 10:15; I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s going to have his tea. At 10:45, he\u2019ll go to the gas station down the street to get his Luckies.\u2019 There\u2019s a part of you that feels like \u2018I know more about this house\u2019s life than I know about my own right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nKristi, who has been flying combat missions for three years, said the most difficult aspect of the job is not what she sees directly. It\u2019s the feeling of impotence that comes from her ability to shape some outcomes but not others. It follows her when she heads home at day\u2019s end. \u201cYou can be in there for eight hours \u2026 you can be following a guy that you know committed some horrible crime and you\u2019re thinking about those things the entire day.\u201d\n\nRelated: World's Most Lethal Drone Just Flew Over Florida\n\nIn a way, her ability to \u201cjust go home\u201d makes it worse. \u201cWith other assets, you\u2019re deployed and you make it back to your base, there\u2019s a camaraderie. You can say, \u2018I just flew the worst mission.\u2019 There\u2019s a sense of family, cohesiveness. Here, we get in a car and go to a five-year-old\u2019s soccer game,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isolation, which distinguishes the job of drone pilot from others in the military, is tough but, technically speaking, it isn\u2019t trauma. It\u2019s a new malady that the military doesn\u2019t know how to recognize.\n\nBut Kristi does not exist in a permanent state of suffering. She feels deeply connected to the work she does and the rewards that it offers. \u201cWhen you can loiter over an area for 24 hours, and have constant handover with a similar asset, and the next day you\u2019re in the same area and the same town, you know \u2018That trash can wasn\u2019t here yesterday.\u2019 So if you know friendly forces are going to go through, you can tell them, \u2018This looks different. I saw it.\u2019 That can be incredibly helpful.\u201d\n\nKristi\u2019s wants are few. More than anything, she said, she would welcome \u201cmeaningful\u201d time away from the front line. In military parlance, this is called dwell time, a rotation back to a home base after being deployed to a war zone. But the military does not acknowledge that the drone operators at Creech are in a war zone, although they\u2019re fighting the Pentagon\u2019s war. For them, dwell time is non-existent.\n\nRelated: Air Force Drone Program Soars $74 Million Over Budget\n\nIn part, this is due to a shortage of qualified pilots. On any given day, says Lt. Col. Leland Cowie, who commands the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron, he is missing one-third of the pilots he needs. In May, a GAO inspection found that only 35 percent of Air Force and Army drone pilots had completed the training needed to fly the full spectrum of potential missions. (The GAO found essentially the same thing last year.) In order for Cowie to get more operators, current operators have to train them. But there aren\u2019t enough operators to do both training and conduct operations. It\u2019s a Catch-22.\n\nA World Without Light\n\n\u201cI can fly our crews every day,\u201d said Col. Jim Cluff, who commands the 432nd Wing and the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing at Creech. \u201cThere\u2019s no dwell for them. Some of them have flown combat straight three, four, five years.\u201d The operators under his command are \u201cconstantly engaged in combat for years at a time.\u201d The effect of that is real.\n\nDoc, the psychologist, says this lack of \u201cbattle rhythm\u201d can affect the psyche and condition. \u201cWe know people do well when there\u2019s light on the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t alone in this concern. The absence of light, is, of course, darkness. It\u2019s one reason that psychologist Rollo May described depression as \u201cthe inability to construct a future.\u201d That description also applies to many of the men and women at Creech.\n\nAs technologies advance, Cowie is worried that policymakers will ignore the effects on operators. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start fielding variants that fly longer than 24 hours. How do you provide manning to support that?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no easy way to give America\u2019s drone pilots time away from the screen, and the problem will likely get worse before it gets better. The United States is ambivalent about its war against the Islamic State, as shown by the president\u2019s own remarks regarding the use of force in Iraq and Syria. Speaking to reporters in February, Obama promised to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d the enemy but not to send ground combat forces to help. The drone warriors pay the price for that policy.\n\nAt the entrance to the main facility at Creech, an oval plaque mounted on a concrete base reads, \u201cThrough These Doors Passes the Future of Aviation.\u201d Yet the men and women at the forefront of that revolution have no sense of how their circumstances might change or improve, no sense of their own future. For the Pentagon, they are indispensable, and they are few.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling when they\u2019ll be allowed to truly go home.\n\nThis article was published originally on Defense One.\n\nRead more at Defense One:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CREECH\u00a0AIR\u00a0FORCE\u00a0BASE, Nevada \u2014\u00a0\u201cDoc,\u201d one of America\u2019s few practicing psycholo", "title": "America's Air Force Drone Pilots Are Burning Out", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Americas-Air-Force-Drone-Pilots-Are-Burning-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072013_drone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Americas-Air-Force-Drone-Pilots-Are-Burning-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072013_drone_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CREECH\u00a0AIR\u00a0FORCE\u00a0BASE, Nevada \u2014\u00a0\u201cDoc,\u201d one of America\u2019s few practicing psycholo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccc2\"", "article_summary": "CREECH AIR FORCE BASE, Nevada \u2014 \u201cDoc,\u201d one of America\u2019s few practicing psychologists with top-secret clearance, spends his days talking to drone pilots.\nStudies have shown that 4.3 percent of Air Force drone operators report symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nRelated: Air Force Drone Program Soars $74 Million Over BudgetIn part, this is due to a shortage of qualified pilots.\nIn May, a GAO inspection found that only 35 percent of Air Force and Army drone pilots had completed the training needed to fly the full spectrum of potential missions.\nHow do you provide manning to support that?\u201dThere\u2019s no easy way to give America\u2019s drone pilots time away from the screen, and the problem will likely get worse before it gets better."}
