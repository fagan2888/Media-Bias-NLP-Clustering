MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A singing woman at the Memphis Zoo hopped the barrier into the lion enclosure and attempted to feed cookies to the animals and serenade them with a song, according to the Associated Press.

“Last week she was noticed by our security staff throwing objects into the lion exhibit. At that time she was asked to leave the zoo,” said Abbey Dane of the Memphis Zoo.

On Monday, the woman came back and jumped a barrier in front of the lions, who reportedly walked up to the fence that has a half-inch spacing in between the wires. The woman was reportedly singing to the lions.

“Some song (was about) how much she missed them. It was bizarre,” said Abby Dane, a worker at the zoo. “I’ve never seen someone singing to a lion. It was really loud.”

The woman was also attempting to feed cookies to the lions in both instances.

Someone called a zoo hotline and reported the woman. She was asked to leave and has been banned from the zoo.
