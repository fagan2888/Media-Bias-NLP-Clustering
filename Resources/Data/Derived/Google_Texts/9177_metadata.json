It was around 2:00 Saturday morning when Choctaw County Sheriff Tom Abate says gunshots suddenly rang out during a birthday party at the Jimmerson House on Highway 17. Witnesses tell us an altercation in the parking lot got out of control.\n\n\"Next thing you know, you heard gunshots,\" Adrian Lockett recalls. \"Walked around, you seen a lot of people running, we seen all the people running. Somebody laying unresponsive on the ground.\"\n\nTurns out there were two people hit by gunfire and both victims died as a result of the gunshots. Sheriff Abate says as family members were transporting one of the victims to the hospital, they were involved in a crash.\n\n\"When the troopers got here, when deputies got to the scene, the individual that was shot was pronounced dead at the scene,\" Abate explains. \"All the names of the victims are being withheld at this time.\"\n\nTiwaka Gailes says he was driving the car that was hit by the car transporting the shooting victim. Both vehicles ended up in the ditch. Gailes tells us he had also been at the party.\n\n\"There were so many people shooting, so I just can't say who did what or you know, who was shooting because a lot of people were shooting,\" Gailes recalls.\n\nThe sheriff says the Alabama Bureau of Investigations is now assisting with this case. He says investigators have spent the weekend tracking a number of leads in the case. The suspects' vehicle was recovered a few hours after the shooting, which will only help authorities with their investigation.\n\nIf you have any information about this case, please call the Choctaw County Sheriff's Office at 205-459-2166.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Authorities are actively searching for the suspects in a double homicide in Choctaw County, Ala.", "language": "english", "author": "Chip Scarborough", "og": {"description": "Authorities are actively searching for the suspects in a double homicide in Choctaw County, Ala.", "title": "Suspects in Choctaw County Double Homicide Still At Large", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Suspects-in-Choctaw-County-Double-Homicide-Still-At-Large--265983101.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D70/D08/D70D08156AA741DDA0484DE6B407F7FA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/56E/44A/56E44ACB1F424CC7BBFB78DB226EA972.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Authorities are actively searching for the suspects in a double homicide in Choctaw County, Ala.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Suspects-in-Choctaw-County-Double-Homicide-Still-At-Large--265983101.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Choctaw+County+Authorities+Double+Homicide.jpg", "title": "Suspects in Choctaw County Double Homicide Still At Large", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Suspects in Choctaw County Double Homicide Still At Large", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Suspects in Choctaw County Double"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b2d\"", "article_summary": "The search is on to find those responsible for shooting and killing two people during a weekend party in Choctaw County.\nIf you have any information about this case, please call the Choctaw County Sheriff's Office at 205-459-2166.\nIt was around 2:00 Saturday morning when Choctaw County Sheriff Tom Abate says gunshots suddenly rang out during a birthday party at the Jimmerson House on Highway 17.\nThe suspects' vehicle was recovered a few hours after the shooting, which will only help authorities with their investigation.\n\"There were so many people shooting, so I just can't say who did what or you know, who was shooting because a lot of people were shooting,\" Gailes recalls."}
