Zero value for him,\u201d said Elway, who recently slapped Thomas with a franchise tag that guarantees $12.8 million for a single season, in a league where security can be as tenuous as one wicked tackle to a receiver\u2019s exposed knee.\n\nSeeking top dollar in a long-term deal, it seems to me Thomas is applying what little leverage a player has by withholding his services. But Thomas also has committed the bad mistake of doing a passive-aggressive dance with Elway, a straightforward dude who never waltzes around any issue.\n\nIf Thomas thinks his worth as Manning\u2019s top target is $14 million per season, then he needs to stand up, state his case to Elway and pound out a deal. Instead, it appears he is waiting for Dez Bryant to sign with Dallas, in the hope the Cowboys star sets the market for D.T. in Denver. Here\u2019s betting that ain\u2019t gonna fly with Elway.\n\nSo now Elway has sent a clear, direct and combative message to Thomas: Quit this big, hot fuss about money and get your butt back to the team\u2019s Dove Valley headquarters, so everybody can start learning the tricks of new coach Gary Kubiak in preparation for a Super Bowl or bust season.\n\nBut, to be dead honest, the irritation in the voice of Elway made the message sound a little too personal, especially when you consider that while Thomas is a receiver who\u2019s unafraid to catch a football over the middle, he does need more tender, loving care to feel appreciated than some mentally tougher NFL athletes.\n\n\u201cAs far as negotiations and his new deal and what\u2019s going on, we\u2019d like to get something done,\u201d Elway said. \u201cBy him being away from here, there is zero value not only to us, but also to him. To me, it makes no sense. That actually has no effect on anything that we\u2019re talking about trying to get a contract done with him.\u201d\n\nWinning and losing is personal to Elway, whether we\u2019re keeping score on the football field or at the negotiating table. The raw competitiveness that crackles as hot as a ruptured power line is what makes Elway so great.\n\nIn the business of the NFL, however, money can never get personal, because the resulting fallout can undermine the sense of all-for-one and nobody-for-himself cohesiveness that\u2019s essential to a championship locker room.\n\nWhile Elway will be beloved forever by Broncomaniacs for fourth-quarter heroics as a quarterback, his throwing hand has quickly morphed to an iron fist since assuming front-office duties in 2011. Disappoint him on the field, and Elway will send you packing, even if you are as popular as Tim Tebow. Challenge Elway in contract negotiations, and you can kiss Denver goodbye, Elvis Dumervil.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing warm and fuzzy about the job of general manager, which is precisely why it would be no shocker if Thomas got slapped with a franchise tag again for the 2016 season, should he fail to sign a long-term deal on Elway\u2019s terms. But it\u2019s also bad business for an NFL executive who pounds the table with an iron fist in contract talks to deliver a critical lecture to the Broncos after a loss, as Elway was known to do on occasion under coach John Fox\u2019s regime, because reception of the football message can get mixed with fears about the waiver wire or resentment regarding a pay cut.\n\nThomas cannot win in this money spat, because Elway refuses to be beaten in a salary dispute with the same intensity he brought to scrambling for the first-down marker. Translation: Don\u2019t get in the way of what Elway wants, unless you\u2019re begging to get hurt.\n\nWith a new offense to install and the championship window closing on Denver\u2019s 39-year-old quarterback, is the stubbornness displayed by both Elway and Thomas in this contract dispute penny smart but football foolish?\n\nLet\u2019s hope the Broncos don\u2019t lose their last, best shot to win a Super Bowl with Manning while his boss and No. 1 receiver quarrel over money.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Demaryius Thomas bashed by boss for missing workouts", "title": "Kiszla: Demaryius Thomas bashed by boss for missing workouts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/23/kiszla-demaryius-thomas-bashed-by-boss-for-missing-workouts/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T21:48:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T12:10:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda58b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo be dead honest, I see absolutely zero value in him being away from here.\n\u201cBy him being away from here, there is zero value not only to us, but also to him.\nSeeking top dollar in a long-term deal, it seems to me Thomas is applying what little leverage a player has by withholding his services.\nChallenge Elway in contract negotiations, and you can kiss Denver goodbye, Elvis Dumervil.\nLet\u2019s hope the Broncos don\u2019t lose their last, best shot to win a Super Bowl with Manning while his boss and No."}
