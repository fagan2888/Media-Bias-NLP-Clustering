One doctor says providing California illegal immigrants health insurance is an expensive move that will reflect the disastrous ObamaCare rollout.

California would provide illegal immigrants access to subsided healthcare under proposed legislation introduced by state Sen. Ricardo Lara.

It offers illegal immigrants two ways to obtain health insurance. For illegal immigrants below the poverty level, the bill would require the state to expand Medi-Cal to include undocumented immigrants. For illegal immigrants who make more, the state would create a marketplace similar to California's health insurance exchange.

Dr. Jane Orient of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons says the bill is "forcing people to work harder, essentially, to pay for not only their own medical care, but for people who have no legal right to be here."

Senate Bill 1005 doesn't note how much it will cost the state to implement the expansion.

"If they can't even estimate it, how are they expecting Americans to say, Ok, just write us a blank check for taking care of these people who are competing against us for jobs?'" Orient observes. "They are criminally trespassing, and many of them are not just here looking for work, many of them are criminals."

Lara said the goal is to offer health insurance for the roughly three million illegal immigrants in the state who currently cannot obtain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act because of their immigration status.
