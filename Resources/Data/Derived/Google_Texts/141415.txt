PHILADELPHIA — Washington Redskins running back Matt Jones is inactive for Saturday night’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Jones was limited all week in practice because of a hip injury. Running back Chris Thompson, who missed the last two games because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder, is active. Without Jones on the field, that means a heavier workload is likely in store for running back Alfred Morris.

Right tackle Morgan Moses and center Josh LeRibeus are active. Both offensive linemen had sprained ankles and were listed as questionable. Free safety Dashon Goldson is also active, despite a broken rib, knee and shoulder injuries.

The other inactives are quarterback Robert Griffin III, defensive end Frank Kearse, inside linebacker Perry Riley, tight end Marcel Jensen, tight end Je’Ron Hamm and left guard Arie Kouandjio.

Eagles cornerback Byron Maxwell is inactive because of a shoulder injury. The other inactives are quarterback Thad Lewis, wide receiver Seyi Ajirotutu, center Barrett Jones, left guard Tanner Hawkinson, nose tackle Bennie Logan and linebacker Steven Means.
