Due to recent federal requirements, insurance companies were required to supply all plan information in a standardized data format (MRF). Despite being available to the public for over 15 months, this data has gone largely unused by individuals and researchers because of inconsistent formatting and the lack of easy-to-use tools.\n\nOver the past six months and with cooperation from a large number of insurance companies, HealthJoy has significantly improved the accuracy of the available data. The company is now releasing these tools for use by the public.\n\n\n\nInsurance Company Network Comparison - Want to compare insurance plans in your city, zip code or state?
