One person died in an early-morning house fire in Strasburg that officials are investigating as suspicious.

The fire happened at about 1:10 a.m. Saturday morning at 4100 South County Road 157, said Arapahoe County sheriff’s spokeswoman Julie Brooks.

The sheriff’s office said on Twitter later that it was looking for two vehicles in connection with the fatal fire: A 2001 white GMC Sierra with Colorado plates 962-VCE and a 1995 blue Chevrolet utility vehicle with Colorado plates 291-NQW.

A passer-by saw flames and smoke coming from the home and alerted authorities.

When fire crews arrived, they found a person inside the home who had died, Brooks said.

“We are investigating the death as suspicious at this point, but obviously there’s a lot of investigation ahead of us,” Brooks said.

Authorities do not yet know the cause of the fire or the cause of death, Brooks said.

No information about the victim has been released yet.
