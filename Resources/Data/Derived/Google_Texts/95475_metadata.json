State game. But before heading to Tuscaloosa, Ingraham stopped in Birmingham to speak at a luncheon organized by the Alabama Policy Institute.\n\nIngraham first explained her love of Alabama football. She recalled that when she was growing up in Connecticut, her mother believed that Bear Bryant\u2019s dedication to hard work, service and love of country meant that he \u201crepresented the best of America,\u201d so they would always watch the games on television.\n\n\u201cMy mom loved college football and she loved Alabama. One of my best memories with my mom was as a 9-year-old in 1973. It was the Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame \u2014 one of the most heartbreaking games in Alabama history. I hate Notre Dame to this day,\u201d she laughed.\n\nIngraham also raved about the progress that has been made in Alabama since Republicans took control in 2010.\n\n\u201cPeople up north like to look down on the South \u2014 entertainment culture does, a lot of the academic elites. But you are outsmarting them. Alabama is outsmarting them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve really shown what is possible. You\u2019ve transformed the state legislature. Now this is such a great state to do business in. You guys are amazing. It inspires me.\u201d\n\nBut she saved her highest praise for Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who she noted is now poised to become the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee when Republicans assume control of the upper chamber in January.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions has affected policy in a really important way, and not just on immigration,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe has really changed the way people talk about trade and holding countries accountable on trade agreements. He has been a tireless fighter for the people of this state and the people of this country. He has made such a mark on the debate. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say, if it weren\u2019t for Jeff Sessions, the Republicans in the House would have signed on to that crazy immigration bill, which was 1,200 pages long and was basically the ObamaCare for immigration. Jeff Sessions did more to educate other Republicans on that legislation than anyone in the country. And they vilified him initially. We owe him a huge debt of gratitude.\u201d\n\nIngraham said that Republicans around the country would do well to follow Sessions\u2019 lead and return to a more populist message that can win over middle-class working families.\n\n\u201cOr as I call it, Reagan Conservatism,\u201d she said. \u201cJust talk to people. Address people like they\u2019re human beings instead of like they\u2019re from interest groups. Just talk about what kind of country we want to live in and how we\u2019re going to get there. That\u2019s what Jeff Sessions does. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he\u2019s having such an impact.\u201d\n\nPrint\n\nFollow Cliff on Twitter @Cliff_Sims", "article_metadata": {"description": "Radio host and Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham spoke in Birmingham.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Nationally syndicated radio host and Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham, a Connecticut native who is perhaps the country\u2019s most unlikely Alabama football fan, is in the state[...]", "title": "Laura Ingraham on her love of Alabama, Jeff Sessions & why Bear Bryant 'represented the best of America' - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 765, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/YH-Laura-Ingraham.png", "height": 409}, "updated_time": "2014-11-16T23:01:12-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/laura-ingraham-love-alabama-jeff-sessions-bear-bryant-represented-best-america/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "the club", "published_time": "2014-11-14T15:49:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T23:01:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fcd\"", "article_summary": "Ingraham first explained her love of Alabama football.\nThat\u2019s what Jeff Sessions does.\n\u201cJeff Sessions has affected policy in a really important way, and not just on immigration,\u201d she explained.\nJeff Sessions did more to educate other Republicans on that legislation than anyone in the country.\nIngraham also raved about the progress that has been made in Alabama since Republicans took control in 2010."}
