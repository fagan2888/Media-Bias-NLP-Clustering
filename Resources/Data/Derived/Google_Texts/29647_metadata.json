Gregarious and likable, he is best known for his prodigious fund-raising skills and overflowing address book. One Republican who worked with him in California said that if he lost his job and \u201ccould call only one person to help me with my career, it would be Jeff Miller.\u201d\n\nThe gravelly voiced consultant commands a ubiquitous presence outside his office near the Capitol, often pacing Austin\u2019s Congress Avenue with a cellphone pressed to his ear and a Marlboro Light dangling from his mouth. Last week, Mr. Miller said he did not want to be quoted in an article about him. But Rob Johnson, Mr. Perry\u2019s former presidential campaign manager, said Mr. Miller was busy preparing Mr. Perry for another possible run for president, even though a decision was months away.\n\n\u201cJeff works with a whole team of people to make sure we\u2019re getting the governor prepared so that, come 2015, he\u2019s in a position to make a thoughtful decision,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He added that if Mr. Perry decided not to run for the president, it would not be because he was unprepared.\n\nMr. Miller grew up in Tehachapi, Calif., about 40 miles east of Bakersfield. His father made high-capacity firearms but had to close his business after President Bill Clinton signed the since-expired 10-year assault weapons ban in 1994 \u2014 an experience that strengthened Mr. Miller\u2019s already considerable conservative tendencies.\n\nIn 1993, after basic training for the Navy Reserve, Mr. Miller took a $5-an-hour internship with the California Republican Party. It was there that he met Kevin McCarthy, then a young field representative for Bill Thomas, a congressman from Bakersfield. Mr. McCarthy, who eventually replaced Mr. Thomas, is now the House majority leader.\n\nPictures of Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Schwarzenegger, former Gov. Pete Wilson and other friends from California line the walls of Mr. Miller\u2019s Austin office. But California is in his rearview mirror now. Over dinner in 2012, Mr. Miller promised Mr. Perry and his wife, Anita, that if California Republicans were licked yet again in 2012, he would pull up his stakes and move to Texas. When Democrats won a supermajority in the California Legislature, and key ballot initiatives went their way, Mr. Miller made good on the vow and headed to Austin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut California was not quite through with him. Mr. Miller was the chief fund-raiser in 2012 for a controversial initiative that he and his business partner, Tony Russo, set up to raise money to oppose Democrats and organized labor on a couple of high-profile state ballot initiatives dealing with taxes and union political spending. Much of the money was raised from anonymous donors. After a series of complicated, out-of-state transfers among \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit groups, which are allowed to shield disclosure of their donors, about $15 million made its way back into California to help finance the Republican-backed campaign on the two ballot initiatives.\n\nA last-minute donation of $11 million from one of the out-of-state groups triggered an inquiry by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which called it \u201cthe largest contribution ever disclosed as campaign money laundering in California history.\u201d\n\nIn a record settlement, the ethics agency hit two Arizona nonprofits with a $1 million fine, and two California groups had to pay $15 million in penalties, representing the amount regulators said was improperly funneled into the ballot initiative campaign. Mr. Miller and Mr. Russo were both granted immunity and cooperated with prosecutors. Neither was accused of wrongdoing. In his testimony, the characteristically brash Mr. Miller, by then living in Austin, said he felt \u201cscrewed\u201d by an out-of-state consultant and called the controversy a \u201cfiasco.\u201d\n\nThese days Mr. Miller runs the Austin branch of Russo Miller & Associates, which specializes in public affairs consulting, government procurement and pro-business \u201cincentives which can be secured at the state and local levels of government.\u201d\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s embrace of job-luring tax incentives, which some critics call corporate welfare, has become his political calling card. Late last month, his deal-closing Texas Enterprise Fund approved $6 million in job-creation incentives for the California-based Charles Schwab Corporation. As it turned out, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, Charles Schwab, was one of the secret donors to the doomed fund-raising initiative in California, according to published reports.\n\nMr. Johnson said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to make any connection between the 2012 California donation and the recent Texas grant. He also said he saw no conflict of interest between Mr. Miller\u2019s consulting work and his role as a top adviser to Mr. Perry.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, he doesn\u2019t represent any clients who have gotten Texas Enterprise Fund money,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nPerry associates say it is far too early to talk about the makeup of an eventual presidential campaign. In this retesting-the-waters phase, Mr. Johnson, who shares an office with Mr. Miller, continues to provide advice to the governor, as do two of his longtime speechwriters, Eric Bearse and Ted Royer.\n\nIf Mr. Perry does run for president, Mr. Miller is expected to play a major role. Mr. Miner, the former spokesman, put it in musical terms. Mr. Miller, he said, would be \u201cthe conductor of the orchestra.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140807201854, "twitter": {"description": "As the Texas governor\u2019s political star appears to rise again, the strategist Jeff Miller is advising Mr. Perry and is poised to guide a possible 2016 presidential campaign.", "title": "The Architect Behind the Rebuilding of Rick Perry", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/the-architect-behind-the-rebuilding-of-rick-perry.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003045217"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/08/us/08ttMILLER/08ttMILLER-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/the-architect-behind-the-rebuilding-of-rick-perry.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003045217", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/the-architect-behind-the-rebuilding-of-rick-perry.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "The Architect Behind the Rebuilding of Rick Perry", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 7, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "keywords": "Perry  Rick,Presidential Election of 2016,State Legislatures,Referendums,Miller  Jeff (1974- ),Texas", "description": "As the Texas governor\u2019s political star appears to rise again, the strategist Jeff Miller is advising Mr. Perry and is poised to guide a possible 2016 presidential campaign.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jay Root", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/08/us/08ttMILLER/08ttMILLER-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Miller, Jeff (1974- )", "slug": "08ttmiller", "byl": "By JAY ROOT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As the Texas governor\u2019s political star appears to rise again, the strategist Jeff Miller is advising Mr. Perry and is poised to guide a possible 2016 presidential campaign.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/08/us/08ttMILLER/08ttMILLER-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Referendum,Texas", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-08-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Texas", "published": "2014-08-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140808123845, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/the-architect-behind-the-rebuilding-of-rick-perry.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/08/us/08ttMILLER/08ttMILLER-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As the Texas governor\u2019s political star appears to rise again, the strategist Jeff Miller is advising Mr. Perry and is poised to guide a possible 2016 presidential campaign.", "title": "The Architect Behind the Rebuilding of Rick Perry"}, "pdate": 20140807, "des": "Referendums", "articleid": 100000003045217, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Architect Behind the Rebuilding of Rick Perry", "col": "The Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb761\"", "article_summary": "If Mr. Perry does run for president, Mr. Miller is expected to play a major role.\nHe also said he saw no conflict of interest between Mr. Miller\u2019s consulting work and his role as a top adviser to Mr. Perry.\nHe added that if Mr. Perry decided not to run for the president, it would not be because he was unprepared.\nLast week, Mr. Miller said he did not want to be quoted in an article about him.\nMr. Miller and Mr. Russo were both granted immunity and cooperated with prosecutors."}
