Taking snaps Friday represented progress. Peyton Manning practiced a third straight day this week, leaving him available as the Broncos backup quarterback on Sunday.

Manning said the week went OK as he continues to work through torn plantar fascia in his left foot. After consecutive days of team practice leading up to the Pittsburgh Steelers game, he suffered a setback.

He has now stacked back-to-back encouraging weeks together. Manning logged four individual workouts last week — “They were intense,” said practice squad receiver Jordan Taylor, who caught passes — and three team practices this week. Manning took reps with the second-string offense and helped run scout team as Brock Osweiler ran the first team.

Manning, 39, hasn’t been active on game day since leaving the Kansas City Chiefs game on Nov. 15 following his fourth interception.

“It was a good week, and we will move forward with this weekend,” coach Gary Kubiak said.
