The white paper signs, affixed to UCLA's entrance gates with red and yellow tape, appeared to be hastily placed and lacked originality. One sign, in an apparent slight against the Affordable Healthcare Act and the university's top-ranked medical center, read "UCla IS THE #1 DONOR TO OBAMACARE." Another sign conveyed the message a bit more clearly, simply saying "UCLA SUCKS."

Stuffed bears were also hung from the signs with red and yellow ribbon. As of Tuesday morning, no one has claimed responsibility for posting the signs or the bears.
