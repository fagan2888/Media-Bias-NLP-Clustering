Essentially, parts of these babies\u2019 hearts haven\u2019t developed properly \u2014 from the valves to nearby arteries or veins \u2014 causing symptoms like rapid breathing; a bluish tint in skin, lips, and fingernails; fatigue, and poor blood circulation. Treating these children can be expensive and emotionally tiring, as it involves highly specialized care. A new study, however, finds that 3D-printed hearts may eliminate the need for surgery, thus reducing costs.\n\n\u201cChildren with congenital heart disease often need up to four open heart surgeries at different times of life,\u201d biomedical engineer Dr. Peter Verschueren said in a press release. \u201cThe 3D-printed copy of the heart could reduce this to one or two, because doctors can choose and practice the best interventional approach and device beforehand. This will avoid children spending months in intensive care.\u201d\n\n3D printing has emerged as a useful tool in everything from aerospace to medical sciences. Just this year, scientists successfully created blood vessels using the sugar-based molecule agarose as a mold, and enclosed it in hydrogel, a gelatin-like substance. A team of researchers from the University of Louisville are also in the midst of developing a 3D-printed heart that may one day be transplanted \u2014 so far, they\u2019ve only developed two-ventricle cylinders tiny enough for a mouse.\n\nVerschueren\u2019s 3D-printed hearts may not soon be transplanted, either, but they will give doctors a better idea of potential treatments. That\u2019s because most current treatments are based on assessments from an image of the heart. By going 3D, the researchers will have a model of each patient\u2019s unique, defected heart, which will even mimic beating. \u201c3D models can be used to discuss the intervention with the medical team, patients, and, in the case of congenital heart defects, with parents,\u201d said Helen O\u2019Grady, another biomedical engineer, in the release. \u201cIt helps everyone affected to better understand what the procedure will involve.\u201d\n\nMost kids born with congenital heart defects go on to live relatively normal lives, albeit with some limitations, such as the ability to exercise. They\u2019re also prone to heart failure and developmental delays in both motor function and learning. Some of these delays can be attributed to defects, however, other delays will probably come from time taken away from school to undergo surgery. It\u2019s cases like these that make the 3D hearts useful, by allowing kids to live more normal lives.\n\nSource: Verscheuren P, et al.
