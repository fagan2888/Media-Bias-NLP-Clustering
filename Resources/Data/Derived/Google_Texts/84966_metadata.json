The suit asks courts to declare it unconstitutional, under the First and Fourth Amendments and insure that all past records are destroyed.\n\nThe program, which started in 1992, collected phone metadata on calls made from the United States to 116 other countries at its peak, according to a report in USA Today. It only ended after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of other surveillance programs carried out by the NSA.\n\nThe DEA used administrative subpoenas, which do not require court approval, to force phone companies to hand over the bulk records. Sprint and AT&T were specifically cited in the report. Other telecom companies were also subject to the orders, the report found.\n\nHuman Rights Watch is represented in the case by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has represented clients in a number of other cases against the NSA\u2019s own metadata collection program.\n\n\u201cWe are asking the court to require the government to destroy the records it illegally collected no matter where they are held, and to declare once and for all that bulk collection of Americans\u2019 records is unconstitutional,\u201d said EFF attorney Mark Rumold.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The now-defunct program collected international call records for decades.", "description": "The now-defunct program collected international call records for decades.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The now-defunct program collected international call records for decades.", "title": "Human Rights Watch sues over secret DEA surveillance program", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238180-human-rights-watch-sues-over-dea-surveillance", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/dea_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238180-human-rights-watch-sues-over-dea-surveillance", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-08T09:41-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-08T09:41:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Drug Enforcement Agency, Lawsuit, phone surveillance,,Human Rights Watch, Electronic Frontier Foundation", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238180-human-rights-watch-sues-over-dea-surveillance", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The now-defunct program collected international call records for decades.", "card": "summary", "title": "Human Rights Watch sues over secret DEA surveillance program"}, "dcterms.title": "Human Rights Watch sues over secret DEA surveillance program"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebcd\"", "article_summary": "Human Rights Watch filed a lawsuit against the Drug Enforcement Agency Tuesday night, after a report detailing a secret surveillance program that collected Americans\u2019 international call records for decades.\nThe surveillance program ended in 2013, but the lawsuit seeks to make sure it is never revived.\nHuman Rights Watch is represented in the case by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has represented clients in a number of other cases against the NSA\u2019s own metadata collection program.\nThe DEA used administrative subpoenas, which do not require court approval, to force phone companies to hand over the bulk records.\nIt only ended after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of other surveillance programs carried out by the NSA."}
