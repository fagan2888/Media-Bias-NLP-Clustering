But his wife, Bharatiben, is still waiting for hers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been calling every week for five months,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what to do.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, enrollment in the expanded Medicaid program has gone well in New Jersey. The numbers are robust as the program\u2019s expansion under the Affordable Care Act allows single residents and childless couples to get coverage provided their income is low enough. But getting an actual ID card that allows someone to see a doctor? The flood of applicants appears to have resulted in a systemwide backlog, according to applicants and field workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard getting an actual Medicaid card is nearly impossible. It\u2019s like getting Willy Wonka\u2019s Golden Ticket,\u201d said Rena Jordan, director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Jersey, which has been helping patients enroll.\n\n\u201cA lot of strange things have been happening, that\u2019s the easiest way to say it,\u201d said Virginia Nelson, administrative supervisor of the Medicaid Department for Middlesex County.\n\nThe flood of phone calls to her office about older cases has taken time away from processing the newest cases, Nelson said.\n\nFederal officials conceded some of the blame for the delay can be put squarely at the feet of the federal website, healthcare.gov. That website transferred data about applicants whose income looked like they might qualify for Medicaid to the state system, but in a format the state system couldn\u2019t use.\n\nSince the state received the information about enrollees from the federal website, it has processed about 60,000 of those applications, said Nicole Brossoie, spokeswoman for NJ FamilyCare.\n\nCompounding the problem is some people have submitted duplicate applications, which the agency then has to sort through, according to Brossoie.\n\nThe ACA enrollment counselor at Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey has helped 230 patients sign up for either private insurance or Medicaid via the federal website, healthcare.gov.\n\nSo far not a single one of the Medicaid enrollees has received a card, said Kalimah Johnson. Worse yet, she said she can\u2019t get any answers on their behalf.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is not responding to anyone,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s toll-free number sometimes works and sometimes cuts off callers. Essex County\u2019s phone number for local Medicaid inquiries reaches a recording that its message box is full.\n\n\u201cIt disconnects you,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even work to let you leave a number.\u201d (In response to an inquiry, a spokesman for Essex County said all comments had to come from Brossoie.)\n\nWithout a card, patients \u2014 even women who are pregnant \u2014 can\u2019t see a doctor unless they\u2019re willing to pay out of pocket.\n\nKim Peterson, 51, of East Orange, has her Medicaid confirmation number, but no card. Inquiries get her nowhere. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s a substitute teacher and part-time college student who wants to keep up on her preventive doctor and dentist visits, but for now, that means finding room in her budget for the $50 office fee. \u201cIt\u2019s adding up,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople in her situation should be able to get care at hospitals or any federally qualified health center, Brossoie said. They will have what\u2019s called \u201cpresumptive eligibility,\u201d but will need to fill out an interim application once there.\n\nNew Jersey is one of three states that chose to both expand Medicaid and rely on the federal website instead of operating its own. It took months to resolve the technical problem of transferring information between the two programs, said Rachel Klein, enrollment program director of Families America, a non-profit that supports the new law.\n\nSince December, NJ FamilyCare enrollment has grown by about 83,000, for a total of about 1,387,000 residents. Just under half are children.\n\nUnlike Obamacare, there is no enrollment deadline to seek coverage through NJ FamilyCare. People may sign up throughout the year.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news'", "title": "Expanded Obamacare Medicaid backlog means financial bind", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Expanded Obamacare Medicaid backlog means financial bind\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/expanded_medicaid_backlog_means_financial_bind.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/04/14616402-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12573432\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T12:25:32Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/04/14616402-small.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "By all accounts, enrollment in the expanded Medicaid program has gone well in New Jersey.
