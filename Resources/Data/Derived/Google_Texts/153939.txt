SAN ANTONIO - There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to Enroll SA, a coalition of health care professionals including hospitals, county and city officials, and grassroots and nonprofit organizations.

During a rally on Main Plaza Wednesday morning, the group kicked off the second open enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act by announcing a goal of 47,000 enrollees.

During the first period, there were 76,000 enrollees.

Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff said enrollment is vital.

"We're one of the highest counties in the United States with respect to people that do not have health insurance," Wolff said.

He said it is important to turn that around and that politics must be set aside.

"I know there's a lot of political controversy whether you're for Affordable Health Care or whether you're not," he said. "The fact of the matter is that it's here, so why shouldn't people be given the opportunity to go buy it?"

The campaign is being organized by a coalition called "Enroll SA: Get Bexar Covered."

The coalition will be working during the next few months getting the word out through a variety of events. Their efforts are drawing praise from the Obama administration.

"They're very excited about getting the work done and have great strategies in mind," said Kathleen Arculeta, director of the Office of Personnel Management.

Archuleta was in San Antonio to take part in the kick-off campaign. Open enrollment begins this Saturday Nov. 15.
