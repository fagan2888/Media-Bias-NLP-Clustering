I think that\u2019s more of a Spielberg movie,\u201d Stone said when asked if he would consider filming a movie about Obama.\n\nStone then continued by explaining his diss of the \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d director, saying \u201cI fault Spielberg for his view of exceptionalism. You know, he grew up in that America, he has to sell that idea. Americans like that idea.\u201d\n\nThe Academy Award-winning director\u2019s political leanings have been hard to pin down of late. Stone spoke last weekend at the International Students for Liberty Conference, an annual gathering of college libertarian clubs from around the world and was a staunch supporter of former Texas Congressman Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaigns. He was also pals with the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, however, and is known for his hatred of the modern Republican Party.\n\nStone has also publicly criticized Obama, calling him a snake and criticizing him for following in the footsteps of his predecessors.\n\n\u201cObama is a snake,\u201d he told the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan in a speech last August. \u201cHe\u2019s a snake. And we have to turn on him.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Don't expect filmmaker Oliver Stone to create a biopic about the nation's 44th president the way he did about it's 43rd.
