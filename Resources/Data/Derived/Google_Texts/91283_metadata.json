Thank you state lawmakers and pro-life governors!\n\nAlthough the U.S. Senate Democratic leadership refuses to allow votes on pro-life legislation, a majority of House Members backed two bills by Congressman Trent Franks: one to end discrimination against baby girls killed by sex selection abortion\u2014the real war on women\u2014and another bill to protect pain-capable unborn children from excruciating agony and suffering.\n\nAnd since the murder conviction last year of abortionist Kermit Gosnell, Americans are beginning to recognize an ugly reality: there are Gosnells all over America\u2014predators, child abusers and exploiters of women, making money on the pain of others.\n\nSome abortionists may have cleaner sheets and better sanitized instruments than Gosnell, but what they do\u2014what Gosnell did for over 40 years\u2014is the same.\n\nAbortionists are victim-makers and since 1973, more than 56 million children have been brutally slain\u2014a death toll that equates to the entire population of England. On the other hand, the compassionate people in the pro-life movement have for over forty years, welcomed, embraced, loved and deeply cherished both mothers at risk and the co-victims of every abortion\u2014post- abortive women.\n\nThe passage of time hasn\u2019t changed the fact that abortion is a serious, lethal violation of fundamental human rights, and that women and children deserve better, and that the demands of justice, generosity, and compassion require that the right to life be guaranteed to everyone.\n\nRather than dull our consciences to the unmitigated violence of abortion, the passage of time has only enabled us to see and, frankly, better understand the innate cruelty of abortion and its horrific legacy\u2013victims\u2013while making us more determined than ever to protect the weakest and the most vulnerable.\n\nIn the run up to passage of Obamacare, Americans were repeatedly told by President Obama himself, including in a speech to a joint session of Congress in October 2009 that \u201cunder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion.\u201d\n\nIn an eleventh hour ploy to garner the votes of a remnant of pro-life congressional democrats absolutely needed for passage in the House, President Obama issued an executive order now infamous that said that Obamacare \u201cmaintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\nAt its core, the Hyde Amendment has two parts. It not only prohibits funding for most abortions but bans funding for insurance plans that include elective abortion.\n\nUnder Obamacare, billions of dollars in the form of tax credits are today buying abortion-subsidizing health insurance plans in exchanges throughout the country. For example, of the 112 health insurance plans available to members of Congress and staff, most, that is, 103 plans pay for abortion on demand.\n\nLike the President\u2019s promise that you can keep your insurance plan if you like it, the massive public funding for abortion in Obamacare insurance plans breaks another solemn presidential promise.\n\nTo rid Obamacare of its massive expansion of public funding for abortion insurance plans\u2014and to make existing policies like the Hyde Amendment permanent\u2013ask your senators and member of the House to support the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act co-sponsored by 165 House Members and a quarter of the Senate.\n\nFinally, by the grace of God\u2014and because of you, your prayers and hard work\u2014we are winning. And to the youth especially, never quit or grow discouraged, your generation will end abortion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Smith Tells March for Life: Abortion is the Ultimate Exploitation of Women and Children", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The following is the text of Congressman Chris Smith's remarks to today's March for Life:  Thank you for joining this extraordinary March\u2014a magnificent cele", "title": "Chris Smith Tells March for Life: Abortion is the Ultimate Exploitation of Women and Children", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/22/chris-smith-tells-march-for-life-abortion-is-the-ultimate-exploitation-of-women-and-children/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/chrissmith-e1306767236837.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "chris smith tells march for life: abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women and children", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09aa\"", "article_summary": "It not only prohibits funding for most abortions but bans funding for insurance plans that include elective abortion.\nFor example, of the 112 health insurance plans available to members of Congress and staff, most, that is, 103 plans pay for abortion on demand.\nUnder Obamacare, billions of dollars in the form of tax credits are today buying abortion-subsidizing health insurance plans in exchanges throughout the country.\nLike the President\u2019s promise that you can keep your insurance plan if you like it, the massive public funding for abortion in Obamacare insurance plans breaks another solemn presidential promise.\nIn the last three years alone, a record 200 pro-life laws have been enacted in the states."}
