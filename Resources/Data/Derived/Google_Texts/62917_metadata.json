They rarely agree on much.\n\nIt was in the final minutes of this debate that they found themselves on the same page of an issue. Unfortunately, casino gambling is not a question that is decided by members of the US House of Representatives. Both candidates don\u2019t feel a casino would be right for New Hampshire.\n\nApart from non-specific calls for the reforming the tax code, and for Edward Snowden to return to America to face charges, Guinta and Shea-Porter were almost exclusively at odds.\n\nGuinta assailed the Affordable Care Act, and Anthem's limited insurance network that don\u2019t allow to access every hospital in the state.\n\n\u201cBut people like Carol Shea-Porter seem to think [the ACA] is working,\u201d said Guinta, \u201c65 percent of the state doesn\u2019t want it, but she\u2019s doubling down on it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where this 65 percent figure comes from. Surveys done by UNH have never found more than 57 percent of Granite Staters disapprove of the ACA.\n\nBut Shea-Porter didn't back away from her vote in favor of so-called Obamacare. She noted the law increased access to insurance and called it the law she was most proud of.\n\n\u201cWe fixed a problem that your party did not fix for decades,\u201d she declared.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only issue where the two were at odds.\n\nFor instance, immigration.\n\n\u201cWell I support the Senate version for immigration,\u201d said Shea-Porter, \u201cwhich of course Kelly Ayotte voted for because it\u2019s a tough one.\u201d\n\nGuinta, meanwhile; said he would support reforming certain guest worker visas, but only after sealing the border and rescinding an executive order that allows some immigrants to stay in the country while their status was being considered.\n\nShea-Porter said she favors reforming the IRS and accused Guinta of wanting to abolish the agency that she called the nation\u2019s accounts receivable.\n\nGuinta countered that ditching the IRS as we know it would solve problems.\n\n\u201cInstead of having IRS agents come after individuals, come after small business owners, come after non-profits, why don\u2019t we have a very simple process of simplifying the code, and you can have a very simple tax collection process,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause Guinta has been out of office now for two years, many of Shea-Porter\u2019s attack lines were recycled from previous campaigns.\n\nShe again brought up a now four-year old Federal Elections Commission complaint against Guinta for not declaring a bank account containing $355,000 dollars.\n\n\u201cSo are you going to deny\u2026 because at 5:02 today, we called and your case is not closed, it is still open. So are you going deny that you\u2019re still being investigated by the FEC?\u201d she asked.\n\nGuinta shrugged off the accusation by noting the House ethics committee had found no wrong-doing, and noting that thousands of politically motivated complaints are filed with the FEC.\n\nGuinta meanwhile, repeatedly painted Shea-Porter as a Washington insider.\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a Washington Speak,\u201d he said at one point as Shea-Porter tried to explain why she believes one of his ads misrepresents her record.\n\nHe repeatedly noted that, \u201cCarol Shea-Porter has been in office for six years.\u201d While that is true, it avoids mentioning the two years that Guinta occupied the same office from 2010 to 2012.\n\nPolls suggest either candidate could end up holding the seat for the next two years.\n\nOne from UNH put Shea-Porter up by four points. The other, by New England College, had Guinta up by six.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "A stark choice was on display Monday night as Democrat Carol Shea-Porter and Republican Frank Guinta met for their final debate before the mid-term", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/guinta-and-shea-porter-meet-final-debate-0", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201410/Shea-Porter_Guinta_side_by.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A stark choice was on display Monday night as Democrat Carol Shea-Porter and Republican Frank Guinta met for their final debate before the mid-term", "title": "Guinta And Shea-Porter Meet For Final Debate"}, "story_id": 359459134, "twitter": {"site": "@nhpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SamEB_NHPR"}, "author": "Sam Evans-Brown", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Guinta And Shea-Porter Meet For Final Debate"}, "nid": 57574, "datePublished": "2014-10-27", "keywords": "Elections 2014, Frank Guinta, Carol Shea-Porter", "wordCount": 679, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd20c\"", "article_summary": "A stark choice was on display Monday night as Democrat Carol Shea-Porter and Republican Frank Guinta met for their final debate before the mid-term elections next week, televised live on WMUR TV.\nIn their three campaigns against one another, Guinta and Shea-Porter have debated more than a handful of times.\nIt was in the final minutes of this debate that they found themselves on the same page of an issue.\nShea-Porter said she favors reforming the IRS and accused Guinta of wanting to abolish the agency that she called the nation\u2019s accounts receivable.\nHe repeatedly noted that, \u201cCarol Shea-Porter has been in office for six years.\u201d While that is true, it avoids mentioning the two years that Guinta occupied the same office from 2010 to 2012."}
