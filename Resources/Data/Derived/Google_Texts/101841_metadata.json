We need to protect voting rights,\" said Peter Callahan, the group's communications coordinator.\n\nProtesters hoisted a scarecrow-like effigy of a corporate lobbyist holding money bags and a sign reading, \"Warning: Massive civil disobedience is next.\"\n\nPolice arrested those who sat on the stairs of the East Front of the Capitol, the seat of the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nDemocracy Spring traces its roots to the end of the Occupy Los Angeles movement, and its rise coincides with the presidential campaigns of Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom speak against the influence of campaign contributions on politicians.\n\nWhile most of the groups involved are associated more with Democrats than Republicans, Callahan said the group was nonpartisan.\n\n\"We see populism on the rise on both sides of the spectrum. Americans are sick and tired of their politicians being bought and paid for,\" Callahan said.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Beech in Washington and Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Eric Walsh and Jonathan Oatis)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/11/More-400-protesters-arrested-US-Capitol-police", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "type": "article", "description": "The mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S.", "title": "Police arrest 400 at U.S. Capitol in protest of money in politics"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/11/More-400-protesters-arrested-US-Capitol-police", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The protest was held \"to demand Congress take immediate action to end the corruption of big money in our politics and ensure free and fair elections,\" Democracy Spring said on its website.\nThe mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S. Capitol Police called \"unlawful demonstration activity\" such as crowding and obstruction.\nProtesters hoisted a scarecrow-like effigy of a corporate lobbyist holding money bags and a sign reading, \"Warning: Massive civil disobedience is next.\"\n(Reporting by Eric Beech in Washington and Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Eric Walsh and Jonathan Oatis)\nWhile most of the groups involved are associated more with Democrats than Republicans, Callahan said the group was nonpartisan."}
