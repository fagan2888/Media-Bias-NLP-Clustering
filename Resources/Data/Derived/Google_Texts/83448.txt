Sarah Palin has aimed her latest Facebook diatribe at a well-deserved target: PETA.

PETA fired the first shot, issuing a public statement denouncing a picture Palin had shared of her young son, Trig, standing on the family dog in order to reach the kitchen sink and wash the dishes.

“It’s odd that anyone—let alone a mother—would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo,” PETA wrote. “Then again, PETA, along with everyone else, is used to the hard-hearted, seeming obliviousness of this bizarrely callous woman, who actually thought it appropriate to be filmed while turkeys were being slaughtered right behind her in full view of the camera.”

Palin began her lengthy Facebook post with a tongue-in-cheek address: “Dear PETA, Chill. At least Trig didn’t eat the dog.”

She went on to call out PETA’s hypocrisy for failing to criticize PETA Woman of the Year Ellen Degeneres, who has posted a basically identical picture–a tiny child standing on a dog to reach the sink–on her own Facebook page.

“Our pets, including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards,” Palin continued.

She ended the post with several pictures of her family with their dog, Jill. “Jill is a precious part of our world. So is Trig.”

Palin’s initial post with the picture of Trig celebrated his ingenuity and determination to get to the sink without her help.
