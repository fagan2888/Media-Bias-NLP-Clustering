Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Washington, D.C., in 2010, an internship with former Ohio representative and current Senator Peggy Lehner in 2009, and an internship with Ohio Rep. Mike Turner in 2007.\n\nWhile attending law school, Antani is currently clerking for Judge Jeffrey Welbaum in an Ohio appeals court.\n\nAs he campaigns, Antani is focused on the issues of the economy and education reform. He emphasizes the need for job creation and particularly that in the manufacturing field. He also wants to spotlight jobs in flourishing new industries like technology, labeling himself ideal for such a task because, as a Millennial, he has \u201cgrown up with technology.\u201d\n\nHaving knocked on many doors in Ohio\u2019s 42nd district to communicate his message, Antani described individuals he has engaged with as \u201cabsolutely\u201d receptive to his message. He also said his potential constituents have \u201cenergy and enthusiasm\u201d for a young candidate like himself in the House.\n\n\u201cOur generation deserves a voice in the Ohio House,\u201d said Antani.\n\nAntani encourages other young individuals from the Republican party to run for roles in government in order to multiply the number of Millennial voices and also to demonstrate to young people that the Republican party has their interests in mind.\n\n\u201cI believe the Republican party is the party of opportunity \u2026 and the American dream,\u201d asserted Antani. Conversly, he labeled Democrats the party of \u201cdependents.\u201d\n\nTo those young people that are considering roles in government, Antani urged them not to be discouraged by judgement.\n\n\u201cPeople told me not to run because I didn\u2019t have enough experience and I was too young,\u201d he detailed, a fact that only incentivized him to continue to press on for the job.\n\nAntani has several honors to his name, including the 2012 Ohio College Republican Federation\u2019s \u201cCollege Republican of the Year,\u201d the Montgomery County Republican Party\u2019s \u201cRepublican Man of the Year\u201d and one of Red Alert Politics\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d awards in 2013.\n\nHe is also a member of the National Rifle Association and chairman of the Ohio Republican Party Asian Pacific American Advisory Council.\n\nAntani is an Indian-American, his parents having migrated to the United States in 1978.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Twenty-three year old Niraj Antani has certainly accomplished a lot, and now he's running as a Republican candidate for Ohio state representative.", "title": "Profiling 2014: 23-year-old Republican running for seat in Ohio...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 268, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/09/niraj-antani-268x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/10/04/23-year-old-republican-running-seat-ohio-house/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "ohio-state-representative", "published_time": "2014-10-04T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T15:29:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa45\"", "article_summary": "He is also a member of the National Rifle Association and chairman of the Ohio Republican Party Asian Pacific American Advisory Council.\n\u2013Niraj Antani has already accomplished a lot, and now the 23-year-old is running as a Republican candidate for Ohio state representative.\nAntani has several honors to his name, including the 2012 Ohio College Republican Federation\u2019s \u201cCollege Republican of the Year,\u201d the Montgomery County Republican Party\u2019s \u201cRepublican Man of the Year\u201d and one of Red Alert Politics\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d awards in 2013.\n\u201cI believe the Republican party is the party of opportunity \u2026 and the American dream,\u201d asserted Antani.\n\u201cOur generation deserves a voice in the Ohio House,\u201d said Antani."}
