Noted conservative commentator and talked-about Republican presidential contender Ben Carson cut to the chase about the fate of Obamacare, saying there is absolutely no reason politicians can’t unravel, reinvent or outright repeal the health care plan — and those who say otherwise are selling a lie.

“Health care is a gigantic issue, and there’s no question that the system was broken and that we needed to do something about it,” Mr. Carson said on “America’s Forum” on Newsmax TV. “What we did not need to do is create another massive government program, and we need to be looking at different ways of taking care of it, putting responsibility back into the hands of patients and to their health care providers. There are things that can be done. We keep listening to people saying ‘the horse is out of the barn, you can’t get it back in there, end of story,’ [and] that’s a bunch of crap. We can do anything. This is America.”

Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, also decried how Obamacare shifted the role of power in the nation and took health care out of the hands of the people and put it into the control of government.

“The people are supposed to be at the pentacle,” he said, Newsmax reported. “The government is supposed to conform to our will, not us to their will.”

Mr. Carson still hasn’t decided whether he’ll seek the presidency in 2016. But he did admit that’s been listening to people and learning more of issues of importance to America.

“I’m rapidly acquiring that knowledge, listening to people and really finding a tremendous amount of frustration with the status quo, politics as usual, be it Republican or Democrat,” he said, Newsmax reported. “Our system was designed for the people. It wasn’t designed for professional politicians. I’m thinking very seriously, listening to people, and we’ll make a decision in a few months.”
