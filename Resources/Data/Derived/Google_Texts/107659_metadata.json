Everybody also agrees that it\u2019s not working as well as it should. So what\u2019s a fair way to evaluate its progress? One way is to compare its performance to commercial websites. Two smart writers on the right, Philip Klein and Megan McArdle, have made that case in the last few days. Here\u2019s Klein:\n\n\u2026 an HHS chart \u2026 shows system uptime now at 95.1 percent (excluding scheduled maintenance), which compares to 42.9 percent a month ago. But, the industry standard is for websites to be available for users 99.9 percent of the time. Anything below that is considered a failure and 95.1 percent is a disaster. A 2012 study by web monitoring firm Panopta that looked at the performance of 130 major retailers' websites from January to August 2012 found that the lowest uptime rate was 99.34 percent. \u2026 A 95.1 percent uptime means that over the course of a year, a website would be down for about 18 days. Alternatively, imagine what a disaster it would be for sales if, during the holiday shopping season, Amazon\u2019s website were down for about a day and a half, excluding scheduled maintenance.\n\nThe comparison to commercial websites is perfectly valid, particularly since President Obama used it all the time when promoting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s virtues. (And, for what it's worth, the site's performance seems to be getting closer to that mark. On Tuesday, the administration says, healthcare.gov handled 950,000 visitors without much queing, although it's still early for making definitive judgments.)\n\nBut the comparison to commercial websites should come with two very important caveats. One is an acknolwedgment of the huge, fundamental difference between what the two types of systems must do. Innovative companies like Amazon are constantly developing new, more efficient ways to sell books, clothing, and other goods. (Just check out those stories about the Amazon drones.) But they are still engaging consumers, producers and retailers in a series of relatively straightforward transactions. And they are using technology that, for the most part, has been around for a long time.\n\nHealthcare.gov, by contrast, must perform a whole series of complex transactions\u2014taking and verifying identity and income, determining eligibility for government programs or private insurance subsidies, calculating individualized insurance prices based on that data, presenting options for consumers to buy, notifying and paying insurers, and following up with consumers after the process is done. To do that, the system must communicate with multiple government agencies, at both the federal and state levels, as well as private insurers. Each one has its own information systems and, particularly when it comes to those state agencies, the technology is relatively antiquated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Everybody agrees that healthcare.gov is working much better than before.
