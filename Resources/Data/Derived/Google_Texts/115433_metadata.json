Each swimmer on this team has come up big for their schools, capturing a CCC title in one event or another along the way.\n\nAlthough only a sophomore, Southington\u2019s Olivia Fournier continues to show why she is one of the best swimmers in the state as she already holds four school records \u2014 three individual and one relay team \u2014 and set the Southington record in the 100 free and the 200 free this season (a record since 1987) alone, while helping the 400 free relay team break another.\n\nHaving earned all-conference again this season in the 50 free, 100 free and 400 free relay and finishing in the top 12 in Class LL in two events, Fournier has positioned herself for an even bigger season in the years to follow.\n\nHer teammate, Allison Schroeder, also had a tremendous season. Finishing her career as a four-time varsity letter winner, the Blue Knight took the CCC title in both the 200 individual medley and the 100 backstroke and was part of the 400 free relay team that took the CCC title and set the school record.\n\nSchroeder also became a state finalist in the 200 IM and the 100 backstroke after taking the conference titles. She is about to sign a letter of intent to continue her swimming career.\n\nBerlin\u2019s Olivia DeGroff is another mainstay on the All-Herald team with this being her fourth selection. A three-time All-State selection \u2014 this year in the 200 IM \u2014 and four-time all-conference swimmer, the Redcoats\u2019 captain earned 423 points for her team this season, earning herself all-conference in the IM and 100 breaststroke.\n\nA four-time scholar athlete to go along with her numerous accomplishments in the pool, DeGroff will continue her swim career at the Division I level at the University of Delaware next fall.\n\nPlainville rounds out this year\u2019s All-Herald team with the most swimmers on the list, with three, in Sydney McGough, Audrey Gediman and Lydia Weinberg.\n\nThis is McGough\u2019s third appearance on the All-Herald team, and like DeGroff, is a four-time all-conference member. One of the Blue Devils\u2019 captains this season, the Plainville senior earned All-CCC in the 100 freestyle and was part of the Plainville 200 medley relay team that also earned all-conference honors.\n\nGediman garnered All-CCC in the 500 freestyle this season, making it her second time making it on the all-conference list in as many years. She also swam her way into the state meets in her three years of swimming for the Blue Devils.\n\nWith a year still to go, Gediman could be poised for another big year in her final season.\n\nRounding out our list is Weinberg.\n\nDespite being a freshman, Weinberg proved to be a major contributor to the Plainville girls swim team.\n\nPart of the 200 medley relay team along with McGough, she earned individual conference honors for her performance in the 50 free this year. It would be safe to expect big things to come from Weinberg in her final three years in high school.\n\nBoth in and out of the pool, this year\u2019s area swimmers have had great seasons to help their teams place well in the conference and in states.\n\nDavid Glovach can be reached at (860) 801-5085 or\n\ndglovach@newbritainherald.com\n\nOn Twitter: @DavidGlovach", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Central Connecticut Communications", "description": "The All-Herald Girls Swim Team features some of the best swimmers in the region, and as was the case last year, this year\u2019s list features some familiar names with a few new ones as well.", "title": "2015 All-Herald Girls Swim Team: When this group enters pool, records guaranteed to be shattered", "url": "http://www.centralctcommunications.com/newbritainherald/article_a842d814-a6cc-11e5-8086-d33a793950e3.html", "image": {"width": 713, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/centralctcommunications.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/c1/9c16f0ce-a6cd-11e5-84fa-fbe1972824c2/5676272c7a34e.image.jpg?resize=713%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "The All-Herald Girls Swim Team features some of the best swimmers in the region, and as was the case last year, this year\u2019s list features some familiar names with a few new ones as well.", "fb": {"app_id": 401038356716937}, "keywords": "southington girls swimming,berlin girls swimming,plainville firls swimming,newbritainherald,sports", "news_keywords": "southington girls swimming,berlin girls swimming,plainville firls swimming,newbritainherald,sports"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31b9\"", "article_summary": "Part of the 200 medley relay team along with McGough, she earned individual conference honors for her performance in the 50 free this year.\nGediman garnered All-CCC in the 500 freestyle this season, making it her second time making it on the all-conference list in as many years.\nDespite being a freshman, Weinberg proved to be a major contributor to the Plainville girls swim team.\nPlainville rounds out this year\u2019s All-Herald team with the most swimmers on the list, with three, in Sydney McGough, Audrey Gediman and Lydia Weinberg.\nThis is McGough\u2019s third appearance on the All-Herald team, and like DeGroff, is a four-time all-conference member."}
