I\u2019m a landlord.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the grabby headline for this essay in The New York Times from Bert Stratton, who is, indeed, a landlord in Cleveland, as well as a blogger, a musician and author of the upcoming memoir \u201cDear Landlord.\u201d\n\n\n\nStratton starts by citing the work of another writer \u2014 Matthew Desmond, a Harvard sociology professor who moved into poor Milwaukee neighborhoods and wrote this year\u2019s hottest ethnographic tome about it: \u201cEvicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Stratton\u2019s essay:\n\n\n\nWhile working on the book, he kept a journal. He wrote, \u201cI feel dirty, collecting these stories and hardships like so many trophies.\u201d\n\n\n\nI collect stories and hardships, too \u2014 and rent. I\u2019m a landlord. Eviction notices \u2014 I buy them by the carton from Ohio Legal Blank. I\u2019ve probably evicted 100 people, two or three a year for 40 years. Two weeks ago I evicted a recovering, or not so recovering, drug addict. He was stealing from his wife, and she wanted him out, so I evicted him. When the locksmith changed the lock, I gave the wife but not the husband new keys.\n\n\n\nStratton\u2019s buildings are in Lakewood, with rents typically $490 to $630 month. They\u2019re not fancy, but units are clean and painted, he writes, while many tenants live paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\n\nHis first rule of being a landlord: \u201cA tenant can be late with her rent (and pay a $20 late fee), but she can\u2019t cause trouble in the building. In \u2018Evicted,\u2019 one of the landlord\u2019s sons says, \u2018We can\u2019t have police coming up in here.\u2019 Well, exactly.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe essay acknowledges there are indeed unscrupulous landlords. Stratton himself comes off as tough-minded but understanding.\n\n\n\nHe concludes, \u201cMy dad, who started the family landlord business, used to say, \u2018We are not a social services agency.\u2019 He was wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty great tease for the memoir to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterized\n\nEmpire magazine calls attention to some cool new posters for \u201cMiles Ahead,\u201d a Don Cheadle-directed biopic of jazz legend Miles Davis that screens at the Cleveland International Film Festival on Sunday, April 10, ahead of its national and global release.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about improvisation,\u201d the magazine says. \u201cSo ran Miles Davis\u2019 mantra, a philosophy that should run through Don Cheadle\u2019s biopic of the jazz legend, \u2018Miles Ahead.\u2019 These three new posters have an improvisational quality to them, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmpire notes that Cheadle\u2019s \u201csideways look at the innovative, experimental musical great takes an episodic approach to his life.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe film was shot in 2014 in Cincinnati. Here\u2019s the official trailer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn God they trust\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries, based in Barberton, is mentioned in this New York Times feature about Christians flocking to groups that help members pay medical bills.\n\n\n\nWhile so-called health care sharing ministries have been around for decades, \u201cinterest in them has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, largely because the law exempts members from the requirement to have health insurance or pay a yearly fine,\u201d The Times says.\n\n\n\nBecause they are not insurance companies, \u201csharing ministries provide no guarantee that members\u2019 medical debts will be paid; members are advised to trust that God will provide,\u201d according to the story. \u201cThe ministries say the payment system is helping Christians fulfill a biblical mandate to share one another\u2019s burdens.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGo mad\n\nThe Times says membership in sharing ministries has more than doubled over the last six years, to 535,000 from about 200,000, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. More participants live in Texas than in any other state, according to Samaritan and the two other largest ministries, Medi-Share, based in Florida, and Christian Healthcare Ministries.Under the terms of the federal health law, the newspaper notes, \u201conly members of ministries that have operated continuously since December 1999 are exempt from the requirement to have health insurance.\n\nNot a basketball fan?

And in this version of March Madness, there\u2019s a local player to root for.\n\n\n\nThe paper\u2019s \u201cBeer Madness 2016\u201d competition aims to settle \u201cheated regional rivalries\u201d among some of the country\u2019s best brewers.\n\n\n\nIn the Midwest region, Great Lakes Brewing Co.\u2019s Alberta Clipper Porter is matched up against the Lagunitas Undercover Investigation Shut-Down from Chicago.\n\n\n\nThe Post describes the Great Lakes beer this way: \u201c(7.5 percent ABV) Once only available at the Great Lakes brewpub, this porter, made with raspberries and bittersweet chocolate, is now an annual release.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Lagunitas beer gets this description: \u201c(9.3 percent ABV) This hoppy malt-forward beer doesn't hew to style, and it's named for the time Lagunitas was busted for allowing pot-smoking at parties at its California brewery.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou can vote online at the link above.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Bert Stratton, a Cleveland landlord/blogger/musician, writes in The New York Times about balancing business and humanity.
