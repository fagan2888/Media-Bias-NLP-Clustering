That law works like this: If Dunn had a reasonable fear that he was about to suffer \u201cgreat bodily harm,\u201d then he had a legal right to shoot Davis to death, rather than, for example, choosing to protect himself by driving away, even if Dunn knew that driving away would have protected him from harm.\n\nIf you think that sounds crazy, you haven\u2019t heard the half of it. Because the \u201cstand your ground\u201d law creates an affirmative defense for criminal defendants, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Dunn\u2019s claim that he had a reasonable fear he was about to suffer great bodily harm was false. Such laws, in effect, put the victim rather than the killer on trial, which is exactly what happened in this case.\n\nConsider how these laws work in the context of Dunn\u2019s actions. Dunn chose to create a confrontation with a group of four young males. He is a middle-aged computer programmer. A middle-aged man who chooses to start a verbal altercation with four teenage boys in a convenience store parking lot on a Friday night knows that he is running a non-trivial risk of suffering great bodily harm, or in non-technical terms, getting his ass kicked.\n\nBut because this is America, Dunn has a trump card: the nine-millimeter handgun in his glove compartment, with 10 bullets in the clip, which he has every legal right to bring to the confrontation he chose to start.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dunn created the confrontation, then made it deadly.
