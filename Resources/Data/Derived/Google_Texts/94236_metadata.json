It then progressed to methamphetamine, and then oxycodone and then, eventually, heroin, so I did the natural progression,\u201d he said.\n\nData from the ninth district medical examiner show heroin-related deaths have gone up every year in Orange County and Osceola counties, from 19 in 2011 to 101 in the first half of last year. The majority of deaths were in Orange County, from 14 in 2011 to 82 in the first half of last year. While the sheriff\u2019s office is focused on dismantling drug rings, doctors are focused on treatment the kind that helped Nickerson.\n\n\u201cApproximately 350 inmates inmates age any given time are in the jail that self-identify as heroin users and with numbers like this, we felt we needed to do something to help this group of individuals,\u201d said Dr. Robert Buck of Orange County Corrections.\n\nBuck and other officials consider the number low compared to the 2,179 heroin addicts who passed through the Orange County jail last year. Buck says fear of prosecution keeps them from getting treatment while there.\n\n\u201cWe cannot force that population to participate in programming, but our goal is to at least have a very aggressive educational component,\u201d added Cornita Riley, chief of the Orange County Corrections Department.\n\nShe and Buck hope to make treatment inside jail free and long-term, and to encourage more inmates to accept treatment. But other officials on the task force add that transitional treatment programs that include housing and drug availability will help prevent heroin overdoses and deaths.\n\nThe majority of heroin users who die of overdoses in Orange County are males between ages 25 and 35 years old.\n\n------\n\nRenata Sago is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
