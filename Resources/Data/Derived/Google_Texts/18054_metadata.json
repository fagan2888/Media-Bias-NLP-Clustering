Mike Conaway, R-Midland, and Lamesa Cotton Growers outgoing president Shawn Holladay on a farm bill question-and-answer panel at the meeting.\n\nHolladay pointed out producers may vary their insurance plan by different types of cropland.\n\n\u201cYou can insure your dryland and irrigated separately on any policy,\u201d he said.\n\nConaway noted 80 percent of the funds in the farm bill are actually used for nutrition programs such as food stamps.\n\nAlthough the new farm bill cuts food stamp spending by about 1 percent, the congressman said he would like to see more reform. He said about 10 percent of food stamp recipients are healthy adults with no dependents and should not rely indefinitely on government assistance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on food stamps without a work requirement, and that\u2019s a moral hazard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have hard times and the safety net should be there, but it should be a temporary fix \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be a permanent way of life.\u201d\n\nConaway said the number of U.S. food stamp recipients has increased from 23 million to 47 million in recent years, despite an economy that appears to be recovering.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why that\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate conversation to have.\u201d\n\nConaway also discussed strategies to bring more Republican control to Washington, D.C. Middle-of-the-road voters unhappy with the Affordable Care Act will help, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have a legitimate shot at taking the Senate back,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping the conversation on issues that are important to independents is going to be key.\u201d\n\nDarneille described Conaway as a friend of the cotton industry.\n\nHolladay also praised the congressman\u2019s efforts in agriculture and encouraged his fellow producers to stay politically active.\n\n\u201cThese partnerships are extremely important,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to be on board to get this going. We\u2019ve got a lot of good people in a lot of good spots.\u201d\n\njosephine.musico@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8796\n\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Region-Agriculture\n\nFollow Josie on Twitter\n\n@josiemusico", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, JOSIE MUSICO", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Panel talks farm bill at Lamesa Cotton Growers annual membership meeting Monday, March 10.", "title": "Farm bill panel talks crop insurance, food stamps", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2014-03-10/farm-bill-panel-talks-crop-insurance-food-stamps", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/13157740.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "LAMESA \u2014 Hello, crop insurance; goodbye, direct payments.That\u2019s what\u2019s in the new farm bill, panelists explained at the Lamesa Cotton Growers\u2019 annual membership meeting on Monday morning, March 10.While adjusting to those new insurance programs, it pays to do your research, National Cotton Council chairman Wally Darneille said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really important for crop producers to work with their insurance agents and know what questions to ask,\u201d he told a large group of farmers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e99\"", "article_summary": "Conaway noted 80 percent of the funds in the farm bill are actually used for nutrition programs such as food stamps.\nAlthough the new farm bill cuts food stamp spending by about 1 percent, the congressman said he would like to see more reform.\nDarneille accompanied U.S. Rep.
