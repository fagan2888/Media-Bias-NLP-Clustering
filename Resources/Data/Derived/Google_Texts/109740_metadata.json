You get, like, three days where you have to show up?,\u201d Bush said to Florida senator Marco Rubio, while commenting on his opponent\u2019s attendance record in Congress.\n\nBut if Senators did take a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever. Contrary to Bush\u2019s suggestion, there\u2019s actually very little difference between French and US working habits.\n\nFrench people work similar hours to Americans, according to OECD data. While the average French working week is 38.9 hours, the average US working week is fewer than three hours longer, at 41.6 hours\u2014so not quite the 16-hour gap that Bush suggested.\n\nMeanwhile, OECD data also show that France and the US achieve similar levels of productivity. France has an economic output of $64 per hour, compared to $67.40 per hour in the United States.\n\nBush\u2019s failure to fact-check has done little to enamor him to the French.\n\nHis comments led G\u00e9rard Araud, France\u2019s ambassador to the US, to tweet that Bush\u2019s comments were \u201cbombastic nonsense.\u201d\n\nHe later tweeted statistics to dispute Bush\u2019s point:\n\nThe French work an average of 39,6 hours a week compared to 39,2 for the Germans. https://t.co/22yUVpQbq7 \u2014 G\u00e9rard Araud (@GerardAraud) October 29, 2015\n\nAnd Politico reported that French journalist Laura Haim, from French TV channel Canal+, took up the dispute on Thursday, asking White House press secretary Josh Earnest if president Barack Obama had any comment in response to Bush\u2019s remarks.\n\nEarnest hadn\u2019t discussed the issue with the president, but said, \u201cIt certainly seems to be a quality of life that many French people have warmly embraced, as they should.\u201d\n\n(Top image via beboy/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Olivia Goldhill", "description": "If Senators took a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "If Senators took a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever.", "title": "What Would Happen If American Senators Worked Like the French?", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2015/11/what-would-happen-if-american-senators-worked-french/123317/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/02/110215paris.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/02/110215paris/open-graph.jpg", "description": "If Senators took a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever.", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Would Happen If American Senators Worked Like the French?"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-02T14:38:54Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/02/110215paris.jpg", "sailthru.title": "What Would Happen If American Senators Worked Like the French?", "keywords": "jeb bush, france, gop debates", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/02/110215paris/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "jeb-bush,france,channel-management->-promising-practices,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "If Senators took a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever."}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush managed to offend American senators and the French on Wednesday, Oct. 28, when he criticized the US Senate for its \u201cFrench\u201d work ethic.\n\u201cWhat is it, like a French work week?\nBut if Senators did take a few tips from the French work week, the political process would still run as smoothly (ahem) as ever.\nFrench people work similar hours to Americans, according to OECD data.\nWhile the average French working week is 38.9 hours, the average US working week is fewer than three hours longer, at 41.6 hours\u2014so not quite the 16-hour gap that Bush suggested."}
