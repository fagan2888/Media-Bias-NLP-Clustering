It's all on Reid and McConnell\n\nIt\u2019s now the Harry and Mitch show.\n\nAfter Senate Democratic leaders rejected a proposal Saturday by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to end the budget impasse, the burden to find a solution now falls squarely on Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 two shrewd tacticians who have a long, complicated and contentious personal and political history with each other.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRepublican senators, eager for a way out of a shutdown fight that has roiled their party\u2019s brand, reacted to the leadership discussions positively, believing that the two crafty dealmakers could concoct a proposal to reopen the government and avert the nation\u2019s first-ever default as soon as next week.\n\nReid, however, was notably more dour.\n\nWhen asked if he is confident he could reach a deal with McConnell, Reid told POLITICO: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Lawmakers arrive for budget showdown)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my best, I\u2019m not confident in anything in the way Republicans have acted,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said.\n\nMcConnell, along with his close ally Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), quietly met with Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) early Saturday to find a way out of the first possible default in U.S. history when the Treasury Department begins to run out of money Oct. 17. While senators said it was a positive discussion, how the impasse is resolved from here remains a major question going forward.\n\n\u201cVery pleasant\u201d was how Reid described the meeting.\n\n\u201cThey had a good talk this morning,\u201d said Schumer, who has had about a dozen Senate Republicans reach out to him in recent days pushing for a deal.\n\n\u201cWe had a good meeting,\u201d McConnell added.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: House takes back seat after W.H. rejects budget plan)\n\nMcConnell is widely viewed as being in a disadvantage in the talks. The GOP leader wants a way out of the politically damaging crisis, and Reid is not willing to give a whole lot.\n\nMcConnell, sources said, is eager to lock in lower-funding numbers at next year\u2019s $967-billion level after the automatic sequestration cuts take effect. That number is too low for Democrats, but sources familiar with the talks said they were willing to agree to a stop-gap spending bill until mid-January at the $986 billion level before the new round of sequestration cuts take effect. It\u2019s unclear whether McConnell would go for that.\n\nMoreover, Democrats want a long-term increase in the $16.7 trillion national debt ceiling \u2014 potentially through next year \u2014 something Republicans blocked in a 53-45 vote in the Senate on Saturday afternoon. They want something far longer than what Collins proposed, which was through the end of January.\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear whether Republicans will get anything out of Obamacare, even though GOP demands to gut the controversial law was the chief disagreement that spurred the first government shutdown in 17 years. Potentially, Republicans may get a two-year delay of the 2.3 percent medical device tax in the law, given the levy\u2019s unpopularity even among Democrats. Moreover, in recent days, Republicans have been asking for a requirement for income verification of Obamacare subsidies as part of a deal.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: House floor tactics spill into acrimony)\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether Democrats will accept those Obamacare demands, especially since they have drawn a hard-line against any negotiations and instead called for a \u201cclean\u201d increase to the national debt ceiling and extension of government funding.\n\nReid said Saturday that the fight over the health care law is no longer the issue for the GOP in the shutdown fight. The issue, he said, was \u201cto do anything they can do divert attention from the fools they\u2019ve made of themselves on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nReid said that he and McConnell would probably speak by phone before markets open Monday and during a rare Sunday session of the Senate.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They're up to bat as the crises continue.", "title": "It's all on Reid and McConnell", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/senate-democrats-susan-collins-proposal-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-98221.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/07/22/130722_harry_reid_mitch_mcconnell_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Susan Collins (159),Senate Democrats (401),Harry Reid (1804),Mitch McConnell (965),Senate (1876)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They're up to bat as the crises continue.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf59d\"", "article_summary": "When asked if he is confident he could reach a deal with McConnell, Reid told POLITICO: \u201cNo.\u201d( PHOTOS: Lawmakers arrive for budget showdown)\u201cI\u2019m just doing my best, I\u2019m not confident in anything in the way Republicans have acted,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said.\nReid said Saturday that the fight over the health care law is no longer the issue for the GOP in the shutdown fight.\n\u201cThey had a good talk this morning,\u201d said Schumer, who has had about a dozen Senate Republicans reach out to him in recent days pushing for a deal.\nThe GOP leader wants a way out of the politically damaging crisis, and Reid is not willing to give a whole lot.\nMcConnell, sources said, is eager to lock in lower-funding numbers at next year\u2019s $967-billion level after the automatic sequestration cuts take effect."}
