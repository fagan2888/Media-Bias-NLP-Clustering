JAKARTA—Global tech experts, social media gurus, Asian technopreneurs and executives from companies including Path, Samsung and Twitter are gathering in Jakarta to talk about the impact technology is having on business, culture and society.

It’s the first time Social Media Weeks is being hosted in Jakarta, the capital of a country that is quickly embracing new types of tech-related innovations and mobile applications.

Jakarta Gov. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama will on Wednesday deliver the keynote speech at the five-day event with a talk about a program that aims to improve communication between city residents and officials through technology.

Dozens of panels and discussions will follow, touching on topics such as the growth of the e-commerce industry, mobile banking, innovation and how to put technology to use for branding and marketing.

Many representatives of global tech firms will also be on hand to discuss their plans for Indonesia, whose 250 million increasingly plugged-in people provide a significant market for Internet companies.

Increased access to more affordable smartphones has allowed more of the population to get online – last year there were more than 38.3 million active smartphones users in Indonesia, compared to 27.4 million in 2013, data from Emarketer shows. And ways to harness the power of the mobile Internet will also be in the spotlight.

Social media week first started in New York City in 2009 and has spread to more than 20 cities around the world, including Mumbai and Johannesburg. This week’s event in Jakarta will coincide with similar events in Bangalore, Copenhagen and Milan.

Some of the big names to look out for include William Tunggaldjaja, the newly appointed country manager for Silicon Valley-based social media application Path; Anthony Tan, founder and CEO of taxi-hailing app GrabTaxi; Twitter’s head of business in Indonesia, Rick Mulia; and Andrew Darwis, founder Kaskus, Indonesia’s largest online forum.
