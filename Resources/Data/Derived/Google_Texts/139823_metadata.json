It began last fall with 53,000 children, and the goal is to boost that number this year to 70,000.\n\nSome pre-K classes are in public schools but many are run by religious groups and other community-based organizations under contract to the city. The latest proposal is aimed at increasing the participation of private religious schools, particularly the Orthodox Jewish schools that serve a growing portion of the city\u2019s population. A 2012 study by the UJA Federation of New York found that 40 percent of Jews in the city identified themselves as Orthodox up from 33 percent in 2002.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s administration announced last month that pre-K classes next year will be permitted to break in the middle of the day for \u201cnon-program\u201d activities such as prayer. Additionally, schools will be invited to operate six days a week in order to meet the minimum number of classroom hours.\n\nIt is similar to an arrangement at pre-K classes currently operating out of Roman Catholic schools.\n\nRocio Fidalgo, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, said 22 of the diocese\u2019s schools are participating now and 14 more have applied for next year. An optional half hour of religious instruction takes place at 8 a.m., with the regular school day starting at 8:30 a.m.\n\nBut a prayer break in the middle of the day is seen by civil libertarians as more problematic than a prayer before the regular school day starts. The midday break means schools have to provide a space for any kids who \u201copt out\u201d of the prayer and something for them to do.\n\nDonna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, called the break \u201can end run around the separation of church and state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have urged the city to audit programs that are sponsored by a religious group to ensure that the prohibition against turning these into religious programs is honored,\u201d Lieberman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "title": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "title": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/15/nycs_plan_for_prayer_break_in_pre_k_classes_raises_concerns/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/pre-k-expansion-religious-schools.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "title": "NYC\u2019s plan for prayer break in pre-K classes raises concerns", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/pre-k-expansion-religious-schools.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karen Matthews", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a93\"", "article_summary": "But a prayer break in the middle of the day is seen by civil libertarians as more problematic than a prayer before the regular school day starts.\nThe latest proposal is aimed at increasing the participation of private religious schools, particularly the Orthodox Jewish schools that serve a growing portion of the city\u2019s population.\nDe Blasio\u2019s administration announced last month that pre-K classes next year will be permitted to break in the middle of the day for \u201cnon-program\u201d activities such as prayer.\nThe midday break means schools have to provide a space for any kids who \u201copt out\u201d of the prayer and something for them to do.\nBut civil liberties groups are already objecting to the plan, which would take effect next fall, saying allowing a prayer break in a publicly funded classroom may violate the constitutional separation of church and state."}
