What happened \u2014 what was the origin of the tea party 5 years ago? It wasn\u2019t about bailouts,\u201d Kristol said.\n\n\u201cSure it was,\u201d Maher said.\n\n\u201cIt was not. It was about a mortgage bill. Then it was about Obamacare and then it was about the stimulus\u2014\u201d Kristol replied.\n\nMaher interjected, \u201cIt was about a black president. But let\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bulls\u2014-! That is total bulls\u2014-!\u201d Kristol said. \u201cYou think tens of millions of people, just out there, they just\u2014-even you don\u2019t believe that. You\u2019re just saying that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI totally believe that,\u201d Maher responded. \u201cIt happened a month after he took office. Suddenly white people were very upset about debt, even though [former President George W.] Bush had raised the debt way more than Obama had.\u201d\n\nKristol argued that the tea party was upset with Bush as well and they were \u201crebelling against the Republican establishment as well as the Democratic establishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a tea party then,\u201d Maher said, adding that members of the group were \u201csuddenly\u201d at town halls.\n\nJumping in, CNN political contributor Margaret Hoover said that the movement did start under Bush for fiscal reasons.\n\n\u201cRepublicans had been trying to get people \u2026 revved up to think fiscal issues were sexy for a really long time and finally they codified behind this mass movement to really rein in federal spending. That was a good thing,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Hoover added \u201cit got of the rails a little bit after 2010\u201d and noted that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, was \u201cnowhere near them.\u201d\n\nMaher pointed out that on one tea party website, they were not talking about debt, but rather impeaching Obama, Benghazi and Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI wonder if they ever really cared about the debt that much,\u201d Maher said.\n\nHoover pushed back saying the group had been \u201cco-opted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was co-opted by more organized forces that, frankly, had less and less to do with fiscal discipline and more and more to do with \u2026 whatever their pet issue was,\u201d Hoover said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Weekly Standard editor fires at Maher for saying the tea party was about Obama being black.", "title": "Kristol: Maher tea party charge 'bull'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/bill-kristol-bill-maher-tea-party-104123.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/01/140301_bill_kristol_maher_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Tea Party,Bill Kristol,Bill Maher", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Weekly Standard editor fires at Maher for saying the tea party was about Obama being black.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kristol: Maher tea party charge 'bull'The Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol fired back at liberal comic Bill Maher for saying the tea party was about President Barack Obama being black, calling the claim \u201ctotal bulls\u2014-.\u201dMaher began by slamming the tea party for condemning the bailouts during his HBO program \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d on Friday.\nKristol argued with Maher that the tea party was upset with Bush.\nWhat happened \u2014 what was the origin of the tea party 5 years ago?\nStory Continued BelowHowever, Kristol disagreed saying the bailouts happened in 2008 under the Bush administration and before the tea party, which he said was founded for different reasons.\nIt wasn\u2019t about bailouts,\u201d Kristol said."}
