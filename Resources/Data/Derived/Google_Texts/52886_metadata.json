Lee Terry in the November general election. Aupperle, an Omaha landscaper, had raised no money and done little campaigning.\n\nAshford, an Omaha attorney, is ineligible to seek re-election in the Nebraska Legislature because of term limits. In recent years he has successfully pushed for state reforms of Nebraska's prison system and services for troubled juveniles.\n\nTerry, a Republican, is an outspoken supporter of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and says he is working with the GOP to try to repeal the federal health care law.\n\nThe congressman issued a statement Tuesday night saying, \"Tonight, I am extremely humbled and grateful that the people of Omaha have continued to respond to my message of holding Barack Obama's Washington accountable. The reality is we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of fighting to do. ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced. The Keystone XL Pipeline needs to be approved. Washington needs to be held accountable. There is a lot to fight against, but there is also a lot to fight for and until we have the government we deserve, I will not stop fighting for the people of Omaha.\n\n\"I'd like to thank all of the people who have invested their time and energy in supporting my campaign - my family and staff, friends and volunteers - without this strong coalition, I would not be where I am today.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Nebraska state Senator Brad Ashford has won the Democratic primary race for the 2nd Congressional District in Omaha and will face incumbent Lee Terry in the general election.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Nebraska state Senator Brad Ashford has won the Democratic primary race for the 2nd Congressional District in Omaha and will face incumbent Lee Terry in the general election.", "title": "Ashford To Face Terry In District Two", "url": "http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Ashford-Wins-Democratic-Nomination-in-District-2-259160711.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8A1/C7D/8A1C7D5CDA8E440EB489223863C72FB5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/870/18A/87018AA1DD00462B894B48861C52CB24.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wowt.com", "description": "Nebraska state Senator Brad Ashford has won the Democratic primary race for the 2nd Congressional District in Omaha and will face incumbent Lee Terry in the general election.", "title": "Ashford To Face Terry In District Two", "url": "http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Ashford-Wins-Democratic-Nomination-in-District-2-259160711.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/primary-house-320.jpg", "creator": "@WOWT6News", "site": "@WOWT6News", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Ashford To Face Terry In District Two", "google-site-verification": "SWTXzu1PvJJvMCaMGIKj2JgtijVl40vJzTeewf6EEKk", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ashford To Face Terry In"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9cb\"", "article_summary": "Ashford easily defeated fellow Democrat Mark Aupperle on Tuesday and will face eight-term incumbent U.S. Rep.
