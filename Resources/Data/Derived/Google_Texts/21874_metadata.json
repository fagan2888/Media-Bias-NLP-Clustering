I hate to quote Charlie Sheen, but in this case, Donald Trump is winning. You could tell. There\u2019s no protesters at Rubio events. there\u2019s no one trying to interrupt Cruz events. No one even knows Kasich\u2019s name. Donald Trump is getting this incredible attack because he\u2019s winning. He\u2019s bothering the left, under their skin, and they know he\u2019s the one that could beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think it\u2019s very much like Ronald Reagan. I was the first commentator in the country who compared Trump to Reagan. I think the reaction is exactly the same, Clayton. I was there. I was at Columbia University, the center of the liberal universe, from 1980 to \u201983 when Reagan was running in and then elected president. The response of the kids on campus and professors, exactly Trump today. They\u2019re scared to death, We are winning, We\u2019re taking back the agenda. We\u2019re not punching bags anymore. We\u2019re actually punching back. And that\u2019s a good thing because I don\u2019t want to be a punching bag. It\u2019s been 7.5 years under Barack Obama where the Republican party\u2019s been a punching bag under John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, and even under Paul Ryan. I\u2019m proud that Donald Trump is hitting back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wayne Allyn Root: Trump Is Punching Back and Winning", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Wayne Allyn Root: Trump Is Punching Back and Winning", "title": "Wayne Allyn Root: Trump Is Punching Back and Winning - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/wayne.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/13/wayne-allyn-root-trump-is-punching-back-and-winning/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wayne Allyn Root: Trump Is Punching Back and Winning", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/wayne.jpg", "title": "Wayne Allyn Root: Trump Is Punching Back and Winning - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Wayne Allyn Root,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Wayne Allyn Root", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Wayne Allyn Root", "published_time": "2016-03-13T08:42:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s winning.\nI hate to quote Charlie Sheen, but in this case, Donald Trump is winning.\nDonald Trump is getting this incredible attack because he\u2019s winning.\nI\u2019m proud that Donald Trump is hitting back.\u201d\nI was the first commentator in the country who compared Trump to Reagan."}
