Stiffer fines would have been levied if Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota were a for-profit insurance company. But fines come out of the surplus of North Dakota Blues, a non-profit owned by policyholders.\n\n\u201cMy department will be closely monitoring the company so changes are made quickly and consumers are treated fairly going forward,\u201d said Adam Hamm, North Dakota\u2019s insurance commissioner.\n\nThe violations were documented in a market conduct examination for the period March 5, 2010, through May 31, 2013, a time span that included the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the federal health care reform law.\n\nDuring that period, Paul von Ebers was the insurer\u2019s top executive. He was fired last May, when Blue Cross Blue Shield suffered significant losses for a variety of reasons, and was replaced by Tim Huckle.\n\n\u201cThe audit timeframe represents what has been a period of change and uncertainty for the health coverage industry,\u201d Andrea Dineen, a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIn the best interest of our members, BCBSND accepts the findings and will continue to move forward with corrective action plans addressing issues identified by the North Dakota Insurance Department, many of which are already under way.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the findings, state insurance regulators now will require quarterly monitoring reports from Blue Cross Blue Shield to ensure compliance and to flag any problems early, Hamm said.\n\nThe scope and severity of problems and lack of cooperation in providing some information sought by regulators reflect a \u201ccultural breakdown\u201d within the company during the period of the examination, Hamm said.\n\nAmong the violations, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota:\n\nNeglected to determine whether some members\u2019 dependents under the age of 26 could get better coverage under a parent\u2019s group insurance plan than their own coverage, as required by law.\n\nImproperly denied coverage to dependents under the age of 19. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance could not be denied for pre-existing conditions. The denials were found in every one of 113 cases examined.\n\nIn marketing life insurance offered by an affiliated company, Lincoln Mutual Life Insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield failed in 6 percent of cases examined to provide an advertised 10-percent premium discount for two years. The discounts not given ranged from $7.30 to $2,883 for 21 of 1,200 groups.\n\nA sample of 82 cases examined to determine if authorization of mental health and substance abuse benefits found 9 claims were wrongfully denied coverage, a failure rate of 11 percent.\n\nThe Blues have agreed to provide coverage on those claims, and to establish an internal auditing program to ensure future compliance in handling mental health and substance abuse claims.\n\nFor more on the story read Friday\u2019s Forum.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Insurance,Health insurance,adam hamm,Health care", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Springer", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota agreed today to pay fines totaling $60,000 for \u201csystemic\u201d violations uncovered in an examination by insurance regulators. \r\n\r\nThe violations involved handling of claims, including health insurance coverage, mental health and substance abuse treatm...", "title": "ND insurance regulators fine Blue Cross Blue Shield $60,000 for...", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/content/nd-insurance-regulators-fine-blue-cross-blue-shield-60000-violations", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/all/themes/inforum_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota agreed today to pay fines totaling $60,000 for \u201csystemic\u201d violations uncovered in an examination by insurance regulators. \r\n\r\nThe violations involved handling of claims, including health insurance coverage, mental health and substance abuse treatm...", "title": "ND insurance regulators fine Blue Cross Blue Shield $60,000 for...", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/content/nd-insurance-regulators-fine-blue-cross-blue-shield-60000-violations", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/all/themes/inforum_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Insurance,Health insurance,adam hamm,Health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Insurance,Health insurance,adam hamm,Health care", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T12:33:22-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota agreed today to pay fines totaling $60,000 for \u201csystemic\u201d violations uncovered in an examination by insurance..."}, "article_summary": "He was fired last May, when Blue Cross Blue Shield suffered significant losses for a variety of reasons, and was replaced by Tim Huckle.\nFARGO \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota agreed today to pay fines totaling $60,000 for \u201csystemic\u201d violations uncovered in an examination by insurance regulators.\nStiffer fines would have been levied if Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota were a for-profit insurance company.\nIn marketing life insurance offered by an affiliated company, Lincoln Mutual Life Insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield failed in 6 percent of cases examined to provide an advertised 10-percent premium discount for two years.\n\u201cThe audit timeframe represents what has been a period of change and uncertainty for the health coverage industry,\u201d Andrea Dineen, a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokeswoman, said in a statement."}
