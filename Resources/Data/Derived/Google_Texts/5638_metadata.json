Christin Goff has a son with autism who attends Renzulli.\n\n\"What they're doing is they're sending a message that parents don't matter, students don't matter and the gifted and talented do not matter,\" Goff said.\n\nAs the district explains the decision, enrollment is up at Global Communications Academy, and it\u2019s down at Renzulli. So the district is shuffling a preschool currently housed at Global \u2013 the Hartford Pre-Kindergarten Magnet School \u2013 to Renzulli\u2019s current building on Cornwall Street. Renzulli will be a separate school housed at Rawson down the street.\n\nBudget problems are also a factor. Moving to Rawson will allow Renzulli to keep all its teachers. If Renzulli had stayed put, some teachers would have been laid-off, according to Barton.\n\nSome services will be shared, but it remains unclear if Renzulli\u2019s custodians will transfer to Rawson. Barton said that\u2019s a facilities decision that will be made by that department.\n\nCommunication Woes\n\nThe decision to move the school might make sense for the district as a whole, but how Hartford came to that decision \u2013 and how that choice was communicated \u2013 is a problem for State Rep. Matt Ritter, who represents parents in that community.\n\nParents learned of the move through a flyer sent home in their children\u2019s backpacks, a method that Ritter said would be acceptable it they were changing something minor, but not a school moving.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to move a school\u2026 you need to engage people,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cCommunication is so important in every facet of life, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with someone\u2019s children. I don\u2019t like how it was dropped on people.\u201d\n\nThe district is now seeking parent input, but some parents said it\u2019s too late. When the new superintendent, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, was hired last year, she addressed concerns over community engagement in past administrations.\n\n\"I've heard many questions about [parent engagement] in this community and we wanted to make sure that we were explicit in studying the strengths and needs in that area as well,\" Narvaez said.\n\nHartford parents have a choice to send their kids to a number of different schools, but parents weren\u2019t told about the Renzulli decision until after the choice deadline. This means that it\u2019s too late to place their kids in another school, unless it\u2019s the school in their neighborhood.\n\nBarton, from the district, said the timing of the decision \u201cis unfortunate.\u201d\n\nRenzulli parent Shonta Browdy said the district had talked about moving Renzulli last year, but parents were against it. It\u2019s only been in its current building for a year.\n\nThe decision \u201cdidn\u2019t go through any vote,\u201d Browdy said. The School Governance Council was \u201ccreated just for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting furniture in that was purchased last year,\u201d Browdy said. \u201cThis is the opposite of what\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d\n\nSigns reading \u201cSave Renzulli\u201d can be found throughout the school, and parents have started a Facebook page and Twitter hashtag around this effort.\n\nBarton said he stands by the district\u2019s decision to act independently.\n\n\"Change is difficult, and we're addressing the needs of a district with some 20,000 students,\u201d he said.\n\nA Parent's Concern\n\nBut parent Christin Goff said that moving her son so late in the game could violate his right to receive appropriate special education services under federal law.\n\nHer son thrives at Renzulli\u2019s current location, because it\u2019s quiet. She\u2019s worried that being in a larger school, with more kids and more distractions, it could make it difficult for him to concentrate because of his autism.\n\nAs a student receiving special education services, Goff\u2019s son has an individualized education plan, or IEP, which details services he\u2019s supposed to receive along with various goals. Federal law requires a district to discuss with parents before a change of placement is made, such as if the district wants to move the student to another school.\n\nGoff said she found out about the school moving two days after meeting with her son\u2019s IEP team.\n\nBarton said that special education services will not be altered, only the location of the services will change.\n\nAndrew Feinstein, a special education attorney, said that a change of location could be problematic if Rawson\u2019s environment makes it difficult for Goff\u2019s son to learn.\n\n\u201cIf it is a change from an appropriate environment to an inappropriate one, it is a change in placement,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nThere are roughly 90 kids at Renzulli this year, and only two have IEPs. Last year there were about 130 total students.\n\nRenzulli and Rawson teachers have also expressed frustration over their lack of involvement. Parents remain worried that this is the beginning of the end for Renzulli, and that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it\u2019s assimilated into Rawson.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "The Renzulli School for the Gifted has been touted as a success story in Hartford, but now the city is moving the school to another location.
