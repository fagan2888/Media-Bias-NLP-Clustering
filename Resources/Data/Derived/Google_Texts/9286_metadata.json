File photo.\n\n(Indianapolis, Ind.) \u2013 Nearly 61,000 Hoosiers who have insurance through the Healthy Indiana Plan are keeping their benefits in 2015.\n\nGovernor Mike Pence said Monday that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services approved the renewal last week. The governor\u2019s office was notified Friday evening.\n\nHIP \u2013 which Pence says has proven itself since it first began in 2007 \u2013 is available for adults who are under 100 percent of federal poverty level but may not otherwise qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cSince this marks the third time the Obama Administration has approved the Healthy Indiana Plan in its current form, we hope that this decision signals an openness by this Administration to move forward with approval of HIP 2.0, which is built on the same principles of personal responsibility and consumer choice,\u201d said Pence.\n\nThe decision does not affect Pence\u2019s proposed expansion of the program called HIP 2.0, a system that asks users to pay some of their own money into. For that to happen, the federal government must approve a waiver allowing the state to use HIP 2.0 as an alternative to an expanded Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act. If so, HIP 2.0 would cover another 350,000 uninsured Hoosiers.\n\nPence\u2019s staff and federal officials have been discussing HIP 2.0 since the state submitted the plan for approval last July. Last month, the governor met with President Barack Obama and Heath and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell face-to-face.\n\nThe proposed new version of HIP would provide health coverage to non-disabled adults until 138 percent of federal poverty level.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nHundreds of Thousands of Hoosiers Waiting for Green Light on \u201cHIP 2.0\u2033\n\nPence Reveals Details Of HIP 2.0 Proposal\n\nHIP At Capacity; Enrollment Halted\n\nGovernor Sends HIP Waiver Request To DHHS", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 61,000 Hoosiers who have insurance through the Healthy Indiana Plan are keeping their benefits in 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "EagleCountryOnline.com", "description": "Nearly 61,000 Hoosiers who have insurance through the Healthy Indiana Plan are keeping their benefits in 2015.", "title": "Federal Gov't Renews Healthy Indiana Plan Through 2015 - EagleCountryOnline.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "https://eaglecountryonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hip-healthy-indiana-plan-logo.jpg", "height": 225}, "url": "http://eaglecountryonline.com/local-article/federal-govt-renews-healthy-indiana-plan-2015/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=643339482", "fb": {"admins": 20701446, "app_id": 224202101261849}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mike.perleberg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5bc\"", "article_summary": "Federal Gov\u2019t Renews Healthy Indiana Plan Through 2015By Mike PerlebergIndiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\u2013 Nearly 61,000 Hoosiers who have insurance through the Healthy Indiana Plan are keeping their benefits in 2015.\nPence\u2019s staff and federal officials have been discussing HIP 2.0 since the state submitted the plan for approval last July.\nRELATED STORIES:Hundreds of Thousands of Hoosiers Waiting for Green Light on \u201cHIP 2.0\u2033Pence Reveals Details Of HIP 2.0 ProposalHIP At Capacity; Enrollment HaltedGovernor Sends HIP Waiver Request To DHHS\nGovernor Mike Pence said Monday that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services approved the renewal last week."}
