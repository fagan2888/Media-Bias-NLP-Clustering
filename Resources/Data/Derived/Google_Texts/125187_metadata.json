If they lose here, Hadi \u2014 the man the U.S. had hoped would stabilize the chaotic nation and fight al-Qaida\u2019s powerful branch \u2014 likely will fall, plunging Yemen into a civil war.\n\nIn his first speech since fleeing Sanaa, Hadi on Saturday denounced the rebel takeover as \u201ca coup against constitutional legitimacy\u201d and declared Aden the country\u2019s \u201ctemporary capital.\u201d\n\nThe city is visibly expecting assault, whether from the forces of Hadi\u2019s rival, ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has allied himself with the Shite rebels, or from al-Qaida militants. Army and police forces loyal to Hadi and their allied militiamen patrol Aden\u2019s streets and man checkpoints at key locations. Tanks guard roads leading to the city and children are largely staying home from school.\n\n\u201cThere are great fears that plans are underway for Aden to meet the same fate as Sanaa,\u201d Nayef al-Bakry, Aden\u2019s deputy governor, told The Associated Press. Referring to Saleh and the Shiite rebels, \u201cthey want to extend their reach on both the ground and on the coast.\u201d\n\nEarly this week, Hadi\u2019s forces fended off an attempt by police commandos loyal to Saleh to capture the airport. But there are still two army units loyal to Saleh in the city. And on Sunday, the Shiite rebels, backed by forces loyal to Saleh, seized Yemen\u2019s third largest city, Taiz, 140 kilometers (85 miles) to the northwest of Aden. Officials here fear it is a prelude to an attack on Aden.\n\nThe takeover of Taiz, known as the \u201cgateway to the south,\u201d followed the arrival there two days ago of a column of 20 armored fighting vehicles and 30 truckloads of Shiite rebel fighters and pro-Saleh troops.\n\nEqually worrying, al-Qaida militants on Friday took a city on Aden\u2019s doorstep, al-Houta, capital of neighboring Lahj province. Al-Qaida fighters now have positions only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Aden. Hadi on Saturday accused Saleh\u2019s forces, which had held al-Houta, of intentionally surrendering it to the militants to create even more chaos, and he sent a force led by his defense minister, Maj.-Gen. Mahmoud al-Subaihi, to retake the city.\n\nThe drama in the south is just one part of Yemen\u2019s turmoil.\n\nAround the country, al-Qaida militants have been battling the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and in some places Sunni tribesman have allied with the militants. A new alarming sign came Friday when suicide bombers hit two mosques in Sanaa controlled by the Houthis, killing more than 130 people in a devastating attack that may signal the emergence of a new branch of the Islamic State group, the extremists who are seeking to supplant al-Qaida region-wide as the flagship for Islamic militants.\n\nHadi fled Sanaa last month after escaping house arrest under the Houthis, who took over the capital in September. Aden is Yemen\u2019s second most important city and the country\u2019s economic hub, and as long as Hadi was here he could reasonably claim to still be president. Moreover, he chose Aden because as a southerner he has considerable support in the region.\n\nAden has been at the center of trade in the Indian Ocean for centuries. Its populace has long seen itself as more sophisticated and distinct from mountainous, tribal, inward-facing Sanaa.\n\nAden was the capital of an independent South Yemen for decades until unification in 1990. Today, secessionist sentiment remains strong \u2014 many pro-Hadi militiamen in the streets wave the red, white, black and blue flags of the former South Yemen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "title": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "title": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/aden_refuge_of_yemens_president_and_target_of_his_enemies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-yemen-presidents-refuge.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "title": "Aden: Refuge of Yemen\u2019s president and target of his enemies", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-yemen-presidents-refuge.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hamza Hendawi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b93\"", "article_summary": "And on Sunday, the Shiite rebels, backed by forces loyal to Saleh, seized Yemen\u2019s third largest city, Taiz, 140 kilometers (85 miles) to the northwest of Aden.\nDriven out of the capital, Sanaa, by Shiite rebels who have taken over much of the north, President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the remains of his government have made Aden their provisional capital.\nAden is Yemen\u2019s second most important city and the country\u2019s economic hub, and as long as Hadi was here he could reasonably claim to still be president.\nAround the country, al-Qaida militants have been battling the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and in some places Sunni tribesman have allied with the militants.\nArmy and police forces loyal to Hadi and their allied militiamen patrol Aden\u2019s streets and man checkpoints at key locations."}
