It was her plan that he passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, though, that in terms of fundamentally, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be as biased against the American economy. But it doesn\u2019t make a difference. There are other things she\u2019d do more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS scandal is a piker next to what Hillary would do,\u201d added Morris.\n\nWhat do YOU think? Sound off on Clinton machine\u2019s reputation for ruthlessness in today\u2019s WND poll!\n\nMorris pointed to the case of Raymond McGovern, a retired CIA officer turned political activist who served the agency from 1963 to 1990. In the 1980s, McGovern chaired the White House\u2019s National Intelligence Estimates and prepared the President\u2019s Daily Brief.\n\nMcGovern was arrested during a Hillary Clinton speech on Feb. 16, 2011, at George Washington University after he stood silently with his back turned to protest U.S. military action overseas during the then-Secretary of State\u2019s address.\n\nAccording to reports, McGovern protested passively but university cops put him in a headlock and dragged him out of the auditorium by force with arrest photos showing some bruising. There were accusations the university police were being directed by Clinton\u2019s security detail.\n\nMorris said \u201cHillary put him on a seven-month investigation into his loyalty and then got him on the BOLO list, which is \u2026 watch out with this guy, approach with caution.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt screwed up his life for a year. He didn\u2019t even know he was on it (the list). But every place he\u2019d go he would encounter the effects of it. So he went to a citizens group, they sued with an FOI (Freedom of Information request). They found out he was on this watch list and they got him removed by judicial order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd all this guy did to offend Mrs. Clinton was to stand up and turn his back on her during the speech. I would never turn my back on Hillary for a minute.\u201d\n\nMorris referenced the title of his latest book, \u201cPOWER GRAB: Obama\u2019s Dangerous Plan for a One Party Nation,\u201d to attack Clinton.\n\n\u201cHillary, while she disagrees with certain aspects of Obama\u2019s program, she\u2019s more of a hawk and I believe she shares more of a she has more of a belief in the free enterprise system, when it comes to power grab and the permanent majority, Hillary is way ahead of Obama.\u201d\n\nMorris was a political adviser to the Clinton White House and served as campaign manager for Bill Clinton\u2019s successful 1996 presidential re-election bid. He was seen as the architect of Clinton\u2019s landslide victory.\n\nClinton\u2019s then communications director George Stephanopoulos said of Morris, \u201cOver the course of the first nine months of 1995, no single person had more power over the president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "In a radio interview Sunday, former Bill Clinton strategist turned Republican adviser Dick Morris warned Hillary Clinton is \u201ctotally Nixonian and paranoid.\u201d Speaking on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio\u201d on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer, Morris cautioned the IRS scandal under President Obama will seem like child\u2019s play \u201cnext to what Hillary would do.\u201d \u201cI [\u2026]", "title": "Dick Morris sounds alarm on \u2018Nixonian and paranoid\u2019 Hillary", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/10/dick-morris-hillary-totally-nixonian-and-paranoid/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2013/05/t1larg.hillary-clinton-smerk.t1larg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ce6\"", "article_summary": "It was her plan that he passed.\u201d\u201cI think, though, that in terms of fundamentally, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be as biased against the American economy.\nThere are other things she\u2019d do more.\u201d\u201cThe IRS scandal is a piker next to what Hillary would do,\u201d added Morris.\n\u201cHillary is totally Nixonian and paranoid,\u201d Morris told Klein.\nMorris pointed to the case of Raymond McGovern, a retired CIA officer turned political activist who served the agency from 1963 to 1990.\nIn a radio interview Sunday, former Bill Clinton strategist turned Republican adviser Dick Morris warned Hillary Clinton is \u201ctotally Nixonian and paranoid.\u201dSpeaking on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio\u201d on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer, Morris cautioned the IRS scandal under President Obama will seem like child\u2019s play \u201cnext to what Hillary would do.\u201d\u201cI would never turn my back on Hillary for a minute,\u201d Morris warned."}
