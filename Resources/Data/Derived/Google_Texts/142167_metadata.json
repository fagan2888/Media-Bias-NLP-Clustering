Doctors determined the cancer has already spread into his liver. Documents show the hospital recommended him to see a specialist.\n\nClifford delivered the paperwork to his doctor at the Albuquerque VA hospital.\n\n\u201cThey made copies of it,\u201d Clifford said.\n\nBut days later, he still hasn't received a phone call or an appointment.\n\nHis wife Vickie said he got on the phone right away.\n\n\u201cThat's all he did yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the day before that. He was just calling, calling, calling.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you get an answering machine,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cOther times, you get a long ringing where nobody answers.\u201d\n\nFor two weeks, he said he couldn't get an appointment with an oncologist.\n\nThe experience is also troubling to other veterans. Three months ago, the New Mexico VA director said he wanted to see the problem of long wait times go away.\n\nAction 7 News asked to talk to the VA director on camera, but instead, received a statement. It says in part, \"Because oncology is so urgent, we squeeze patients in as early as their condition warrants.\"\n\nThree weeks after his diagnosis, Clifford finally has an appointment. However, it\u2019s not until July.\n\n\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said Vickie, Kummerer's wife, sitting beside him in their Rio Rancho home.\n\n\u201cThis is cancer,\" she said.\n\nKummerer hopes an oncologist can finally calm his fears.", "article_metadata": {"category": "New Mexico News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 27 Jun 2015 22:51:42 MDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "KOAT", "description": "Months after the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Healthcare System promised changes in how it schedules veterans for medical appointments, Action 7 News is learning some are still waiting for care.", "title": "Veteran still waiting for medical appointment for fast-spreading cancer", "url": "http://www.koat.com/news/veteran-still-waiting-for-medical-appointment-for-fastspreading-cancer/33814758", "image": "http://www.koat.com/image/view/-/9297122/highRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/yvgfhu/-/site-Facebook-logo---jpg-for-Facebook-like-recommend.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.koat.com/news/veteran-still-waiting-for-medical-appointment-for-fastspreading-cancer/33814758", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "koat://content/article/33814758", "iphone": "koat://content/article/33814758", "googleplay": "koat://content/article/33814758"}, "name": {"ipad": "koat", "iphone": "koat", "googleplay": "koat"}, "id": {"ipad": 505246892, "iphone": 505246892, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.koat"}}, "site": "@KOATLiveUpdates", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "koat://content/article/33814758", "app_name": "koat", "package": "com.hearst.android.koat"}, "ios": {"url": "koat://content/article/33814758", "app_store_id": 505246892, "app_name": "koat"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 141082827976}, "keywords": "veteran, va, hospital, cancer", "google-site-verification": "UP7Vu_zgjLycilR22TycHT_yNOXa0R6ziN6WRB9F3rw", "news_keywords": "veteran, va, hospital, cancer", "description": "Months after the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Healthcare System promised changes in how it schedules veterans for medical appointments, Action 7 News is learning some are still waiting for care."}, "article_summary": "Months after the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Healthcare System promised changes in how it schedules veterans for medical appointments, Action 7 News is learning some are still waiting for care.\nThree months ago, the New Mexico VA director said he wanted to see the problem of long wait times go away.\nHis wife Vickie said he got on the phone right away.\nClifford Kummerer of Rio Rancho learned he had cancer a few weeks ago.\n\u201cOther times, you get a long ringing where nobody answers.\u201dFor two weeks, he said he couldn't get an appointment with an oncologist."}
