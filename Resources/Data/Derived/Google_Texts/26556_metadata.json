This image on his grandmother's cell phone shows the boy the day he graduated from kindergarten. Christine Elmore/Staff\n\nDerotha Jones grew uncomfortable Saturday afternoon as tears began to build.\n\nThe Charleston grandmother doesn't like to cry. She'd much rather stay strong, she said, for the sake of her family.\n\nBut a gun battle that sent a bullet into her 5-year-old grandson's back Friday night, steps away from her front door, had her shaken to the core.\n\n\u201cHe didn't even cry,\u201d Jones said, her voice falling to a whisper. \u201cHe said, 'Granny, please help me. Please hold me.\u201d\n\nThe boy, whom Jones identified as Tyreik Gadsden, of North Charleston, was visiting with his grandmother Friday night at her home at the Wraggborough Homes housing project at the intersection of Mary and America streets on Charleston's East Side.\n\nThe pair walked out of the woman's home shortly before 9 p.m., having planned to spend the night with another relative who was preparing for a birthday party scheduled for the following day, Jones said.\n\nThey only made it a few steps before two men ran past them from around a corner in an apparent shootout, Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe walked into a gunfight. By the time I thought to shield my grandson, he was already hit. ... I seen blood in his shirt and a bullet wound in his (expletive) back. I just started yelling, 'Somebody done shot my grandson,'\u201d she said.\n\nThe child was seriously injured in the incident, Charleston police said.\n\nHe survived two surgeries at Medical University Hospital, Jones said, including doctors patching fluid that was leaking from his spine.\n\nA second person, a 20-year-old man, also took a bullet to his left leg, police said. That person has since been released from the hospital.\n\nPolice cordoned off a section of the community's Wraggborough Homes housing project with yellow crime scene tape and combed the area well into the night. A suspect, however, has not been identified.\n\nCharleston police spokesman Charles Francis confirmed that Jones reported seeing two men run from the scene, but said investigators are only searching for one gunman.\n\nIn a statement, Police Chief Greg Mullen referred to the shooting as \u201canother senseless tragedy with an innocent victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need all members of the community to assist us in quickly locating this violent criminal, who seriously injured a 5-year-old child,\u201d he said. \u201cThis act clearly demonstrates their lack of regard for the safety of this child.\u201d\n\nThe chief said it is important to identify and apprehend the shooter quickly, before he or she can harm someone else. \u201cAdditional patrol officers and detectives are working this case to bring it to a quick resolution,\u201d Mullen said.\n\nJones said she could only hope that a surveillance camera that keeps watch over the community's grounds caught a glimpse of the shooters. She expressed frustration, however, that officers who patrol the area weren't able to stop the men before they reached her doorstep.\n\n\u201cAre we not safe here,\u201d she asked, her gaze fixed on a pair of officers in the distance. \u201cAre we not safe in the projects?\u201d\n\nAnyone with information about the case can call the lead detective, Richard Holmes, at 607-6787, or call Crime Stoppers at 554-1111.\n\nTipsters can also text information to Crime Stoppers at 274637, starting the message with TIPCSL.\n\nDavid MacDougall contributed to this report.\n\nReach Christina Elmore at 937-5908 or at Twitter.com/celmorePC.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Earlier versions of this story had an incorrect spelling of Tyreik Gadsden's name.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Grandmother of 5-year-old wounded in shooting: We walked into a gunfight., FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston,crime,East Side,Greg Mullen,shooting", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Derotha Jones grew uncomfortable Saturday afternoon as tears began to build.", "title": "Grandmother of 5-year-old wounded in shooting: We walked into a gunfight.", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529625/grandmother-of-5-year-old-wounded-in-shooting-we-walked-into-a-gunfight", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529625/AR/0/AR-150529625.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529625/AR/0/AR-150529625.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Derotha Jones grew uncomfortable Saturday afternoon as tears began to build.", "title": "Grandmother of 5-year-old wounded in shooting: We walked into a gunfight.", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC16/150529625/AR/0/AR-150529625.jpg?201505232117", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529625}}, "keywords": "Grandmother of 5-year-old wounded in shooting: We walked into a gunfight. , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston,crime,East Side,Greg Mullen,shooting", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T08:48:08Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-23T21:17:00Z", "author": "Christina Elmore"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Derotha Jones grew uncomfortable Saturday afternoon as tears began to build."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2b2\"", "article_summary": "Gunfire that erupted Friday night on Charleston's East Side resulted in a 5-year-old boy being rushed to Medical University Hospital with a bullet wound.\nBut a gun battle that sent a bullet into her 5-year-old grandson's back Friday night, steps away from her front door, had her shaken to the core.\nShe expressed frustration, however, that officers who patrol the area weren't able to stop the men before they reached her doorstep.\nHe survived two surgeries at Medical University Hospital, Jones said, including doctors patching fluid that was leaking from his spine.\nThis image on his grandmother's cell phone shows the boy the day he graduated from kindergarten."}
