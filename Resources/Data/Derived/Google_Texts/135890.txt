The Senate has let partisan posturing get in the way of results. Mark Begich is in Senate leadership and helps set the Senate's agenda, yet he hasn't made Alaska's priorities the Senate's priorities. He's only passed two bills -- and one of them was to rename a building. He wants an A for effort, but he deserves an F for results. Leadership is about bringing people together to actually get real results for Alaska. That's what my career has been about, and it's what I'll do in the Senate.
