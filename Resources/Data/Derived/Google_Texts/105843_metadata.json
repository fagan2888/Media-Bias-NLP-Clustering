Since many adjunct professors teach enough classes to meet that bar, college administrators must choose between paying extra healthcare costs or cutting back adjunct work hours.\n\nFor many universities\u2013both public and private\u2013the decision is an easy one: punish the adjuncts.\n\n\u201cAm I saying it\u2019s the right thing to do? No,\u201d said Robert Conlon, senior vice president at Sibson Consulting, a firm that advises colleges on employment decisions, in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. \u201cBut is it the logical thing to do? Yes.\u201d\n\nSome 48 percent of universities\u2013including 49 percent of public universities\u2013have decided to place limitations on the number of hours adjunct professors can work, according to a survey conducted by Inside Higher Ed.\n\nAdjuncts are not the only academics facing new burdens under Obamacare. Some universities are considering imposing fines on employees who smoke, or fail to get regular checkups.\n\nPennsylvania State University originally proposed a fine of $100 on employees who refused to submit to a battery of invasive, physical tests or answer questionnaires about their lifestyles and health habits. The policy was changed after faculty revolted; instead, those who take the test will earn a small cash reward. (RELATED: Profs must take invasive physical tests under new health care regime)\n\nStill, most university human resources officers believe Penn State\u2019s penalizing approach was the right one, and colleges may increasingly move in that direction as Obamacare is implemented.\n\nThe College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, which monitors university employment issues, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but recently announced that about 60 percent of its members believed health costs would increase under Obamacare. Some 40 percent expected costs to stay the same, and none thought they would decrease.\n\nFollow Robby on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Robby Soave", "description": "Universities are cutting back on adjunct professors\u2019 work hours to comply with Obamacare--an unfortunate wake up call for some liberal academics who supported", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Universities are cutting back on adjunct professors\u2019 work hours to comply with Obamacare--an unfortunate wake up call for some liberal academics who supported the law.    \u201cI understand that colleg", "title": "Here\u2019s how Obamacare makes life hell for college profs", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/27/heres-how-obamacare-makes-life-hell-for-college-profs/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/8cdd2220866146e39a246bc66d145907-e1382981407702.jpg", "height": 275}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Am I saying it's the right thing to do?
