It isn’t Trump who is destroying the Republican Party; it is the Republican Party leadership. Trump and the other “outsiders” are merely the beneficiaries of the anger and dissatisfaction of a large majority of the electorate fed up with the gridlock in Washington.

The primaries and caucuses are the only way citizens have a voice to express their point of view. The message the citizens are sending is clear: The senators and representatives of the people (not the donors) are not doing the job they were elected and are paid to do, namely, run the government for the benefit of the people.

As the party leadership wrings its hands trying to figure out how to stop Trump, it continues its pattern of gridlock, trying to “win the game” of the Republicans against the Democrats. For Republicans, it has been how to “prevent Obama from having a second term,” as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, how to repeal Obamacare, and the latest, how to not hold a hearing or a vote on the Supreme Court nominee. Obviously, the Republican Party leaders (and their donors) are so myopic they have not yet seen the voters’ writing on the wall. They are still destroying their party from within.

Otto von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible.” It is not getting the perfect deal. Government is no place for idealists of any persuasion, because the goal is to bring divergent views together to get “the best deal possible” for the people given the divergent viewpoints of their representatives. Even the Founding Fathers had to compromise to give us the Constitution we have.
