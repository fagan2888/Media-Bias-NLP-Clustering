So much so that by middle school she knew she would follow in her late grandfather's footsteps and become a doctor.\n\nNow, after 15 years in traditional primary care practice, Dr. Legg Corba took a chance this month and transitioned her Upper Macungie office into Green Hills Direct Family Care Inc. \u2013 becoming the region's first direct primary care physician.\n\nDirect primary care is not a substitute for health insurance, but rather a medical service that was developed 20 years ago to act as a backup mechanism for primary care patients who have high-deductible health insurance plans.\n\nThe practice charges a monthly fee to its patients, who get full access to primary care, including longer visits, 24/7 access, no co-pays and no restriction on the number of office visits. The direct primary care physicians benefit by eliminating third-party payers or health insurance companies and the complexities, costs and delays in health care that can come with them.\n\nMost important for Legg Corba is that direct primary care empowers the doctor-patient relationship \u2013 her favorite part of being a physician, she said.\n\n\u201cEven if I was making less money, I am spending more time with patients,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore switching to direct primary care, Legg Corba had to maintain a high number of patients in order to keep up with the rising overhead costs of health care. But, with the new direct primary care model, it has been liberating for her, she said, giving patients an opportunity to save money while still getting effective, personal health care.\n\n\u201cI didn't go into medicine to bankrupt people,\u201d said Legg Corba who has 154 patients, a fraction of the 1,200 active patients she was seeing in her previous practice.\n\nLegg Corba said she is still trying to grow her patient membership, but will be able to maintain a similar income with a significantly smaller number of patients. And this means more quality time with patients.\n\nPhyllis Leibensperger, a patient of Legg Corba's for about nine years, said being a member of Green Hills Direct Family Care is money well spent.\n\n\u201cI like the way that I get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't feel like a number or like I am holding anyone up.\u201d\n\nUnder the new model, Green Hills' patients pay a membership fee that can range from $10 to $100 a month, depending on how many services the patient wants access to.\n\nMembership gives an affordable way to cover general adult physicals, women's health care, newborn and pediatric care, wellness education, chronic disease management, minor procedures and coordination of care with specialists. Legg Corba's plan also offers discounted rates on lab testing, radiology and prescriptions.\n\nThere are more than 4,000 direct primary care physicians nationwide \u2013 up from 756 in 2010 and 146 in 2005. There are about 150 direct primary care doctors in the Philadelphia area, Legg Corba said.\n\nTo prepare her patients for the change to direct primary care, Legg Corba sent out an informational letter, followed by three more letters, and held three well-attended town-hall meetings.\n\n\u201cA natural reaction is for physicians, employers and consumers to look for ways to access basic care in a more affordable and efficient model,\u201d said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based consultant. \u201cI expect these kinds of programs to continue to grow.\u201d\n\nFor employers who struggle with rising health care costs, direct primary care could be another avenue to pursue as they devise health insurance plans for employees.\n\n\u201cThe unabated rise in health care costs \u2026 have forced employers to look at other options,\u201d said Tom Croyle, president of Lehigh Valley Business Coalition on Healthcare, a nonprofit organization in Bethlehem that represents businesses and strives to improve the delivery, cost and quality of health care. \u201cI favor changes in care delivery that improve quality, efficiency at a reasonable cost. Those must be the deliverables.\u201d\n\nLegg Corba stressed that direct primary care is not a substitution for health insurance, as it is recommended that each patient still buy a basic health insurance plan that covers catastrophic illness, emergency room visits, specialist care, hospitalization or other services outside of what the membership covers \u2013 to avoid gaps in care.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary care model is attractive to doctors who want to remain independent, are frustrated by the limited amount of time spent with patients, and administrative work,\u201d Croyle said.\n\nAlthough the concept began two decades ago, direct primary care has picked up speed significantly in the last five years \u2013 on the heels of the 2010 Affordable Care Act \u2013 which is producing high-deductible plans that are forcing employers to pass more expenses on to employees.\n\n\u201cThere has been a clear trend toward employers moving to plans that require workers and their families to pay for more basic care out of pocket,\u201d Laszewski said. \u201cThat has been reinforced by Obamacare, that offers policies with even higher deductibles, co-pays and narrower networks.\u201d\n\nAccording to Legg Corba, there is no legislation in Pennsylvania regarding direct primary care or a state policy that defines direct primary care, but for her, this is a positive thing, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is a good situation because no regulation is good regulation,\u201d she said.\n\nLegg Corba was scheduled to meet last week with state legislators to start talks about getting legislation in place to protect direct primary care from being labeled as insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lehigh Valley Business", "description": "", "title": "Direct primary physician debuts with monthly fee for care | LVB", "url": "http://www.lvb.com/article/20160125/LVB01/301229999/direct-primary-physician-debuts-with-monthly-fee-for-care", "image": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20160125/LVB01/301229999/AR/0/AR-301229999.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "lvb.com", "description": "", "title": "Direct primary physician debuts with monthly fee for care | LVB", "image": {"src": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20160125/LVB01/301229999/AR/0/AR-301229999.jpg"}, "creator": "@jenniferg_LVB", "site": "@lvb_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Now, after 15 years in traditional primary care practice, Dr. Legg Corba took a chance this month and transitioned her Upper Macungie office into Green Hills Direct Family Care Inc. \u2013 becoming the region's first direct primary care physician.\nThe direct primary care physicians benefit by eliminating third-party payers or health insurance companies and the complexities, costs and delays in health care that can come with them.\nDirect primary care is not a substitute for health insurance, but rather a medical service that was developed 20 years ago to act as a backup mechanism for primary care patients who have high-deductible health insurance plans.\nThere are more than 4,000 direct primary care physicians nationwide \u2013 up from 756 in 2010 and 146 in 2005.\nMost important for Legg Corba is that direct primary care empowers the doctor-patient relationship \u2013 her favorite part of being a physician, she said."}
