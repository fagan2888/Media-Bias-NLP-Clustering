What\u2019s happening in New Jersey is not a miracle. What's happening is grind-it-out progress on behalf of the people that I work for.\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful, who has been struggling to move up in a crowded and boisterous field of Republicans, managed to tie for seventh place in a Monmouth University poll released on Monday.\n\nBack in New Jersey, however, Christie is despised by many voters, and public opinion has largely turned against him. As he attended the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on Sunday, the governor was booed\u2014twice\u2014by a hostile crowd of horse racing fans. It\u2019s been rapid fall for a man who was re-elected less than two years ago by a landslide.\n\nHarwood framed Christie\u2019s woes in a few succinct lines, referring to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures and the state\u2019s repeated downgrades by credit rating agencies.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s not happy with you,\" Harwood told Christie. \u201cYou just are playing a weak hand right now as a governor.\"\n\n\u201cYou know, I've governed in a deeply blue state, vetoed income tax increases, cut business taxes, cut the budget $2.5 billion less than it was eight years ago in discretionary spending,\u201d Christie replied. \u201cAnd in the last five and a half years, we\u2019ve got 192,000 new private sector jobs.\u201d\n\nHarwood skipped over Christie's comment about budget cuts\u2014the state\u2019s total spending has actually increased every year since he took office\u2014and pointed out that New Jersey has added jobs at a much slower pace than most other states have.\n\n\u201cOf course we have, because we have higher taxes than anybody else,\" Christie replied. \"Now there\u2019s certain things you can do, and there's certain things that you can\u2019t do, 'cause you're not a dictator.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Facing trouble on the trail, governor cites 'grind-it-out progress' on economy.", "title": "Christie: 'There's been no miracle in New Jersey'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/chris-christie-theres-been-no-miracle-in-new-jersey-120950.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/03/150803_chris_christie_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Chris Christie 2016,CNBC,2016 Elections,Budget,Chris Christie,New Jersey", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Facing trouble on the trail, governor cites 'grind-it-out progress' on economy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac70\"", "article_summary": "Christie: 'There's been no miracle in New Jersey' Facing trouble on the trail, governor cites 'grind-it-out progress' on economy.\nGovernor Chris Christie said \"there's been no miracle in New Jersey\" in a television interview Monday, after facing questions about his troubles at home and on the campaign trail.\n\"Now there\u2019s certain things you can do, and there's certain things that you can\u2019t do, 'cause you're not a dictator.\u201d\n\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s not happy with you,\" Harwood told Christie.\nBack in New Jersey, however, Christie is despised by many voters, and public opinion has largely turned against him."}
