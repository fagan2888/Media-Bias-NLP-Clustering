Iglehart and others submitted roughly $158 million in false claims through Riverside for partial hospitalization program services, which is an intensive outpatient treatment for severe mental illness. Evidence showed those beneficiaries never received those services and most of the Medicare beneficiaries rarely even saw a psychiatrist or received any intensive psychiatric treatment at all, the DOJ said.\n\nAdditionally, the Justice Department said Iglehart personally billed Medicare for individual psychotherapy and other treatment that she never provided, as well as falsified the medical records of patients at Riverside's inpatient facility to make it look as though she provided psychiatric treatment when she did not.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n12 others have been convicted for roles in this scheme, including the former president of Riverside.
