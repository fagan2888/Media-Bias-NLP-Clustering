The less restrictive rules would allow the creation of a standalone emergency department if a rural hospital closes.\n\nLewis also cited proposals for financial help for rural hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina, for instance, raised the Medicaid reimbursements that it pays struggling rural hospitals. Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s administration called it a way to improve the health of the Palmetto State\u2019s most vulnerable residents, according to the Associated Press.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s spending per capita on Medicaid is among the lowest of the 50 states, Lewis noted.\n\nAnother possibility is Medicaid expansion, which would help rural hospitals by turning many of their uninsured patients into paying patients. The federal Affordable Care Act calls for expansion, providing subsidies for it, but the decision is up to the individual states.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal and Republican lawmakers have rejected expansion in Georgia, citing the cost to the state. And this week, GOP leaders went further, introducing a bill that would require legislative approval of any Medicaid expansion in the state.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an effort to add another barrier to expansion,\u2019\u2019 said Tim Sweeney, health policy director for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.\n\nRoughly half of the states have chosen to expand Medicaid.\n\nSee more at: http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2014/02/rural-hospital-closing/#sthash.bgNShmJl.dpuf", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Another Rural Hospital Closes", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "Lower Oconee Community Hospital in southeast Georgia has closed due to financial problems, becoming the state\u2019s fourth rural hospital to do so in the past two years.
