It extensively explained the ruling in a video release, declaring that Barrie \u2014 though unpenalized \u2014 had been guilty of both charging and interference, launched himself with both skates off the ice and made initial contact to Anaheim defenseman Simon Despres\u2019 head at the Honda Center Friday.\n\nDespres didn\u2019t return to the game after the second-period hit and the Ducks said he had an upper-body injury. Barrie went through a hearing by phone with the league Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even really think about it the rest of the game,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cThen when I found out (it was an issue), I was a little surprised. Going through this process and dealing with all of this has been new to me and interesting.\u201d\n\nBarrie added, \u201cOnce you slow any hit down, it looks worse than it is. I think in real time it was a split-second decision, and I was under the impression the puck was in his feet or whatever. . . I don\u2019t consider myself a dirty player or an overly physical player. I don\u2019t think I need to change the way I play or anything like that. It was just an unfortunate situation, and it was unfortunate that Simon got hurt.\u201d\n\nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy quibbled with the ruling and suspension.\n\n\u201cWhen you show video, you can make whatever on your side,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYou control the circles and whatever it is. From my perspective, for me first of all it was not interference. I think the guy had the puck and it was less than one or two seconds before (Barrie) finished his check on him. Two, the first point of contact was the shoulder. And three, on my view, his skates were touching the ice. But I guess you you can use the image at the moment you want and make it look to your advantage.\n\n\u201cBasically, I\u2019m not happy.\u201d\n\nDid he believe three games were too much, then?\n\n\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Roy responded. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot for that type of check, yes.\u201d\n\nRoy said he also believed Barrie\u2019s lack of history on the supplemental disciplinary front \u2014 he never has been suspended \u2014 should have been a consideration. Barrie was on the other side of the equation when Minnesota\u2019s Matt Cook was suspended for seven games for a knee-on-knee hit on Barrie in the 2014 playoffs.\n\n\u201cFor me, that should have been a factor, yes,\u201d Roy said.\n\nSaid Barrie: \u201cI get it. There\u2019s a job that the league has to do to protect the players from the players. If I were on the other end, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d be upset by it. I\u2019m not thrilled. Three games is a lot and it\u2019s going to be tough to sit out and watch. But at the end of the day, you respect the decision.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFfei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s Tyson Barrie philosophical about three-game suspension", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s Tyson Barrie philosophical about three-game suspension", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/18/avalanches-tyson-barrie-philosophical-about-three-game-suspension/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__barriep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__barriep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T19:08:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T10:38:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f28\"", "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Avalanche defenseman Tyson Barrie missed Colorado\u2019s game against Los Angeles Sunday as he began a three-game NHL suspension.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even really think about it the rest of the game,\u201d Barrie said.\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the decision, but I respect it,\u201d Barrie said before the game at the Staples Center.\nDespres didn\u2019t return to the game after the second-period hit and the Ducks said he had an upper-body injury.\nBarrie was on the other side of the equation when Minnesota\u2019s Matt Cook was suspended for seven games for a knee-on-knee hit on Barrie in the 2014 playoffs."}
