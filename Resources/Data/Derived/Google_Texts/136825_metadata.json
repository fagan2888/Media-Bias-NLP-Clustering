Among the severely injured was the 2-year-old boy, who had taken shelter there with his family.\n\nSam Billett, 31, a Briton who works in public relations, discovered the story the new-media way: through Twitter, after The Daily Signal published an article about the plight of the boy, whose name is Hasan Uday Albayati.\n\nThrough the kind of sharing allowed in a world connected through email and social media, Albayati (who is not related to Hasan) and Billett united to bring healing to Hasan.\n\nShrapnel had lodged deep into Hasan\u2019s left eye, nearly blinding it. The boy also suffered a fractured arm and facial cuts and bruises.\n\n>>> Iraqi Boy, 2, Loses Most of Family as ISIS Terrorists Target Town\n\nWith Albayati\u2019s support on the ground, Billett raised $2,250 for Hasan\u2019s medical treatment through a campaign called Aziz Legacy Children\u2019s Fund. Albayati heads a small, Iraq-based humanitarian group, the Turkmen Saving Foundation.\n\nThe money raised by Billett\u2019s organization \u2014 collected entirely online through a page on the website gofundme.com \u2014 paid for Hasan to fly to Tehran, Iran, where the boy underwent special eye surgery.\n\nHasan also had two operations on his left arm at a hospital in Iraq.\n\nHe is almost fully healed now, with only slight facial scarring. He lives a life as normal as can be in Iraq, at the home of his uncle and cousins in Iraq. (For security reasons, Billett asks that The Daily Signal not name the city.)\n\n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Albayati says of his collaboration with Billett during a Skype interview with The Daily Signal from Baghdad.\n\nBillett, in a separate Skype conversation from London, is more expansive:\n\nWe did this because we were moved to action. In today\u2019s world of social media, doing nothing no longer applies. When we can, we should.\n\nAt the time of The Daily Signal\u2019s first report on Hasan, intelligence indicated that the boy had lost his entire family in the bombings. (The story reflected that understanding, depicting the boy as the family\u2019s sole survivor, and also misspelled his name as Hassan based on available information.)\n\nHowever, Billett and Albayati were able to confirm that Hasan\u2019s mother and uncle survived.\n\nTurkmen Helps His Own\n\nThe Sunni Muslim jihadists who make up the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have become notorious for their brutality to fellow Muslims as well as Christians and other those of other religions in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWhat could have been just another mourned but quickly forgotten ISIS attack against Shiite Muslims became a world-spanning act of philanthropy in Hasan\u2019s case.\n\nToday, Hasan and his mother can\u2019t return to their home village of Brauchelli because it was overrun by ISIS militants during the summer. Hasan\u2019s father died in that attack.\n\nHasan and his family are Shiite Turkmen, as is Albayati, the neurologist who would come to play an important role in the boy\u2019s life.\n\nIn June, many Turkmen villages \u2014 clustered about 100 miles north of Baghdad \u2014 came under attack from ISIS.\n\nThe Turkmen, with linguistic and cultural ties to Turkey, have lived in northern Iraq for centuries. Some are Shiites, some are Sunnis. ISIS considers them infidels.\n\nThe plight of some 17,000 Shite Turkmen in the town of Amiri caught the world\u2019s attention after the United Nations described the threat as similar to the one faced by the Yezidi minority, who were forced by the advance of ISIS to flee to Mount Sinjar in Iraq.\n\n>>> For Yezidis Displaced by ISIS, a Long Way Home\n\nIn late August, a coalition of Iraqi and Iranian militias backed by American air support drove off the ISIS terrorists.\n\nFrom the relative safety of his home in Baghdad, Albayati had tracked ISIS\u2019s methodical destruction of villages all summer long, through firsthand accounts written by villagers.\n\nA Turkmen from Hasan\u2019s village wrote about the bomb attack in Kirkuk, detailing Hasan\u2019s injuries.\n\nAlbayati saw the story, translated it to English, and sent it to U.S.-based Iraqi activists. One of those activists shared Hasan\u2019s story with The Daily Signal, the multimedia news organization of The Heritage Foundation, which published an article Aug. 28 featuring Hasan.\n\nAlbayati hoped attention to the story would bring action.\n\nThree weeks after the bombing, when it ran, Hasan received limited medical treatment at Faruk Medical City in the Sulaymaniyah province of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nHasan lay in a hospital bed, bandages covering part of his face and his left eye, red scabs dotting his forehead and cheeks.\n\nFrom Aziz to Hasan\n\nIn London, Billett\u2019s desire to act actually began with failure.\n\nOn Aug. 16, Billet saw a story published by the BBC and The Daily Telegraph about another boy \u2014 a disabled, 4-year-old Yezidi who was deserted in Sinjar. Facing an ISIS assault on their village, the boy\u2019s parents had left their weak son behind as they sought to save their five other children.\n\nBillett, along with seven others from disparate places such as India, New Zealand, Croatia, Australia and the U.S., began using the hashtag #littleyazidiboy on Twitter to draw attention to the boy\u2019s struggle.\n\nTheir Twitter movement turned into a campaign to raise money. Two weeks after the group\u2019s work began, however, the boy died of dehydration.\n\nHis name was Aziz.\n\nThe Aziz Legacy Children\u2019s Fund now had a name, and when Billett saw The Daily Signal\u2019s story about Hasan, it had a new opportunity to bring help and healing to a child. Billett says:\n\nAziz was a defenseless little boy stranded in the desert because of ISIS. His struggle brought the world together, and now we are trying to live out his legacy.\n\nPassage to Tehran\n\nTo help Hasan, Billett reached out to contacts in groups such as Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nThose groups connected him with Kurdistan Save the Children, a charity with contacts in Iran.\n\nAt Faruk Medical City, Hasan\u2019s left eye was cleaned and protected with a lens.\n\nHe was referred to a second Iraq hospital, but it did not offer the specialized treatment his eye needed.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, was that Hasan had no identification or other personal documents. When his family fled their village because of ISIS, the suddenness of the terrorists\u2019 advance forced them to leave nearly everything behind.\n\nWorking together, Albayati and Billett sent a message to the office of the new Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, explaining Hasan\u2019s situation.\n\nHasan would have to leave Iraq to get the treatment he needed. The prime minister\u2019s office provided passports so that Hasan, his mother and uncle could exit the country.\n\nKurdistan Save the Children arranged care for Hasan in Iran. The Iranian embassy in Iraq issued visas to the boy, his mother and uncle, and on Oct. 29 they flew to Tehran.\n\nSave the Children representatives found a hospital to admit Hasan. After identifying more shrapnel in Hasan\u2019s eye, doctors there removed the temporary lens and surgically repaired the eyelid.\n\nFor the first time since being wounded in the August bombings, the boy could close his eye all the way.\n\n\u2018Really Something\u2019\n\nThe Aziz Legacy Children\u2019s Fund and Kurdistan Save the Children split the $3,500 cost for Hasan\u2019s treatment and stay in Iran.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Hasan, his eye fully healed, returned with family members to Iraq on a flight paid for by Billett\u2019s group.\n\nGeoffrey Lysaught, publisher of The Daily Signal, said:\n\nAs a social, digital-first news organization, The Daily Signal has the power to connect the lives of people across the globe. We are so proud of the impact that our reporting has had on Hasan\u2019s life. It really demonstrates that high-quality journalism that rises above the din of political partisanship is critical to making the world a better place.\n\nThe happy outcome likely will inspire similar action, if Billett\u2019s charity has anything to say about it.\n\nThe Aziz Legacy Children\u2019s Fund is working to arrange treatment for a 2-year-old Turkmen girl named Rawa who has tumors on her face, neck and throat. Rawa and her family fled Tal Afar in June when ISIS captured that city.\n\nJust before the terrorists ISIS came, Rawa was due to be treated there. After that appointment became impossible, a familiar doctor stepped in to treat Rawa as best he could.\n\nHis name is Ali Albayati.\n\n\u201cDr. Ali really is something,\u201d Billett says. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about him.\u201d\n\nAs ISIS continues to rape, maim and kill, tearing apart families and wrecking infrastructure, Billett and Albayati promise to help give hope to children caught up in the violence. Billett says:\n\nThere is so much happening in Iraq with death and destruction, and children\u2019s health care is slipping through the cracks. Things can\u2019t move quickly enough for them. But the world can come together to support those children to show that they stand the right to life.\n\nNote: To learn more about the Aziz Legacy Children\u2019s Fund, visit http://www.gofundme.com/e6ggt0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A neurologist in Iraq and a PR specialist in London team to get surgery for a 2-year-old wounded in an ISIS bombing after The Daily Signal tells his story.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A neurologist in Iraq and a PR specialist in London team to get surgery for a 2-year-old wounded in an ISIS bombing after The Daily Signal tells his story.", "title": "Daily Signal Inspires Social Media Action to Mend This Iraqi Boy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140828_Amerli_Hassan.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-28T09:33:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/15AMMkp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A neurologist in Iraq and a PR specialist in London team to get surgery for a 2-year-old wounded in an ISIS bombing after The Daily Signal tells his story.", "title": "Daily Signal Inspires Social Media Action to Mend This Iraqi Boy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140828_Amerli_Hassan.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media,religious liberty,terrorism", "published_time": "2014-11-28T03:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T09:33:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Islamic State, ISIS, Iraq, Turkmen, Tehran, Doctors Without Borders, United Nations, Yezidi, Sinjar"}, "article_summary": "After identifying more shrapnel in Hasan\u2019s eye, doctors there removed the temporary lens and surgically repaired the eyelid.\nPassage to TehranTo help Hasan, Billett reached out to contacts in groups such as Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Albayati says of his collaboration with Billett during a Skype interview with The Daily Signal from Baghdad.\nGeoffrey Lysaught, publisher of The Daily Signal, said:As a social, digital-first news organization, The Daily Signal has the power to connect the lives of people across the globe.\nAt the time of The Daily Signal\u2019s first report on Hasan, intelligence indicated that the boy had lost his entire family in the bombings."}
