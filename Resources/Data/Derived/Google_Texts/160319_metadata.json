Not only do we not like it, we\u2019re not very good at it.\n\nMinnesota state exchange CEO Scott Leitz says he saw consumers struggle last year.\n\n\u201cIn many, many cases, it was hours of time that were spent kind of walking a person through what their choices were, answering their questions and helping them make a final decision,\u201d he says.\n\nWith millions flocking to public exchanges under Obamacare, this shopping problem \u2013 which researchers have known about for years \u2013 is coming into focus.\n\nConsumers must sort out co-insurance, deductibles, in-network, out-of-network and medications, then compare it all to screen after screen of health insurance plans. Wharton economist Jonathan Kolstad says don\u2019t forget people also must attempt to guess what health problems they\u2019ll have over the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cUltimately, insurance is not just about the world as we know it today, it\u2019s about knowing where we are going down the road,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are more than 900,000 variables to consider when shopping for health insurance, Kolstad says, so it's no wonder that we tend to make such poor choices. Here\u2019s the thing: Those choices have real world costs.\n\nKolstad\u2019s research shows that when employees don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, they leave $1,800 on the table. There\u2019s certainly an opportunity here to both help people and to cash in. Several University of Pennsylvania professors \u2013 along with Kolstad \u2013 have launched software called Picwell in response.\n\nCompany CEO Jay Silverstein says their software is designed to \u201cmake the process easier, simpler, faster, better.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it works, according to Silverstein: Consumers first answer the four simple questions, \"What is your age?\" \"Where do you live by ZIP code?\" \"What is your gender?\" and \"What medications are you on?\"\n\nThen Picwell\u2019s algorithms cut, slice and dice the responses with a big data buffet that includes medical claims and credit scores. The result is Google-like. Almost instantaneously, the software spits out a list of the plans and ranks them by best fit. It also offers a total monthly cost estimate, which includes all out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIndustry consultant Ted von Glahn \u2013 who has no ties to the company \u2013 says Picwell is taking a lot of the mystery out of shopping.\n\n\u201cThe golden rule is 'do the math.' Don\u2019t make me go find that neurologist procedure and [ask] 'Is it covered or not?' Bring it right to me,\u201d he says.\n\nCompare Picwell to healthcare.gov. The federal exchange, says von Glahn, only offers the most basic tools forcing consumers to still do the math. Picwell is one of a dozen companies including GetInsured and Consumers\u2019 CHECKBOOK in this small consumer choice space.\n\nAs these products mature, von Glahn believes, it will force the entire industry \u2013 insurers, hospitals and doctors \u2013 to become more efficient.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t compete on the mistakes that consumers make, the dazzle and confusion of choice,\u201d he says.\n\nChange may well be here sooner than it seems. PricewaterhouseCoopers says a third of private companies are considering moving their active employees onto private exchanges within the next three years.\n\n\u201cMy gut on this is private exchanges are in the early stages,\u201d says PWC\u2019s Michael Thompson. \u201cThe value proposition isn\u2019t as strong as it ultimately will be. As that proposition grows, you\u2019ll see more companies adopt it. I think the uptick rates will be significant.\u201d\n\nNot only do employers need to be convinced they can save money \u2013 so do employees. To that extent, whether exchanges take off or disintegrate could turn on the success of outfits like Picwell. CEO Silverstein says business is good: They\u2019ve already lined up private and public exchanges, including Minnesota\u2019s. He says there\u2019s a good chance their clients will grow from 750,000 this year to 40 million in 2015.\n\nPicwell executives believe their tiny industry is moving toward a time when consumers can actually find value \u2013 quite a transformation for a product that today many don\u2019t understand or trust at all.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/11/13/health-care/theres-business-opportunity-behind-open-enrollment", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/photo_34.JPG?itok=SjZ0JG1P", "type": "article", "description": "Companies are trying to eliminate the hassle that comes with choosing insurance.", "title": "There's a business opportunity behind open enrollment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "IXNEpZVe5hmLT9YyuUY4xSbtIePaYrHVr3FENhJfo/rfepZUpVXHHOok0dytx1cmBQQJlA18w4TGwz5DJhmWXQ==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc447\"", "article_summary": "PricewaterhouseCoopers says a third of private companies are considering moving their active employees onto private exchanges within the next three years.\n\u201cMy gut on this is private exchanges are in the early stages,\u201d says PWC\u2019s Michael Thompson.\nThere are more than 900,000 variables to consider when shopping for health insurance, Kolstad says, so it's no wonder that we tend to make such poor choices.\nCEO Silverstein says business is good: They\u2019ve already lined up private and public exchanges, including Minnesota\u2019s.\nHe says there\u2019s a good chance their clients will grow from 750,000 this year to 40 million in 2015."}
