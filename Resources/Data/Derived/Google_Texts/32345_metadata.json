The two leading contenders to succeed him in Ward 9 (right) are Ty Moore, a Green Party-endorsed activist running on the Socialist Alternative ticket, and Alondra Cano, a DFL-endorsed communications specialist for Minneapolis Public Schools.\n\nThe other candidates at Saturday's forum were attorney Charles Curtis -- running under the banner of Politics with Principle -- DFLer Patrick Fleetham, who works in home furnishings, and Abdi Abdulle.\n\nMoore had the most vocal supporters in the crowd at the forum, which was moderated by the League of Women Voters. Here are the answers to several questions that shed some light between the candidates:\n\nResponding to a question about crime and the shooting of Terrence Franklin:\n\nFleetham said there is cultural racism on the police force that needs to be addressed. \"I don\u2019t believe the current chief is doing it, at least openly.\" He noted that there have been armed robberies and prostitution stings recently on Lake Street. Advocated more police on bicycles patrolling Lake Street.\n\nMoore advocated for an elected Civilian Review Board to have disciplinary power over police (that oversight process was modified last year). He said that America jails more citizens than any peacetime society in the world, and a majority of prisoners are \"black or brown.\" \"There is a deep deep problem with the way law enforcement and the criminal injustice system functions in this society and this city.\u201d\n\nCano wants to revamp the civilian review over police, but also reinstate a requirement that police live in Minneapolis. \"I want to go back to that system. I think that\u2019s about community building and that\u2019s about accountability.\u201d\n\nCurtis supports residency requirements and strengthening civilian police review. Noted that he is a former prosecutor and believes most police are good, hard-working people.\n\nAbdulle explained that he wants to find \"a solution to the gap between the city, the police, and the community members.\"\n\nHow can we hold Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy accountable for the concessions they made in response to the Minneapolis Energy Options campaign?\n\nFleetham wants more detailed explanations of the concessions that were made. Believes there is too much negotiation behind closed doors. \"We need to have our hands strengthened in negotiations and relations with them by the Legislature.\"\n\nMoore believes we should not extend the contracts for more than two years so that discussions can continue around municipalization of the city's utilities. \"I think we need to continue to fight to put the idea of municipal energy on the [ballot].\" He said it is the only way to hold the companies accountable.\n\nCano said her existing relationships at City Hall will enable her to get the votes necessary to \"keep energy companies accountable and keep their word on how they will continue to preserve the earth and people like us that live on it.\" Wants more multi-lingual education efforts to ensure people are better informed about the debate.\n\nCurtis does not support municipalizing the city's utilities. \"I think City Hall has a hard enough time filling potholes on 14th and 15th Avenues. And they should really focus on helping our neighborhoods\u2026 and not running a multi-billion dollar energy consortium.\u201d\n\nAbdulle said we cannot let the energy companies \"off the hook,\" but adds that \"Xcel Energy is a great company, I believe. And they provide a lot of support for a lot of neighborhoods and a lot of communities.\"\n\nOn what to do about the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center, the county trash burner:\n\nMoore and Fleetham took the strongest stances against HERC. Moore said the city should \"move to shut down HERC.\" Fleetham said he did not support burning more waste at the facility. Other candidates were less concrete, but supported a variety of efforts to reduce overall waste.\n\nOn the Vikings stadium:\n\nAll candidates generally opposed the Vikings stadium deal and most agreed that it should have been put to a public vote -- as outlined in the city charter. Two of the most forceful comments:\n\n\"Our essential services in this city have been cut again and again and again, and yet somehow we find money for the Minnesota Vikings stadium. It is outrageous,\" Curtis said. Moore questioned how it is \"that there is such widespread opposition in our city to this kind of corporate welfare project, and yet we have a city council that continually passes corporate welfare projects?\"\n\nOn how to ensure people have a place to live and are not mistreated by landlords (accused slumlord Spiros Zorbalas owned many properties in Ward 9):\n\nFleetham believes more inspection and enforcement is necessary. He wants to see more interpreters to aid with community education and encourage the use of 311 to report violations. Believes more affordable housing is needed.\n\nMoore asserted that bedbug, asbestos, lead and other problems are the result of landlords \"putting their bottom line above the needs and the health of our families and our communities.\" Said more robust enforcement is necessary. Also wants more investment in affordable housing through rent control and urban planning models that prioritize low-income living.\n\nCano said the city should rethink housing and that we cannot \"build these boxed homes where people live in compartments.\" Wants to examine creative ways to bring together police, regulatory services and neighborhoods in targeting problem properties.\n\nCurtis said it is necessary to fully fund essential services and housing inspections so existing regulations can be enforced and the city can build a record against problem landlords.\n\nAbdulle said citizens need to be a part of the solution. Noted that housing is a problem for many minority groups and some buildings have no space for children.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "It was a chilly morning for an outdoor political forum Saturday, but five candidates seeking to replace outspoken Council Member Gary Schiff endured the cold at the Midtown Farmers Market to discuss crime, sustainability and housing issues.", "title": "Open council seat brings five candidates to forum", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/open-city-council-seat-brings-five-candidates-to-minneapolis-forum/224720422/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ericroper_1379796965_Ward9-2.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ericroper_1379796965_Ward9-2.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "It was a chilly morning for an outdoor political forum Saturday, but five candidates seeking to replace outspoken Council Member Gary Schiff endured the cold at the Midtown Farmers Market to discuss crime, sustainability and housing issues.", "title": "Open council seat brings five candidates to forum", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/open-city-council-seat-brings-five-candidates-to-minneapolis-forum/224720422/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ericroper_1379796965_Ward9-2.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ericroper_1379796965_Ward9-2.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It was a chilly morning for an outdoor political forum Saturday, but five candidates seeking to replace outspoken Council Member Gary Schiff endured the cold at the Midtown Farmers Market to discuss crime, sustainability and housing issues."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb61\"", "article_summary": "Moore believes we should not extend the contracts for more than two years so that discussions can continue around municipalization of the city's utilities.\nCano said the city should rethink housing and that we cannot \"build these boxed homes where people live in compartments.\"\nHow can we hold Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy accountable for the concessions they made in response to the Minneapolis Energy Options campaign?\nMoore had the most vocal supporters in the crowd at the forum, which was moderated by the League of Women Voters.\nAbdulle explained that he wants to find \"a solution to the gap between the city, the police, and the community members.\""}
