Cannon of the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t yet say whether Chad\u2019s $175 premium is the lowest-cost plan available to him through the Obamacare Exchange,\u201d Cannon said. \u201c[I\u2019m in the process of researching that, and it\u2019ll probably take a few hours.] But it\u2019s probably close.\u201d\n\nThanks to Obamacare\u2019s community-rating price controls that take effect in 2014, Henderson\u2019s cheapest plan option on eHealthInsurance jumped up to $190.23.\n\n\u201cSo it appears that Obamacare quadrupled Chad\u2019s premiums, and Enroll America thinks this is a success story,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nOne of the main reasons health insurance prices are going up under Obamacare is because of the one-size-fits-all insurance plans required by the health care law.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing in August, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., asked Marilyn Tavenner of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services whether President Obama's promise that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\u201d was true.\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d Tavenner said, but added that it was true \u201cunder the assumption that your insurance is \u2018true\u2019 insurance that provides coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "American media outlets were finally able to track down a mythical creature \u2014 a person who actually signed up for the Obamacare exchanges online.\nBut that person, Chad Henderson, admitted to the Washington Post that the premium for the plan he enrolled in was $175.
