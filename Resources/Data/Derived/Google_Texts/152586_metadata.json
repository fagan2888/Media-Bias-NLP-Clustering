Photo: Supplied\n\nRugby union fanatic James Teague was supposed to be sitting in the stands watching his beloved Waratahs take on the Brumbies on Saturday night.\n\nInstead, the 19-year-old from Sydney's eastern suburbs was clinging to life in a New Zealand hospital after plunging six metres from a luxury apartment balcony while on a ski trip to Queenstown.\n\nThe Waratahs made a pre-match tribute to Mr Teague on Saturday night as the Eastern Suburbs Colts player spent a third day in a critical condition in Dunedin Hospital's intensive care unit.\n\nJames Teague, right, and his cousin.

A Waratahs spokeswoman said the club had been in touch with the family, who were grateful for the pre-game tribute to their son.\n\n\"A big Tahs fan, 19-year-old James Teague had been looking forward to being here tonight,\" the announcement said. \"Tragically he was involved in an accident earlier this week and is now in a critical condition in hospital. Our thoughts are with the Teague family. We wish James all the very, very best for a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nBest friend Gabby Richmond posted online that Mr Teague was \"the sunshine in all of our lives\".\n\nJames Teague.

The group of five friends had been in New Zealand for at least a week, enjoying skiing and skydiving in Queenstown.\n\nGlebe Apartments manager Anne Henley said a growing number of Australians were injuring themselves after drinking excessively.\n\n\u2018\u2018Perhaps it is something the council needs to address in Queenstown,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Just the numbers of people coming to Queenstown, naturally [these kinds of incidents] are going to increase.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn 2008, a local electrician fell to his death at the Glebe after gaining access to the courtyard and climbing to the roof. In 2003, a construction worker suffered serious injuries after he slipped from the third floor of the Glebe when it was being built.\n\nMs Henley insisted the Glebe was safe. \u2018\u2018It is a safe property,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW, Union News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Rugby union fanatic James Teague was supposed to be sitting in the stands watching his beloved Waratahs take on the Brumbies on Saturday night.", "title": "NSW Waratahs' tribute to victim of balcony fall James Teague", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/nsw-waratahs-tribute-to-victim-of-balcony-fall-james-teague-20140726-zx5xr.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/c/l/y/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zx5xr.png/1406433684153.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/c/l/y/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zx5xr.png/1406433684153.jpg"}, "description": "Rugby union fanatic James Teague was supposed to be sitting in the stands watching his beloved Waratahs take on the Brumbies on Saturday night.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "NSW Waratahs' tribute to victim of balcony fall James Teague"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Rugby union fanatic James Teague was supposed to be sitting in the stands watching his beloved Waratahs take on the Brumbies on Saturday night."}, "article_summary": "James Teague.\n\"A big Tahs fan, 19-year-old James Teague had been looking forward to being here tonight,\" the announcement said.\nJames Teague, left, is in a critical condition in a Dunedin hospital after falling from a balcony.\nPhoto: SuppliedRugby union fanatic James Teague was supposed to be sitting in the stands watching his beloved Waratahs take on the Brumbies on Saturday night.\nJames Teague, right, and his cousin."}
