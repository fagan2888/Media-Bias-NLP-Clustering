The suit says that the President overstepped his executive powers when he chose to delay enforcement of the Affordable Care Act provision that says firms with more than 50 employees must provide health insurance coverage to their workers.\n\nPresident Obama then granted a second delay to businesses employing 50 to 99 workers, extending their time to comply. Due to the flaws in the ACA that placed an undue burden on those employers, Republicans also supported the delays, but they argue that the president and Congress must act together to change the law. They do not support Obama\u2019s decision to do it himself, creating a slippery slope that allows the executive to choose which laws to enforce and when. That power would essentially allow Obama, and future presidents, to unilaterally re-write the law.\n\nREAD ALSO: John Boehner\u2019s red line: Framing the presidential lawsuit\n\nRepublicans consider this a symptom of Obama\u2019s larger overreach; if Nixon was imperial, they consider Obama positively monarchical. They want to check Obama\u2019s unilateral use of power; while Republicans and Democrats alike supported delaying ACA\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d the next \u201cexecutive action\u201d may not be as palatable.\n\nBoehner and Republicans are not generally calling for impeachment. Boehner is not supporting a recent cry by Sarah Palin, who asked when Republicans in Congress will develop the \u201ccojones\u201d to impeach the president.\n\nInstead, Boehner hopes the \u201cimpeachers\u201d will join him on the lawsuit that will, he hopes, limit the use of Executive Orders for all presidents to come.\n\n\u201cIf this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well,\u201d Boehner said on Thursday. \u201cThe House has an obligation to stand up for the legislative branch, and the Constitution, and that is exactly what we will do.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has taken a stand against presidential overreach, unanimously declaring Obama\u2019s \u201crecess appointments\u201d to the National Labor Board illegal, and unanimously rejecting his administration\u2019s stance on searching cell phones and bulk collecting data, calling it a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In Hobby Lobby, a divided court put limits on the ACA\u2019s power to dictate types of health insurance coverage, and House Republicans will use ACA as the wedge against executive orders.\n\nREAD ALSO: Johnny the joke: Boehner\u2019s lawsuit is Republican \u201cShadow Theater\u201d\n\nBy filing this suit, Boehner will help to quiet those Republicans who say he is doing nothing to protect the Constitution, while avoiding creation of impeachment chatter, in contrast to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi several years ago when she called for President George W. Bush to be impeached over the Iraq war.\n\nPelosi\u2019s call for impeachment seems to have been due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq rather than in any specific violation of the law by the Bush Administration.\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 with heavy bipartisan support. U.N. Resolution 1441 unanimously passed on November 8, 2002, giving Iraq \u201ca final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations\u201d that had been set out in several previous resolutions.\u201d Iraq\u2019s failure to comply with U.N. investigators gave the U.S. the legal justification to invade.\n\nThe Constitution specifies that impeachment of a president is for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d During the Bush presidency, some legal scholars suggested that an indictable offense wasn\u2019t necessary to launch impeachment against an inept or dangerous administration. The idea of making impeachment equivalent to a parliamentary vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d is antithetical to our system of government, however, and it is not likely that Americans will support an overtly political attempt to impeach even an unpopular president.\n\nBoehner has undoubtedly calculated that movement in the direction of impeachment will further divide the parties and America, making an already weak government entirely ineffective at a time of crisis, at home and abroad. Impeachment without a clear, indictable offense would create an ugly wound on the body politic that would take years or decades to heal, muster support for an unpopular president, and cause more harm than good.\n\nThe law suit, however, might be a defining moment for the divided government and people. It may help establish in court some clear limits on presidential authority to use executive orders for more than administrative, ministerial ends. At the least the GOP will hope it ensures that there will be no \u201cpen and phone\u201d actions out of the White House during this recess.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential Executive Orders need to be defined for generations, and presidents, to come.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jacquie Kubin", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Presidential Executive Orders need to be defined for generations, and presidents, to come.", "title": "Boehner\u2019s law suit to define Executive Branch powers", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/boehner-suit-vs-impeachment-is-correct-course-for-america-21496/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obama-white-house-image.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential Executive Orders need to be defined for generations, and presidents, to come.", "creator": "@commdiginews", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obama-white-house-image-435x375.jpg", "title": "Boehner's law suit to define Executive Branch powers", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "keywords": "john boehner,president,obama,suit,impeachment", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T07:36:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-13T07:37:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "impeachment, john boehner, obama, president, Suit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd76c\"", "article_summary": "President Obama then granted a second delay to businesses employing 50 to 99 workers, extending their time to comply.\nThe law suit, however, might be a defining moment for the divided government and people.\nIn Hobby Lobby, a divided court put limits on the ACA\u2019s power to dictate types of health insurance coverage, and House Republicans will use ACA as the wedge against executive orders.\nIt may help establish in court some clear limits on presidential authority to use executive orders for more than administrative, ministerial ends.\nBoehner\u2019s office released a draft resolution outlining the suit on Thursday."}
