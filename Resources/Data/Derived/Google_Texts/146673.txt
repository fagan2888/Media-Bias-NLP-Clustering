Windham planners send Market Square before voters



— The planning board on Wednesday night sent to the ballot a zoning ordinance for the proposed Market Square Overlay District, a potential future development that could offer Windham a walkable downtown area.

..

After much debate about the project’s merits, as well as whether the vote was about those merits at all, the board voted 4-3 to send the zoning ordinance to a warrant article.



The ordinance had previously undergone a lengthy process of review and revision, with significant and sometimes heated public input. But Wednesday night’s meeting attracted minimal public attendance or participation.

..

Instead, board members mostly went back and forth over Market Square and, to some extent, their visions for development in Windham.



Market Square, which the Windham Economic Development Committee has been working on and planning for years, would comprise a walkable mixed-use town center on 167 acres along Interstate 93 and Route 111. About 50 acres would be for commercial development.

..

Proponents touted Market Square — which is still in the abstract stages and doesn’t have any concrete development plans — as a boost for quality of life, a town attraction and a potential contributor toward growing the town’s tax base.

..

Board member Kristi St. Laurent said sending Market Square to the ballot was about innovation and forward thinking.



And vice chair Paul Gosselin said it could create an opportunity for future growth.



But several planning board members raised strong concerns to the project. Margaret Crisler said she thought the development would make the prominent location less attractive and fail to create the walkable center people wanted, in part due to a lack of water and sewer access.

..

Board member Ruth-Ellen Post noted that there are initial plans for other mixed-use commercial developments in town, including the Village Center District, all with some degree of walkability. Post raised concerns about excessive retail in Windham, saying the town might not be able to sustain it.

..

“I would like to see an economic development culture that is at least equally devoted to attracting a corporate presence to this town,” Post said. “A serious, strong corporate presence.”



Market Square is modeled on walkable town centers that been created and become attractions in other towns such as Lynnfield and Lowell, Mass. But board members disagreed over whether such a vision would actually be feasible in Windham.

..

Still, board member Kristi St. Laurent said the board should set aside disagreements over the project’s merits and approve the ordinance, given general agreement on its framework and wording, to let voters make the ultimate decision.

..

Board chair Alan Carpenter agreed, citing the general concept’s support in the master plan and residential surveys: “I don’t think it’s our job to make decisions on something that is this impactful unilaterally.”

..

Still, he added, he didn’t want voters to think revenue for Market Square would help lower taxes significantly or fund spending priorities. One resident at the meeting had spoken earlier of the school district’s desperate need for more funding to deal with overcrowding.

..

“It is not a money event to me,” Carpenter said. “It is a lifestyle event.”



Ultimately, Crisler, Post and member Dan Guttman voted to nix the project, but a slim majority — Carpenter, Gosselin, St. Laurent and Selectman Joel Desilets — moved Market Square forward to the next step of going before voters.
