However, only a fifth of cardholders have ever asked for either.\n\n\u201cPeople underestimate the power they have in the relationship with their credit card issuer, especially now because the marketplace is so competitive,\u201d says Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com\u2019s senior industry analyst. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize how good of a chance they have at being successful.\u201d\n\nSchulz recommends shopping around and collecting offers from other credit card companies before requesting a lower interest rate. Tell your card issuer that other companies are offering lower rates to sign up for a new card and see if your issuer matches the number, rather than throwing out a random figure.\n\nRelated: Credit Card Debt Is Soaring Again \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much We Owe\n\n\u201cI would say that should temper their expectations. Don\u2019t expect to go from 25 percent to 15 percent,\u201d says Schulz. \u201cBut I think if you have other offers that you received, that can set a baseline for negotiating.\u201d\n\nTo get a late fee waived, Schulz says those with consistent on-time payments are the most successful. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to tell issuers that you\u2019ve already sent in the late payment and have set up autopay, so a delayed payment won\u2019t occur again.\n\n\u201cIn this case, loyalty can count,\u201d says Schulz. \u201cIf you have been a good customer for several years and have good payment history, you\u2019re more likely to get a waiver than if you\u2019ve had the card for a few months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s a simple but little-used way to waive a late fee or lower the interest rate on", "title": "The Surprisingly Easy Way to Save Money on Your Credit Card Bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/Surprisingly-Easy-Way-Save-Money-Your-Credit-Card-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11292012_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/Surprisingly-Easy-Way-Save-Money-Your-Credit-Card-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11292012_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There\u2019s a simple but little-used way to waive a late fee or lower the interest rate on", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s a simple but little-used way to waive a late fee or lower the interest rate on your credit card: Just ask.\nRelated: Credit Card Debt Is Soaring Again \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much We Owe\u201cI would say that should temper their expectations.\n\u201cPeople underestimate the power they have in the relationship with their credit card issuer, especially now because the marketplace is so competitive,\u201d says Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com\u2019s senior industry analyst.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t realize how good of a chance they have at being successful.\u201dSchulz recommends shopping around and collecting offers from other credit card companies before requesting a lower interest rate.\nIt also doesn\u2019t hurt to tell issuers that you\u2019ve already sent in the late payment and have set up autopay, so a delayed payment won\u2019t occur again."}
