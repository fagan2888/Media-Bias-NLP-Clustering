One especially gratifying and praiseworthy feature of the majority opinion was that it explicitly invoked the logic of health reform to justify the \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery\u201d (can this be made into a dance step?) that so infuriated Scalia. From the opinion:\n\nThe combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a State\u2019s individual insurance market into a death spiral. It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner. Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation, but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits. It thus stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.\n\nYes! The Court (minus the three stooges) understood that the ACA is designed to work via the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d of guaranteed issue and community rating, the individual mandate, and subsidies. All three elements are needed to make it work, which is why it was obvious to anyone who paid any attention that the lawsuit was nonsense.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of people on the right have never grasped this logic, either because all they need to know is that Obamacare is eevil big government, or because of the Upton Sinclair principle of finding it difficult to understand something when your salary depends on your not understanding it. But the court majority did the basic policy analysis, which gratifies my inner wonk as well as my outer health reformer.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150625162638, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 25, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Court and the Three-Legged Stool ( 20150625 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "By George, I think they got it.", "title": "The Court and the Three-Legged Stool", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/the-court-and-the-three-legged-stool/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "By George, I think they got it.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 25, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1435263998, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T20:26:38-04:00"}, "utime": 20150625202638, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150625, "pdate": 20150625, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "By George, I think they got it.", "title": "The Court and the Three-Legged Stool", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/the-court-and-the-three-legged-stool/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/the-court-and-the-three-legged-stool/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Court and the Three-Legged Stool", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b04\"", "article_summary": "But the court majority did the basic policy analysis, which gratifies my inner wonk as well as my outer health reformer.\nThe Court (minus the three stooges) understood that the ACA is designed to work via the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d of guaranteed issue and community rating, the individual mandate, and subsidies.\nIt is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.\nIt thus stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.\nStill on a high over the Supreme Court ruling."}
