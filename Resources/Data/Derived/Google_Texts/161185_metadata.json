Well, good luck getting somebody to take up a federal case on the offhanded and somewhat dickish comments of some MIT egghead.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Stewart spotlighted at the end of the segment, opponents may have the opportunity to use Gruber\u2019s comments when the Supreme Court hears yet another challenge to Obamacare involving subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Jon Stewart jumped on the #Gruber bandwagon during \"The Daily Show\" Tuesday by skewering MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber for his now viral remarks about the \"stupidity of the American voter\" that allowed the opaque health care law to gain passage.", "title": "Jon Stewart: Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber is a 'super...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/11/stewart-spaghetti-600x307.jpg", "height": 307}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/11/19/jon-stewart-obamacare-architect-jonathan-gruber-super-egghead/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "republicans-gruber", "published_time": "2014-11-19T10:35:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T10:35:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Stewart labeled this action by Democrats \u201cpretty slimy.\u201dOf course, Stewart couldn\u2019t resist talking down at Republicans who oppose Obamacare and have spotlighted Gruber\u2019s offensive comments.\nHowever, as Stewart lamented, the improvement of HealthCare.gov has been completely eclipsed by Gruber\u2019s comments that were recorded in multiple videos over past years.\nThough he poked fun at Gruber\u2019s voice and labeled him a \u201csuper egghead,\u201d Stewart certainly didn\u2019t reserve all of his criticism for the MIT professor.\nJon Stewart jumped on the #Gruber bandwagon during \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d Tuesday by skewering MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber for his now viral remarks about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d that allowed the opaque health care law to gain passage.\n\u201cYou keep trying, and now your best remaining move \u2014 the strongest card in your deck \u2014 looks to the be Gruber."}
