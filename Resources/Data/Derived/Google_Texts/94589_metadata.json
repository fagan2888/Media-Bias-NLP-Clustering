We have modern-day Washington.\n\nToday, President Barack Obama fights relentlessly for his liberal priorities. Like the Terminator, he never gives up, he never stops. And Republican leadership responds to every challenge by surrendering at the outset.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPresident Obama demands of Congress: fund all of Obamacare, with no changes to help the millions being hurt by that failed law, or he will veto funding for the entire federal government. And Republican leadership backs down. President Obama demands: fund his unconstitutional executive amnesty\u2014or he will veto funding for the entire federal government. And Republican leadership backs down. President Obama demands: give $500 million in taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood, a private organization under criminal investigation\u2014or he will veto funding for the entire federal government. And Republican leadership backs down.\n\nThe core of this capitulation comes from Republican leadership\u2019s promise that \u201cThere will be no government shutdown.\u201d On its face, the promise sounds reasonable. Except in practice it means that Republicans never stand for anything.\n\nSurely, you might think, Republicans can use different \u201ctactics\u201d and accomplish something meaningful without risking a government shutdown.\n\nAlas, no. In today\u2019s partisan Washington, there are only two important kinds of votes: show votes on legislation that has no chance of becoming law and votes on legislation that \u201cmust pass.\u201d (A third kind of vote\u2014growing government and worsening the deficit\u2014occurs as well. These votes succeed because Democrats and Republican leadership agree that expanding corporate welfare and cronyism helps the reelection of career politicians of both parties.)\n\nThe leadership loves show votes. They will schedule a vote on just about anything, confident that Senate Democrats will vote party-line and filibuster over and over again until Republicans retreat. Leadership wants and expects grassroots voters to be satisfied with these meaningless show votes.\n\nThe other type of vote is on \u201cmust-pass\u201d legislation. Typically, these votes consist of continuing-resolution votes, omnibus appropriations votes and debt-ceiling votes. In short, \u201cmust-pass\u201d legislation is where the rubber meets the road.\n\nAnd history is on the side of these being the only effective leverage Congress has on a recalcitrant president. For example, of the past 55 times the debt ceiling has been adjusted, Congress has attached meaningful conditions 28 times.\n\nIndeed, one of the few victories congressional Republicans have had over President Obama\u2014the 2011 budget caps, which for the first time meaningfully reined in Obama\u2019s spending\u2014 occurred only because Congress was willing to use the \u201cmust-pass\u201d legislation of a debt ceiling increase to force him to concede.\n\nYet today, Republican leadership is unwilling to use the current \u201cmust-pass\u201d legislation, a continuing resolution, to honor our commitments to the voters. Instead, the president knows he can send Republican leadership running for the hills by uttering a single word: \u201cshutdown.\u201d\n\nIf leadership is correct that we can never win against the president, why did it matter to win a Republican House? A Republican Senate? If Republican majorities in Congress will acquiesce to and affirmatively fund the identical Big Government priorities that Obama supports, then what difference does it make who is in charge of Congress?\n\nIn 2010, we were told that Republicans would stand and fight if only we had a Republican House. In 2014, we were told that Republicans would stand and fight just as soon as we won a majority in the Senate and retired Harry Reid. In both instances, the American people obliged. Now we\u2019re told that we must wait until 2017 when we have a Republican president.\n\nLike Charlie Brown and the football, this disconnect explains the massive frustration with Washington. The American people do not believe Republicans will actually do what we say we will do.\n\nThe latest example: When video evidence surfaced depicting the barbaric selling of unborn baby parts by Planned Parenthood, Americans of conscience\u2014pro-life and pro-choice alike\u2014were understandably shocked. People on both sides of a contentious issue agreed that at a minimum, until the results of the investigations are known, the federal government should suspend taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nSeparately, the American people are also understandably horrified by an Iranian nuclear deal that profoundly threatens our national security.\n\nThese priorities matter. But leadership\u2019s only question for those who are fighting for the American people is this: How do you get 67 Senate votes to override the president\u2019s veto? If that is the standard, then the Republican position quickly deteriorates to \u201cWe will only support whatever Harry Reid agrees to.\u201d\n\nThe alternative? We actually do what we said we would do. We fight for commonsense conservative principles, and we use the constitutional authority of the power of the purse\u2014which leadership has forsworn\u2014to do so.\n\nOn the upcoming continuing resolution, we should fund the entire federal government, but we should decline to fund Planned Parenthood. And we should use our constitutional authority to actually try to stop this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nSpecifically, we should prohibit spending federal funds to implement the deal and eliminate the United States\u2019 contributions to the United Nations, until the Obama administration complies with federal law and hands over the \u201cside deals\u201d governing the absurdly weak inspection regime.\n\nBut, many Republicans fear, we could never win this fight. The premise of that belief is that Obama will never, ever give in, so it must be Republicans who ultimately surrender. But, if we cannot win on these issues, with the facts overwhelmingly in our favor, then what possibly can we win? Nothing? Ever?\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, the next step\u2014likely coming in December\u2014is that Republican leadership intends to give in to Obama and bust the budget caps, exploding the deficit even further because if Republicans do not Obama will threaten another shutdown.\n\nWe can win if we take the case to the American people. Show the Planned Parenthood videos. Stand united.\n\nIf Obama follows through on his threat to veto funding for the federal government, we should force him to defend that radical position. Planned Parenthood is a private organization, not even part of the government. That\u2019s worth repeating.\n\nThus, President Obama\u2019s position is that, if Congress doesn\u2019t give a half-billion dollars to a politically favored private organization currently under criminal investigation, then he will shut down the entire government. Likewise, on Iran, his position would be that he is so committed to sending over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei\u2014which would be used by jihadists to murder Americans and Israelis, and to accelerate the Iranian development of nuclear weapons\u2014that he will shut down the government.\n\nBoth positions are clearly unreasonable.\n\nIf Obama forces a shutdown, it\u2019s worth remembering that during the previous government slowdown, operations associated with roughly 80 percent of government spending continued, including pay for military personnel, national security, Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries and everything else federal law deems \u201cessential.\u201d\n\nIf Republican leadership actually tried to win, we would vote on one bill after another funding specific parts of the federal government. Fund it all, and let Democrats explain why they are filibustering funding for vital services to give $500 million to a private organization under criminal investigation.\n\nAnd, notably, after President Obama forced the 2013 shutdown over Obamacare, predictions of electoral calamity proved false; instead, Republicans won a landslide victory in 2014.\n\nWhen Reagan was president, there were eight partial shutdowns, including six before his historic 1984 reelection. The world didn\u2019t end. But that\u2019s what happens sometimes when a leader fights for his principles. The alternative\u2014Republican leadership\u2019s current strategy\u2014is to surrender on everything and leave Harry Reid as the de facto leader of the Senate.
