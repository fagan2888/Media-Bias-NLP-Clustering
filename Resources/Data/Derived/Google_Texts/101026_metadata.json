Good luck!\n\nWhen I graduated from college, my dad told me one of the hardest things I would ever do is to look for and land a great job. He was right. Now, after 30 years helping companies build teams, I\u2019ve learned the other side of that is also true. It\u2019s hard to hire the right person for the right job at the right time in a company\u2019s journey...It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a startup adding a few critical hires or you\u2019re a mid-stage company, finding the \u201cideal\u201d candidate is tough. There is no ideal candidate. We\u2019re talking about people. We joke, saying our jobs would be easy if we didn\u2019t have to achieve goals using people! Finding the right people is as important as getting the product right \u2014 maybe more important...If you get the team wrong, you\u2019ll lose time and product traction and maybe you start losing some of the team you already had. While lots of us can deal with product questions, it\u2019s tough to bring products or services to market in an organization that has high turnover, lacks direction, and where there\u2019s a high sense of frustration. There\u2019s no magic bullet, but I want to share some things I remind folks of when we\u2019re hiring...Recognize this. Hiring people just like you is good \u2014 smart, high energy, insightful and the \u201cfit\u201d with the team is great. But you also need people who aren\u2019t just like you \u2014 successful teams need people with different strengths and weaknesses...This means you need to be self-aware and honest with yourself (ask trusted advisers about your strengths/weaknesses if you don\u2019t have a clue). You need the confidence to hire folks who\u2019ll challenge you and may have different ideas/perspectives. Healthy differences are good. Embrace them. It\u2019ll make you, your product and organization stronger.... There\u2019s no substitute for experience and the battle scars associated with it \u2014 It keeps you from making mistakes that have been made before. At some point you\u2019re going to need to invest in bringing on expertise, even if you have to pay that person more than you\u2019re paying yourself. Get over it \u2014 and get creative on how you\u2019re going to afford it. One size does not fit all, and you may need to be creative to meet the hire\u2019s needs and yours...I\u2019m fond of saying, \u201cI can teach a smart person anything, but I can\u2019t teach a person to be smart\u201d (not my original quote, but it\u2019s a truism). Small companies need people who can \u201cfigure it out\u201d and find answers and alternatives. Someone made for a startup loves putting up his/her hand and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that, but I\u2019ll get educated and figure it out.\u201d It\u2019s how individuals develop breadth and organizations move forward quickly...Ask why they haven\u2019t done it before. People migrate to bigger companies for stability, organizational structure, pay, advancement and less risk. All good things, but will that person thrive and be comfortable when plans change a lot, the risk is high, and life/work balance can be more like work/work balance? Maybe, but maybe not. Interview carefully, posing questions that let you assess how a person would handle an ill-defined assignment when you need someone to \u201cfigure it out.\u201d..This goes back to my first point about \u201cself-awareness,\u201d yours and others. Understand how the people you\u2019re trying to hire operate and how they define themselves in the work environment. Others won\u2019t want to work with someone who is disruptive (in a bad way), leading to a more significant HR problem...I\u2019ve been in companies that say they will \u201cput up\u201d with a big ego because of the contribution an individual makes. It doesn\u2019t work. You can\u2019t build a company around an individual. When others see that Mr. or Ms. Ego is treated differently a sense of \u201cunfairness,\u201d creeps into the culture. Sooner or later you start losing the team and traction, and need to hire and train all over again...Strategize upfront relative to who is doing the deep dive on technical skills, fit with the company, relevant experience, etc. Everyone has to get a good sense of fit. I\u2019ve seen a company so focused on convincing an applicant to join no one does a deep dive into skills. Know what success looks like in the job, and communicate that to the applicant. Many times I debrief applicants, asking how they know they will have succeeded in the job and I get a blank look. No one told them, making success elusive...This helps develop interview skills internally. Everyone will have their perceptions and thoughts. Listen carefully to dissenting voices and work through issues. It helps check the \u201chire in our own image\u201d mistakes...If you\u2019re not sure you have the right person, keep looking. You\u2019ll be in bad shape if you don\u2019t get it right, and you\u2019ll be back to square one. Involve boards and advisers in hiring, but make sure you retain the \u201chiring manager\u201d decision. It\u2019s your team. Your success depends on who you hire.... Ask the candidate what each of their references will say about their strengths, weaknesses. Ask the candidates what they think will be the biggest issues they will face in the job (and if they answer with the obvious, ask \u2018what else?\u2019)...Andrea Kokolis is executive vice president of Human Resources at Newforma Inc. a high-growth venture-capital backed company in Manchester.
