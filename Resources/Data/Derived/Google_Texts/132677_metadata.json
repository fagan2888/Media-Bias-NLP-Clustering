In California, health insurance is sold in four primary tiers \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum \u2014 that offer, for a price, increasing levels of coverage for medical expenses. Within each tier, however, prices may have changed significantly over the past year, health officials said.\n\n\u201cIf you shop around within the same metal tier, specifically the silver, you might be able to find a better deal than you had the year before,\u201d said Larry Hicks, a spokesman for Covered California, the state\u2019s health exchange set up under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe current open enrollment period is Covered California\u2019s third such period since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. There are 21,980 Sonoma County residents actively enrolled in one of its plans, according to the most recent data available from Covered California, with 34 percent in a bronze plan and 21 percent in a silver enhanced plan.\n\nOn Monday, the state exchange launched a $29 million ad campaign in multiple languages to promote open enrollment, which started Sunday. If you get health insurance through your employer or through Medi-Cal or Medicare, the open enrollment period and deadline do not apply.\n\nThe average rate increase will be about 4 percent for plans offered through Covered California, down slightly from the 4.2 percent increase consumers experienced last year, state officials calculated.\n\nThe rate increase is less dramatic than the \u201cdouble-digit\u201d increases that were common before Covered California, Hicks said.\n\nBut Dave Hodges, a Santa Rosa-based broker with Vantreo Insurance Brokerage, said out-of-pocket maximums on most small group plans are jumping to $6,250. Last year, out-of-pocket maximums on most plans were between $3,500 and $4,000, he said.\n\nHodges said only a few gold plans and platinum plans offer no out-of-pocket maximums, but these are expensive.\n\nOne newcomer to the local health insurance market is Sutter Health Plus, an HMO sold by health care giant Sutter Health. Hodges says the plan is competitively priced and has enviable benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best rates in the county right now,\u201d Hodges said.\n\nThere is one significant caveat: the plan is not being marketed through Covered California. That means those who purchase the new plan are not eligible for government subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSy Neilson, a spokesman for Sutter Health Plus, said Sutter focused its priorities this year on expanding its service area. It now includes five counties in the Bay Area, including Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara and San Francisco counties, which were added in September.\n\nSutter launched its HMO in the Central Valley in 2014 and added Sonoma County last March.\n\nUnlike the Kaiser network of doctors, Sutter Health\u2019s affiliated physicians still will accept other health insurance plans even as Sutter grows its own HMO product.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Open enrollment for California\u2019s health insurance exchange begins this week, offering Sonoma", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Open enrollment begins this week, offering Sonoma County residents who already have health insurance a chance to shop around for a better deal \u2014 and those without it an opportunity to purchase coverage and avoid a hefty tax penalty.", "title": "Covered California health insurance enrollment period begins", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4697918-181/time-to-shop-for-health", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=AnFlqDcJjNKs$0Kl841zis$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvteIwhkl6GFNYmWcTPDsy5WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-11-02T19:53:08-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One newcomer to the local health insurance market is Sutter Health Plus, an HMO sold by health care giant Sutter Health.\nIn California, health insurance is sold in four primary tiers \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum \u2014 that offer, for a price, increasing levels of coverage for medical expenses.\nIf you get health insurance through your employer or through Medi-Cal or Medicare, the open enrollment period and deadline do not apply.\nSy Neilson, a spokesman for Sutter Health Plus, said Sutter focused its priorities this year on expanding its service area.\nThe rate increase is less dramatic than the \u201cdouble-digit\u201d increases that were common before Covered California, Hicks said."}
