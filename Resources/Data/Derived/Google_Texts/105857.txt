Spring allergens are still in the air and ophthalmologist, Dr. Charlie Thompson, at The Eye Clinic in Lake Charles says the symptoms are very annoying. "Itching is the big symptom," he said. "Burning, watering, redness. Perennial allergies will do that year-round and then seasonal allergies are consistent with what's in bloom."When an allergen comes in contact with your eyes, the little blue sacs inside your eyes' mast cells blast your blood stream with histamine, a chemical that causes the irritation. "The more it itches, the more people want to rub and the more those chemicals are released," said Dr. Thompson," so the more they'll become symptomatic from their allergies. Rubbing kind of perpetuates the problem."Minimizing your exposure to the allergen is the best way to keep symptoms at bay. The next step is over-the-counter eye drops and medications like Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra. If none of that brings relief, see your doctor.The weather is getting warmer and more people are swimming. If you are a contact lens wearer, Dr. Thompson says be sure to take them out. Pools that are not properly cleaned can set you up for a dangerous infection. "That is where the parasites will live and when people are wearing contacts, it serves as a host for those parasites to grow," said Dr. Thompson.Longer summer days lead to longer hours with contact lenses in your eyes and that can set you up for a bacterial infection. "If you're a contact lens wearer and you wake up or have a painful red eye, you should assume infection until proven otherwise," said Dr. Thompson.Ignoring those signs could lead to a more serious eye health problem. Treatment typically involves compresses and special prescription eye drops.If you are swimming with your eyes open in a chlorinated pool, the chemicals can cause the blood vessels to dilate, leading to red, irritated eyes. Goggles can prevent that problem.
