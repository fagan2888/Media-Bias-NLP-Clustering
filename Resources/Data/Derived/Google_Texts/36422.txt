Aberdeen, SD

A Walmart was closed for more than an hour Saturday after a bomb threat in Aberdeen.

Police say someone called the store just after 5:00 and said an explosive device was hidden inside the retailer.

Officers evacuated the store while investigators attempted to locate a bomb, but soon found the threat to be unfounded.

The store was back open at 6:30 PM.

Police say they will continue investigating to find out who made the phone call.
