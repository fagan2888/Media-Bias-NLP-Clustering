Gallup on Wednesday released new data that shows a plunge in the rate of uninsured from the last three months of 2013 to the last three months of 2014.\n\nThe decline was seen across all demographics, including some the Obama administration has targeted as crucial toward the law\u2019s success \u2014 African-Americans, Latinos, and young people.\n\nThe rate of uninsured Americans plummeted overall on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 17.1 percent of the adult population (18-65) was uninsured. By the end of last year, just 12.9 percent of Americans were without health insurance, the lowest ever recorded, according to Gallup\u2019s data.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the plunge over the past five years, per Gallup:\n\nThe plunge was even starker among the key demographics. The uninsured rate among young people aged 18-25 plunged more than 6 points, from 23.5 percent to 17.4 percent.\n\nThe uninsured rate among the African-American population saw the most staggering decline, dropping 7 percentage points (20.9 to 13.9) on a year-over-year basis. And among Latinos, by far the most uninsured demographic in America, the uninsured rate dropped more than 6 percentage points, from 38.7 percent to 32.4 percent.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the demographic drop:\n\nThe success among the demographics is significant for a number of reasons. Signing up young people into plans is crucial for the law, which needs them to balance out the older, sicker population to keep costs relatively low.\n\nLatinos, meanwhile, have been the group of people the Obama administration has most heavily targeted in enrollment-outreach efforts. Closing the coverage gap between white and minority populations in the near-term is also important to the law\u2019s success \u2014 an Urban Institute study released last month projected that if all states adopt the law\u2019s expansion of the federal Medicaid program, the uninsured rate among Latinos would plunge to near 15 percent.\n\nBut challenges remain toward getting these groups signed up for health insurance. Especially Latinos, where barriers include language and outreach, as well as fears that applying could expose a relative living in the country illegally.\n\nThe Obama administration is also set for a huge showdown before the Supreme Court, in a case that could put millions of people\u2019s subsidies at risk.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has accomplished one of its goals: increasing the percentage of Americans who have health insurance coverage,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Jenna Levy wrote along with the data.\n\n\u201cThe uninsured rate as measured by Gallup has dropped 4.2 points since the requirement to have health insurance or pay a fine went into effect. It will likely drop further as plans purchased during the current open enrollment period take effect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Almost five years ago, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law with the stated goal of\u00a0eventually providing health insurance to every person in the U.S.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Almost five years ago, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law with the stated goal of\u00a0eventually providing health insurance to every person in the U.S.", "title": "Obamacare Is Working With the Key Demographics It Needs to Succeed", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/37359/obamacare-uninsured-rate-gallup/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gty_obama_imm_141229.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Almost five years ago, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law with the stated goal of\u00a0eventually providing health insurance to every person in the U.S.", "title": "Obamacare is working with the key demographics it needs to succeed", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/37359/obamacare-uninsured-rate-gallup/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gty_obama_imm_141229.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "Politics,Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec40\"", "article_summary": "By the end of last year, just 12.9 percent of Americans were without health insurance, the lowest ever recorded, according to Gallup\u2019s data.\nThe uninsured rate among young people aged 18-25 plunged more than 6 points, from 23.5 percent to 17.4 percent.\nBut challenges remain toward getting these groups signed up for health insurance.\nHere\u2019s a look at the plunge over the past five years, per Gallup:The plunge was even starker among the key demographics.\n\u201cThe uninsured rate as measured by Gallup has dropped 4.2 points since the requirement to have health insurance or pay a fine went into effect."}
