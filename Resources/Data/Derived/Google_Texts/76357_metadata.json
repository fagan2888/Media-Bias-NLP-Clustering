They\u2019re combined in a PxP score -- preference times priority -- assessing the interplay of these two factors in political attitudes.\n\nThe poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, finds that opposing a no-tax pledge has the broadest base: Seventy-two percent of Americans hold this view, including big majorities across party lines. Only about half in this group overall call the issue an important one, but their views on it are so lopsided that it wins a high score, nonetheless.\n\nSupporters of a tax pledge, by contrast, are much more likely to call it an important issue -- but there are few of them.\n\nDesire for the next president to support action on climate change takes a different path: It\u2019s low among Republicans, but broad enough among Democrats and independents, and important enough to them, to give it potential influence.\n\nOverall, Americans by 59-31 percent say they want the next president to be someone who favors government action to address climate change, and 58 percent call it an important issue. Again there\u2019s a sharp difference in importance depending on one\u2019s position: Among those who favor federal action, 68 percent call it an important issue. Among those who oppose action, far fewer say it\u2019s important to them, 39 percent.\n\nOn a third issue to emerge as potentially influential, Americans by 58-37 percent say they\u2019d rather have a president who mainly tries to compromise than one who mainly stands up for his or her side, and 72 percent overall say it\u2019s important to them. Both those who favor compromise and those who prefer a more partisan approach say it\u2019s an important issue, with preference for taking partisan sides, and calling this important, peaking among Republicans.\n\nOther issues are contentious, but with no clear advantage in preference or priority for one side or the other. Obamacare is an example. Americans divide 49-45 percent on whether the next president should be someone who wants to keep the federal health care law or wants to repeal it, and those on both sides call the issue highly important. The partisan divisions are vast.\n\nViews on a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants are similarly inconclusive in terms of their potential political influence. Americans by 51-45 percent say they\u2019d like to see the next president support rather than oppose a path to citizenship, again with sharp partisan differences. Fifty-nine percent overall call this an important issue, about equal numbers on both sides.\n\nOne other issue tested, views on the next president\u2019s approach to a nuclear agreement with Iran, also produced sharply partisan responses, but in this case opponents are more apt to call it important.\n\nPxP SCORE \u2013 The PxP score was developed by Langer Research Associates for use in political and market research alike. Computed here on a scale of -100 to 100, it multiplies individuals\u2019 preferences on an issue (or for a candidate or product) with the importance they give to that position. Moving farther from 0 in either direction indicates that an issue has priority, differentiated preference or both of these at sufficient levels to be potentially influential.\n\nOverall, PxP values are 29 for climate change, -25 for the tax pledge issue (the negative sign shows opposition) and 15 on compromise vs. partisanship. (Consider that very high or very low scores are difficult to obtain -- they\u2019d require very broad agreement on policies and priorities alike.) Scores drop to 3, 3 and 2, respectively, on Obamacare, immigration reform and a pact with Iran; those indicate either a lack of differentiated preference overall, a low priority or both.\n\nAs noted, though, sharp partisan divisions may make for different discussions in the 2016 primaries as opposed to the general election. Government action on climate change has a PxP score of 58 among Democrats and 29 among independents, but -12 among Republicans. On compromise vs. partisanship, it\u2019s 21, 22 and 1, respectively. And on the ACA, most strikingly, it\u2019s 55, 5 and -63.\n\nMETHODOLOGY \u2013 This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone March 26-29, 2015, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including design effect. Partisan divisions are 30-22-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Climate Change, Tax Pledge Among 2016 Issues to Watch", "description": "Support for action to address climate change and opposition to a no-tax pledge show potential to carry unexpected clout in the 2016 presidential election.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Support for action to address climate change and opposition to a no-tax pledge show potential to carry unexpected clout in the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "Climate Change, Tax Pledge Among 2016 Issues to Watch", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/climate-change-tax-pledge-issues-watch-2016-poll/story?id=30067623", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_climate_change_jef_150402_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Support for action to address climate change and opposition to a no-tax pledge show potential to carry unexpected clout in the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "Climate Change, Tax Pledge Among 2016 Issues to Watch", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/climate-change-tax-pledge-issues-watch-2016-poll/story?id=30067623", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,30067623", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,30067623", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/climate-change-tax-pledge-issues-watch-2016-poll/story?id=30067623"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_climate_change_jef_150402_4x3t_240.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-03", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,30067623", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/climate-change-tax-pledge-issues-watch-2016-poll/story?id=30067623"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/climate-change-tax-pledge-issues-watch-2016-poll/story?id=30067623", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,30067623", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-04-03 07:00:01", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "poll, climate change, Iran, path to citizenship, immigration, compromise, taxes, tax pledge, ACA, health care, 2016, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "Date": "2015-04-03", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "poll, climate change, Iran, path to citizenship, immigration, compromise, taxes, tax pledge, ACA, health care, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd86\"", "article_summary": "Supporters of a tax pledge, by contrast, are much more likely to call it an important issue -- but there are few of them.\nThey\u2019re combined in a PxP score -- preference times priority -- assessing the interplay of these two factors in political attitudes.\nFifty-nine percent overall call this an important issue, about equal numbers on both sides.\nOverall, PxP values are 29 for climate change, -25 for the tax pledge issue (the negative sign shows opposition) and 15 on compromise vs. partisanship.\nAgain there\u2019s a sharp difference in importance depending on one\u2019s position: Among those who favor federal action, 68 percent call it an important issue."}
