News columnist and MSNBC contributor Jeff Greenfield paused and clarified to the largely liberal panel that he was not speaking as an \u201cadvocate\u201d but a \u201cjournalist,\u201d prompting a mini-categorical debate over the guests\u2019 identities on the network.\n\n\u201cI have felt this about the president since he was campaigning: he talks too much,\u201d Greenfield began. \u201cA twenty-eight minute speech is twenty-six minutes too long about what happened. Surrounded by the same kind of human props, that poor pregnant diabetic who almost collapsed. It was too long. What he might have learned from Winston Churchill was to begin by saying, \u2018We screwed up, and we are going to fix it.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the other thing,\u201d he continued, and then hesitated a bit over how he wanted to frame his criticism of the administration. \u201cI realize sometimes networks can be\u2014I want to just\u2014I want to be a counter-arguer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to do whatever you want,\u201d Wagner said.\n\n\u201cBecause I represent myself as a humble country journalist, not an advocate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think many people at this table would consider themselves journalists, too,\u201d Wagner objected.\n\n\u201cWho are also advocates,\u201d Greenfeld countered. \u201cProgressives and liberals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr not,\u201d Wagner said, more seriously, and then moved the segment along: \u201cWe can get into that discussion later.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is, when [Obama] said nobody\u2019s madder than me that this isn\u2019t working, I\u2019m thinking, how about a single working mother whose kid has a pre-existing condition and couldn\u2019t get on the website?\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cI bet she was angrier than Obama that it didn\u2019t work. My feeling was\u2014because he\u2019s president in part because of his eloquence, going back to 2004, that speech\u2014he spoke at great length about this, and, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a great system, and it\u2019s not working because too many people want it.\u2019 I would have much preferred \u2018We\u2019ve blown it and we\u2019re going to fix it.'\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip below, via MSNBC:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the midst of criticizing President Barack Obama's speech about the Affordable Care Act exchange website's problematic rollout on Now With Alex Wagner", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/greenfieldwagner.jpg", "title": "MSNBC Guests Have Awkward Moment Over Whether They\u2019re \u2018Journalists\u2019 or \u2018Advocates\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the midst of criticizing President Barack Obama's speech about the Affordable Care Act exchange website's problematic rollout on Now With Alex Wagner Wednesday afternoon, Yahoo!
