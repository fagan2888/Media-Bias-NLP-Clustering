The closing of a longtime apartment complex means the end of family housing on the University of Kansas campus.

The final family moved out of the university's Stouffer Place apartments last week, bringing an end to the 58-year-old housing complex.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports the 25 buildings opened in 1957 for married students, and eventually opened to students with children and single graduate students.

The university's long-range plans do not include replacing family housing. A tentative plan for the site includes new integrated science buildings and some apartments for single students.

Kip Grosshaus, associate director of student housing, says the complex's buildings were at the end of their usefulness and the university could not build new ones and charge the low rents that attracted students to Stouffer Place.
