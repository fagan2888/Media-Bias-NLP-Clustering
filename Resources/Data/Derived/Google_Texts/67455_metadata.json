There are no joint HSAs, even when the HSA is linked to a family coverage HDHP and subject to the higher family coverage contribution limit.\n\nSome employer plans include an \u201cemployee plus one\u201d tier in addition to self-only and family coverage. An \u201cemployee plus one\u201d\u2014such as an eligible employee and her dependent child\u2014would fall under the HSA family coverage limits.\n\nPenalties for Nonqualified Expenses\n\nThose under age 65 (unless totally and permanently disabled) who use HSA funds for nonqualified medical expenses face a penalty of 20 percent of the funds used for such expenses. Funds spent for nonqualified purposes are also subject to income tax.\n\nAffordable Care Act Limits Differ\n\nA frequent source of confusion are the two sets of limits on out-of-pocket expenses that employers should keep in mind.\n\nStarting in 2015, out-of-pocket or cost-sharing limits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were slightly higher than the IRS\u2019s out-of-pocket limits on HSA-qualified HDHPs. That\u2019s because the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) uses a premium-adjustment percentage method\u2014based on a projection of annual increases in per enrollee employer-sponsored insurance premiums\u2014to modify the maximum out-of-pocket limit for ACA-compliant plans. Grandfathered plans are not subject to the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing limits. The IRS, however, uses the consumer price index to adjust its out-of-pocket limit for HSA-eligible HDHPs.\n\nHHS published its 2017 ACA out-of-pocket limits in the Federal Register on March 8, 2016, in its Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017 final rule.\n\n2016 2017 Out-of-pocket limits for ACA-compliant plans (set by HHS) Self-only: $6,850 Family: $13,700 Self-only: $7,150 Family: $14,300 Out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified HDHPs (set by IRS) Self-only: $6,550 Family: $13,100 Self-only: $6,550 Family:$13,100\n\n\u201cNote that the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing limit is higher than the out-of-pocket maximum for HDHPs. In order for a health plan to qualify as an HDHP, the plan must comply with the lower out-of-pocket maximum limit for HDHPs,\u201d advises a legislative brief by the Stellar Benefits Group in Solon, Ohio.\n\nThe HHS\u2019s Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters final rule clarifies that, as in 2016, the ACA\u2019s self-only annual limit on cost-sharing for 2017 applies to each covered individual, regardless of whether the individual is enrolled in self-only coverage or family coverage.\n\nCoverage of Adult Children\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act allows parents to add their adult children (up to age 26) to their health plans, the IRS has not changed its definition of a dependent for health savings accounts. This means that an employee whose 24-year-old child is covered on her HSA-qualified health plan is not eligible to use HSA funds to pay that child's medical bills.\n\nIf account holders can't claim a child as a dependent on their tax returns, then they can't spend HSA dollars on services provided to that child. According to the IRS definition, a dependent is a qualifying child (daughter, son, stepchild, sibling or stepsibling, or any descendant of these) who:\n\n\u2022 Has the same principal place of abode as the covered employee for more than one-half of the taxable year.\n\n\u2022 Has not provided more than one-half of his or her own support during the taxable year.\n\n\u2022 Is not yet 19 (or, if a student, not yet 24) at the end of the tax year, or is permanently and totally disabled.\n\nStephen Miller, CEBS, is an online editor/manager for SHRM.
