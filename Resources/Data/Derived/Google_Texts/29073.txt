(Newser) â€“ A man is dead and a woman critically injured after a domestic incident flared into a nightmare for Black Friday shoppers inside a busy department store in Chicago, reports the Sun-Times. Police say a 31-year-old man approached a 22-year-old woman, identified as either his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend, and shot her in the head or neck about 8:30pm, reports the Chicago Tribune. He then turned the gun on himself. The woman is a seasonal employee of the store. The shooting took place on the second floor, and Nordstrom was not opening today as the investigation continued.

"It was a pow and a pow," says one witness. "It was a stampede coming down the escalator."
