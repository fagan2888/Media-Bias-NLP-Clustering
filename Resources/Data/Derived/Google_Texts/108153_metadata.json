And that means it\u2019s time to interview the candidates in some of the state\u2019s most competitive electoral contests.\n\nState Rep. Paul Wieland, R-Imperial, joins St. Louis Public Radio\u2019s Chris McDaniel, Jason Rosenbaum and Jo Mannies to discuss his bid for the 22nd District state Senate seat. Wieland is running against state Rep. Jeff Roorda, D-Barnhart, for the open Jefferson County-based seat.\n\n(Roorda is slated to appear on next week\u2019s episode of Politically Speaking.)\n\nAfter a brief stint in the Missouri House in the 1990s, Wieland burst back onto the political scene in 2010 when he challenged Roorda \u2014 who at the time was vying for his fourth and final term in the General Assembly\u2019s lower chamber. Wieland prevailed, marking a major political shift in a county that Missouri Democrats dominated for decades.\n\nRoorda and Wieland both successfully ran for different House seats in 2012. But they placed themselves on a collision course when they both announced for the 22nd District seat, which Democrat Ryan McKenna represented from 2006 to 2013. Because a Democratic candidate didn\u2019t file to oppose state Auditor Tom Schweich, the so-called \u201cBattle for JeffCo\u201d may be the most competitive state legislative contest of the 2014 cycle.\n\nDuring the show, Wieland said:\n\nHis campaign is focusing primarily on economic issues, such as the need to bolster Jefferson County's port along the Mississippi River. Wieland said many of the county's residents haven't rebounded from the 2008 recession and from the closing of the Chrysler auto plant in Fenton. Many autoworkers lived in nearby Jefferson County.\n\nHe believes he best fits the county's political leanings. \"I've always been conservative in nature, on economic and social issues.\" He says Roorda is simply \"mostly conservative.\"\n\nHe continues to be opposed to right-to-work and other proposals aimed at curbing union clout.\n\nHe is confident that his suit against the Affordable Care Act's provisions requiring insurers to cover contraception will be successful. Wieland and his wife, who are staunch Catholics, say they don't want such coverage available for their three daughters. The family is insured under the state of Missouri's insurance covering state employees.\n\nFollow Chris McDaniel on Twitter: @csmcdaniel\n\nFollow Jo Mannies on Twitter: @jmannies\n\nFollow Jason Rosenbaum on Twitter: @jrosenbaum\n\nFollow Paul Wieland on Twitter: @WielandNow", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Missouri\u2019s mid-term election season is in full swing.
