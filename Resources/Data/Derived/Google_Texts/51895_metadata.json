You\u2019re not that smart!\u201d and \u201cNo price on children\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe protesters demanded that Princeton ask for Singer\u2019s resignation and denounce his remarks about disabled babies. The demonstrators also called for Princeton to hire a bioethicist from the disability community in a comparable position to provide a platform for views that contrast with Singer\u2019s.\n\nAfter a meeting with the dean of bioethics ended with no clear conclusions, the protesters temporarily blocked Nassau Street, the main access to the university. The activists disbursed from the street after local police threatened some with arrest.\n\n\u2018Hate speech\u2019\n\nThe protest was led by the Pennsylvania chapter of Not Dead Yet, a disability-rights group specializing in direct action that opposes assisted suicide and euthanasia for people with disabilities. Also joining the protest were groups representing parents of people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cIf any professor would start using racial or sexual slurs or epithets, such a professor would be fired. It\u2019s time for Princeton to recognize disability hate speech against the disabled,\u201d said Alan Holdsworth, an activist from Not Yet Dead.\n\nAsked for Princeton\u2019s response to the protesters\u2019 demands, the university\u2019s spokesman, Martin Mbugua, told WND, \u201cPrinceton is strongly committed to ensuring the academic freedom of members of its community and to ensuring that the campus is open to a wide variety of views.\u201d\n\nSinger did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the protest, Not Yet Dead also circulated an online petition, signed by more than 250 disability activists, denouncing Singer for his remarks.\n\nStates the petition: \u201cRather than challenging Singer\u2019s advocacy as a form of hate speech, Princeton University has provided Singer with a prominent platform and increased access to US media and policymakers. \u2026 Enough is enough. It\u2019s long past time for this outrage to end.\u201d\n\nSinger\u2019s interview with Klein aired April 19. \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio\u201d broadcasts on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia\u2019s NewsTalk 990 AM.\n\nFeds slam Singer\u2019s remarks\n\nThe disability rights activists are not the first to protest Singer\u2019s controversial remarks on Klein\u2019s show.\n\nThe National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency, in April contested Singer on the facts and contended his comments to Klein could foster discrimination against the disabled.\n\n\u201cProfessor, do your homework,\u201d the NCD said.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination because of disability is not likely to be reduced by Singer\u2019s positions, or the logical policy positions that would emerge from them,\u201d stated the NCD. \u201cDiscrimination is not solely a philosophical concept; it remains a regular occurrence for individuals with disabilities.\u201d\n\nSinger essentially argues the right to life is based on a being\u2019s capacity for intelligence and to hold life preferences, which in turn is directly related to a capacity to feel and comprehend pain and pleasure.\n\nThe NCD \u201ccategorically reject[ed] any calculus that assumes to ascribe a measurable, immutable quality of life to another human being \u2013 disabled or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are simply too many variables to consider in making \u2018quality of life\u2019 assumptions.\u201d\n\nThe agency said one of \u201cthe hallmarks of societal attitudes toward disabilities has been a tendency of people without disabilities, including media savvy philosophers, to overestimate the negative aspects and underestimate the positive features of the lives of those who have disabilities.\u201d\n\nKill disabled infants under Obamacare\n\nIn the interview, Klein asked Singer whether he believes health-care rationing under Obamacare will become more prevalent.\n\nSinger replied that rationing is already happening, explaining doctors and hospitals routinely make decisions based on costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different in the U.S. system, in a way, because it doesn\u2019t do this overtly; maybe it doesn\u2019t do it as much. And the result is it spends about twice as much on health care as some other countries for very little extra benefit in terms of the outcome.\u201d\n\nKlein quoted from a section of Singer\u2019s 1993 treatise, \u201cPractical Ethics,\u201d titled \u201cTaking Life: Humans.\u201d\n\nIn the section, Singer argued for the morality of \u201cnon-voluntary euthanasia\u201d for human beings not capable of understanding the choice between life and death, including \u201cseverely disabled infants, and people who through accident, illness, or old age have permanently lost the capacity to understand the issue involved.\u201d\n\nFor Singer, the wrongness of killing a human being is not based on the fact that the individual is alive and human. Instead, Singer argued it is \u201ccharacteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness that make a difference.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he envisions denying treatment to disabled infants to become more common in the U.S. under the new health-care law, Singer replied: \u201cIt does happen. Not necessarily because of costs.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nIf an infant is born with a massive hemorrhage in the brain that means it will be so severely disabled that if the infant lives it will never even be able to recognize its mother, it won\u2019t be able to interact with any other human being, it will just lie there in the bed and you could feed it but that\u2019s all that will happen, doctors will turn off the respirator that is keeping that infant alive. I don\u2019t know whether they are influenced by reducing costs. Probably they are just influenced by the fact that this will be a terrible burden for the parents to look after, and there will be no quality of life for the child. So we are already taking steps that quite knowingly and intentionally are ending the lives of severely disabled infants. And I think we ought to be more open in recognizing that this happens.\n\nKlein followed up by asking whether the killing of severely disabled infants should be institutionalized to reduce health-care costs.\n\nAsked Klein: \u201cI know that it happens and it happens certainly if the family gives consent. But do you think in the future in order to ensure a more fair rationing of health-care and health-care costs, that it should actually be instituted more? The killing of severely disabled babies?\u201d\n\nSinger replied that such a plan would be \u201cquite reasonable\u201d if it saved money that can be used for better purposes. He contended that most people would say they don\u2019t want their premiums to be higher \u201cso that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments.\u201d\n\nSinger\u2019s full response:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "About 70 disability-rights activists marched Wednesday on Princeton University to demand the resignation of famed ethics professor Peter Singer for contending in a recent radio interview that it is \u201creasonable\u201d for government or private insurance companies to deny treatment to severely disabled babies.
