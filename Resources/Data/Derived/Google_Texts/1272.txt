PITTSBURGH (AP) - Too much water will mean no boats - of any kind - at the Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta.

Officials canceled Formula One boat races and all other water-based events for the three-day festival which began Friday because the rain-swollen rivers are unsafe.

Officials were concerned about floating debris and faster-than-normal currents. This year is the first in the event’s 38-year history that all boating events have been canceled. The event normally draws about 500,000 people.

Concerts, the Fourth of July fireworks show, and other land-based events will go on normally.

But Jet Ski stunt shows scheduled Friday through Sunday and an “Anything that Floats” event, also scheduled for Sunday, were also canceled.

Regatta board chairman John Bonassi says, “Obviously, it’s very disappointing, but it’s still going to be a very, very fun-filled weekend.”
