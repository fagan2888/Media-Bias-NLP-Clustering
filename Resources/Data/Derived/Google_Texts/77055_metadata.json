In the piece, I had argued that to convince the majority of Americans that Barack Obama deserved to be removed from office, Republicans would have to demonstrate impeachment was a disinterested act, not a partisan one. To do so, they would have to prove Obama\u2019s \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d were uncommon (that is, not something every president does) and nonpartisan (that is, something Republicans would be punished for as readily as Democrats). Thus they would have to reckon with George W. Bush.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s response? \u201cHow predictable: To be \u2018serious\u2019 about [presidential] lawlessness, must talk about \u2013 all together now \u2013 BUSH!\u201d\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of conservative rhetoric in the Obama era is what a colleague of mine called \u201cthe Godwin\u2019s Law of right-wing debating\u201d: The first person to bring up George W. Bush in a discussion of Obama\u2019s policies automatically loses the debate. As soon as liberal callers mention Bush\u2019s name on the Sean Hannity Show, for instance, Hannity immediately dismisses them as part of the \u201cBlame Bush\u201d crowd. For many conservatives, January 20, 2009, marks an unbridgeable break in time; anything occurring after that date \u2013 so long as it\u2019s bad \u2013 must be a result of Obama\u2019s policy choices and nothing else.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nCall them the \u201cBlameless Bush\u201d crowd. In the waning days of the Bush administration, when his approval ratings bottomed out in the mid-20s, conservatives developed important critiques of the \u201cbig-government conservatism\u201d of the Bush era. In the hyper-partisanship of the Obama years, however, those criticisms quickly disappeared. A year into Obama\u2019s presidency, billboards popped up picturing a smiling Bush with the text \u201cMiss Me Yet?\u201d With a Democratic president to focus their attention on, Bush\u2019s flaws faded away.\n\nConservatives\u2019 response to the current turmoil in Iraq demonstrates just how far this all-is-forgiven attitude extends. Monday morning, Fox News repeatedly ran a clip of Bush warning that U.S. withdrawal from Iraq \u201cwould mean surrendering the future of Iraq to al-Qaida. It would mean that we'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It would mean we'd allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan. It would mean increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous.\u201d The onscreen chyron read \u201cPres Bush Warned Violence Could Resurface in Iraq in 2007.\u201d And Bush\u2019s former chief of staff Andy Card argued, as Republican Sens. Lindsay Graham and John McCain have, that Obama squandered Bush\u2019s \u201csuccesses in Iraq.\u201d\n\nWhat conservatives promoting this narrative omit is that Bush, not Obama, signed the Status of Forces Agreement that called for U.S. troop withdrawal by the end of 2011. Extending U.S. military presence in Iraq past that date required the approval of the Iraqi parliament, and there simply weren\u2019t enough votes for an extension on the terms U.S. military commanders required. Discussing the lack of a Status of Forces Agreement on Fox News Monday, Card said of Obama: \u201cHe created that problem. It wasn\u2019t created by President Bush.\u201d But that\u2019s not true. The terms of an extension, which may not have seemed unworkable in 2008 but which failed in 2011, were explicitly created by Bush and the Iraqi government.\n\n[READ: How U.S. Counterterrorism Goes All Wrong]\n\nThe unraveling of Iraq is due to complex forces. It may well have happened without the U.S. invasion and occupation; the rest of the Middle East is not exactly in a state of harmony at the moment. But the Obama administration\u2019s policies cannot be evaluated properly if one\u2019s understanding of the current situation in Iraq dates to January 20, 2009. (It also cannot be evaluated properly if one\u2019s understanding is limited to U.S. foreign policy. Fred Kaplan at Slate persuasively argues the rise of Sunni jihadist groups \u201chas little to do with the withdrawal of American troops and everything to do with the political failure of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\u201d)\n\nNow, to be fair, not everyone on the right falls in the \u201cBlameless Bush\u201d camp when it comes to Iraq. McCarthy, who brooks no mention of Bush when it comes to impeachment, upbraided Republicans who \u201cblame Obama alone\u201d for the turmoil in Iraq. He\u2019s right to do so, not only because erasing Bush from the equation makes it impossible to understand the shape and trajectory of American foreign policy under Obama, but also because most Americans don\u2019t have that blind spot in their understanding of American politics. When most Americans think about the Great Recession, for example, they understand it as something Obama inherited rather than something he created. The same goes for America\u2019s diminished reputation in the world and external constraints on its foreign policy.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Conservatives Want to Pin Iraq Struggles on Obama, Not Bush", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "January 20, 2009, was not an unbridgeable break in U.S. foreign policy.", "title": "The 'Blameless Bush' Crowd Gets Iraq All Wrong", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nicole-hemmer/2014/06/17/conservatives-want-to-pin-iraq-struggles-on-obama-not-bush", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/fb/dbc63912cfd781f31e4bdf1d97aa87/media:6dab8e18c6324878aa579361b80dbd20ObamaIraq.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Conservatives Want to Pin Iraq Struggles on Obama, Not Bush", "description": "January 20, 2009, was not an unbridgeable break in U.S. foreign policy.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nicole Hemmer,Republican Party,Democratic Party,Obama, Barack,Bush, George W.,Iraq,impeachment,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "January 20, 2009, was not an unbridgeable break in U.S. foreign policy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1bf\"", "article_summary": "McCarthy, who brooks no mention of Bush when it comes to impeachment, upbraided Republicans who \u201cblame Obama alone\u201d for the turmoil in Iraq.\nMonday morning, Fox News repeatedly ran a clip of Bush warning that U.S. withdrawal from Iraq \u201cwould mean surrendering the future of Iraq to al-Qaida.\nIt wasn\u2019t created by President Bush.\u201d But that\u2019s not true.\nFor many conservatives, January 20, 2009, marks an unbridgeable break in time; anything occurring after that date \u2013 so long as it\u2019s bad \u2013 must be a result of Obama\u2019s policy choices and nothing else.\nDiscussing the lack of a Status of Forces Agreement on Fox News Monday, Card said of Obama: \u201cHe created that problem."}
