The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced this week that it would pitch in by donating $50 million to boost emergency efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are working urgently with our partners to identify the most effective ways to help them save lives now and stop transmission of this deadly disease,\u201d said Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Gates Foundation, in a press release. \u201cWe also want to accelerate the development of treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics that can help end this epidemic and prevent future outbreaks.\u201d\n\nIn the press release, the foundation notes that it will give funds to the United Nations agencies and international organizations that are involved in the emergency response, as well as to national governments that are in need of supplies. The press release states that \u201cthe foundation will work with public and private sector partners to accelerate the development of therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics that could be effective in treating patients and preventing further transmission of the disease.\u201d\n\nBut it might be a while before the first Ebola vaccine is produced and distributed. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), only a few experimental treatments for Ebola exist, and they\u2019re all in the early stages of development. One experimental treatment, known as ZMapp, was distributed to Ebola patients and ultimately saved the lives of two infected Americans, Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly. But the CDC states that not enough research has been done on ZMapp to prove that it\u2019s effective \u2014 and there's simply not enough of the supply to distribute it to infected patients.\n\nIn addition, the disease \u2014 which has already infected over 4,000 people and killed over 2,000 \u2013 could take over a year to get under control, much longer than expected. \u201cWe hope we\u2019re wrong,\u201d Bryan Lewis, an epidemiologist at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech, told The New York Times. Though the World Health Organization has stated it hoped to get the epidemic in check within nine months, other researchers aren\u2019t so hopeful. \u201cEbola has a simple trajectory because it\u2019s growing exponentially,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, told the Times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola, bill gates, gates foundation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Gates Foundation hopes to aid in the battle against the Ebola epidemic, which continues to grow exponentially, while baffling scientists and public health workers all over the world.", "title": "Will The Gates Foundation's $50 Million Donation Be Enough To Fight Ebola?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gates-foundation-donates-50-million-boost-ebola-emergency-efforts-it-enough-302964", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/bill-gates.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Gates Foundation hopes to aid in the battle against the Ebola epidemic, which continues to grow exponentially, while baffling scientists and public health workers all over the world.", "title": "Will The Gates Foundation's $50 Million Donation Be Enough To Fight Ebola?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gates-foundation-donates-50-million-boost-ebola-emergency-efforts-it-enough-302964", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/bill-gates.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/bill-gates.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-13T16:09:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T16:09:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Gates Foundation hopes to aid in the battle against the Ebola epidemic, which continues to grow exponentially, while baffling scientists and public health workers all over the world."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e07\"", "article_summary": "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced this week that it would pitch in by donating $50 million to boost emergency efforts.\nAs the Ebola epidemic continues in West Africa, international efforts to fight the disease don\u2019t seem to be making the cut; the disease is growing exponentially.\n\u201cEbola has a simple trajectory because it\u2019s growing exponentially,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, told the Times.\nOne experimental treatment, known as ZMapp, was distributed to Ebola patients and ultimately saved the lives of two infected Americans, Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), only a few experimental treatments for Ebola exist, and they\u2019re all in the early stages of development."}
