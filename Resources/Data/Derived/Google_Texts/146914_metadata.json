Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for president on Tuesday. ( The Blaze Image )\n\nPresidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) got the endorsement Tuesday of one of the founding leaders of the grassroots Tea Party movement.\n\nDana Loesch co-founded the St. Louis Tea Party and quickly became one of the movement's most outspoken national voices. She was an original Breitbart News editor, handpicked by Andrew Breitbart himself, but today is a nationally syndicated radio and television host.\n\nIn deciding to back Cruz, Loesch said she was vetting the Republicans to find the \"most consistent conservative\" in the race. In a statement provided shortly after she announced her endorsement on-air, she said:\n\n\"As one of the original founders of the modern-day Tea Party movement, I watched grassroots conservatives support Ted Cruz' David and Goliath success against Dewhurst and the Republican establishment. Cruz has fought to repeal Obamacare, shrink the size of government; he has defended our gun rights, our right to privacy, our sovereignty and borders. I personally feel that Ted Cruz is the best choice to reverse America's road to ruin and am proud to support him in the 2016 Republican primary.\"\n\nLoesch appears regularly on FOX News, ABC, CBS and CNN, where she advocates relentlessly for conservative principles. She most frequently discusses the Second Amendment, President Obama's executive orders, defunding Obamacare and protecting Americans' Constitutional liberties.\n\n\"Dana is a fearless conservative who is not afraid to confront the liberal media bias head-on,\" Cruz said. \"She is a passionate fighter for liberty and an important voice for conservatives. I am thrilled to have Dana on our team and work together to win the White House in 2016.\"\n\nDraw closer to God. Experience the presence of the Holy Spirit every month as you read Charisma magazine.
