Gary Peters (D-Mich.) for claiming the Michigan woman was lying, slamming Peters for attempting to silence Boonstra.\n\nBoonstra and Americans for Prosperity have teamed up again in a new ad released Tuesday called \u201cJulie Responds.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of Obamacare, I am now stuck with a plan that doesn\u2019t work for me. My choice was taken away from me,\u201d Boonstra said in the new ad. \u201cAll I want is to be listened to.\u201d\n\nBoonstra first appeared in a commercial by the Koch brothers-backed nonprofit that aired in Michigan last week. The cancer patient, who was diagnosed with leukemia five years ago, slammed Peters for voting to pass the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a result of the law\u2019s implementation, Boonstra \u2014 along with millions of Americans \u2014 lost her health insurance plan.\n\nBut Peters, with the help of a team of lawyers, hit back against Boonstra and called on Michigan television stations to cease airing the ads until he received \u201cfactual documentation\u201d for Boonstra\u2019s claims.\n\nThe Michigan Democrat is running for the U.S. Senate in November, facing former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land (R).\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) echoed Peters\u2019 allegations that Boonstra\u2019s story was riddled with falsities, claiming on the Senate floor last week that all Obamacare \u201chorror stories\u201d were, in fact, lies.\n\nBoonstra, however, maintains her assertion that her health insurance plan was cancelled because of Obamacare, leaving her with a costly new one.\n\n\u201cI just want Congressman Peters to help me, to listen to me. Instead, he\u2019s trying to silence me,\u201d the Michigan woman says in the new ad. \u201cCancer is hard enough. I just want to be happy with my plan, and I want it for everyone else out there that\u2019s being hurt by this.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips defended Boonstra in a statement and called on Peters to explain his voting record to Michigan voters feeling the negative affects of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat Gary Peters would attempt to silence Julie\u2019s story rather than defend his vote for Obamacare tells us everything we need to know about the disaster this law has been for middle-class Americans,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cAs Peters and his team can see now, hiding is not going to work. It is time to start listening to real people like Julie instead of political consultants, and admit that Obamacare is not the answer.\u201d\n\nPeters, however, is continuing to fight back against both Boonstra and Americans for Prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe claims in AFP\u2019s original ad have been discredited by local and national media, and any charge that our campaign tried to silence her are absolutely inaccurate. Per standard practice, we asked AFP to provide documentation for claims that AFP paid to air after independent fact checkers said they needed further substantiation,\u201d Haley Morris, a spokeswoman for Peters, told The Hill.\n\nWatch Americans for Prosperity\u2019s new ad, \u201cJulie Responds,\u201d below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Cancer patient Julie Boonstra and Americans for Prosperity are firing back at Rep.
