Balancing the budget, reforming the tax code and entitlements, protecting our national interests \u2013 we want politicians in both parties to roll up their sleeves, get to work, and make hard choices about important issues.\n\nBut most politicians aren\u2019t like most Americans. For them, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Congress right now. On Tuesday, 127 Republicans and 186 Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank. They voted to resurrect a federal agency that benefits foreign governments and a few well-connected corporations at the expense of everyone else\n\nCongress let the Ex-Im Bank expire when its charter ran out in June. Lawmakers did so for one simple reason: As then-Senator Barack Obama Barack ObamaRyan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Stoddard: Clouds loom for Clinton Pelosi, Dems rush to defense of Wasserman Schultz MORE said in 2008, the bank is \u201clittle more than a fund for corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nIt most certainly is. The Export-Import Bank is a New Deal relic originally created to subsidize American exports. The theory was that taxpayer-backed financing would boost American small businesses in the global economy. Reality, however, looks significantly different.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ex-Im helps some companies export their products\u2014roughly 2 percent of America\u2019s exports are financed by the bank. But the vast majority of the Ex-Im\u2019s money doesn\u2019t benefit small businesses. Instead, it goes to multi-national companies with multi-million dollar profit margins. Large companies typically benefit from around 75 to 80 percent of the bank\u2019s money every year. Tellingly, a mere 10 mega-corporations received 64 percent of the bank's financing in 2013\u2014and roughly 30 percent went to just one business.\n\nWhy should hardworking American taxpayers subsidize these corporate profits? The Congressional Budget Office predicts Ex-Im will lose $2 billion over the next decade. That number could quickly grow if the economy takes a turn for the worse. All told, there are roughly $110 billion on Ex-Im\u2019s balance sheet. Another Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac collapse could be just around the corner.\n\nYou won\u2019t hear that from Ex-Im\u2019s beneficiaries, however. Ever since the bank expired, they\u2019ve launched a furious lobbying campaign to convince Congress the sky will fall if they don\u2019t get their subsidies. Yet their threats should be taken with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. They\u2019re little more than a transparent attempt to trick lawmakers into turning the taxpayer spigot back on.\n\nThese special interests also ignore that Ex-Im already harms the economy with every deal it makes.\n\nIt\u2019s Economics 101. Tim Carney at the American Enterprise Institute has shown that when Ex-Im helps a company export, that company\u2019s rivals are automatically put at an unfair disadvantage. They don\u2019t have the same access to taxpayer handouts. Similarly, when a foreign company buys an export with the taxpayer\u2019s help, its American competitors suffer.\n\nPut another way, Ex-Im isn\u2019t just picking winners\u2014it\u2019s picking losers, too. Just look across the economy for proof.\n\nThe largest portion of Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio deals with aircraft exports. When foreign airlines use the bank to buy U.S. planes, they get a leg up on their American competitors. The Air Line Pilots Association estimates that Ex-Im\u2019s preferential treatment of only two foreign airlines \u2013 Emirates and Air India \u2013 has eliminated 7,500 jobs here at home. This number would only grow if you add in the hundreds of other aircraft deals financed by the bank.\n\nMore broadly, Daniel Ikenson at the Cato Institute found that nearly every sector of American manufacturing gets harmed by Ex-Im. Appliances, electronics, textiles, and nearly 200 other industries others are among the bank\u2019s victims, losing more than they gain from Ex-Im benefits. All told, this costs American companies in these areas at least $2.8 billion every year.\n\nThis money could have been used to create jobs and grow the economy. Apparently that\u2019s less important than giving corporate welfare to a well-connected few.\n\nYet special treatment for special interests is what passes for a bipartisan cause in Washington, D.C. these days. As the vote for the Export-Import Bank on Tuesday shows, almost every congressional Democrats and a majority of Republicans are already willing to put special interests above Americans\u2019 interests. Who knew that was something both parties could support?\n\nKoenig is senior policy advisor at Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "For politicians, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.", "description": "For politicians, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "For politicians, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.", "title": "Corporate welfare cuts across party lines", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/258425-corporate-welfare-cuts-across-party-lines", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/258425-corporate-welfare-cuts-across-party-lines", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-29T13:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Andy Koenig", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Barack Obama,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-29T13:30:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/258425-corporate-welfare-cuts-across-party-lines", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "For politicians, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.", "card": "summary", "title": "Corporate welfare cuts across party lines"}, "dcterms.title": "Corporate welfare cuts across party lines"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a13\"", "article_summary": "Yet special treatment for special interests is what passes for a bipartisan cause in Washington, D.C. these days.\nFor them, bipartisanship is an excuse to dole out tax dollars to special interests.\nWhy should hardworking American taxpayers subsidize these corporate profits?\nAll told, this costs American companies in these areas at least $2.8 billion every year.\nThese special interests also ignore that Ex-Im already harms the economy with every deal it makes."}
