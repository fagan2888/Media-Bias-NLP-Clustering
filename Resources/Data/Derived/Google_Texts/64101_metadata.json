(AP) - Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery business Greg Calhoun have purchased a former latex glove and condom factory in Eufaula.\n\nThe factory, now called AmeriTech Glove Factory, reopened last week after being shuttered for five years, Calhoun told AL.com in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt is the only latex glove facility in the U.S. We have a commitment from Walmart \u2026. We met with the chairman of Walmart Doug McMillon, me and Steve Harvey, and we strategized on how we could bring jobs back to the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nCalhoun said 25 employees are currently working at the factory, testing the new products.\n\n\u201cBy January, we will have our first line up and running,\u201d he said, adding he hopes the factory will have 75-100 employees by the end of 2015 and 300 employees by the end of next year.\n\nThe Montgomery-based businessman said he is also in talks with and hopes to manufacture gloves for Tyson Foods and the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nCalhoun and Harvey have been friends for 15 to 20 years, Calhoun said, and when the comedian decided to branch out into the business world he asked Calhoun to join him. They formed the investment group, HarCal, which is combination of both of their last names.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to have Mr. Steve Harvey commit to Alabama to do business,\u201d Calhoun said. He looked at a lot of others states, and he chose Memphis, Tenn. and Alabama.\n\nHarCal entered into a partnership with Memphis-based Monogram Foods to launch a new product called Easy Bacon. The product will go on sale in Publix, Kroger and Walmart supermarkets in Atlanta on Oct. 1.\n\nEasy Bacon cooks to a crisp in two minutes, one minute on each side, Calhoun said.\n\nThe product will go national in January.\n\nHarCal has also partnered with Vanguard Soap Co. based in Memphis to create a line of soaps called Bilt.\n\nCalhoun has extensive experience in the supermarket industry. He formerly owned two grocery store warehouses in the Dallas area, and four supermarkets in Montgomery.\n\nCalhoun Enterprises still owns stores in Tuskegee and Selma.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery business Greg Calhoun have purchased a former latex glove and condom factory in Eufaula.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/22/comedian-steve-harvey-business-partner-reopen-late/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery business Greg Calhoun have purchased a former latex glove and condom factory in Eufaula.", "title": "Comedian Steve Harvey, business partner reopen latex factory"}, "twitter": {"description": "Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery business Greg Calhoun have purchased a former latex glove and condom factory in Eufaula.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Comedian Steve Harvey, business partner reopen latex factory"}, "Author": "ERIN EDGEMON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe46b7\"", "article_summary": "MONTGOMERY, Ala.
