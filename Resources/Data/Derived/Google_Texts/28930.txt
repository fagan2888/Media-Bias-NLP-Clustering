Nebraska officials say they've taken action to protect residents of two nursing homes run by an ailing Utah company.

The office of Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson says a judge in Brown County on Thursday placed Ainsworth Care Center into receivership with Klaasmeyer & Associates in Omaha. A judge in Burt County did the same with Logan Valley Manor in Lyons. Under receivership, Klaasmeyer & Associates will take over management and operation of both homes.

The state of Kansas seized control of Deseret Healthcare in Wichita earlier this week, after employees complained to KAKE's on Your Side Problem Solvers about not being paid on time.

Peterson's office sought the receiverships at the request of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

Officials say both homes are owned by Deseret Health Group, headquartered in Bountiful, Utah. Peterson's office says Deseret Health had told Nebraska officials that it was ceasing operations at the nursing homes and been unable to pay staffers.
