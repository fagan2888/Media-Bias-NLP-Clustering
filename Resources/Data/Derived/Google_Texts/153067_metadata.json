Jeter tipped his helmet to fans when he left the game for a pinch runner in the third inning of the Yankees\u2019 9-5 win.\n\nHe had no idea that past captains of local pro teams would come out of the Red Sox dugout to embrace him as he stood on the outfield grass just behind shortstop during the ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to envision what would happen because this is a place where we\u2019ve been an enemy for a long, long time,\u201d Jeter said, \u201cand for them to flip the switch this last time coming here made me feel extremely proud.\u201d\n\nOne by one, the captains came, starting with Carl Yastrzemski. He was Boston\u2019s left fielder on Oct. 2, 1978, in one of the rivalries\u2019 most memorable games. Captain Carl could only look up as a much-less accomplished Yankees shortstop, light-hitting Bucky Dent, lofted a three-run homer that lifted the Yankees to a 5-4 win in a one-game AL East playoff.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about how great this rivalry has been over the years and all the things that have happened - the playoff games, everything,\u201d Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how people could really unite a crowd like he did today.\n\n\u201cSuch big rivals, so much history between the teams, but you would have thought that it was one team in a sense today. And I don\u2019t know how many players can do that in any sport. But I think it shows you the respect he has even against your toughest rival.\u201d\n\nThe other former captains who embraced Jeter during the half-hour ceremony were Jason Varitek of the Red Sox, Bobby Orr of the Bruins, Troy Brown of the New England Patriots and Paul Pierce of the Celtics.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, the date \u201cSEPTEMBER 28 2014\u201d was removed, one character at a time, from the hand-operated scoreboard on the left-field wall and replaced by \u201cWITH RESPECT 2 DEREK JETER.\u201d Then the \u201cS\u201d in \u201cRESPECT\u201d was replaced by the No. 2.\n\nJeter, the designated hitter, waved his cap to a crowd as he left the dugout for his 153rd game at Fenway, including the playoffs, breaking a tie with Lou Gehrig and Mantle for most among Yankees.\n\nIt\u2019s the field where the Yankees clinched the AL championship series in 1999 and the AL East title in 2005. It\u2019s also the place where the Yankees took a 3-0 lead in the 2004 ALCS then lost the next two games at Fenway and the series in New York. Boston went on to its first World Series title in 86 years.\n\nBoston second baseman Dustin Pedroia presented a base with a No. 2 and blue pinstripes on it to Jeter. He also received a green sign with white characters like those on the Green Monster scoreboard saying \u201cRE2PECT.\u201d\n\nA video was shown of Jeter being doused in the Yankees clubhouse as part of the \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d inspired by former Boston College baseball captain Pete Frates to raise awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, a condition Frates is afflicted with. Then Frates rode onto the infield grass in his wheelchair and Jeter came in to greet him.\n\nMichelle Brooks Thompson, a Massachusetts native from the Voice TV show, sang \u201cRespect\u201d on the infield dirt then Jeter shook hands and hugged her as the cheers poured down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a part of some chants here at Fenway Park,\u201d Jeter said with a laugh, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if any of them were good.\u201d\n\nAfter his chop single to third baseman Garin Cecchini - his 3,465th hit and 1,311th RBI - Jeter got a standing ovation as Brian McCann came out to pinch run and he slowly ran off the field to complete his 20th big league season, pointed to the Boston dugout and embraced pitcher Clay Buchholz.\n\nHe said he told Buchholz, \u201cI know this is kind of odd but I just want to say I\u2019ve enjoyed competing against you over the years and good luck.\u201d\n\nApproaching the Yankees dugout after the team\u2019s last at-bat by a player with single-digit uniform number, the 40-year-old who has worn No. 2 since his rookie season lifted his helmet to recognize the cheers and was hugged on the warning track by Mark Teixeira and Brett Gardner. Boston players stood in their dugout and applauded.\n\nThe ovation continued as others in his dugout congratulated their leader. Jeter\u2019s parents watched from the stands.\n\nThe final hit left him with a .310 career batting average, raising it from 30945 to .30951. And it came at Fenway Park, the same field where Mantle played his finale exactly 46 years earlier.\n\nJeter had lined out to shortstop Jemile Weeks in the first inning.\n\nThe last active member of the Core Four that included Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, Jeter led the Yankees to 13 AL East titles, seven AL pennants and five World Series championships. He broke an ankle in the 2012 AL championship series opener and was limited to 17 games the following season. He dropped off this year to a .256 average with four homers and 50 RBIs.\n\nBefore the game, Boston manager John Farrell praised Jeter for \u201ca grace and a dignity, an integrity that probably is unmatched by others.\u201d\n\nJeter said he considered not playing in Boston after his dramatic walk off single in his Yankee Stadium finale on Thursday night. He sat out Friday night\u2019s game but went 1 for 2 as the designated hitter Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of fans that told me that they came a long way to see these last games so I felt it was right to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI played out of respect for this rivalry and the fans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the last day of his remarkable career, Derek Jeter performed one final amazing feat.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On the last day of his remarkable career, Derek Jeter performed one final amazing feat.", "title": "Derek Jeter has RBI single in last at-bat", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/28/jeter-in-lineup-for-farewell-game-at-fenway-park/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/27/2620e8860916ea26600f6a7067007e1e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/27/2620e8860916ea26600f6a7067007e1e.jpg", "description": "On the last day of his remarkable career, Derek Jeter performed one final amazing feat.", "card": "summary", "title": "Derek Jeter has RBI single in last at-bat"}, "Author": "HOWARD ULMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Then Frates rode onto the infield grass in his wheelchair and Jeter came in to greet him.\nBOSTON (AP) - On the last day of his remarkable career, Derek Jeter performed one final amazing feat.\nIt\u2019s the field where the Yankees clinched the AL championship series in 1999 and the AL East title in 2005.\nJeter tipped his helmet to fans when he left the game for a pinch runner in the third inning of the Yankees\u2019 9-5 win.\nHe broke an ankle in the 2012 AL championship series opener and was limited to 17 games the following season."}
