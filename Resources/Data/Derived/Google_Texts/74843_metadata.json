Several federal employee health benefit providers now offer coverage this care, and, perhaps most significantly, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), more transgender people are gaining insurance coverage and protection through the Exchanges and Medicaid. Although we are still awaiting formal regulations from HHS, the Office of Civil Rights has clarified that Section 1557 of the ACA prohibits discrimination against transgender people in health programs that receive federal funding, including insurance coverage.\n\nNow for the flip side: a dearth of providers and systems to provide adequate coverage. Consider the following:\n\nGeneral healthcare practitioners frequently lack cultural competency and clinical knowledge about transgender health issues. Most medical schools do not provide sufficient cultural competency training pertaining to transgender people.\n\nThere are very few providers of transition-related surgery; most geographic areas have none. And even where providers exist, they are not accustomed to taking insurance for transgender-related services and typically have no systems in place to do so.\n\nEven when coverage exists, provider reimbursement is frequently inadequate and transgender people face daunting obstacles before insurance will actually pay for care.\n\nThere is no accreditation of training for transgender-related medical services, nor is there certification of expertise in transgender medicine. Although the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) provides Standards of Care for transgender healthcare, this guidance is non-binding for providers and insurers.\n\nThere have been modest signs of progress. New guidelines to improve the healthcare provided to LGBT people have been published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. In the District of Columbia, HRC is supporting legislation that would require that healthcare providers receive such training on an ongoing basis.\n\nBut without sufficient standardization, and as demand for transgender-related medical services grows, transgender people are increasingly at risk of receiving inappropriate or negligent care that can result in physical and psychological suffering.\n\nInsurance providers, hospitals, and physicians must take a serious look at how to professionalize their care of transgender clients and patients, and how to ensure that needed medical services are available. Because of a legacy of excluding transgender people from healthcare, it will take several years to fully integrate transgender-related healthcare into our health systems. But make no mistake, this complex and often frustrating work is necessary to ensure that transgender people have access to medically necessary care that is competent, sensitive, and free from discrimination.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Over the past few years, there has been a heartening and historic trend toward expanding insurance access for transgender people.", "author": "Human Rights Campaign", "og": {"url": "http://www.hrc.org/blog/coverage-is-not-enough-working-for-comprehensive-transgender-healthcare/", "image": "/files/images/meta_images/health_share200.jpg", "site_name": "Human Rights Campaign", "description": "Over the past few years, there has been a heartening and historic trend toward expanding insurance access for transgender people.", "title": "Coverage is Not Enough: Working for Comprehensive Transgender Healthcare | Human Rights Campaign"}, "image": "/files/images/meta_images/health_share200.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFDF1B", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 548530806, "app_id": 977970605575576}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "twitter": {"image": "/files/images/meta_images/health_share200.jpg", "title": "Human Rights Campaign", "description": "Over the past few years, there has been a heartening and historic trend toward expanding insurance access for transgender people.", "card": "summary", "site": "@HRC"}, "theme-color": "#FFDF1B"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf591\"", "article_summary": "Although the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) provides Standards of Care for transgender healthcare, this guidance is non-binding for providers and insurers.\nBecause of a legacy of excluding transgender people from healthcare, it will take several years to fully integrate transgender-related healthcare into our health systems.\nThere is no accreditation of training for transgender-related medical services, nor is there certification of expertise in transgender medicine.\nIn the District of Columbia, HRC is supporting legislation that would require that healthcare providers receive such training on an ongoing basis.\nConsider the following:General healthcare practitioners frequently lack cultural competency and clinical knowledge about transgender health issues."}
