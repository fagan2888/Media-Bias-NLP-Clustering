Nearly 0.65 inches of rain dropped in less than half an hour, the National Weather Service said, dousing crowds at the Capitol Hill People\u2019s Fair in Civic Center park.\n\nAbout 2:15 p.m., an inch or two of standing water was still on downtown streets under a sunny sky after the storm moved east to the plains. A couple of hours later, tornado warnings were issued for Fort Morgan and for Kit Carson County in far eastern Colorado.\n\nThe prognosis for Saturday evening along the Front Range was less grim than in recent days, which saw tornadoes, heavy rain and hail occurring frequently.\n\nBut forecasters cautioned that scattered storms could turn severe Saturday night. At 4:40 p.m., the Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch through midnight for northeastern Colorado, including much of the metro area. About 7 p.m., country singer Luke Bryan\u2019s concert at Sports Authority Field was delayed by lightning, prompting fans to crowd stadium concourses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have another round of scattered heavy rain and hail today and tomorrow,\u201d Weather Service meteorologist Chad Gimmestad said Saturday. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll be back to normal warm temperatures on Monday.\u201d\n\nAlthough the risk was considered low, heavy rain of more than an inch per hour could cause localized flooding, given saturated soils, according to the Weather Service\u2019s midafternoon forecast.\n\nFor Sunday, the Weather Service was predicting a lower chance of severe storms, putting the chance of rain at 60 percent for Denver, mainly after 5 p.m.\n\nThe high temperature is forecast to reach 74 degrees, before warming to 80 on Monday under partly sunny skies and a 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms.\n\nEach day through next Saturday is forecast to have a slight chance of storms, holding out the hope of a drier week.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Another round of storms possible in Denver", "title": "Another round of storms possible in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/another-round-of-storms-possible-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_051109_weather-rain-colorado.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_051109_weather-rain-colorado.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T17:06:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:09:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll have another round of scattered heavy rain and hail today and tomorrow,\u201d Weather Service meteorologist Chad Gimmestad said Saturday.\nFor Sunday, the Weather Service was predicting a lower chance of severe storms, putting the chance of rain at 60 percent for Denver, mainly after 5 p.m.\nAfter Friday night\u2019s storms toppled power lines and brought a monsoon of heavy rainfall, another downpour hit downtown Denver early Saturday afternoon.\nThe prognosis for Saturday evening along the Front Range was less grim than in recent days, which saw tornadoes, heavy rain and hail occurring frequently.\nBut forecasters cautioned that scattered storms could turn severe Saturday night."}
