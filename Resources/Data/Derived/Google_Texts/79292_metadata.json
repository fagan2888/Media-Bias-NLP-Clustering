The Sheriff says the men were helping patch county roads when they disappeared.\n\nThe two men were working just east of Summit when they walked off from their work crew. Sheriff Charles Pearson said he's disappointed because they were trusted to be out in the community.\n\n\n\nDeputies with the Muskogee County Sheriffs Office and members of a U.S. Marshals task force started looking for Mark Stubblefield and James Thomson Monday afternoon when the inmates ran from their work crew.\n\nStubblefield and Thomson were awaiting trial on various charges including forgery, drug possession and outstanding warrants.\n\n\"It's just unfortunate. It's a program where were trying to get non-violent offenders and we're trying to help them,\" said Muskogee County Sheriff Charles Pearson.\n\nPearson says inmates with good behavior and non-violent charges are allowed to apply for the work program.\n\n\n\nJust after noon on Tuesday, deputies found Thomson at a home in Muskogee. Originally officials said Stubblefield was caught hours later, around 7:00 Tuesday night, at a federal building about a block from the jail. It was later said he turned himself in.\n\nSummit resident David Milligan watched deputies search for the inmates around his home. He doesn't understand why inmates on the work crew would run off like that.\n\n\"It's really a privilege instead of sitting in jail all day long, so they've lost that privilege forever,\" he said.\n\nMilligan believes the inmate work crew program is a benefit for taxpayers.\n\n\"It helps. It keeps from paying our county and city workers from patching these holes; we get some use out of them from people that's done bad,\" he said.\n\nSheriff Pearson says new security measures will now be added to the work crew program.\n\n\n\n\"You think that we just put them in jail - we just let them sit there. These men were trying to work with them and help them,\"the sheriff said.\n\nThe sheriff said thee non-violent inmates could now face charges of escape.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Inmates on a work detail escaped Monday in Muskogee County, a county commissioner confirms.
