(Published Saturday, Dec. 27, 2014)\n\nA North Texas teenager got a big surprise this week when he learned he\u2019s part of one of the Huffington Post\u2019s \u201cBest White House Photos of 2014.\u201d\n\nThe president \"was like, \u2018c\u2019mon man, show me some moves.\u2019 I was like, \u2018what do I do?\u2019\u201d Suber said.\n\n\u201cHe was asking me to show him some Taekwondo moves. He was like, \u2018Show me!\u2019 And I was sitting there giggling and smiling the whole time, I couldn\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nSuber's doctors at Children\u2019s Medical Center Dallas helped connect him several years ago with the Make-A-Wish Foundation . Suber\u2019s wish was to meet the president.\n\nIt finally happened on March 20, 2014 in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cHe opened the door and he was like, \u2018Hey Jaren, what\u2019s up?\u2019 He gave me a handshake and he hugged me. He was a really nice guy and down to earth,\u201d Suber said.\n\n\u201cHe was like a friend who just comes over your house all the time. He was very polite and he wasn\u2019t stiff at all, just comfortable. He made me feel comfortable,\" Suber added.\n\nJaren\u2019s mom Karen Suber said the president \"made us feel like family, like he was an uncle or a relative coming to visit and catch up.\"\n\nJaren and his parents spent about 25 minutes alone in the Oval Office with the president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kinder, softer side to him,\" Karen Suber said. \"He\u2019s a caring man with a family. Not only does he make important decisions that affect the world, but at the end of the day he\u2019s also a dad.\"\n\nSuber said he wanted to meet the president for a simple reason.\n\n\"He\u2019s a role model to me,\" Suber explained. \"He knows how to persevere and be calm and focused. Even when people hate him and are always negative, he just stays calm and collected and fights on.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama was impressed when Suber asked the president about his plans to fund pediatric cancer research.\n\nThe two talked for a few minutes about cancer research, Suber\u2019s health and then the topic turned to the teenager's hobbies.\n\nThat\u2019s when Jaren told him he was a black belt. President Obama laughed and stepped back into a fighting stance.\n\nBut the Suber\u2019s say the President\u2019s fighting technique can use a little work.\n\n\u201cI was laughing. It was hilarious,\u201d Karen Suber said. \u201cBut then I\u2019m also thinking, you\u2019re wide open. He can come in with some move and get ya!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had his hands like this, and you\u2019re supposed to keep it like this,\u201d Jaren Suber explained, noting the president\u2019s hands should\u2019ve been closer together to protect his face and body.\n\nJaren\u2019s mother said the moment was a bit unforgettable. But now, it\u2019s one of the Huffington Post\u2019s Best White House Photos of the Year\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud and honored to be his mom. And to go there and be able to meet the president? Wow. That\u2019s something no one can ever take away from us,\u201d Karen Suber said.\n\nJaren Suber finished up his last round of chemotherapy a few days ago.\n\n\"We got the most amazing, the best Christmas present ever. His treatment is over,\u201d Karen Suber said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A North Texas teen inspires President Obama to &quot;strike a fighting stance.&quot; The Make-A-Wish teen also learns about his diagnosis.", "title": "Rowlett Teen Inspires President's Fight Stance", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth", "description": "A North Texas teen inspires President Obama to \"strike a fighting stance.\" The Make-A-Wish teen also learns about his diagnosis.", "title": "Rowlett Teen Inspires President's Fight Stance", "url": "http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Rowlett-Teen-Inspires-Presidents-Fight-Stance-286942231.html", "image": "http://media.nbcdfw.com/images/1200*675/122714+White+House+Photo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A North Texas teen inspires President Obama to \"strike a fighting stance.\" The Make-A-Wish teen also learns about his diagnosis.", "title": "Rowlett Teen Inspires President's Fight Stance", "url": "http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Rowlett-Teen-Inspires-Presidents-Fight-Stance-286942231.html", "image": "http://media.nbcdfw.com/images/1200*675/122714+White+House+Photo.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcdfw", "site": "@nbcdfw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 79562228021}, "keywords": "President Obama, Jaren Suber, Karen, Rowlett, Oval Office, Taekwondo", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcdfw", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JeffSmithJournalist"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "President Obama, Jaren Suber, Karen, Rowlett, Oval Office, Taekwondo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee63\"", "article_summary": "But now, it\u2019s one of the Huffington Post\u2019s Best White House Photos of the Year\u201cI\u2019m really proud and honored to be his mom.\nThat\u2019s something no one can ever take away from us,\u201d Karen Suber said.\nJaren Suber finished up his last round of chemotherapy a few days ago.\nHis treatment is over,\u201d Karen Suber said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kinder, softer side to him,\" Karen Suber said."}
