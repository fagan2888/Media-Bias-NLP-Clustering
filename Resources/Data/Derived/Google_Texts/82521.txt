The House of Representatives continue to look at ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Though a repeal passed through both chambers of congress months ago and the president vetoed it, it doesn't mean members of congress are giving up just yet.

It's been nearly six years of turmoil in Washington over the Affordable Care Act and now with some state exchanges closing down around the country, Republician members of Congress highlighting flaws in the cleanup.

Congressman Rick Allen recently introduced legislation that he says will prevent the american tax payer from being held financially accountable when exchanges shut down. Right now, he says the taxpayer has funded the state's exchanges.

Now, if an exchange does fail, his legislation would require unused funds be returned to the treasury department to work down the national debt. This includes funds and equipment used to run the exchanges.

Allen says states should be keeping records and properly reporting how these federal funds have been spent.

"Forty-nine its all about accountability, basically an audit process. We want to go back into the states and if there's any money left we want to bring back that money to reduce our debt", said Rick Allen.

We reached out to the department of health and human services multiple times for an interview but were not granted one. In a statement they say: 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act and the uninsured rate has fallen to the lowest on record. Unfortunately, partisan efforts in the house of representatives to repeal key parts of the ACA do the opposite.
