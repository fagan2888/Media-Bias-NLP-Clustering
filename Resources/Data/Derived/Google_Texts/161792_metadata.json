Zabilka [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\n4278847\n\nThe University of Kansas has reduced student employment hours from 30 hours a week to 20 hours a week due to the Affordable Care Act mandate that compels employers to provide health insurance to part-time workers, Campus Reform reports.\n\nGraduate students can work no more than 29 hours.\n\n\u201cThe revised policy seeks to balance the necessity for students to make academic progress while managing potential fiscal liabilities with ACA,\u201d vice provost for administration and finance Diane Goddard said in an email to the departments obtained by The University Daily Kansan.\n\nAccording to The Daily Kansan, Director of Human Resources Ola Faucher estimates that nearly 5,000 student employees and every university department will be impacted by the cutbacks in employment hours.\n\nHowever, KU spokesman Gavin Young told KSHB Kansas City that of their student workers, \u201cthere are very few who are actually working over the 20 hour limit, comparatively.\u201d\n\nStudent workers are concerned at how the university\u2019s new policy will affect them.\n\nSenior Elizabeth Melton, for instance, works at KU\u2019s Anschutz Library 25 hours a week. With the cutbacks, Melton will have to take out more student loans.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have enough money to pay for all my expenses next semester,\u201d Melton told The Daily Kansan. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to be in a lot more debt once I graduate than I would have been normally, because I was trying to kinda keep up with it just so I didn\u2019t have to take out a loan, and now I do.\u201d\n\nAnother student, senior Rachel Prather, works at a tutoring center and isn\u2019t sure how she will be able to afford food.\n\n\u201cI need any extra income I can get, and that means every hour of the day that I\u2019m not in class I\u2019m working and I value that a lot,\u201d Prather told KSHB. \u201cI can\u2019t really imagine how I\u2019m going to buy groceries on twenty hours or less a week.\u201d\n\nSenior Kristina Nielander also told KSHB that finding off-campus employment to offset the reduction in on-campus work hours would not be a good alternative.\n\n\u201cIf I have a test to study for I can let them know, and they can give me any time off that I need, but I know that would not be the case if I was working a service job,\u201d Nielander said.\n\nAccording to KSHB, students at KU aren\u2019t blaming the university or President Barack Obama, but are instead blaming Obamacare\u2019s unintended consequences.\n\nFollow Aaron on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Aaron Bandler", "description": "'I can't really imagine how I\u2019m going to buy groceries on twenty hours or less a week'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The University of Kansas has reduced student employment hours from 30 hours a week to 20 hours a week due to the Affordable Care Act mandate that compels employers to provide health insurance to part-", "title": "University Reducing Student Work Hours Thanks To Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/06/university-reducing-student-work-hours-thanks-to-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 958, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Spooner_Hall_University_of_Kansas-e1407342697552.jpg", "height": 411}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I can't really imagine how I'm going to buy groceries on twenty hours or less a week'", "title": "University Reducing Student Work Hours Thanks To Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/06/university-reducing-student-work-hours-thanks-to-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Spooner_Hall_University_of_Kansas-e1407342697552.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-06 12:34:41", "sailthru.title": "University Reducing Student Work Hours Thanks To Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,aaron-bandler", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare,university of kansas", "sailthru.description": "The University of Kansas has reduced student employment hours from 30 hours a week to 20 hours a week due to the Affordable Care Act mandate that compels employers to provide health insurance to part-", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Spooner_Hall_University_of_Kansas-e1407342697552.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "According to KSHB, students at KU aren\u2019t blaming the university or President Barack Obama, but are instead blaming Obamacare\u2019s unintended consequences.\nAccording to The Daily Kansan, Director of Human Resources Ola Faucher estimates that nearly 5,000 student employees and every university department will be impacted by the cutbacks in employment hours.\nGraduate students can work no more than 29 hours.\nSenior Elizabeth Melton, for instance, works at KU\u2019s Anschutz Library 25 hours a week.\n\u201cI need any extra income I can get, and that means every hour of the day that I\u2019m not in class I\u2019m working and I value that a lot,\u201d Prather told KSHB."}
