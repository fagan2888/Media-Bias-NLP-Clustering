Since arriving in Washington in 2013, the Texas senator has been a thorn in the leadership\u2019s side. Now he may be the Republican elected official best positioned to stop Donald Trump.\n\nThe fifth Republican presidential debate was really two fights in one. Cruz and Marco Rubio fighting each other while almost everyone else tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to drag Trump down to their level. Why?\n\nCruz is surging in Iowa. There\u2019s no guarantee Cruz hasn\u2019t peaked too soon\u2014this is closer to the point when Ron Paul moved into first place there four years ago than when eventual caucus winner Rick Santorum did\u2014but he\u2019s a natural fit for the caucus electorate.\n\nNearly three out of five Iowa caucus-goers were evangelical or born-again Christians, according to the 2012 entrance poll. Cruz is the son of an evangelical pastor who is a popular conservative circuit speaker in his own right. He even launched his presidential campaign at the Jerry Falwell-founded Liberty University.\n\nAlmost two out of three caucus-goers identified with the Tea Party four years ago. Cruz is perhaps the politician most associated with this populist conservative movement. He won his Senate seat by beating the sitting lieutenant governor of Texas in a Republican Party with the support of Tea Party groups and over the opposition of the party\u2019s governing wing.\n\nIf something has needed defunding, from Obamacare to Planned Parenthood, Cruz has been there ready to defund it. That\u2019s true even when the legislative fight is hopeless or, from the point of view of more established Republicans, counterproductive.\n\nBut grassroots conservatives want Obamacare to go away. They want to overturn Roe v. Wade. They want to see the government tax, spend and regulate less. They don\u2019t want to hear from Republicans who say it can\u2019t be done. When Cruz says that these battles are simply a matter of political will, he is telling them what they want to hear.\n\nPlaying to these sentiments has gone a long way toward making Cruz the most hated man in Washington. Compared to Trump, however, Cruz is Bob Dole (a comparison neither man would find flattering): a polished elected official with experience putting together winning political coalitions who is running on familiar, more or less mainstream Republican issues. Or to put it another way, Cruz is very much a creature of the conservative movement that helped produce Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency while Trump is something unique.\n\nTrump has emerged as a real threat to win the Republican nomination because he has married angry Tea Party conservatives with downscale, more secular disenchanted white voters who more closely resemble Ross Perot\u2019s voters than Reagan\u2019s. Cruz is the best bet for prying the most conservative of those voters away\u2014Jeb Bush certainly isn\u2019t going to take them\u2014but he must get past Rubio first.\n\nThat\u2019s why Cruz was so careful to avoid challenging Trump directly while he hit Rubio at nearly every opportunity. The two candidates returned the favor. Trump declined to repeat recent criticisms of Cruz, suggesting he was fine with the Texan, while Rubio took issue with his U.S. Senate colleague often.\n\nCruz\u2019s rise in Iowa could be helpful to his party for two reasons. One, Trump is heavily reliant on momentum. There\u2019s a reason that a big part of every Trump campaign speech is devoted to reciting all the poll results showing him in the lead. That was his go-to whenever he was hit during Tuesday night\u2019s debate.\n\nTrump is a runaway train chugging through the Republican nominating process. If Cruz beats him in Iowa, he could derail the Trump train entirely. Or at the very least, he could keep a Trump win in New Hampshire or South Carolina from giving the reality TV star an aura of inevitability.\n\nTwo, while Cruz is among the most conservative Republicans in Washington, his ascendancy reorients the race around issues with which the rest of the GOP is familiar\u2014tax cuts, abortion, family values\u2014rather than Trump\u2019s platform on immigration and trade, which is divisive to some Republicans and alien to others.\n\nYes, Cruz is combative when it comes to fighting with Democrat and Republican leadership. But when conservatives are divided on issues, as they are on immigration reform or the NSA, he can be a skilled and diplomatic difference-splitter.\n\nBut the party establishment and many conservative elites vastly prefer Rubio to Cruz. They think the Floridian is a better general election candidate and someone with whom they can do business once office. Early state victories by Cruz threaten to make Rubio\u2019s path more arduous.\n\nSome Republican donors and politicos don\u2019t even think Cruz is obviously preferable to Trump. While he has not fully embraced either Trump\u2019s position on immigration or the Ron/Rand Paul libertarians\u2019 positions on surveillance and foreign policy, Cruz has inched in their direction on both counts, threatening to bring them both further into the Republican mainstream.\n\nAs well, some establishment Republicans believe Trump is a celebrity who has his own brand identity which can be differentiated from the GOP\u2019s while Cruz can more easily remake the party in his image.\n\nThus there seems to be a lack of interest in taking the fight to Trump unless it is evident that someone like Jeb Bush, John Kasich or Rubio will benefit.\n\nCruz probably had a better debate than Rubio, and certainly a better one than even an improved Kasich or Bush. But expect some of Cruz\u2019s more lawyerly moments debating immigration to be thoroughly scrutinized by Rubio-friendly commentators in the coming days. Also anticipate more articles about Cruz suddenly becoming an \u201cisolationist.\u201d\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ted Cruz is very much a creature of the conservative movement that helped produce Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency while Trump is something unique.", "dcterms.title": "Cruz Could Destroy the GOP Establishment\u2014And Save It", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "Ted Cruz is very much a creature of the conservative movement that helped produce Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency while Trump is something unique.", "title": "Cruz Could Destroy the GOP Establishment\u2014And Save It", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/feature/cruz-could-destroy-the-gop-establishment%E2%80%94-save-it-14638", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/Cruz%20Red.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.subject": "Politics, United States, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, GOP Establishmen, reagan, Jeb Bush", "abstract": "Ted Cruz is very much a creature of the conservative movement that helped produce Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency while Trump is something unique.", "description": "Ted Cruz is very much a creature of the conservative movement that helped produce Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency while Trump is something unique.", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "W.
