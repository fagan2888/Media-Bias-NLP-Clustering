It\u2019s demagoguery.\"\n\nBut the mutual animus extends back at least to January, when Cruz impugned Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values\u201d during a GOP debate.\n\nThat episode prompted de Blasio to declare himself \u201cdisgusted,\u201d and then raise money off the spat.\n\nThe combatively conservative senator from Texas said Wednesday that he\u2019s hoping to make New York State\u2019s April 19 Republican primary a competitive one, even if Trump\u2019s lead currently looks prohibitive.\n\nPitting himself against de Blasio, who is unpopular among New York Republicans, can\u2019t hurt.\n\nThe crowd at the Women\u2019s National Republican Club seemed to dislike de Blasio as much as Cruz did. Manhattan Republican Party chair Adele Malpass publicly hoped for a one-term mayor in her introductory remarks.\n\nWhen Cruz invoked de Blasio\u2019s name, the audience would laugh or jeer.\n\n\u201cWhen the heroes of the NYPD stood up and turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio, they spoke not just for the men and women of New York, but for Americans all across this nation,\u201d said Cruz, referring to one of the darkest moments in de Blasio\u2019s mayoralty.\n\nCruz was briefly drowned out by applause.\n\nThe senator also doubled down on his contention that de Blasio was wrongheaded to shut down his predecessor\u2019s Muslim surveillance unit, something Cruz would like to see expanded.\n\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s response is essentially, \u2018Who are these terrorists of which you speak?'\u201d said Cruz to laughter. \u201cLook, it is that ostrich-head-in-your-sand political correctness that has made America so vulnerable.\u201d\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters after the speech, a reporter asked Cruz if his denigration of New York values might hurt him among New Yorkers who might well subscribe to those values, whatever they are.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not worried at all, because the people of New York understand first-hand the liberal, left-wing values of New York politicians,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, he argued, they have suffered under those very values, \"Whether it is men and women in upstate New York and western New York who would like to work and have high-paying jobs, but liberal politicians prohibit fracking so they don\u2019t get the same high-paying jobs that people in Pennsylvania get, or whether it is African American and Hispanic schoolchildren here in the city of New York who Mayor de Blasio tried to throw out of their charter schools because he is, in effect, bought and paid for by the teacher union bosses.\"\n\nCruz railing against de Blasio probably doesn't hurt the mayor either, since Cruz is not exactly popular with de Blasio\u2019s liberal base.\n\n\u201cWe understand why Ted Cruz is lashing out,\u201d said de Blasio spokeswoman Karen Hinton. \u201cHe's not going to be the Republican nominee. Life gets better, though, when you focus on helping people, not dividing them with eleventh-hour political rhetoric out of desperation.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/03/8594661/cruz-and-de-blasio-prolong-mutually-beneficial-tit-tat", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a-ted%20cruz%20ny_1.png", "type": "article", "title": "Cruz and de Blasio prolong mutually beneficial tit-for-tat"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Mayor called Cruz's Tuesday comments 'demagoguery'"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe understand why Ted Cruz is lashing out,\u201d said de Blasio spokeswoman Karen Hinton.\nCruz railing against de Blasio probably doesn't hurt the mayor either, since Cruz is not exactly popular with de Blasio\u2019s liberal base.\nBut the mutual animus extends back at least to January, when Cruz impugned Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values\u201d during a GOP debate.\nThe crowd at the Women\u2019s National Republican Club seemed to dislike de Blasio as much as Cruz did.\nResponding to that criticism, de Blasio on Tuesday said Cruz's \"comments are not about safety and security."}
