Often seen as the tortoise, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has become the hare. It’s the first of America’s major stock indexes to climb back above its 200-day moving average this year.

The 200-day today–a widely watched technical level–is at 17153 Friday, and the Dow has been above it nearly all session. It was recently trading at 17180, up 185 points.

The Dow’s climb back to its 200-day average is the latest bullish technical indicator to be tripped amid the stock-market rally over the past few weeks.

It remains to be seen, however, whether this move above that mark is a harbinger of better things to come for the broader market — or a mere cocktail-party factoid. It will need to stay over the always-moving 200-day level to build on the case being made by the bulls that after sideways 2015 action, the 7-year-old bull market still has life in it.

Remember: Getting back above the 200-day in October didn’t lead to notable additional gains, and falling back below it in December cleared the way for January’s skid.

With today’s 1%-plus climb, the blue-chip index is off just 1.3% this year, a smidge better than the S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, is down 5.5% for 2016.

While the S&P is just a handful of points below its 200-day of 2020, the Nasdaq’s lagging performance has that index 3% under its 200-day average of 4880. Until all three are able to get several percentage points above the longer-term technical levels–which continue to fall daily, making doing so easier as time goes on–there will be plenty of doubters about this move higher.

And for good reason, considering how last Autumn’s stock rebound last roughly a month before the indexes went sideways into year-end. This rebound is now a month old itself, and who knows how the FOMC on Wednesday might change investors’ calculus yet again.
