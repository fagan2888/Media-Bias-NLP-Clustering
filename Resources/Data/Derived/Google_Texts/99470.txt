West Lauderdale High School Principal Kevin Cheatham gives Derek Pouncey the over $4,000.00 raised for his medical expenses through the Memorial Day baseball game.

Members of the West Lauderdale community flocked to the high school's baseball field Monday to support one of their own. Assistant football coach Derek Pouncey was diagnosed with stage four Metastatic Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, in February

But on Memorial Day, the school hosted an alumni baseball game to raise money for his treatment. Hundreds of supporters showed up to watch the game, which brought together recent high school graduates from all over Lauderdale County against members of the 2007 West Lauderdale baseball team, including St. Louis Rams quarterback Austin Davis.

Coach Pouncey said he broke down in tears when he was told players and friends wanted to make the event for him.

"I can't begin to tell you how great they have been throughout the whole process,” said Pouncey. “It's just a small showing of how much support and love and faith people have been showing out here for me and for my family throughout this time."

Davis said hearing coach Pouncey’s story made him want to be back with his high school teammates and help the cause.

“It was fun to get everybody back together and do something like this and be back and have a good time doing it."

West Lauderdale Assistant Girls’ Basketball coach Kristy Wooldridge organized the event, which raised over 4,000 dollars for coach Pouncey, who has two surgeries to remove Melanoma from his skin, one on his leg and another on his arm.

He said he has neither won nor lost the battle. He is still in the fight.
