Eaglecrest gave No. 1 Valor Christian Eagles everything they could handle on Friday, but the top-ranked team in the Colorado Associated Press media poll held on to win 23-21.

The Eagles defense pushed the Raptors back to fourth down on the Eaglecrest 1-yard line with 1:25 remaining in the game. Eaglecrest QB Elijah Ross threw an incomplete pass, but a roughing-the-passer penalty on Valor gave Eaglecrest another chance. However, Ross would leave the game with an injury.

Sophomore Colbey Ross would enter the game, but on second down, Eagles defensive back Brian Dawkins Jr. came down with an interception to seal the deal for the Eagles.
