The margin of error in the poll is 4.1 percent.\n\nThe new rating is slightly worse than in the previous WMUR Granite State Poll, taken in February, in which 42 percent approved of Obama\u2019s job performance, 53 percent disapproved and 5 percent were neutral.\n\nObama\u2019s New Hampshire job approval rating has been \u201cunder water\u201d since October 2013. His low point came in polls taken in August and October 2014. In both, 38 percent approved of his performance, while 55 percent disapproved.\n\nHow did his ratings affect the mid-term election?\n\nIn November 2014, Democrats Maggie Hassan, Jeanne Shaheen and Ann Kuster won re-election as governor, senator and congresswoman, respectively. But Republicans won the majority of the New Hampshire House and the Executive Council and the GOP also increased its majority in the state Senate.\n\nThe Survey Center, in its report on the new poll, said that Obama\u2019s popularity \u201cwill likely be a key factor in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d But the center noted his job performance rating is \u201csignificantly better\u201d than former President George W. Bush\u2019s rating was at this point in his second term. Bush\u2019s rating then was 29 percent approval and 68 percent disapproval.\n\nAccording to the poll, Granite Staters who consider themselves Democrats still strongly support Obama, with 81 percent approving of his job performance and 14 percent disapproving. A total of 88 percent of Republicans disapprove of Obama\u2019s job performance, while 7 percent approve. But Obama is not viewed favorably by independents, with 27 percent approving of his job performance and 56 percent disapproving.\n\nWomen favor Obama by a margin of 48 percent to 44 percent, but 61 percent of men disapprove of his job performance, while 32 percent approve.\n\nObama\u2019s personal favorability ratings also continue to remain low. He is viewed favorably by 42 percent and unfavorably by 51 percent, with 8 percent neutral.\n\nObama\u2019s handling of foreign affairs has hit a record low in New Hampshire, the poll shows, with 33 percent approving and 57 percent disapproving, while 9 percent are neutral.\n\nThe poll also shows that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular, with 34 percent favoring the law, 55 percent opposing it, while 11 percent are neutral. It shows that 41 percent of New Hampshire adults approve of how Obama is handling the economy, while 52 percent disapprove.\n\nFor full poll results, click here.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 29 May 2015 17:30:00 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "President Obama continues to receive poor grades from Granite Staters, with his job approval rating and popularity far \u201cunder water,\u201d the latest WMUR Granite State poll indicates.", "title": "WMUR poll: Granite Staters strongly disapprove of Obama\u2019s performance", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmur-poll-granite-staters-strongly-disapprove-of-obamas-performance/33293360", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/32089404/highRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/10sqvn4z/-/President-Obama-announces-killing-of-Osama-bin-Laden-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmur-poll-granite-staters-strongly-disapprove-of-obamas-performance/33293360", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/33293360", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/33293360", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/33293360"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33293360", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33293360", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmur-poll-granite-staters-strongly-disapprove-of-obamas-performance/33293360"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "WMUR Granite State Poll, President Obama", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "WMUR Granite State Poll, President Obama", "description": "President Obama continues to receive poor grades from Granite Staters, with his job approval rating and popularity far \u201cunder water,\u201d the latest WMUR Granite State poll indicates."}, "article_summary": "President Obama continues to receive poor grades from Granite Staters, with his job approval rating and popularity far \u201cunder water,\u201d the latest WMUR Granite State poll indicates.\nA total of 88 percent of Republicans disapprove of Obama\u2019s job performance, while 7 percent approve.\nAccording to the poll, Granite Staters who consider themselves Democrats still strongly support Obama, with 81 percent approving of his job performance and 14 percent disapproving.\nThe new rating is slightly worse than in the previous WMUR Granite State Poll, taken in February, in which 42 percent approved of Obama\u2019s job performance, 53 percent disapproved and 5 percent were neutral.\nBut Obama is not viewed favorably by independents, with 27 percent approving of his job performance and 56 percent disapproving."}
