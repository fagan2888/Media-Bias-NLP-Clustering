The confidence of Colorado business leaders has increased slightly going into the first quarter of 2014 as economic conditions have improved and some political issues have subsided, according to the Leeds Business Confidence Index.

The LBCI posted a reading of 59.9 for the first quarter, an increase from 59.3 for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Expectations of the business leaders measured positive — at 50 or higher — for all the areas measured by the index, which includes the national economy, state economy, industry sales, industry profits, capital expenditures and hiring plans.

The LBCI was released Thursday by the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Leeds School of Business.

While they remained in positive territory, the only expectations that fell going into the first quarter of 2014 were in sales and profits. Business leaders’ sales expectations for the first quarter came in at 61.2, down from 62 for the fourth quarter of 2013, while profits fell to 57.9, down from 59.3 for the fourth quarter.

Economist Richard Wobbekind, executive director of the Leeds School’s Business Research Division, said the index has shown nine consecutive quarters of positive expectations.

“The sustained confidence over the past several quarters now ties the record of optimism set from 2003 to 2005,” said Wobbekind. “Strong signals from the market are keeping confidence up, including the acceleration of GDP growth, employment gains and a federal budget compromise.”

Confidence in the national economy saw the greatest gain, 1.9 points, to 57.4.

Confidence in the state economy increased to 64.8 from 63.9 last quarter. It outpaced confidence in the national economy, which has been a consistent 35-quarter trend noted in the business confidence index.

Wobbekind said that despite a slight slip in sales and profit expectations, the business leaders indicated increased expectations for investments in labor and capital.

The capital-expenditures index measured 59 for the first quarter, up from 57.4. The hiring-plans index increased to 59.3, up from 57.8.
