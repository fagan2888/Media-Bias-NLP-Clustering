Teachers knock on students\u2019 doors from time to time, encouraging them to come to class, knowing many are facing language barriers and challenges in their personal lives that kept them off the traditional education track.\n\nIt\u2019s an even tougher job now.\n\nAcross the state and nation, the number of students receiving high school equivalency diplomas plummeted in 2014 after the launch of a rigorous new exam.\n\nAligned to the new Common Core State Standards now being taught at public schools in most states, the new test also is nearly twice as expensive for those who take all four sections \u2014 $130 compared to $70 \u2014 and now is offered only on computer.\n\nNationwide, 90,000 test-takers received a high-school equivalency diploma in 2014, down from more than 540,000 in 2013 and 400,000 in 2012. The numbers were unusually high in 2013 because there was a rush to earn a diploma while the old test was still available.\n\nThe same trend is seen across Florida and the Tampa Bay area.\n\nMore than 13,000 Floridians completed the GED exam last year, but just 7,814 passed and received diplomas \u2014 a 58 percent pass rate, according to data provided by the Florida Department of Education. In 2013, about 44,700 received diplomas in Florida. In 2012, 29,200 received diplomas.\n\nIn Hillsborough County, fewer than 600 GED diplomas were issued last year \u2014 down from about 3,000 in 2013 and 2,200 in 2012, said Debbie Sass, the school district\u2019s chief GED examiner.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have those growing pains,\u201d Sass said. \u201cI think people now realize it is a rigorous test and they have to prepare for it. I believe it is very much in line with the high-school diploma. It truly is an equivalency diploma.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nWhile local educators welcome the idea of a more challenging test, they say rollout of the new exam could have been smoother.\n\nThe GED test can be taken by anyone 16 or older who has no diploma and isn\u2019t enrolled in school. It was last revised in 2002.\n\nMarc Hutek, Hillsborough\u2019s director of adult education, blames the dip in diplomas on a lack of preparation materials aligned to the new exam, which tests students in four subjects \u2014language arts, math, social studies and science.\n\n\u201cTextbook companies didn\u2019t have materials to support the new standards,\u201d Hutek said. \u201cWe found only one textbook company that could provide resources.\u201d\n\nThe new test was developed after the nonprofit GED Testing Service began working with the Pearson testing company. Some states, including Texas, New York and New Hampshire, decided to drop the GED and go with other high-school equivalency tests.\n\nEven though the numbers don\u2019t look good, the outlook is improving, Sass said. In Hillsborough, and across the state, there was a 15 percent increase in the passing rate in the second half of 2014 compared to the first.\n\nThe school district\u2019s adult education department offers the GED during the day at the Learey Technical Center, 5410 N. 20th St., and at night at Lennard High School in Ruskin. The district also has a mobile testing lab that travels to prisons for inmates who want to earn their GED.\n\nTampa resident Maria Si, 32, is halfway through the new test. She passed the language arts and math portions, which she said were easy enough.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be more difficult, but it wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d she said, adding that she likes how fast she receives her scores now that everything is done on the computer.\n\nAs a high-school student in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Si said she \u201cslacked off\u201d and was a few credits short of earning her diploma. She hopes to work in social services once she receives her GED.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like starting over,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only to better myself.\u201d\n\nEvan Gestrich, 19, of Temple Terrace, has passed the social studies portion but failed the language arts test by just a few points.\n\n\u201cThe questions weren\u2019t difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the extended response part.\u201d\n\nJust as the new test has been an adjustment for students, it has created a learning curve for teachers of GED prep classes.\n\nFinney, the underage GED teacher at Chamberlain High, has taught the class in Hillsborough for 16 years. She now leads trainings for other teachers to get them up to speed on the new test.\n\nThe math portion of the GED includes tougher concepts than the old test, such as quadratic equations. The new test includes more than just multiple-choice questions. There\u2019s also drag-and-drop, fill-in-the-blank, short answer and extended response questions.\n\nFinney prefers the new test to the old one because it requires critical thinking, much like the new Florida Standards Assessment that students will begin taking in public schools next month. It will test students\u2019 knowledge of the Florida Standards \u2014 language arts and math goals that are based on Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken away the ability to spoon feed,\u201d Finney said. \u201cI know some teachers don\u2019t appreciate that, but I love it.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nMore than one year after the new test was launched, Finney still tunes in to every webinar that\u2019s offered and studies in her spare time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind that I\u2019ve had to study to effectively deliver the material,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m learning to prepare them better.\u201d\n\nIn Finney\u2019s classroom, located on the north end of Chamberlain High, a group of students meet for five hours a day, five days a week.\n\nFrom 7:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., Monday through Friday, the students work assignments on their own, at their desks and on computers. Three times each day, Finney gives a lesson that everyone will understand, even though all of the students are on different levels \u2014 their skills range from second-grade to 12th-grade level.\n\nThe 21 students enrolled in Finney\u2019s class this semester face a variety of challenges that have kept them from succeeding in a regular K-12 setting.\n\nSome have emotional issues that hinder them from performing at their best in a large high school. Others couldn\u2019t pass middle school or were kicked out of their high schools for bad behavior. Some are pregnant. Some have children of their own. One boy is from Africa and is still learning English.\n\nFinney, her co-teacher Mary Ellen Wolfington and aide Patty Shaffer sometimes drive to the students\u2019 houses to get them to come to class. They give out their cellphone numbers and encourage the teens to text and call with questions if they are having trouble with the material.\n\nFinney said many of her current students have made great strides since they started coming to her class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to be able to see these kids flourish and realize they don\u2019t have to give up on their dreams because they couldn\u2019t make it in K-12,\u201d she said.\n\nFinney has seen a decline in the rate of diplomas in her own class, although the numbers are slowly ticking upward.\n\nIn any given semester before 2014, Finney might have deemed 30 students ready to take the GED. In early 2014, she sent 12 to take the test and nine passed. Last semester, she sent 16 to take the test. Of those, 10 earned their diplomas and six are still finishing up.\n\n\u201cI think once we get used to it, these numbers will rise again,\u201d Finney said.\n\nOne of her students, Quanae Toussaint, 17, enrolled in the class after being kicked out of school.\n\n\u201cI got in trouble a lot, so I came here,\u201d said Toussaint, who returned last month for her second stint in the class.\n\nFinney said the teen has improved dramatically.\n\n\u201cWe have a great class.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 20:55:33 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 In teacher Deanna Finney\u2019s classroom, a cap and gown hang on the wall alongside dozens of diplomas of past graduates \u2014 all reminders to her students of what they can achi", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 In teacher Deanna Finney\u2019s classroom, a cap and gown hang on the wall alongside dozens of diplomas of past graduates \u2014 all reminders to her students of what they can achi", "title": "Tougher GED means fewer earn equivalency diploma", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/tougher-ged-means-fewer-earn-equivalency-diploma-20150215/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150215/ARTICLE/150219470/EP/1/3/EP-150219470.jpg", "height": 2832}, "updated_time": "2015-02-15T20:55:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 In teacher Deanna Finney\u2019s classroom, a cap and gown hang on the wall alongside dozens of diplomas of past graduates \u2014 all reminders to her students of what they can ac", "title": "Tougher GED means fewer earn equivalency diploma", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150215/ARTICLE/150219470/AR/0/AR-150219470.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-15T20:55:33Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-15T20:55:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The GED test can be taken by anyone 16 or older who has no diploma and isn\u2019t enrolled in school.\nIn Hillsborough County, fewer than 600 GED diplomas were issued last year \u2014 down from about 3,000 in 2013 and 2,200 in 2012, said Debbie Sass, the school district\u2019s chief GED examiner.\nSome have emotional issues that hinder them from performing at their best in a large high school.\nAcross the state and nation, the number of students receiving high school equivalency diplomas plummeted in 2014 after the launch of a rigorous new exam.\nThe numbers were unusually high in 2013 because there was a rush to earn a diploma while the old test was still available."}
