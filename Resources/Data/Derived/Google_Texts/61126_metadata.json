In the process, he elevates form over substance.\n\nHis legal position is that congressional approval to wage war, while important, is unnecessary. As a former professor of constitutional law, he knows the Constitution says otherwise.\n\nOn Aug. 8, the president launched the first in a series of \u201ctargeted airstrikes\u201d against ISIL, sometimes referred to as ISIS or Islamic State. He said that the strikes were necessary to protect American personnel and for humanitarian reasons. He repeatedly claimed that the Constitution allowed him to act unilaterally as commander-in-chief.\n\nHe was wrong. The Constitution vests in Congress the power and responsibility to authorize such military action.\n\nBy late September, \u201cdiscrete military operations\u201d had morphed into a \u201csystematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary actions\u201d aimed at \u201cdegrad[ing], and ultimately defeat[ing], ISIL.\u201d This time, the president argued that Congress need not weigh in because it had already signed off on a broader war \u2013 both in 2001 when it authorized force against the Taliban and al Qaeda and in 2002 when it authorized the invasion of Iraq.\n\nAt least he noticed that Congress ought to play a role in continuing a war he presumed to start. But he was still wrong.\n\nIn his letter transmitting to Congress his newly proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIL, the president reiterated his claim that \u201cexisting statutes\u201d provide him all the authority he needs to continue the current military campaign.\n\nHe is wrong again. There is no evidence whatsoever that Congress intended either the 2001 AUMF or the 2002 AUMF to sanction a war nearly a decade and a half later against an enemy that at the time did not even exist.\n\nYes, the president deserves credit for his willingness to work together with Congress on the use of force abroad.\n\nHaving served in Congress, we know this is the most difficult issue an elected representative can face: whether to send U.S. service members to fight, knowing that some, and possibly many, will die. But President Obama continues to miss the fundamental point: if he believes that war is necessary, the Constitution requires him to request Congress to exercise its authority, not to accede to his.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that Congress will evaluate and debate the proposed new AUMF over the coming weeks. We hope lawmakers will engage in that debate with appropriate skepticism about the willingness of any president to adhere to limits on the use of force.\n\nIf members of Congress decide to continue the war that the president began, they must do so in a way that checks his expansive claims of pre-existing authority. President Obama\u2019s proposal would repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF. But he ignores the more problematic, post 9/11 2001 AUMF. At minimum, any new war authority must make clear that, going forward, no commander-in-chief may rely on either the 2001 AUMF or the 2002 Iraq AUMF to justify the use of force against ISIL.\n\nIf Congress allows either law to stay on the books \u2013 and fails to state explicitly that neither applies to the war with ISIL \u2013 future presidents will be tempted to seize on what remains to sidestep any new Congressionally-imposed limits on the use of force.\n\nIf Congress succeeds in reaching agreement on the specifics of a new force authorization \u2014 hopefully with limits on its scope in geography, enemies and duration \u2014 it would be ironic if a future president might still rely on the 2001 AUMF to circumvent congressional intent and extend military action beyond the specifics authorized.\n\nUnless Congress confronts President Obama\u2019s current legal position, it risks endorsing and adding to an ambiguous grab-bag of war authorities that simply expands the chief executive\u2019s powers while diminishing those of Congress.\n\nThe framers of our Constitution assigned Congress the sole power to decide on war because they believed that young Americans should only be sent into battle when the people, through their representatives\u2019 collective judgment, approved it. The commander-in-chief\u2019s role is to wage war once authorized, but only within the boundaries that Congress sets. It is high time for both branches to discharge those responsibilities.\n\nMickey Edwards is a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who served as chair of the House Republican Policy Committee.
