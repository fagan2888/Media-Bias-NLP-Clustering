Even though the increase is likely to be short-lived and members of Congress are working to avert or lessen its effects, the potential price jump nonetheless complicates the annual open enrollment process for millions of seniors nationwide.\n\nHigher premiums come alongside worries about spiraling prescription-drug costs and rising deductibles for many who are on fixed incomes. The federal government is already pursuing dozens of programs aimed at reducing the Medicare trust fund\u2019s expenses, from targeting fraud and waste to rewarding doctors for avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. But actuaries in Washington, D.C., said increasing premiums is also necessary to keep the program solvent.\n\nSitting at the Oceanside Senior Center on Friday, Bob Baker, 84, of Oceanside said while some people might see Medicare\u2019s increases as insignificant compared to the premiums paid by those with private or employer-based coverage, they can be downright crippling for many like him, who regularly turn out for the center\u2019s reduced-cost lunch program.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a fat retirement account, you constantly have to adjust things, and increases make it painful,\u201d Baker said, adding that he plans to stay away from Medicare and continue to rely as long as possible on his benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nHe knows that enrolling in Medicare would give him access to a broader range of medical services. But the premiums, especially with the latest increase on the way, would gobble up the rest of his monthly budget. He uses that money to spoil his great granddaughter, Delaney, as much as he can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off. As long as I\u2019m feeling pretty good, I want to buy her and her mom as many presents as I can,\u201d Baker said.\n\nFortunately, there are many in the region who make it their business to help Medicare recipients figure out which trade-offs are the right ones to make. Some health insurance brokers and the region\u2019s Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program provide free, one-on-one consultations that can help make a confusing set of options clearer.\n\nShare Photo \uf610\n\n\uf611\n\n\uf616\n\n\u2709\n\nRate redux\n\nThe unevenness of next year\u2019s possible premium increase is an indirect effect of a law that governs Social Security, not Medicare.\n\nThe U.S. Social Security Administration announced Thursday that low inflation numbers mean its 70 million beneficiaries will not receive cost-of-living increases in 2016. That decision triggers a \u201chold harmless\u201d clause that prevents any increase to automatic deductions from monthly Social Security checks.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Medicare recipients have their premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security checks, so they will continue to pay their existing premiums next year. The vast majority pay $104.90 per month for Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient services including doctor visits.\n\nHowever, seniors who turn 65 next year and those who are on Medicare but are not yet receiving Social Security benefits will see their monthly premiums climb next year. The majority of these enrollees are projected to pay $159.30.\n\nThe increase also affects low-income seniors who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California), the government\u2019s program for the poor and disadvantaged.\n\nAlso, deductibles for the Part B plan would increase from $146 to $205, though the bump would not necessarily apply to members of Medicare Advantage plans. Those plans, run by private insurance companies, have their own deductibles and copays.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/oct/17/medicare-open-enrollment/", "description": "Medicare\u2019s 2015 open-enrollment period has begun.
