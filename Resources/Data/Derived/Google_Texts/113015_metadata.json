Police are calling the incident a murder-suicide.\n\nPolice say the male victim, 43-year-old Adan Chavez, and the female victim, 33-year-old Jessica Rubacalba, both lived in the home where the pair was found.\n\nHomicide detectives have determined that Chavez first shot Rubalcava and then turned the gun on himself.\n\nA weapon was found at the scene.\n\nThe bodies were discovered when family members went to the home earlier in the day, apparently to make a welfare check on the couple. They had apparently been trying to contact the couple since 1 a.m. When no one at the home responded, the relatives kicked in the door.\n\nRubacalba's cousin, Natalie Casillas says the family is devastated. \"The family is all grieving. It's just so terrible,\" Natalie said.\n\nThe family didn't want to talk about what might have led up to the shooting but do say their focus is now on taking care of the couple's three young children.\n\n\"I am going to love her kids for her, they are what's important right now,\" Natalie said.\n\nThe three children weren't home at the time of the murder. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
