The implementation of the Affordable Care Act led to increased enrollment in Medicaid across all Oregon counties, state data show.

At the same time, reliance on food stamps and welfare fell slightly as Oregonians continue their slow and steady climb out of the Great Recession. But the state isn't in the clear yet: More than one in five Oregonians continue to rely on food stamps, a stubbornly high rate that has remained about the same for years.

The Oregonian mapped state and county unemployment, poverty, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid rates using June and July 2014 numbers from the Oregon Department of Human Services and Oregon Health Authority.

Overall, the numbers indicate an Oregon economy that has slightly improved since The Oregonian last mapped poverty about six months ago. It's also apparent that the recession's effects still linger in pockets of rural Oregon.

The implementation of the Affordable Care Act at the beginning of the year expanded eligibility in two main ways that led to increased Medicaid enrollment, said Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority.

The income qualification level rose from 100 percent of the federal poverty rate to 138 percent of the federal poverty rate.

Now, anybody who meets the income qualifications can enroll in the Oregon Health Plan. Previously, the plan was limited so that enrollment was largely limited to pregnant women and children. But starting at the beginning of the year, men, non-pregnant women and others can all enroll if they meet the income requirements, Fish said.
