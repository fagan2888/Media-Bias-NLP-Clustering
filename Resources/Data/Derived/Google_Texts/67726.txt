House Speaker Paul Ryan to prioritize ACA alternative

U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) went on AM 970 New York's "The Cats Roundtable" Sunday and said the Republican Party has failed to provide a viable alternative to the Affordable Care Act, according to The Hill.

But, she said, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) plans to propose a policy and has already chosen a representative to head the effort, according to the report.

"We've got to write the specific replacement to the [ACA]," she told host John Catsimatidis, according to the report. "We've talked about repealing ObamaCare, we've taken votes, we've put the bill on the president's desk to repeal ObamaCare, but we've got to put forward, 'What is the future of healthcare?'"

The alternative, she said, will lessen federal government control, putting more decision-making power in the hands of physicians and patients, according to the report.
