The last partnership that the Alaska Permanent Fund entered into on a similar scale was an up to $750 million account with Carlyle Group , approved in July 2013, to target natural resources, metals and energy.\n\nThe latest tie-up with Apollo is a bet on burgeoning opportunities for non-bank providers to offer credit, as banks tighten their lending standards in the face of stricter regulations, according to slides presented by Jay Willoughby , chief investment officer, and David Fallace, senior portfolio manager, to board directors on May 21.\n\nAlaska\u2019s proposed partnership with Apollo will include a $175 million separately managed account for unconstrained debt and distressed investments, $125 million for co-investments, and $100 million to source direct deals.\n\nAs part of the pact, Alaska is expected to pledge $350 million commitments across three funds: Apollo Credit Opportunity Fund III, for opportunistic credit strategies such as private lending and mezzanine debt, Apollo Credit Strategies Fund, a hedge fund for long/short credit and arbitrage plays, and the Apollo Structured Credit Recovery Fund III, which targets structured credit.\n\nContinue reading via LBO
