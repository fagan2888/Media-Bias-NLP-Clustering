Admittedly, she\u2019s not Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) either. Then again, Bernie Sanders would be unelectable nationally. Nevertheless, this caricature of Clinton mainly has to do with her foreign policy positions \u2014 at least the ones we know of. And other than her 2002 vote in support of the Iraq Authorization for Use of Force (AUMF), she\u2019s largely in line with President Obama on predator drones, intervention, NSA operations and so forth.\n\nThat aside, watch carefully to see if any Republicans release a video favorably showing two men holding hands. Elsewhere, Clinton will likely appoint center-left justices to the Supreme Court; she\u2019ll veto any legislation to repeal Obamacare; and she\u2019ll continue the Obama administration\u2019s approach to the climate crisis. All of that aside, the whole \u201cGOP-lite\u201d meme is just another version of the \u201cboth parties are the same\u201d meme \u2014 it\u2019s good for some RTs on Twitter, but makes little sense in terms of a break-down of Clinton\u2019s positions on the issues. Indeed, when Clinton served in the Senate, she was considered the 11th most liberal senator. That\u2019s basically in the top 20 percentile in terms of liberal votes. That\u2019s lightyears away from being a DINO.\n\nElizabeth Warren and Dr. Jill Stein are better.\n\nThis particular observation is one we\u2019ll be seeing for a long, long time. And while both candidates are more liberal than Clinton, one of them isn\u2019t running and the other is unelectable because she\u2019s running as a third party, and third party candidates don\u2019t have a shot at winning. By that very measure, Clinton is obviously a better candidate because she\u2019s running and she can win.\n\nI\u2019ve never quite understood the penchant for fapping away over candidates who don\u2019t have a prayer, either because they refuse to run or because they\u2019ve marginalized themselves to the sideshow of the campaign. So why, then, are they deserving of time and energy? I personally think Warren would make a fantastic candidate, but using her non-candidacy as a cudgel against the one Democrat who\u2019s currently defeating each of the GOP frontrunners in their home states is counterproductive. It\u2019s like refusing to pursue relationships with anyone who\u2019s not Jennifer Lawrence or Ryan Gosling. Good for you if one of those two is into you, but they\u2019re probably not.\n\nFrankly, the activist left doesn\u2019t have a particularly strong track record of picking solid primary contenders. Both Howard Dean in 2004 and John Edwards in 2008 crashed and burned in spectacular fashion.\n\nWe need a primary, not a coronation.\n\nHaving a largely uncontested primary doesn\u2019t by default mean a \u201ccoronation.\u201d Sometimes it works out like this because American politics. There\u2019s no rule that says every presidential primary has to feature a cast of thousands. Sometimes it\u2019s a big fat clown car, sometimes it\u2019s not. In recent memory, Al Gore was only challenged by Bill Bradley in 2000. Every poll in the field shows Clinton with roughly a 48 point lead over other potential Democratic candidates. In other words, Democratic voters believe Clinton is the best bet \u2014 today \u2014 to beat the Republican nominee. A smoke-filled room at the DNC can\u2019t manufacture those numbers. That\u2019s not to say there shouldn\u2019t be other candidates. There should be. What happens if Clinton gets into serious trouble? Who\u2019s playing second string? And will he or she be able to step up and beat the Republican nominee? The party should be planning for this possibility, if it isn\u2019t already.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crooks and Liars.com explains...
