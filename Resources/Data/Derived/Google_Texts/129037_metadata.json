Joe.\u201d The series was about a U.S. special missions force that protected America from Cobra, \u201ca ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world.\u201d\n\nBack then, ruthless terrorists dressed up in funny costumes but they didn\u2019t saw off people\u2019s heads. Cobra\u2019s plans for world domination included schemes like the weather dominator, which controlled the weather. Trying to control the weather sounds more like liberal climate policies than ISIS. But I digress.\n\nAround the third season or so, some members of the Cobra high command realized their current leader wasn\u2019t getting the job done. So they decided to create a new one. They combed the tombs of Napoleon, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Rasputin, Alexander the Great and a long list of other bad dudes and then crafted a new leader from their DNA.\n\nHis name was Serpentor.\n\nListening to CPAC speeches by various Republican presidential candidates over the years, I\u2019ve often wondered if conservatives need a Serpentor of their own.\n\nNo, I haven\u2019t been drinking.\n\nIn the cartoon that is my life, conservatives aren\u2019t like Cobra. They are the real America heroes. And we\u2019ve already established that it\u2019s liberals who are trying to build a weather dominator.\n\nBut the Republican-controlled Senate blinked on defunding President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. (What\u2019s going on in the House is too convoluted even for a cartoon.) These same Republicans might be working to save Obamacare subsidies from the Supreme Court.\n\nThat\u2019s even assuming Obamacare won\u2019t once again be rescued by a Republican-appointed Supreme Court justice. The evidence that the current conservative Republican leadership isn\u2019t getting it done abounds.\n\nWe\u2019re generally anti-cloning on the right. But what if a new leader could be formed with the DNA of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Barry Goldwater and Robert Taft?\n\nThen it occurs to me that conservatives might actually have the opposite problem. There are a lot of current Republican leaders who have some of the characteristics of a past great leader.\n\nWas Ronald Reagan conservatism\u2019s Serpentor?\n\nNo, I haven\u2019t been hanging out at the CPAC marijuana event.\n\nThink about it. Scott Walker is the conservative governor of a blueish state who did the 2010s equivalent of firing the air traffic controllers (a comparison he\u2019s made himself).\n\nChris Christie is a more moderate version of the same.\n\nTed Cruz gives \u201cThe Speech\u201d that reminds conservatives of their rendezvous with destiny.\n\nMarco Rubio gives a version of that speech that might resonate beyond the Republican base.\n\nRand Paul reminds us that government is the problem and applies that lesson to contemporary problems.\n\nJeb Bush thinks this is all \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d but he reminds me of a loyal vice president.\n\nIf you could mold all them together, you would get an approximation of Ronald Reagan.\n\nMaybe that would be more like other 1980s cartoon characters, like Voltron or Devastator. After all, Serpentor turned out to be a terrible leader, unlike Reagan.\n\nIn 2016, Republican primary voters are going to have to settle for one nominee. Not even a neurosurgeon like Ben Carson can design a science fiction technology that will save conservatives from the already available options.\n\n\u201cG.I. Joe\u201d cartoons always used to end with a corny public service announcement. Here\u2019s mine: Donald Rumsfeld once said, \u201cYou go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time.\u201d\n\nConservatives must go to #war with the candidates they have, not the candidate they want want or wish to have at a later \u2014 or earlier \u2014 time.\n\nSee you on the other side of the straw poll results. Yo Joe.\n\nW. James Antle III is managing editor of The Daily Caller and author of the book Devouring Freedom: Can Big Government Ever Be Stopped?
