CU sophomore Ben Saarel was seventh and senior Blake Theroux finished ninth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no pressure to us. It\u2019s just business,\u201d Theroux said. \u201cWe\u2019re all veterans here. This is what we do every day. We train; we just have to do exactly what we\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019re going to win. I trust these guys with my life. I\u2019d take a bullet for them. I knew they were going to come out here and do it.\u201d\n\nThey may have approached their task in a businesslike manner, but when Moussa emerged from the finish area, a wave of emotion crossed his face and caught in his throat.\n\nPHOTOS: CU Men win 2nd national title at NCAA Cross Country Championships\n\n\u201cJust blessed,\u201d he said, tears pooling in his eyes. \u201cReally blessed.\u201d\n\nColorado finished with 65 points for the lowest (best) score of its men\u2019s title teams. Runner-up Stanford finished with 98.\n\n\u201cWe start training in June,\u201d Theroux said. \u201cWe train harder than anyone in this country. We\u2019re up in the Rocky Mountains, zero degrees, (running) 18 miles and we say, \u2018Screw this, we\u2019re going to go out there and win in Terre Haute.\u2019 That\u2019s just what it\u2019s all about. We\u2019ve been talking about winning every single day since June 1. We talk about this day, we\u2019re going to come out here and kill it. That\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMoussa got a good luck text Friday night from Adam Goucher, who won the NCAA individual title in 1998 to lay the foundation for the elite program coach Mark Wetmore has built. Moussa was touched to hear from Goucher.\n\n\u201cI told him (Saturday) is just another chapter in the legacy he started,\u201d Moussa said. \u201cWe\u2019re not special, we\u2019re not different than anybody else, but we push each other every day. I do it for them, and I know we all feel the same way. We just care about each other.\u201d\n\nThis was Wetmore\u2019s first team to repeat, but his emotions were \u201chalf relief\u201d and pride for his team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be the favorites, it\u2019s so hard to have the attention, it\u2019s so hard for nine or 10 21-year-old men to keep their egos in check and they really did it,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest feeling I have \u2014 pride, not for me but for them.\u201d\n\nA month ago Wetmore said if CU won, it would be his best team. In recent days he\u2019s been more reluctant to say that.\n\n\u201cThis is probably our best team ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is certainly the best third, fourth and fifth (runners) we\u2019ve ever had. They\u2019re real good and they belong in the pantheon.\u201d\n\nSaarel was the top Buff at NCAAs last season as a freshman, finishing eighth, but he battled nagging health issues this season. He ran strong Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very serious student, he\u2019s in a very hard arduous engineering program, he lives on four or five hours sleep,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cThe other night he got seven and he said, \u2018I feel so much better.\u2019 I was encouraged for him this weekend, that he got his exams out of the way and was going to feel well.\u201d\n\nCross country teams tend to be extremely close because of the mutual suffering the sport entails, but that is especially true of this team fueled by the legacy Wetmore has built.\n\n\u201cIt really is a team sport when you have the best team in the sport,\u201d Saarel said. \u201cYou do the best you can. Our coach stresses running your race, so I focused on trying to run my race. It\u2019s an amazing feeling to win, and it\u2019s privilege to run with these guys.\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nCU men\u2019s cross country titles, with top finisher\n\n2001: Jorge Torres, second\n\n2004: Brent Vaughn, fourth\n\n2006: Vaughn, 12th\n\n2013: Ben Saarel, eighth\n\n2014: Ammar Moussa, fifth\n\nNote: The CU women won NCAA championships in 2000 and 2004.
