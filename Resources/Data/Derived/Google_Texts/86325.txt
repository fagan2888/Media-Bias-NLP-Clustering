Temperatures have been getting colder and colder as we inch farther into the New Year.

Expect this week to bring some of the coldest temperatures weâ€™ve seen so far this winter season and so far this year!

Monday night will likely see temperatures fall into the mid-20s in the upstate and upper teens in western North Carolina! Tuesday night into Wednesday will likely be cold as well, falling into the mid-20s and mid-teens!

Temperatures will become a bit milder as the end of the work week approaches and rain chances return to the Carolinas.

Look for a brief break in the rainfall on Saturday with clouds building once again on Sunday.

As it looks now, an area of low pressure will develop and track northeast along the Atlantic seaboard. This will likely bring rain to the Carolinas Sunday into Monday.

Colder temperatures will likely move in during the tail end of this system. This colder air coupled with wet weather could lead to snow or other wintry precipitation on Monday January 11th!

Many things can change in the days ahead so be sure to keep up with your forecast here at Fox Carolina!
