Larger providers and systems' slow start adapting to these realities meant startups were able to get an early advantage. It's crucial that providers not fall into the trap of thinking their brand will do the work for them, he added. Time is of the essence, he said, for providers that want to avoid being left in the dust. Valdes cited Kaiser Permanente's partnership with Target in Southern California and Sutter Health's state-of-the-art call center as examples of organizations that understood the shift in patient thinking and acted accordingly.\n\n\"The partnership will be 'We'll take what we want and leave you with want we don't.' But the people who partner with [startups and retailers] will get the referrals,\" Valdes said. \"The culture is going to change, but it's not going to be changed by healthcare systems.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow healthcare organizations can promote patient-centered care\n\nWalmart primary care creates stiff competition for providers\n\n4 reasons parents use retail health clinics instead of pediatricians\n\nConsumers turn to retail clinics for convenience, affordability\n\nThe quest for patient-centered care: Patients as partners\n\nJournal: Stronger doctor-patient partnerships improve healthcare\n\nKaiser Permanente to staff Target primary care clinics", "article_metadata": {"description": "As healthcare becomes increasingly consumer-focused, the power of an organization's brand means less and less compared to convenience,\u00a0according to\u00a0MedCityNews.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As healthcare becomes increasingly consumer-focused, the power of an organization's brand means less and less compared to convenience,\u00a0according to\u00a0MedCityNews.", "title": "Consumers want convenient healthcare, not brand recognition", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/consumers-want-convenient-healthcare-not-brand-recognition/2015-03-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "branding,consumer-driven healthcare,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient-centered care,Telehealth,Walmart", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "As healthcare becomes increasingly consumer-focused, the power of an organization's brand means less and less compared to convenience, according to MedCityNews.\nThe healthcare industry has long known it must become more patient-centered, Valdes said, but is a more urgent matter in a post-Affordable Care Act market that emphasizes patient engagement.\nIt's crucial that providers not fall into the trap of thinking their brand will do the work for them, he added.\n\"The culture is going to change, but it's not going to be changed by healthcare systems.\"\nLarger providers and systems' slow start adapting to these realities meant startups were able to get an early advantage."}
