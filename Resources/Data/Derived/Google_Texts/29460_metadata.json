Portland Ave. and just east of I-44, on Feb. 29.\n\nAccording to court documents, the 16-year-old suspect was visiting at the victim\u2019s apartment that day. After the suspect went home, the 9-year-old victim told his mom that he had been abused.\n\nThe mother immediately filed a report and a forensic interview was conducted with the victim at Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nBased on the victim\u2019s extremely detailed and graphic story with police, investigators also collected clothing and other evidence from the apartment.\n\nAt a follow-up interview on March 3, police say the suspect confessed to all of the acts the victim had claimed. The teen was then arrested on three counts of lewd acts with a child. He was booked into the Oklahoma County Jail. The report did not indicate if he would be charged as a juvenile.\n\nAs part of the investigation, authorities obtained a warrant for DNA swabs of the suspect on March 3. The results of those DNA swabs have not been disclosed.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An Oklahoma City teen is in custody, accused of sexually abusing a 9-year-old neighbor at an apartment complex on the northwest side of the metro.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31416513/okc-teen-accused-of-sexually-abusing-9-year-old-neighbor", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10052846_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma City teen is in custody, accused of sexually abusing a 9-year-old neighbor at an apartment complex on the northwest side of the metro.", "title": "OKC Teen Accused Of Sexually Abusing 9-Year-Old Neighbor"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10052846_G.jpg", "description": "An Oklahoma City teen is in custody, accused of sexually abusing a 9-year-old neighbor at an apartment complex on the northwest side of the metro.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Teen Accused Of Sexually Abusing 9-Year-Old Neighbor"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-teen-accused-of-sexually-abusing-9-year-old-neighbor", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/03/08", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,diddler,sex abuse,child predator", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,diddler,sex abuse,child predator"}, "article_summary": "An Oklahoma City teen is in custody, accused of sexually abusing a 9-year-old neighbor at an apartment complex on the northwest side of the metro.\nAs part of the investigation, authorities obtained a warrant for DNA swabs of the suspect on March 3.\nThe results of those DNA swabs have not been disclosed.\nAccording to court documents, the 16-year-old suspect was visiting at the victim\u2019s apartment that day.\nThe mother immediately filed a report and a forensic interview was conducted with the victim at Children\u2019s Hospital."}
