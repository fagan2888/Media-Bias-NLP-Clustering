However, after host Todd Wilken and I talked -- click here to tune that in -- it hit me that there is another way to frame this debate. In part, Christian leaders are arguing over whether churches grow when they are (a) culturally modernized and less doctrinally demanding or (b) when they hold firm to ancient doctrinal standards and, in many ways, reject trends in the modern world. Then, after that, it hit me that many modern churches -- think evangelical megachurches -- seem to be striving to look and sound modern, while claiming to stay orthodox at the level of morality and doctrine. So that is, kind of, a (c) approach, in their eyes.\n\nWith that in mind, consider the following material about the Pew Forum numbers from conservative blogger Matt Walsh. This fascinated me, because it didn't go where I thought it was going to go. Let's look at the summary material near the end, first:\n\n.... This is the problem with Christianity in this country. Not just inside our church buildings, but everywhere. It often has no edge, no depth. No sense of its own ancient and epic history. There is no sacredness to it. No pain. No beauty. No reverence. Or I should say Christianity has all of those things, fundamentally and totally, but many modern Christians in every denomination have spent many years trying to blunt them or bury them under a thousand layers of icing and whipped cream and apathy.\n\nI think this might shed some light on the latest study trumpeting how the Christian ranks have shrunk by another eight percentage points in just the last seven years. Now, about 70 percent of Americans identify as Christians. Still a majority, but the smallest majority we\u2019ve ever had. As atheism and agnosticism surge in popularity, Christianity hemorrhages and fades.\n\nSo stop right there for a minute. Who do you think Walsh is criticizing?\n\nDead mainliners? Cultural Catholics? Old-hymnal Southern Baptists?\n\nTo my surprise, it was firing away at another kind of church, one that many researchers might assume is growing. This passage at the start of the essay is long, but it's important to see his argument unfold:\n\nI recently attended a service that might help solve the riddle of the fantastic decline of American Christianity. It was a different church from the one I normally go to. Let me set the scene, perhaps it will sound familiar:\n\nI walked in and immediately realized that I\u2019d inadvertently stumbled upon a totally relaxed, convenient, comfortable brand of church. The first hint was the choir members dressed in shorts and flip flops. Sweet, bro. So chill.\n\nThere were a bunch of acoustic guitars and drums and tambourines and a keyboard. Before the service/concert began, some guy came out to rev up the crowd. Opening acts aren\u2019t usually a part of the liturgical experience, but this is 2015 and we\u2019re, like, so not into solemn silence and prayer anymore.\n\nThere must always be noise. Always noise. Sounds. Lights. Never silence, not even for a moment.\n\nFinally, church started. The choir, or jam band for Jesus, or whatever it was, played a song that sounded like a cross between a 90\u2032s Disney soundtrack and an easy listening favorite you might hear if you skimmed through your aunt\u2019s second generation iPod. It wasn\u2019t really contemporary, or good, or relevant, but at least it wasn\u2019t traditional. Because YUCK! Tradition is old!\n\nWait, he then switched to content issues.\n\nThe singer was relatively talented, but he carried on like an American Idol contestant. I got the impression that he was fishing for applause, not worshiping the Lord of the Universe. His style and demeanor said \u201ctalent show\u201d but the music said \u201cwine and cheese festival\u201d or maybe \u201cmy dentist\u2019s waiting room.\u201d It definitely didn\u2019t say \u201ctruth,\u201d or \u201cheaven,\u201d or \u201cthe Great King sitting upon his throne amidst throngs of mighty angels.\u201d\n\nThe pastor began with another round of jokes. They weren\u2019t very funny but they succeeded in being unserious, which I guess is close enough. The sermon was jam packed with youth slang and pop culture. He mentioned a couple of TV shows and Netflix. He made sports metaphors. He didn\u2019t do anything with the references, he just hung them out there like we were supposed to be impressed that he knows about these things.\n\nI think he even said something about Angry Birds. Dated, sure, but it did the job of letting us know that the guy speaking also used a smart phone at some point in the last five years. OMG! He totally gets us!\n\nThe word \u201cGospel\u201d made maybe one appearance in his message. The words \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201csacred,\u201d \u201creverence,\u201d \u201csin,\u201d \u201chell,\u201d \u201cvirtue,\u201d \u201cobedience,\u201d and \u201cduty\u201d were conspicuously absent, just as they\u2019re absent from most sermons delivered in most churches, everywhere in the country.\n\nNow, while many would say that his kind of approach packs the house, Walsh claims that the crowd seemed totally bored and disconnected. Thus, his thesis centered on the question of whether this kind of worship is \"effective.\" Maybe?\n\nEffective at making this whole thing seem rote and shallow, that\u2019s for sure. I guess it\u2019s supposed to entertain us, but our faith isn\u2019t suppose to be merely entertaining. It\u2019s so much more than that. When you reduce it to mere distraction and spectacle, it loses its substance, and without its substance it is, among other things, boring.\n\nI wonder what a secular person might think if he was looking to give Christianity a try and that was the first service he ever attended? Yeah, he wouldn\u2019t leave offended (or impacted, or moved, or energized), but would he even be awake?\n\nWould he have a deeper understanding of the faith, or would he be scratching his head, wondering what all the Jesus fuss is about? If he went in prepared to encounter something deep, holy, and challenging, would he walk out feeling like that goal was accomplished?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nThus, Walsh asked a rather blunt question: Is the modern church so tame that it is boring people to death? Yes, there may be people fleeing because they are offended by orthodox theology. But are those people joining other churches or joining the ranks of \"nones\"? Might other people be hitting the exits because they are simply bored?\n\nThis isn't a Protestant question, alone. Looking at these Pew Forum numbers, many Catholic leaders need to ponder that question.\n\nEnjoy the podcast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like many of our readers, I have been digging into tons of coverage of the \r\nnew Pew Forum study (full .pdf document here) offering an update on the \r\ngrowth of the \"nones\" and the cultural-left coalition of religious \r\nliberals, agnostics, atheists, \"spiritual but not religious\" believers and \r\nsimple unaffiliated people.\r\n\r\nAs our own Julia Duin noted the other day, the basic theme in the \r\nmainstream coverage is that the number of self-proclaimed \"Christians\" in \r\nAmerica is falling, quickly.
