His hatred focused on one creature in particular: The Blonde Slut.\n\nThe Blonde Slut roams free in California and, at this time, is not on the endangered species list in that state. The latest census numbers put the population of the species in the millions.\n\nWhile it is true the Blonde Slut has been responsible for much of the hurt, ridicule, drama, head games, boob jobs, and heartbreak that has taken place in the state, they can also be very loving, kind, sexy, unintelligent, wonderful people.\n\nHopefully, the authorities will see this case for what it is \u2013 a young man who couldn\u2019t get any and decided to make everyone else miserable with him. It is our hope the state does not do anything rash like ban Blonde Sluts from the state or put needless restrictions on them.\n\nOne fear is that legislators will limit the number of times a year a woman can dye her hair blonde, but then you have roots growing out and that\u2019s not good for anybody. In fact, some suggest doing so could wreck the state\u2019s stripping and cosmetology industries.\n\nPolice are reportedly looking into whether this was a hate crime since the killer stated in his YouTube video how he resented the fact that blondes have more fun than he did.\n\nAuthorities are also asking Blonde Sluts in California to try to act a little less slutty, but not too much less.\n\nThe young killer wanted to go out in a blaze of glory but will simply go down in history as the \u201cVirgin Douchebag.\u201d\n\nIt is sad that a young man who obviously had some issues couldn\u2019t get help from a professional so this incident could have been avoided. However, when you make the decision to try to take out members of the highly-prized Blonde Slut species, you will not be fondly remembered.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "article_summary": "Authorities are also asking Blonde Sluts in California to try to act a little less slutty, but not too much less.\nIt is our hope the state does not do anything rash like ban Blonde Sluts from the state or put needless restrictions on them.\nThe Blonde Slut roams free in California and, at this time, is not on the endangered species list in that state.\nHis hatred focused on one creature in particular: The Blonde Slut.\nHowever, when you make the decision to try to take out members of the highly-prized Blonde Slut species, you will not be fondly remembered."}
