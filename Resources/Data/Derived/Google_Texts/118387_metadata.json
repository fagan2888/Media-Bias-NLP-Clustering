Inside they found 83-year-old, Ozie Mcbeath dead. After the officers were able to put out the fire, 23-year-old Victor Mcbeath was found in the woods near the home and taken into custody for killing his step-father.\n\n\"It's still under investigation. We've got a lot of work to do. We do believe that we have the murder weapon, which is going to be shotgun,\" says Waddell.\n\nWaddell says the shotgun gauge and the size of the shell found in the Mcbeath's back bedroom match. It was sent to Mississippi crime lab for investigation. Waddell says Mcbeath is a habitual offender previously charged with drug violations.\n\n\"He was a troubled person, but there's no reason he should have shot him. It's just so sad that he would do something to someone that has always been there for him,\" says Williams.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "One man is dead and Victor McBeath is in custody after a fatal shooting on County Road 101 in Neshoba County, early Wednesday morning.", "language": "english", "author": "Lindsey Jennings", "og": {"description": "One man is dead and Victor McBeath is in custody after a fatal shooting on County Road 101 in Neshoba County, early Wednesday morning.", "title": "Neshoba Murder Leaves Family Shocked", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Murder-Leaves-Family-Shocked--356187221.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0B0/958/0B09582EB83441FCA705D9A9D44A8BE3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C35/8F4/C358F4BBA996482CB6EFD3694D5B825A.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "One man is dead and Victor McBeath is in custody after a fatal shooting on County Road 101 in Neshoba County, early Wednesday morning.", "title": "Neshoba Murder Leaves Family Shocked", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Murder-Leaves-Family-Shocked--356187221.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/VICTOR+MCBEATH.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Neshoba Murder Leaves Family Shocked", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Neshoba Murder Leaves Family Shocked"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2096\"", "article_summary": "One man is dead and Victor McBeath is in custody after a fatal shooting on County Road 101 in Neshoba County, early Wednesday morning.\nWe do believe that we have the murder weapon, which is going to be shotgun,\" says Waddell.\nAfter the officers were able to put out the fire, 23-year-old Victor Mcbeath was found in the woods near the home and taken into custody for killing his step-father.\nSheriff Tommy Waddell says they received a 911 call early Wednesday morning, saying shots were fired at a home on County Road 101.\nIt's just so sad that he would do something to someone that has always been there for him,\" says Williams."}
