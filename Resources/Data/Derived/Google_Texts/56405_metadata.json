(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it over and over: Congress passes huge bills, like Obamacare or the recent omnibus spending bill, that contain hundreds of provisions, and occupy thousands of pages \u2014 or tens of thousands if you include the ensuing pages of regulations. These bills are so long that literally no one has read the whole thing. They\u2019re not so much bills, really, as Christmas trees on which lobbyists and legislators hang their goodies.\n\nA bill that\u2019s so long that nobody can read it is, naturally, pretty likely to escape scrutiny. With thousands of pages and hundreds or thousands of provisions in the bill, what\u2019s the chance that any particular provision will be noticed or criticized?\n\nAnd even if a few provisions are criticized, when they\u2019re tied to a bill that rewards literally hundreds of constituencies, there\u2019s not much chance they\u2019ll be shot down. Legislators, and special interests, have a vested interest in sticking together and being sure that the whole bill passes. Individually, most of these lousy provisions wouldn\u2019t pass, but when banded together for mutual protection they can.\n\nThe result is something that doesn\u2019t look much like the legislative process as we teach it in school. There aren\u2019t hearings on each provision, there isn\u2019t a lot of public debate, and there\u2019s essentially no back-and-forth. Often, most of the provisions are written by lobbyists and inserted by tame members of Congress. The public isn\u2019t really represented at all. That\u2019s not an accident \u2014 it\u2019s by design.\n\nEnter Congresswoman Mia Love, a Republican from Utah. She wants to introduce a \u201csingle subject rule\u201d to federal legislation. Says Love, as quoted by the Deseret News: \"Members of both parties have made a habit of passing complex, thousand-page bills without hearings, amendments or debate. ... That process and the collusion that goes with it are why we are $18 trillion in debt and why the American people have lost trust in elected officials.\"\n\nHer bill, H.R. 4335, would do the following according to Love's congressional website:\n\nRequire that each bill enacted by Congress be limited to only one subject;\n\nEnd the practice of attaching controversial legislation to unrelated, must-pass bills;\n\nRequire the subject of a bill to be clearly state in its title;\n\nMake void in appropriations bills, general legislation that does not pertain to the underlying (appropriations) bill;\n\nMake the legislative process more transparent to the public\n\nImportantly, the bill also provides for judicial review, allowing a court to strike legislation that doesn\u2019t comply. And, in keeping with Love\u2019s philosophy, the bill is just over three pages long.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly a new idea. Many states, such as Mia Love\u2019s Utah, or my own state of Tennessee, have provisions in their state constitutions that limit legislation to a single subject. Some also provide for judicial review. And Love isn\u2019t the first to propose such a rule: In fact, Brannon Denning and Brooks Smith proposed a constitutional amendment, the \u201cTruth In Legislation Amendment,\u201d in a law review article over a decade ago. (Coincidentally, their piece was published in the Utah Law Review.)\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nWhether enacted legislatively, or by constitutional amendment, a rule that a bill must have a single subject and a descriptive title would go a long way toward limiting cronyism and corruption. Personally, I would prefer a constitutional amendment that, like Tennessee\u2019s provision, would allow anyone to sue and have a bill struck down if it did things not included in its caption. A statute like Love\u2019s is second-best, and given our political class\u2019s willingness to skirt the rules, probably a poor second-best, though still worth trying.\n\nThe deeper problem is that neither Congress, nor the voters, seems sufficiently attached to clean government to make it work. In the old days of what is now nostalgically referred to as \u201cregular order,\u201d one set of congressional committees had to authorize spending, while another had to appropriate funds. Spending bills \u2014 and general legislation \u2014 advanced after subcommittee and committee hearings in which issues were discussed publicly, followed, sometimes at least, by amendments. This gradually broke down with the growth of gigantic omnibus bills, and once politicians realized they could get away with it, the kitchen-sink approach to legislation became the norm.\n\nAs Rep. Love notes, this is how we wound up with an enormous debt and with a Congress that few Americans respect. The old days were hardly a paradise of clean government, but they look like that now, by comparison with what we\u2019ve got. Her bill is, at least, a step in the right direction. Will it pass? We can hope.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.To read more columns like this, go to the Opinion front page.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1WXJdtC", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "To thrive, voters in a democracy need to understand what is going on better than lobbyists.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "To thrive, voters in a democracy need to understand what is going on better than lobbyists.", "title": "Want to know why voters are so mad?
