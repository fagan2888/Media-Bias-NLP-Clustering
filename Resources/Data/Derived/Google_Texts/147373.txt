YAOUNDE, Cameroon-The Nigerian Islamic sect Boko Haram’s expanding insurgency into Cameroon has prompted Chinese oil firm, Yan Chang Logone Development, to suspend exploration in Cameroon’s Far North Region, sources at Cameroon’s National Hydrocarbons Corp., known as SNH, said.

State-run SNH, which manages and markets Cameroon’s oil industry, is in a joint venture with the Hong Kong-based company. Yan Chang, which had reached a $62 million exploration and production-sharing contract with SNH in 2009, is the first Chinese corporation to explore for oil in Cameroon.

It is the second time in a year that work has been interrupted on the site where the testing of three wells suggests there are huge oil and gas reserves.

Yan Chang has been operating on two oil blocks in Waza in the Far North Region, where 10 Chinese road construction workers were kidnapped in mid-May by suspected armed militants of Boko Haram. The hostage-takers also took a dozen vehicles and explosives belonging to the road constructor.

Boko Haram is believed to be involved in at least five abductions—mainly of foreigners—in the area, which borders Nigeria’s Borno State, known as the stronghold of the sect.

“The Chinese embassy recalled all its workers in the Far North Region and this coincided with the suspension of work on the oil fields we’re operating there with our partner Yan Chang Logone Development Holding Co. Ltd.,” SNH’s Director of Exploration Simon Tamfu said.

The Chinese embassy in Yaounde couldn’t be reached for comment and a spokeswoman at the Yan Chang office in the West African nation’s port city of Douala refused to speak on the matter.
