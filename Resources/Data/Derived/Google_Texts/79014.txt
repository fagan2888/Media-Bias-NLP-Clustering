JERUSALEM (AP) â€” The Israeli military says it has suspended an officer after soldiers were caught on camera assaulting a pair of Agence France-Press journalists in the West Bank.

The army said Sunday that after a preliminary review, it determined the officer in charge "did not conduct himself in accordance with professional expectations." It called the incident "grave and in contravention of its code of ethics" and said the investigation was continuing.

The Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists covering Israel and the Palestinian territories for international news organizations, has said the AFP photographer and cameraman were beaten by Israeli troops Friday in an unprovoked attack. The soldiers smashed a video camera and a still camera.

The army has a long history of ignoring complaints of alleged violence against journalists.
