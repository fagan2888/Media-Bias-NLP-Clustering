People who are interested in getting an ObamaCare plan this year still have time but they can also expect to pony up some more dollars.

As of now, the deadline to enroll in ObamaCare for 2016 is January 31.

New information from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shows the average premium under ObamaCare rose to $408 per month. That is for 2016 plans and reflects an increase of about nine percent from this time last year.

Hadley Heath Manning, director of Health Policy at the Independent Women's Forum, points out that this is the unsubsidized premium price.

"So this is the total premium price that unsubsidized customers pay on their own," she explains, "or subsidized customers pay along with help from the government through a subsidy or tax credit."

Disputing the government's figures, The Daily Caller reported that rates are expected to rise 20.3 percent on average in 2016, citing an analysis by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Some plans in some states will rise even higher, the analysis claims.

A complaint people have made about the Affordable Care Act is that it's misnamed because the plans are unaffordable.

Based on the new information from HHS, OneNewsNow asked Manning for comment.

"Well, the price tag certainly is not affordable," she responds. "These plans are much more expensive than similar plans that were available before the Affordable Care Act passed and before many of the regulations standardized what all insurance plans must carry."

That being said, Manning points out that more coverage comes with more cost.

"That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone," she observes.

Defenders of ObamaCare argue that many - if not most - of the customers on federal and state exchanges are using a subsidy or tax credit. But Manning says tax dollars and public funds go towards tax credits and subsidies.
