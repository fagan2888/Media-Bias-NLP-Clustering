Furthermore, no drug-related adverse events were noted in either patient, which is always a concern when you're dealing with gene-modifying therapies. Bluebird anticipates reporting additional data later this year on these patients as well as an expanded 15 patient beta-thalassemia trial.\n\nNow what: Again, we have incredibly encouraging data that after less than two weeks patients who are in constant need of transfusions have been transfusion-free for months. As noted from its original LG001 study, its third subject has remained transfusion-free for a full six years! The safety profile, though, is what's more impressive to me as gene therapies can often come with notable side effects. While I believe there's merit for upside today, I'd also encourage investors not to uncork the champagne bottle just yet after a very small sample size of patients has shown a response. With a valuation that topped $1 billion this morning for a clinical-stage company I'd surmise that traders are allowing their emotions to get the best of them. Feel free to add bluebird to your watchlist, but I'd suggest monitoring it from a very safe distance for the time being.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:20", "description": "Bluebird shares take flight after the company reports encouraging initial data for LentiGlobin.
