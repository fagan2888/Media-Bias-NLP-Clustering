They found podiums and shone under pressure, earning their first-ever tickets to their sports\u2019 biggest show.\n\nCall it pressure or tough courses or just plain bad luck, but the newcomers are falling quickly. The latest was the Sochi Winter Olympics\u2019 youngest athlete, Voisin, whose impressive switch 1080 at the Aspen X Games earned her bronze and proved U.S. Freeskiing\u2019s coaches right in their decision to nominate her for the U.S. Olympic Ski Team. Voisin broke her right ankle while practicing on the rail features of the burly slopestyle course early Saturday.\n\nWalker bruised her heel on the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park slopestyle course\u2019s final rail feature a few days earlier while practicing. Kloser took a seemingly innocuous tumble while practicing on the moguls course late Thursday.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Maggie Voisin, U.S. freestyle skier, out of Olympics with broken ankle", "title": "Maggie Voisin, U.S. freestyle skier, out of Olympics with broken ankle", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/07/maggie-voisin-u-s-freestyle-skier-out-of-olympics-with-broken-ankle/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_010701_rsz_dsc_0487.jpg", "height": 623}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_010701_rsz_dsc_0487.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T01:04:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:00:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Voisin broke her right ankle while practicing on the rail features of the burly slopestyle course early Saturday.\nThe U.S. Olympic qualifying season this winter mashed several contests into an intense few weeks and many up-and-comers \u2014 like 15-year-old slopestyle skier Maggie Voisin, 16-year-old snowboarder Ty Walker and 21-year-old bump skier Heidi Kloser \u2014 rose to the occasion.\nWalker bruised her heel on the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park slopestyle course\u2019s final rail feature a few days earlier while practicing.\nSOCHI \u2014 America\u2019s Olympic-season year of the rookie is emerging as a curse in Russia.\nCall it pressure or tough courses or just plain bad luck, but the newcomers are falling quickly."}
