Like climate change, scientists have been warning about bacterial resistance \u2014 and the possibility of previously eradicated diseases reemerging \u2014 for years. But doctors are still overprescribing antibiotics and patients are still misusing them. A new easy-to-use antibiotic, however, called oritavancin, may help us control antibiotic use at least a bit more.\n\nThe drug diverges from the usual antibiotic regimen. Instead of patients undergoing a 10-day, twice-daily regimen of antibiotic treatment, they would only have to take one dose of oritavancin. The antibiotic was developed by researchers at Duke Medicine in order to get around a common problem many patients have: They stop taking the antibiotic at some point during their treatment because they feel better. But the antibiotic usually isn\u2019t finished with its job, which results in the bacteria not only coming back, but developing a resistance to the medication. Oritavancin makes it easier to get rid of infections.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged activity is what makes oritavancin distinctive,\u201d Dr. G. Ralph Corey said in a press release. \u201cThe drug has a long half-life, which allows for single-dose treatment.\u201d Corey is lead author of the three-year study, which was funded by oritavancin\u2019s owner, The Medicines Company.\n\nOritavancin would be useful for treating a range of bacterial skin infections, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a particularly hardy and easily spreadable bacteria. MRSA infections typically look like spider bites, but quickly worsen, becoming red, swollen, and full of pus \u2014 they may also cause fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe study, which involved two separate trials, tested oritavancin in almost 2,000 patients. The results of the first trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. The researchers found that a single intravenous (IV) dose of oritavancin on a group of 475 patients was just as effective as twice-daily IV doses of vancomycin for seven to 10 days. The drug reduced the size of infected wounds by 20 percent within the first three days, and reduced the severity of fever. The results will soon be presented to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cHaving a single-dose drug could potentially prevent hospitalizations or reduce the amount of time patients would spend in the hospital,\u201d Corey said in the press release.\n\nMRSA infections can be prevented with proper hygiene. Simply using antibacterial soap and ointment lowers risk of infections in the ICU \u2014 they\u2019re most prevalent in health care settings \u2014 by 37 percent, a study from last year found. The CDC also suggests keeping your personal items to yourself, and not sharing towels and razors. Most importantly, if you think you have an infection, get checked as soon as possible.\n\nSource: Corey G, Kabler H, Mehra P, et al.
