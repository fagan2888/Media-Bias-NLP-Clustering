This show explains why Barack Obama will not be remembered as the “Agricultural President”, and why candy is probably not a big driver of obesity. We also note that tick larvae look a lot like tiny adult ticks, and Jean gets to vent on the Affordable Care Act. St. Claire dietitian Jean Jones and UK dietetic intern Jordan Bressler are our guests.

Tip: It is tick season, but remember ticks rarely transmit disease in the first 24 hours. Check yourself when you come indoors.
