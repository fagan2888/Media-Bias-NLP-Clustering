PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota forward Zach Parise missed the Wild\u2019s game Saturday night against Tampa Bay, and is considered week to week with a sprained MCL in his right knee.\n\nParise, who leads Minnesota and is tied for eighth in the NHL with seven goals, was injured during the first period on Thursday against Nashville when he was hit by Predators forward James Neal.\n\nBattling for the puck near the right wall in the offensive zone, Parise went awkwardly into the boards when Neal hit him from behind, possibly knee-to-knee. No penalty was called and Neal isn\u2019t facing any discipline from the league.\n\nParise has led the Wild to three straight playoff appearances after signing a 13-year, $98 million contract as a free agent in 2012. He\u2019s led the team in goals in two of the past three seasons, scoring 80 goals in 188 games.\n\nParise\u2019s 33 goals last season were the fourth-highest in franchise history.\n\nWild general manager Chuck Fletcher was glad the injury wasn\u2019t worse.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great news,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be back as soon as possible. But all things considered, in terms of knee injuries, it was the best case possible.\u201d\n\nMinnesota was also without defenseman Nate Prosser, who is considered day to day with a back injury. Prosser was injured after taking a crosscheck to the back against Nashville.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate there,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cHe\u2019s sore, but hopefully it won\u2019t be too long.\u201d\n\nThe Wild recalled forward Cristoph Bertschy from Iowa of the American Hockey League. Bertschy was set to make his NHL debut against the Lightning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota forward Zach Parise missed the Wild's game Saturday night against Tampa Bay, and is considered week to week with a sprained MCL in his right knee.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Minnesota forward Zach Parise missed the Wild\u2019s game Saturday night against Tampa Bay, and is considered week to week with a sprained MCL in his right knee.", "title": "Wild F Parise out with sprained MCL", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/7/wild-f-parise-out-with-sprained-mcl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/07/999aac73e48eec31860f6a706700699d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/07/999aac73e48eec31860f6a706700699d.jpg", "description": "Minnesota forward Zach Parise missed the Wild's game Saturday night against Tampa Bay, and is considered week to week with a sprained MCL in his right knee.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wild F Parise out with sprained MCL"}, "Author": "BRIAN HALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ST.
