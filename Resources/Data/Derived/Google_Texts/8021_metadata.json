Rick Snyder intervened. Courser, an accountant and tax lawyer from Lapeer, then gave a positively creepy speech in which he said he believed that Jesus wanted him to run to save the party.\n\n\n\nYet, even though those sinners turned their backs on the Lord, Courser doesn\u2019t intend to give up. He doesn\u2019t believe in democracy, really; he would fit right in with the Iran of the ayatollahs, if you substitute \u201cJesus\u201d for Mohammed.\n\n\n\nHis website says he went to law school to preserve the \u201cChristian heritage of America,\u201d and a steady stream of rambling essays and blog posts make it clear where he stands: \u201cWhen looking at the uprising in Egypt and our role in the world, remember this is what democracy looks like. It\u2019s ugly. Democracy is mob rule. We were set up as a republic, not a democracy. Democracy is tyranny by the majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nCourser, who sports a Lenin-style beard and an intense, almost frightening blue-eyed stare, prefers tyranny by the minority. Looked at in terms of things that are real \u2014 like Right to Work legislation, taxing pensions and slashing funds for education \u2014 Gov. Rick Snyder is the most hard right governor we\u2019ve had in modern times. Lt. Gov. Brian Calley is more so.\n\nIn an essay, \u201cA Few Thought\u2019s Before Mackinac,\u201d Courser says, \u201cWe need a credible candidate to challenge Brain [sic] Calley, because he supported Medicaid expansion \u2026 and supported Obamacare exchanges.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut alas, \u201cI\u2019m just not certain Wes Nakagiri is that choice \u2026 because of his past ties to the establishment.\u201d\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to see or recognize but with every exposure, every freedom and liberty bill, with every email educating people about the proper role of government and society, with each step explaining what is and is not God ordained as given rights, with each of these steps and having a few liberty eyes and ears and voices in the state capitol, we can all sleep just a little wee bit easier\u2026.but we do need many more eyes and ears and voices for Liberty and Freedom in the state house for 2016\u2026\n\nAnd so on that note, if the roads are so darned/damned bad, well then cut back and stop eating the wine and caviar and tighten the belts and eat a little Hamburger Helper and let\u2019s spend the people\u2019s treasury on the things that should be a priority for government! LIKE THE ROADS!\n\nIt's perhaps best to leave the description of Todd Courser toCourser hasn't gone away. Last November, he won a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives. Since then, he's continued a habit that Lessenberry later notes in his piece: Courser often writes rambling diatribes on ... things. For instance:Poor Todd: His nemesis \"Brain\" Calley still won and remains the governor's lieutenant.Anyway, today, Courser published an entry on his website today titled, \"First Bills.\" It serves as an update of sorts on his experience in Lansing thus far, and it comes off like a word soup manifesto of biblical proportions . Consider:What? Thanks to all human persons who have \"liberty eyes and ears and voices\" in Lansing, Courser helpfully explains, \"we can all sleep just a little wee bit easier.\" Was this the continuation of a thought that occurred to him during a dream? As Eric Baerren points out , there's really nothing concrete in any of the words Courser splatters across his page, just nice tidbits to pick and choose and consider what the hell this guy is actually saying. Like this, in which he slams any plan whatsoever that seeks to fill a pothole that doesn't entail simply shrinking the government:Incredible. In one gasping breath, he implies he believes the roads don't even need to be fixed, and then suggests that, instead, we spend money to ... fix the roads. And please, all you fat cats in Wayne County, stop sucking down the caviar and drinking Merlot every goddamn night and eat some Hamburger Helper. (Also: nice use of \"darned\"\"damned\" there.)We'll say this: There is something biblical about Courser: His words are like the Peace of God \u2026 in that they passeth human understanding.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "It's perhaps best to leave the description of Todd Courser to MT columnist Jack Lessenberry.
