Are you a risk taker? Do you like parties?\n\nOdds are, questions like these were not part of your last doctor\u2019s appointment. But one day they might be \u2014 a growing body of research suggests that your personality can influence your health. And some experts think changing people\u2019s personal traits might one day help treat diseases \u2014 or keep people from getting them in the first place.\n\nThe research also comes at a time when many are calling for a more individualized approach to medicine. Some day, researchers hope, personality testing could be used to help your doctor design treatment specifically to you.\n\nFor a study published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, Kavita Vedhara and her co-authors gave personality tests to 121 people, and tested their blood to analyze the expression of genes related to inflammation. They found that the personality trait of extroversion was associated with increased expression of genes promoting inflammation. Meanwhile, conscientiousness, which the authors define as a trait \u201creflecting planfulness, caution, and harm avoidance,\u201d was associated with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Since inflammation can be part of the body\u2019s response to infection, higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes can mean a more active immune system; lower expression can mean a relatively less active one.\n\nIt could be, the authors write, that people with weak immune systems become more introverted to protect themselves from infection (meet fewer people, get fewer germs). They might become more conscientious for the same reason. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that people\u2019s personalities affect their gene expression \u2014 people who go to a lot of fun, germy parties (or who are really bad at washing their hands) might start to undergo gene-expression changes that strengthen their immune systems.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean everybody should get a personality test, Dr. Vedhara told Op-Talk. But it does suggest that in general, a treatment approach that considers the patient\u2019s psychological profile may be more effective than one that just looks at physical symptoms.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re confronted with a chronic condition\u201d like diabetes or heart disease, she explained, \u201cyou may well have underlying beliefs about your condition which influence how likely you are to engage with treatment, you might have an emotional response to that condition which might influence your underlying physiology and your ability to recover or to manage your disease, you may well have an orientation which makes you more or less likely to exercise\u201d \u2014 and looking at all of those factors as well as the physical manifestations of the condition itself might help doctors treat it better.\n\n\u201cMost areas of medical intervention work quite well,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think that we\u2019re on the brink of seeing a future where we use psychological interventions and behavioral interventions to maximize their efficacy.\u201d\n\nJoshua Jackson, a psychology professor at Washington University, also sees understanding personality as a way to improve physical health. In a recent study, he and his co-authors looked at personality and longevity \u2014 or, more specifically, at how your friends\u2019 assessments of your personality might predict how long you\u2019ll live. They found that men whose friends thought they were conscientious and open tended to live longer than those whose friends found them less so; for women, the traits associated with longer life were agreeableness and emotional stability. And friends\u2019 assessments of subjects\u2019 personalities were better than their own self-reports at predicting how long they would live.\n\nConscientiousness people, Dr. Jackson told Op-Talk, tend to \u201ceat their vegetables and exercise,\u201d as well as avoiding risky behaviors like driving without a seatbelt. \u201cThey seem to just live a nice, buttoned-up and tidy life, which helps them live longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen individuals,\u201d meanwhile, \u201care not necessarily set in their ways, they\u2019re able to change, they\u2019re open to new experiences.\u201d So they may be amenable to altering their diets or making other changes that could improve their health. Openness may also be associated with a tendency to do mentally challenging activities like crosswords, Dr. Jackson noted, which may also promote good health.\n\nHe thinks the gender differences his team found may have to do with social mores in the 1930s, when the personality assessments were conducted. He and his co-authors write, \u201cIt is likely that high levels of peer-rated emotional stability and agreeableness predict mortality because they largely assess positive characteristics indicative of a supportive and easy-going wife, such as that described in the social theory of the time.\u201d However, he told Op-Talk, some research suggests \u201cthat personality within women has a less robust relationship with health and longevity.\u201d\n\nDr. Jackson sees a role for personality research beyond predicting when you\u2019re going to die. Understanding someone\u2019s personality could help doctors determine which patients are going to have trouble following a new medication or exercise regimen (conscientious people, he said, are especially good at doing what their doctors tell them to do).\n\nHe\u2019s also involved in research into how changes in personality might affect health. \u201cWe know that personality changes across the life span\u201d \u2014 people tend to become more conscientious and less neurotic over time \u2014 \u201cbut some people change more than others.\u201d And since personality traits are associated with health, altering those traits might make someone healthier or sicker.\n\nBrent Roberts, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Dr. Jackson was once his student), has found that changes in personality can be linked to changes in health. \u201cThat sets up an interesting possibility,\u201d he told Op-Talk: If personality can be altered, \u201cthen it could be a target of intervention.\u201d People can become less neurotic with medication or therapy, he said, and \u201cif that\u2019s the case, then you have an interesting question about whether interventions like that could be used to help people be healthier at an earlier age because you could change their personality.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatry professor Benjamin Chapman says personality was long thought to be unchangeable: \u201cthe term was, personality was set like plaster.\u201d But now, he told Op-Talk, some believe people can change their personalities if they want to: \u201cYou might be able to change at least some aspect of conscientiousness in your 40s, for instance, and not get heart disease in your 60s.\u201d\n\nTherapy is one way to change personality, he added, but its scale is necessarily limited. \u201cPsychotherapy for hundreds of thousands of people is not cost-effective,\u201d he said, and the question is \u201cwhether this sort of thing can be accomplished with something that\u2019s less labor-intense and reaches more people.\u201d Some programs in schools, such as those that teach responsibility and goal setting, \u201cprobably have a de facto effect on the shaping of personality and traits like conscientiousness,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe tricky thing is, how would you do that later in life?\u201d\n\nThe time may be ripe for a focus on the personal. \u201cThe personalized medicine movement,\u201d said Dr. Chapman, seeks \u201cto get a very individualized prediction of, will you get this disease, will this treatment work for you, how long will you live?\u201d Such predictions are usually made based on demographic information and risk factors like smoking, he said (some, like the chief executive of England\u2019s National Health Service, have called for a personalized-medicine approach focusing on genetic information). But Dr. Chapman believes personality may be a useful element in such predictions: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve suggested is that certain aspects of personality pick up on a very unspecified and general but highly relevant set of factors related to future health, and you might be able to augment those predictive models with personality-type measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s been a big shift in medicine toward patient satisfaction and patient-centered care.\u201d And collecting some information on patients\u2019 personalities might be one way of fostering better relationships between patients and doctors: \u201cthe question would be, can the doctor use that information to better understand the patient, better understand how to approach them, how to interpret their behavior?\u201d As Dr. Chapman, Dr. Roberts, and Paul Duberstein write in a 2011 review article in the Journal of Aging Research:\n\n\u201cPersonality assessment could improve the provision of patient-centered care because the physicians better understand how to approach and interact with different kinds of patients. The mere presence of these assessment tools in primary care waiting rooms would convey to patients that the provision of high quality health care is not solely about ordering diagnostic tests, arriving at the correct diagnosis, and prescribing appropriate treatments. It is also about expressing concern and empathy and understanding the patient\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nAt The New York Times\u2019s Well Blog, Dr. Sandeep Jauhar writes, \u201cquality improvement in medicine is too often a blunt instrument. We try to take what works in certain situations and apply it to all situations. Our methods yield results for populations, not individual patients.\u201d And, he adds, \u201ca shift to more personalized medicine will be needed to continue to make the kind of progress to which patients and doctors have become accustomed.\u201d\n\nPersonality research could become part of such a shift. As Dr. Vedhara puts it, \u201cthe individual who has the disease is almost as important as the underlying disease itself. So if medicine treated not only the pathology but the person with the pathology, it would probably get more bang for its buck.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141229102231, "twitter": {"description": "A growing body of research suggests that personality can affect your health, and that changing it could help you get better.", "title": "Could a Personality Test Improve Your Health?", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/could-a-personality-test-improve-your-health/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/12/15/opinion/nyto-healthy/nyto-healthy-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 29, 2014", "keywords": "Emotions,Genetics and Heredity,Longevity,Psychology and Psychologists,Research,Tests (Medical),Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Could a Personality Test Improve Your Health?
