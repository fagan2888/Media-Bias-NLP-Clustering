They stayed for the fiesta.\n\nThe streets of Ybor were packed Saturday for the annual Fiesta Day and Flan Festival. Hundreds of people spent the day on Seventh Avenue, perusing booths and sampling cuisine that celebrated Ybor City\u2019s Hispanic heritage.\n\nFifteen recipes were submitted for judging in the contest for Best Flan in Tampa Bay. They were judged in three categories: traditional recipe, non-traditional recipe and presentation.\n\nGloria Battafarano took first place in the traditional category, and Dulce Magallanes won the title in the non-traditional category. Each of the winners earned a $200 prize.\n\nEvery year, contestants in the flan contest submit their recipes, sure that their dessert is best, said Tony Morejon, Hispanic affairs liaison for the county.\n\n\u201cBut anything is up for grabs here,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Lence, of Carrolwood, and her 5-year-old daughter Sofia entered their Oreo flan recipe in the non-traditional category this year. They didn\u2019t win, but they took home the trophy for best presentation last year, Lence said.\n\nShe started making flans a few years ago, and once she had mastered the traditional recipe, she started experimenting with other flavors. Lence\u2019s banana nut flan placed in the contest a few years ago.\n\n\u201cI just do it for fun,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Behrman", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Feb 2014 19:55:07 -0400", "Description": "YBOR CITY \u2014 They came for the flan.
