Afterwards they will receive medical attention if needed, food, and a comfort bag.\n\n\n\nIn the comfort bag, victims will receive: a toothbrush, toothpaste, band-aids, location, any essentials that one my need.\n\n\n\nOne volunteered, George, played a scenario out that he was eight months pregnant. Volunteers assessed his needs and he received medical attention. In the scenario his home has been destroyed and he can't find his husband.\n\n\n\nAfterwards they helped get his medicines that were left in his home and they search through other databases for his husband.\n\n\n\nGeorge says that although he had to play a scenario where he was a woman, these help him grow as a volunteer to understand what one might be going through.\n\n\n\nHe also says that what the Red Cross does is extremely helpful and believes more people should know how much they help in a natural disaster.\n\n\n\nThe Red Cross is ran off through donation, they are not funding by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
