Sioux Falls, SD

The City of Sioux Falls and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources are teaming up for the 12th Annual Project AWARE from July 12 through the 19.

Project AWARE stands for A Watershed Awareness River Expedition. The project gives volunteers the chance to clean, learn about and explore the 91 mile stretch of the Big Sioux River that goes from Sioux Falls to Westfield, IA.

Those who volunteer can help with clean up by paddling the river or by land-based recycling initiatives. The project also offers educational programs at the end of the day. Each program is offered free to the public.

Those who wish to volunteer and clean up, can do so by registering. Registration is not required for those who want to attend the evening programs.

To avoid a late registration fee, those who want to volunteer are asked to have their registration forms postmarked by June 20. Volunteers can stay the whole week, help just one day or anytime in between. Limited canoes are available and tent camping is free to volunteers.

Registration forms can be found at www.iowaprojectaware.com or by calling 605-367-8276.
