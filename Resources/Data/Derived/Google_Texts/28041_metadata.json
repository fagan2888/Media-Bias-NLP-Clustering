Darion Marcus Aguilar, age 19, opened fire inside The Mall in Columbia on Saturday morning. Although he is remembered as a \u201cgentle, sweet kid,\u201d Aguilar shot and killed two people before turning the gun on himself.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the teen reportedly took a taxi to the Maryland mall. Officials said he spent approximately an hour in the mall\u2019s food court before entering a store called Zumiez, which sells skateboarding accessories and gear.\n\nAuthorities said Aguilar immediately entered the shop\u2019s dressing room and removed a shotgun from his backpack. He then walked out of the dressing room and fired six to nine shots. Witnesses said the teen shot and killed 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson. He then used the same gun to commit suicide. Benlolo and Johnson were both Zumiez employees.\n\nFive others were reportedly injured in the attack. One person was shot in the foot and the remaining four were injured in the mass panic. The five additional victims\u2019 injuries were non life-threatening. Police found several crude explosive devices in the suspect\u2019s backpack. However, the devices were never activated.\n\nAguilar was a 2013 graduate of James Hubert Blake High School and was employed at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Although he applied and was accepted to Montgomery College in 2013, he failed to complete the registration and did not attend.\n\nHis mother said she had no idea her son was capable of murder. Aguilar\u2019s classmate, Tydryn Scott, was equally stunned. Scott said her friend was \u201cNever upset, never sad, just quiet\u2026 If any other emotion, he was happy, laughing.\u201d\n\nAs reported by New York Post, the the Columbia mall shooter\u2019s motive remains unknown. However, police recovered a personal diary that may provide some clues. Howard County Police Chief William McMahon said the journal revealed Darion Aguilar \u201cexpressed general unhappiness with his life.\u201d\n\nNumerous document and belongings were removed from the home Aguilar shared with his mother. Authorities confirmed they confiscated ammunition, computers, and numerous documents. They hope the items will help them understand what prompted the shooting.\n\nAlthough there are rumors that Aguilar and Benlolo were romantically involved, authorities have not confirmed any link between the suspect and either victim.\n\nZumiez CEO Rick Brooks said to the victims\u2019 fellow employees. He also said the store is working with the mall to honor Benlolo and Johnson. When the mall reopens, guests will have an opportunity to view and sign memory books. Flowers will also be provided to place in the mall\u2019s fountain as a memorial.\n\nThe Columbia mall shooter\u2019s motive remains unknown. However, authorities hope the information they gathered will provide some insight about Darion Aguilar\u2019s frame of mind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Columbia mall shooter's personal diary may help authorities understand his motive.
