Former Vice President Al Gore said the GOP is guilty of "political terrorism" because of those who are threatening a government shutdown over Obamacare.

“The only phrase that describes it is political terrorism,” Gore said Friday, speaking at the launch of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management in Washington. “Why does partisanship have anything to do with such a despicable and dishonorable threat to the integrity of the United States of America?”

“And now you want to threaten to not only shut down our government but to blow up the world economy unless we go back and undo what we did according to the processes of this democracy?” Gore said, referencing the Affordable Care Act. “How dare you?”

Gore also joked that he's a "recovering politician."
