Still, designers and software developers frequently fail to target the older population with their offerings, Jenkins said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we see enough investments in innovations that are focused on the 50-plus,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the first fund that\u2019s devoted to solutions around the 50-plus.\u201d\n\nNew Products\n\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management will do due diligence on potential investments and won\u2019t be contributing money to the fund, Jenkins said. AARP\u2019s first concern will be on helping new products get to market, rather than turning the biggest possible profit on an investment, she said.\n\n\u201cThere may or may not be returns, but this is key to serving our members who are looking for dependable solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cAging is different than it was 10 or 20 years ago, and we need to get the private sector involved.\u201d\n\nThe aging of the U.S. population, along with an increasing emphasis on aging at home -- instead of in assisted living or a nursing home -- is fueling investment in technologies such as telemedicine, which allows patients to communicate remotely with health-care providers. According to a 2014 study by IHS Inc., the global telehealth market will increase to $4.5 billion by 2018 from about $440 million in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe aging population is one of health care\u2019s tectonic shifts, driving government changes and policy changes,\u201d said Zen Chu, faculty director of the Healthcare Ventures course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course teaches health-care entrepreneurship.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Role\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, has encouraged health-care companies to experiment with home-based and preventive services, said Bill Fera, health-care analytics leader for consulting firm EY. Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly, has been increasingly paying for telehealth services, he said.\n\nMedZed, a closely held company based in Atlanta, said Wednesday it raised $3.2 million for its service that allows doctors to see homebound patients online with the help of a medical technologist who comes to the home. The money will be used to help refine the technology and expand into other markets, said Scott Schnell, MedZed co-founder and CEO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to sell the next widget,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to use the widget effectively to help providers and payers cut costs.\u201d\n\nStill, Fera said, companies are searching for a transformative technology for older people.\n\n\u201cI think people have been nibbling around the edges of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is a killer app in this space it hasn\u2019t been invented yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Lauerman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/aarp-starts-40-million-venture-fund-for-technology-for-seniors", "description": "AARP, the 37 million-member organization for people 50 and older, is establishing a $40 million venture capital fund to boost innovation and technology that will serve its constituents.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "AARP Starts $40 Million Venture Fund for Technology for Seniors"}, "parsely-author": "John Lauerman", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Jo Ann Jenkins,Aging,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Health,Venture Capital,AARP", "news_keywords": "Jo Ann Jenkins,Aging,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Health,Venture Capital,AARP", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/aarp-starts-40-million-venture-fund-for-technology-for-seniors", "parsely-title": "AARP Starts $40 Million Venture Fund for Technology for Seniors", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-01T10:30:00.003Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "AARP, the 37 million-member organization for people 50 and older, is establishing a $40 million venture capital fund to boost innovation and technology that will serve its constituents.", "parsely-tags": "Jo Ann Jenkins,Aging,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Health,Venture Capital,AARP,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-10-01T10:30:00.003Z", "parsely-section": "personal-finance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/aarp-starts-40-million-venture-fund-for-technology-for-seniors", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "AARP, the 37 million-member organization for people 50 and older, is establishing a $40 million venture capital fund to boost innovation and technology that will serve its constituents.", "title": "AARP Starts $40 Million Venture Fund for Technology for Seniors"}, "fb": {"status": "AARP, the 37 million-member organization for people 50 and older, is establishing a $40 million venture capital fund to boost innovation and technology that will serve its constituents."}, "parsely-post-id": "NVID40SYF01T01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "AARP, the 37 million-member organization for people 50 and older, is establishing a $40 million venture capital fund to boost innovation and technology that will serve its constituents.\nStill, designers and software developers frequently fail to target the older population with their offerings, Jenkins said.\n\u201cWe want to use the widget effectively to help providers and payers cut costs.\u201dStill, Fera said, companies are searching for a transformative technology for older people.\nThe money will be used to help refine the technology and expand into other markets, said Scott Schnell, MedZed co-founder and CEO.\nAccording to a 2014 study by IHS Inc., the global telehealth market will increase to $4.5 billion by 2018 from about $440 million in 2013."}
