He is launching a presidential campaign that stands virtually no chance of success, if you define \u201csuccess\u201d to mean acquiring the nomination. It looks increasingly likely, however, that Kasich defines success as something else altogether.\n\nKasich began his career in a dissident role. As the Republican Party careened in the 1980s and 1990s toward militant supply-side economics, Kasich carved out an identity as an old-fashioned deficit hawk. Kasich was evangelical on the subject of deficit reduction and conciliatory on the fervent class-war issues that increasingly animated his party. He wanted to cut wasteful defense spending and tax loopholes first, finding a way to square fiscal conservatism with populism.\n\nAs the chairman of the House Budget Committee during what was then called \u201cthe Republican Revolution,\u201d the frothy period after the GOP took control of the House for the first time in four decades, he tried to steer the revolution his way. He failed. I profiled Kasich in 1998, after his populist ambitions had dissolved into empty platitudes. Kasich was the kind of populist figure his party\u2019s Establishment liked having around \u2014 long on folksy slogans, short on substantive disagreement.\n\nKasich launched an abortive presidential campaign, then headed to Wall Street to make a pile of cash. In 2010, he ran and won an election for governor of Ohio. In that role, he embarked on another foray against party dogma. A 2012 Supreme Court ruling gave states the right to opt out of expanding Medicaid, which was the mechanism Obamacare used to provide coverage to the poorest uninsured citizens. Hatred for Obamacare is a core tenet of Republican doctrine, and conservatives have pressured their party\u2019s elected officials to turn down the Medicaid expansion \u2014 even at major cost to their hospitals and state budgets, let alone the health and welfare of their poorest citizens.\n\nKasich bucked the right and accepted the Medicaid expansion. What made his deviation not just noxious but utterly intolerable to the party base is the rationale he provided. Kasich did not just argue that the state\u2019s budget needed the money. He insisted that denying health insurance to poor people is \u2026 wrong:\n\nYa know, because people are poor doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t work hard. Because people are poor doesn\u2019t mean that \u2014 it sometimes means they couldn\u2019t pull themselves up by their bootstraps at some point in time. The most important thing for this legislature to think about: put yourself in somebody else\u2019s shoes.\u201d \u201cPut yourself in the shoes of a mother and a father with an adult child that\u2019s struggling. Walk in somebody else\u2019s moccasins. Understand that, ya know, poverty is real, and that when people are poor\u2026 I\u2019ll tell ya somethin\u2019, I had a; I had a comment; I had a conversation with a, one of the leaders\u2026 wasn\u2019t one of the leaders, but one of the members of the legislature the other day.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do too. I also happen to know that you\u2019re a person of faith. Now, when you die and get to the, get to the, uh, to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not gonna ask you much about what you did about keeping government small, but he\u2019s going to ask you what you did for the poor. Better have a good answer.\n\nHere was a Republican blowing open the moral question that his party was determined to obscure. To be sure, Republicans have different views about what sort of health-care system they would construct in an ideal world, with some preferring to offer modest assistance to some of the poor and sick, and others happy to let them fend for themselves. They usually bury these disagreements in abstract comparisons between their idealized alternative health-care policies and Obamacare, which they all agree is evil and must be repealed. Kasich came face to face with the actual political choice faced by American politicians: whether to support the coverage offered under Obamacare for the poor, or to leave them with nothing. Kasich actually came out and said that taking health insurance away from extremely poor people is immoral.\n\nThis was completely beyond the pale, infuriating conservative activists. Kasich has found himself increasingly alienated within the party. He courted supply-siders in New York in March, where he met with a frosty reception. Philip Klein of the conservative Washington Examiner argued, \u201cit will be important for conservative voters to punish him for his expansion of President Obama's healthcare law in his state.\u201d The Republican health care adviser Avik Roy declared, \u201cThe chances of John Kasich marrying Kate Upton are higher than the chances of John Kasich contending for the GOP nomination.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Kasich\u2019s only chance at redemption with the conservative base lay in confessing his terrible error and throwing himself upon their mercy \u2014 the strategy Marco Rubio has employed, more or less successfully, to atone for his failed attempts to reform immigration law. Instead, Kasich appears to be pursuing the exact opposite approach. Unlike the 1990s, when he slunk quietly away from his failed insurrection back into the bosom of the party elite, Kasich is veering away from it.\n\n\n\nHe has hired as his chief strategist John Weaver, who has cultivated an even more hostile relationship with the right than Kasich himself. Weaver cut his teeth advising John McCain through his doomed insurgent candidacy in 2000. McCain infuriated the Republican Establishment by uttering what was at the time the maximal heresy \u2014 he denounced George W. Bush\u2019s tax-cut plan not only as fiscally irresponsible but as a giveaway to the rich. It was, in other words, a Kasich-esque moral dissent. Weaver stuck with McCain through the first few years of Bush\u2019s term when, alienated by the hostility he had experienced, McCain sided with Democrats on nearly every domestic policy fight.\n\nWeaver went on to advise Jon Huntsman's flamboyantly moderate 2012 campaign, where he happily expounded upon his belief that Huntsman was the solution to the problem of a party that had lost its mind. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason our party is nowhere near being a national governing party,\u201d Weaver told Esquire in a 2011 interview. \u201cNo one wants to be around a bunch of cranks.\u201d\n\nJon Huntsman practices his eyeroll during a debate.

The overwhelming majority of them, however, go about this project with the utmost caution. They don\u2019t openly challenge the moral foundations of their party\u2019s most sacred pieties. They don\u2019t hire advisers who have described large segments of its base as cranks. They believe in working quietly in the background, rather than having it out in the open.\n\nThe drama of Kasich\u2019s campaign lies not in whether he can win, but rather in whether he is willing to lose gloriously, and whether he can attract enough support to force his adversaries to grant him political martyrdom.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Meet the new McCain-Huntsman doomed voice of sanity.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Meet the new McCain-Huntsman doomed voice of sanity.", "title": "John Kasich\u2019s Quest for Glorious Martyrdom", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/john-kasichs-quest-for-glorious-martyrdom.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/10/10-john-kasich.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Meet the new McCain-Huntsman doomed voice of sanity.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/10/10-john-kasich.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "John Kasich\u2019s Quest for Glorious Martyrdom", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, john kasich, campaign 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,john kasich,campaign 2016", "published_time": "2015-06-10T16:04:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, john kasich, campaign 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2f23\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason our party is nowhere near being a national governing party,\u201d Weaver told Esquire in a 2011 interview.\nHe has hired as his chief strategist John Weaver, who has cultivated an even more hostile relationship with the right than Kasich himself.\nJohn Kasich is a highly popular governor of a vital swing state, possessed of national experience and long-standing ties to his party\u2019s financial and ideological elite.\nWeaver cut his teeth advising John McCain through his doomed insurgent candidacy in 2000.\nAs the Republican Party careened in the 1980s and 1990s toward militant supply-side economics, Kasich carved out an identity as an old-fashioned deficit hawk."}
