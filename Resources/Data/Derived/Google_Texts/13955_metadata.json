One upshot: a massive \u201cdemonstration\u201d to see if $248 million can be saved this year in the care of California\u2019s oldest, disabled and poorest residents, including 200,000 in Los Angeles County.\n\nAlmost half of all individuals in the state who are eligible for both Medicare and Medi-Cal benefits are being steered to special Medi-Cal managed care plans where their health needs are supposed to be coordinated, and where federal and state payments are limited to a set fee per patient, eliminating open-ended fees for services.\n\nIt sounds good, except that lots of vulnerable people \u2014 many in nursing homes or suffering cognitive impairment \u2014 suddenly find themselves stripped of their regular doctor, and facing a bureaucratic maze to get that care reinstated.\n\nBeginning this spring, thousands of so-called dual eligibles each month receive packets advising that they must sign up with one of the plans, or the state will sign for them. If they want to keep their current doctors \u2014 notably, many paid by Medicare on a fee-for-service basis \u2014 they must proactively say so.\n\nAdvocates for the elderly and disabled \u2014 including the National Senior Citizens Law Center, the Center for Health Care Rights, and Neighborhood Legal Services of L.A. County, as well as the county Medical Association \u2014 say thousands don\u2019t understand what is at stake and have been unwittingly drafted into the demonstration.\n\nSome have seen gaps open in critical services, including chemotherapy, or sight-saving eye injections or prescriptions, because their previous providers say they are no longer on their patient list. Appeals to get such situations corrected are difficult for the cognitively impaired, especially for those who have no one to speak up for them. The state will not recognize an appeal unless it comes directly from the patient, or someone registered with the state as a health surrogate.\n\nThe state Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which manages the demonstration, says it puts a high priority on continuity of care and says that it is trying to make sure that Californians who get the enrollment packets understand their responsibilities.\n\nDHCS says the managed care plans will assist enrollees in many ways, including added dental and transportation benefits, and improved health care and social service coordination to help people stay out of hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nBut many Medi-Cal managed care plans have a reputation for reduced numbers of doctors and hospitals and that understandably frightens many dual eligibles. As of August, the most recent data available, 20,981 Los Angeles County residents had enrolled in the demonstration, while 36,552 had opted to keep their current doctors. In California, 42,473 had enrolled and 55,511 had opted out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvocates were dealt a setback last week when procedural issues forced the Medicaid Defense Fund to withdraw a federal lawsuit seeking to block Medicare and Medi-Cal from further enrollments in the demonstration. A similar lawsuit in state court failed in August. The judge ruled then that the plaintiffs had not shown that patients would be harmed by the project.\n\nA recent study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research pointed in another direction.\n\nMany of the people who are likely enrollees \u201care so physically, mentally and socially vulnerable,\u201d the study concluded, \u201cthat they could not withstand even temporary gaps in care.\u201d\n\nRoger Smith is managing editor of the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting at USC Annenberg, which partners with news organizations in California on health care issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act mandates that Medicare dramatically reduce spending to help pay for federal subsidies in the new health insurance exchanges.
