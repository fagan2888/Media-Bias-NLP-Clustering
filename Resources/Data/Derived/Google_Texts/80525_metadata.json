Kit Carson rallied from two games down to beat McClave, 3-2. The Lady Wildcats went on to beat South Baca and earn a berth to the Class 1A State Volleyball Championships to be held Nov. 7-8 at the Denver Coliseum. (John Contreras/The Lamar Ledger)\n\nThe Class 1A state-qualifying Region B volleyball tournament had high drama Halloween morning as the Kit Carson Lady Wildcats, by the narrowest of margins, won the championship.\n\nKit Carson, McClave, and South Baca played in the first regional held at the Lamar Community College Wellness Center on Friday morning.\n\n\n\nThe opening match between #1 seed Kit Carson and #3 seed McClave Lady Cardinals had all the drama you could hope for.\n\nIt was a wakeup call for Kit Carson as McClave slammed their way to a 2-0 lead, only to watch the Lady Wildcats slowly gather themselves to win the next two games and then pull out a 16-14 win in a dramatic game five.\n\n\n\nMcClave got off to a good start in leading early in game one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lady Cardinals held an 11-8 lead and extended that to 15-11, only to see the Lady Wildcats climb back in on the serving of libero Katie Johnson to trail 16-15.\n\nMcClave broke a 20-20 tie on two tips by freshman Allie Nidey and then rode the serving of Shelby Davis to a 25-20 win in the first set.\n\n\n\nIn the second game, McClave stormed to an 8-0 lead and increased that to 20-6 on a combination of kills by Tacie Canfield, Jordan Isom, and Peighton Martin and also took advantage of a number of Kit Carson errors.\n\nMcClave's Tacie Canfield battles at the net as Kit Carson's Brooke Dickey hits the ball over the net during action in the Class 1A state-qualifying Region B Tournament. Kit Carson rallied from two games down to beat McClave, 3-2. The Lady Wildcats went on to beat South Baca and earn a berth to the Class 1A State Volleyball Championships to be held Nov. 7-8 at the Denver Coliseum. (John Contreras/The Lamar Ledger)\n\nThe Lady Cardinals won going away 25-12.\n\n\n\nMcClave appeared in control of the match but saw Kit Carson wake up.\n\nThe Lady Wildcats got off to a 3-2 lead in game three and kept a narrow lead most of the way.\n\nDown 22-14, the Lady Cardinals, playing their best volleyball of the season, got right back in on Canfield's right arm.\n\nMcClave actually took a 25-24 lead on a Martin winner, but Aurelia Isenbart, the coach's senior daughter, hit home two blasts including the game winner, as Kit Carson pulled out a wild 27-25 win.\n\nIn the fourth game, the Lady Wildcats led from start to finish. They took an 8-2 lead and never looked back.\n\nSenior hitter Brooke Dickey had three kills late and freshman daughter Macayla Isenbart added six kills in the set, as Kit Carson won convincingly 25-15.\n\n\n\nAfter a three-minute timeout, the two teams only added more drama in the decisive fifth game.\n\nAgain leading 3-2, Kit Carson appeared to have things in hand as they kept a narrow lead at 10-7 on three kills by Aurelia Isenbart.\n\nBut the game Lady Cardinals showed their toughness as they tied things at 11-11 on two hits by Tacie Canfield.\n\nMacayla Isenbart had a tip and blast to carry Kit Carson to 14-11 lead, but again McClave fought back on a Jordan Isom bomb to tie the set at 14-14.\n\nA McClave passing error and a final blast by Aurelia Isenbart down the line gave the Lady Wildcats an electrifying five set win, 16-14.\n\n\n\nBoth McClave and Kit Carson played South Baca following that intriguing first match. The Lady Cardinals fswept the Lady Patriots 25-20, 25-20, 25-15 despite good hitting performances from South Baca's Bree-ann Carwin and Shaelynn Wood in both matches.\n\nThe McClave Lady Cardinals saw their season end with an 18-6 record.\n\nKit Carson then handled the Lady Patriots in three games as well, 25-20, 25-13, and 25-10 to capture the championship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was scary!\u201d said a relieved Kit Carson head coach Penny Isenbart after the ceremony. \u201cIt was like we didn't practice all week and forgot everything we were suppose to do, but we learned a lot. McClave came ready to play. That is a good team, and we had to battle through it. I was proud of the way we ended that match and the day, but I certainly wasn\u2019t happy with the way we started it. We played more with emotion and about let it get to us, but we figured it out finally.\"\n\nKit Carson (21-3) advances to the Class 1A State Volleyball Championship to be held Nov. 7-8 at the Denver Coliseum.
