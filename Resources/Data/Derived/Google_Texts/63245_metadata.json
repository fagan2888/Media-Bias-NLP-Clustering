Scott Walker, R-Wis., has approved legislation that will use public funds to finance a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.\n\nWisconsin governor has committed $250 million in taxpayer money to fund new arena for @bucks. http://t.co/7UCGpyVXBF \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) August 12, 2015\n\nThe bill pledges $250 million dollars from Wisconsin taxpayers\u2014half the cost of the $500 million stadium and the surrounding entertainment venue.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that:\n\nThe state taxpayer portion is capped at $80 million over 20 years, a cost that Walker said was more than reasonable to keep the team in the state. On top of that, about $47 million from the city of Milwaukee will come in the form of a parking structure and tax increment financing. The rest of taxpayers\u2019 share will come from bonds, a $4 million annual state payment with a corresponding reduction in Milwaukee County\u2019s annual state aid, a $2 ticket surcharge and the extension of Milwaukee city and county taxes on hotel rooms, rental cars, food and beverages.\n\nIn return, the Bucks must stay in Milwaukee. The remaining costs will be paid by the team\u2019s current and former owners.\n\nWalker has argued that keeping the revenue gained from having the team in Wisconsin is worth the expense. Critics of the deal call it corporate welfare.\n\n\u201cThis is an important day for the state of Wisconsin,\u201d Walker told reporters after he approved the legislation, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cIt\u2019s not just important for Milwaukee, but the state as a whole. We think this is a good solid move as a good steward of the taxpayers\u2019 money here in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nPeter Feigin, president of the Milwaukee Bucks, said in a statement:\n\nToday\u2019s signing is the culmination of an extraordinary effort from a broad coalition to not only keep the Bucks in Wisconsin, but revitalize Milwaukee. The entire Bucks family is thankful for the leadership and bipartisan support of Governor Walker, state legislators, local officials, countless organizations and the community. We will continue to work with the city and county to move this public-private partnership forward as swiftly as possible and make this world-class sports and entertainment district a reality.\n\nIn July, the legislation was passed by the state Senate in a 21-10 vote and by the Assembly in a 52-34 vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
