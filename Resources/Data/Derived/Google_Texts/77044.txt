The VA Western New York Healthcare System will show its admiration, respect and honor to veterans with its national salute to veteran patients. The salute offers VAs and communities across the nation the opportunity to partner together to honor veterans with special visits, cards and mementos.

VA Western New York Healthcare System invites local celebrities and community leaders to visit with veterans Friday, Feb. 12, at the Buffalo site, 3495 Bailey Ave. Introductions of local celebrities, civic officials and group leaders will take place at 1 p.m. in Freedom Hall, Room 301.

For the 38th consecutive year, the nationally syndicated column started by Ann Landers, now called "Annie's Mailbox," has devoted a column to the National Salute, asking readers to send Valentine cards and letters to hospitalized veterans at VA medical centers.

"Valentine cards made by local school children will be displayed and given to our veterans," VA Medical Center Director Brian G. Stiller said. "The messages in these cards are symbolic of the community's heartfelt affection for our veterans."

Stiller said he wants veterans to know the organization is available to serve their health care needs. He encourages veterans to stop by the Veterans Service Center to enroll in VA health care.

"Our medical center's volunteers are an essential component of our health care team. The National Salute is a great way for everyone to learn more about helping the veterans we serve, and how veterans can access VA health care, which meets the Affordable Care Act," Stiller said.

Also this year, the VA Voluntary Service will celebrate its 70th anniversary.
