Similarly, neuroscientists say a continuum of empathic intelligence exists with the species, with varying tendencies toward altruism and psychopathology. Now, researchers in Brazil say the use of newly developed biofeedback techniques may help to \u201ctrain\u201d the mind to feel greater levels of empathy and tenderness for others.\n\n\u201cWe found that participants were able to use visual feedback based on decoded fMRI patterns as a neurofeedback signal to increase brain activation characteristic of tenderness/affection relative to pride, an equally complex control emotion,\u201d says researcher Jorge Moll of D\u2019Or Institute for Research and Education in Rio de Janeiro, in a press statement. \u201cSuch improvement was not observed in a control group performing the same fMRI task without neurofeedback.\u201d\n\nIn the study, Moll and his colleagues scanned volunteers to identify neurological patterns associated with those feelings of tenderness and affection for loved ones, finding that such patterns could be strengthened with a bit of coaching. Reporting in the journal PLOS ONE on Tuesday, the researchers said the findings may help clinicians treat patients diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as well as postpartum depression.\n\nWith recent advances in neurobiology and neurotechnology, researchers have wondered whether it\u2019s possible to identify and decode brain signals associated with the so-called affiliative emotions, and whether those patterns might be enhanced. In this new study, the researchers used algorithms called \u201csupport vector machines\u201d to classify complex brain patterns associated with such feelings, finding they could indeed help volunteers to induce greater levels of empathy.\n\nMoll says the study also demonstrates that \u201chumans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness [and] affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering anti-social behavior.\u201d With the technique, the researchers observed a local response in the septhohypothalmic area as well as the prefrontal cortex \u2014 brain regions previously implicated in the production of affiliative emotion.\n\nSomewhat chillingly, the study authors compare the new technique to the fictive \u201cempathy box\u201d described in the 1982 dystopian film Blade Runner, whereby police hunt humanoid \u201creplicants\u201d deemed incapable of such affiliative emotions. However, Moll and his colleagues emphasize that such cognitive \u201cenhancements\u201d should be served on a voluntary basis.\n\nSource: Moll J, Weingartner JH, Bado P, et al.
