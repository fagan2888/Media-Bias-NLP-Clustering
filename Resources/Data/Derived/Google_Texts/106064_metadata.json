But the candidate polling in the top-three of a crowded field of mostly white GOP White House hopefuls seemingly has a distracting penchant for hyperbole. Especially when addressing socioeconomic issues that disproportionately impact Black America, some black Republicans have suggested.\n\nSome primary voters, especially those who are white and of an advanced age, might swoon over Carson previously comparing the Affordable Care Act to American slavery or his suggestion last week that abortion service provider Planned Parenthood\u2019s locations in black communities are strategically stifling the growth of the black population, but that kind of rhetoric can be cringeworthy for some black Republicans who say they would like to see a conservative candidate like Carson succeed because of his authenticity on black issues and not for reinforcing old racial stereotypes.\n\n\u201cHe has staying power because he comes across very authentic -- politicians would sell their firstborn for that quality,\u201d said Raynard Jackson, a black conservative Republican who has been a political strategist and consultant in Washington for more than 25 years. \u201cI think Ben Carson has taken this campaign seriously. He has dedicated himself to studying the issues,\u201d Jackson continued before making a measured, if not cautious, comparison: \u201cBut my greatest fear was that he\u2019d be another Herman Cain,\u201d he confessed.\n\nJackson was referring to the African-American former Godfather\u2019s Pizza chief executive from Georgia, who also initially polled well among a slate of white GOP candidates in the 2012 presidential election cycle by aligning himself with the right wing of the party on social and fiscal issues. Like Carson, Cain made inflammatory remarks about Planned Parenthood and abortions. But Cain\u2019s painfully obvious lack of knowledge on geopolitical issues coupled with sexual harassment allegations and cartoonish behavior in the media ended his campaign midway through the primary season.\n\nCarson, 63, spent time in the private sector with nearly 30 years in the medical profession before opting to seek America's highest public office. After more than four months since joining a field of 16 presidential candidates, he faces an uphill race for the Republican Party nomination against business tycoon Donald Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had been polling first and second, respectively, ahead of the retired neurosurgeon. The latest national poll had Trump at 24 percent of Republican support, 11 points ahead of Bush, who had 13 percent. Carson polled a few points behind Bush at 9 percent.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBut by the time he released his acclaimed autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d in 1992, Carson had long risen out of what he described as the harshest conditions of poverty in rough Detroit neighborhoods by achieving several noteworthy accomplishments: He obtained degrees from Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School; at age 33, he became the youngest pediatric neurosurgeon at Baltimore\u2019s John Hopkins Hospital; in 1987 he successfully separated twins born conjoined at the head; and he was the first black director of the unit. The combination of medical triumphs resulted in Carson receiving many lofty accolades, culminating in the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, bestowed on him in 2008 by President George W. Bush.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Karen Bleier/AFP\n\nBut it was Carson's February 2013 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast that catapulted him into the stratosphere among black and white conservatives alike. After regaling dignitaries and attendees with a heartfelt account of his rise out of poverty and youthful shortcomings, Carson slammed moral decay and fiscal irresponsibility in the U.S. and blasted the \u201cPC police,\u201d foreshadowing a string of politically incorrect statements.\n\nSeveral months later, Carson turned heads with his critique of the Affordable Care Act, a national healthcare reform law also known as Obamacare that is considered to be among President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant political achievements. \"You know Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery \u2026 because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about healthcare,\" Carson said in remarks at the conservative Values Voter Summit in October 2013. The comparison was an attempt to equate the mandate that all citizens enroll in a healthcare plan or face tax penalties with the centuries-long, forced bondage of millions of Africans and African-Americans in the U.S.\n\nCarson later admitted he regretted making the slavery allusion. But since then he\u2019s made ill-phrased comments against gay rights, including a statement in March declaring homosexuality was a choice some people make while in prison. Following the release of undercover \u201csting\u201d videos of doctors at a Planned Parenthood clinic discussing the sale of aborted fetal body parts, Carson said in an Aug. 12 Fox News interview that \u201cmost of their clinics in black neighborhoods [are] so that you can find [a] way to control that population.\u201d Those types of statements show Carson still has not learned to deliver legitimate policy critiques with language that prove he is in touch with reality, some black conservatives have said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a black person with two grains of sense, you know slavery was disgusting,\u201d said Crystal Wright, an African-American conservative and political TV pundit, who added that the number of black Republicans elevated to the presidential field is too small for virtually each one to spout rhetoric that reinforces stereotypes of blacks and minorities. \u201cThere are very few circumstances where this is acceptable [to make that comparison],\u201d she said.\n\nCarson\u2019s stance on the role of institutionalized racism in the U.S. has proved divisive among black Republicans. His statements in 2014 that race as an issue \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that much to me\u201d and was \u201ccontrived by liberals to divide people\u201d are among the most troubling statements an African-American candidate can make, some black conservatives said. Others said he is right to talk about how blacks have achieved great things in spite of racism.\n\nHowever, his personal story of triumph over poverty is one that transcends race and politics, said Wright, who agrees with Carson's stance on abortion. The \u201creal Ben Carson\u201d is at odds with the inexperienced candidate who needs to appeal to voters who have limited and even racist views of blacks, she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him is that he started listening to the rhetoric of what [the party] thinks you are supposed to say,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWhen Ben Carson talks about his opportunity message, that\u2019s when he wins over black Republicans.\u201d\n\nCandy & I had the joy of joining Rev.

Free copies of a newly released book about Carson\u2019s accomplishments and origins have been deliberately distributed to predominantly black churches and community groups and will soon go out to the Latino community, with Spanish translation, Muth added.\n\nCarson\u2019s lack of tact on black issues should make it difficult for him to attract blacks in general, said Michael Tyler, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s director of African-American media. \u201cSadly, Carson\u2019s comments mirror the type of invective that has taken over the entire Republican field running for president,\u201d Tyler recently said via email, echoing the sentiment expressed by Wright, the conservative political commentator. \u201cRegardless of who emerges as their nominee, Republicans are making it clear that they\u2019re not at all interested in fighting for minority communities.\u201d\n\nJackson, the Washington political consultant, said he is hopeful Carson will show he\u2019s not like previous black conservative candidates who fizzle out because they aren\u2019t true to themselves. \u201cEven if he loses, no one will be able to say that he\u2019s not running a credible campaign,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a victory for him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ben carson, ben carson 2016, ben carson gop, ben carson republican, ben carson neurosurgeon, ben carson black, ben carson african american, ben carson polls, ben carson debate, ben carson bio, ben carson history, ben carson slavery abortion comments", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson, the former pediatric neurosurgeon, has courted controversy with his comments about abortion and gay rights, but will will more African-American conservatives warm up to him?", "title": "Ben Carson And Black Republicans: Will More African-American Conservatives Warm Up To The Neurosurgeon-Turned-Presidential Candidate?", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-black-republicans-will-more-african-american-conservatives-warm-2061764", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/08/20/rtx1og7c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson, the former pediatric neurosurgeon, has courted controversy with his comments about abortion and gay rights, but will will more African-American conservatives warm up to him?", "title": "Ben Carson And Black Republicans: Will More African-American Conservatives Warm Up To The Neurosurgeon-Turned-Presidential Candidate?", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-black-republicans-will-more-african-american-conservatives-warm-2061764", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/08/20/rtx1og7c.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/08/20/rtx1og7c.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2015-08-24T11:54:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T00:32:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson, the former pediatric neurosurgeon, has courted controversy with his comments about abortion and gay rights, but will will more African-American conservatives warm up to him?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b31\"", "article_summary": "Especially when addressing socioeconomic issues that disproportionately impact Black America, some black Republicans have suggested.\nCarson\u2019s stance on the role of institutionalized racism in the U.S. has proved divisive among black Republicans.\n\u201cWhen Ben Carson talks about his opportunity message, that\u2019s when he wins over black Republicans.\u201dCandy & I had the joy of joining Rev.\n\u201cI think Ben Carson has taken this campaign seriously.\nCarson\u2019s lack of tact on black issues should make it difficult for him to attract blacks in general, said Michael Tyler, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s director of African-American media."}
