(Mercifully, though, no food-stamp recipients were maligned for buying seafood.) The report\u2019s grand, familiar theory is that the American welfare state has grown too sprawling and complex, and when combined, its overlapping programs discourage the needy from working.\n\n\u201cThere are nearly 100 programs at the federal level that are meant to help, but they have actually created a poverty trap,\u201d Ryan told the Washington Post.\n\nIs it possible that the growth of the safety net under Obamacare could lull us into a lethargic new world?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSome of the academics cited in Ryan\u2019s report have complained that their work was misquoted or ripped out of context. (For instance, it ignores data about the first two years of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s war on poverty, which happened to be its most successful.) But in a very narrow sense, Ryan\u2019s big idea is sort of, kind of correct. Because poor families lose government benefits as they climb up the income ladder, there are some select circumstances where it can stop making sense for them to work harder or longer hours. Earning an extra $1,000 by pulling extra shifts at McDonald\u2019s might not be worth it, for instance, if it means saying goodbye to your Medicaid coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of dilemma that policy types sometimes call a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d or \u201cwelfare trap.\u201d A 2012 report by the Congressional Budget Office, which Ryan cites, found that after taxes and benefit cuts, single parents living just above the poverty line would take home less than 20 cents of each additional dollar they made in wages above their current income, assuming they took full advantage of the programs available to them. At that point, many mothers and fathers might decide they\u2019re better off spending more time parenting than working.\n\n\n\nMarginal Tax Rates for a Hypothetical Single Parent With One Child, by Earnings\n\nCourtesy of the Congressional Budget Office\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s Ryan\u2019s amuse bouche of fact. But he\u2019s using it as the enticement to a large and harmful fiction\u2014that by giving the poor incentives not to work, we\u2019re turning the entire \u201csafety net into a hammock,\u201d as he\u2019s put it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that poverty traps are out there. They just don\u2019t snare that many families. The same CBO report Ryan cites estimates that, after taxes and lost benefits, the median household living around the poverty line still takes home roughly 70 cents of each additional dollar it earns, not unlike many middle-class families. Relatively few people reach a point where it\u2019s no longer worth it to pull extra time on the job.\n\nCourtesy of the Congressional Budget Office\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe hammock theory truly begins to fall apart once you look at the relatively short periods of time the poor actually remain poor. Americans tend to think of poverty as a chronic condition\u2014the financial equivalent of acute and crippling arthritis. But it\u2019s largely more like a broken bone: something many of us suffer and most recuperate from. Mark Rank, a professor of social work at Washington University in St. Louis, and his collaborators have found that between the ages of 25 and 60, almost 40 percent of Americans will spend a year living under the poverty line, but only 11.6 percent spend five years or more of their adult lives impoverished. Likewise, Rank finds that 45 percent take advantage of the safety net at some point, but only 16.4 percent do so for more than five years.\n\nCourtesy of the Atlantic\n\n\n\nSince the 1960s, Rank says, poverty has become a more common experience, thanks to a boom-bust economy and the ubiquity of low-paying jobs that leave many families living at its edge. But typically, poverty is still a short-lived experience. \u201cThe grip of poverty is not as strong as some people think,\u201d Rank told me in a recent interview. If the safety net is a hammock, relatively few are napping in it.\n\nStill, Rank\u2019s data looks backward\u2014what about the future? Is it possible that the growth of the safety net under Obamacare could lull us into a lethargic new world?\n\nOf course, the CBO did recently conclude that health care reform would lead a number of Americans to cut their work hours\u2014but it didn\u2019t specify how many will do so simply because they\u2019ll be able to find affordable insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. It also helps to have some global perspective on this issue, which Paul Krugman offers up in his own post on Ryan\u2019s poverty hokum. As Krugman notes, countries with larger welfare states tend to have more income mobility, not less. If you\u2019re born poor in Sweden or Canada, you\u2019re far more likely to end up middle class than if you\u2019re born in the United States, which cuts against the idea that generous government programs enshrine poverty.*\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Miles Corak\n\n\n\nRyan is right that the government should try to fix the perverse work incentives that the welfare state creates for a fraction of poor families. But his report is meant to lay the intellectual groundwork for an overhaul that would more likely result in the same sorts of draconian cuts contained in his previous budgets, all in the name of aiding the needy.
