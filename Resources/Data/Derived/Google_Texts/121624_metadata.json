Or at least that\u2019s been conventional wisdom since President Obama decided to buck a decade-plus of Democratic Party strategy and make gun safety legislation a major issue once again. But the bill Obama endorsed didn\u2019t pass, and according to the FBI, we\u2019re now seeing more mass shootings than ever.\n\nAnother, more recent setback for the gun-safety movement was a poll from the Pew Research Center released in early December that found support for \u201cprotecting right of Americans to own guns\u201d at an all-time high, besting \u201ccontrolling gun ownership\u201d by 52 to 46 percent. But as Bryan Schatz of Mother Jones recently reported, gun-safety advocates \u2014 not just professional activists, but researchers and academics, too \u2014 believe that the Pew poll\u2019s phrasing is deeply flawed, pitting rights against each other that in reality need not be in conflict.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense In America, about the Pew poll, how the gun-safety movement is like the fight for same-sex marriage, and the recent local and state-level victories by reformers that the media has missed. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWere you surprised by the Pew poll\u2019s results?\n\nNo, they didn\u2019t surprise me, because Pew keeps using this old and poorly crafted poll question \u2014 and it really perpetuates this outdated idea that we have to choose as a country between protecting gun rights and supporting public safety. But that\u2019s a false choice.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to choose between protecting the Second Amendment and measures that have been proven to prevent gun violence. Ultimately, there are responsibilities that go along with gun rights. And measures like background checks, keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, like domestic abusers, all of these save lives. Pew asks you to choose between the two, and you don\u2019t [have to].\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t know where we\u2019re starting on this issue. The Pew question assumes that people understand that there are background check loopholes and that, every year, 40 percent of gun purchases are made without background checks (because you can avoid having to do a background check by buying from a private seller). So if Americans are going into these questions and answering them without that \u2026 context, then the answers are going to be skewed.\n\nIs the belief that it\u2019s an either/or choice something you come up against often when talking with and reaching out to regular people?\n\nThat certainly exists, the idea that it\u2019s an either/or [choice], because the NRA and the gun lobby in general has sort of said, Gun ownership should be completely unfettered! It should not be subjected to the same limits as other Constitutional rights like, for example, freedom of speech. (I can\u2019t go yell fire in a crowded theater, for example.) And there\u2019s this idea that because it\u2019s in the Constitution, there should be absolutely no responsibilities written into law that protect other Americans\u2026\n\nOne of the bits of the Pew poll I thought was interesting was the large increase in support for gun rights from African-American respondents, who viewed guns as useful for self-defense to a degree that wasn\u2019t reflected among other non-white respondents. Do you use different messaging with African-Americans than you do for other communities?\n\nNo, we don\u2019t. At the end of the day, when you look at polls that ask questions in the correct way, you have 90 percent or more of Americans supporting background checks \u2014 and obviously that includes people of all backgrounds and all colors\u2026\n\nWhat we have found is that this issue impacts a broad spectrum of people in different ways. Obviously, it affects the African-American community severely \u2026 But if you look at the latest polls, if you ask Asian-Americans [about gun safety], this is in the top 3 issues for Asian-Americans. And it polls very highly for Hispanic-Americans as well\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "New poll showing support for \"gun rights\" higher than ever misses the big picture, gun-safety activist tells Salon", "title": "The NRA is losing: Moms Demand Action\u2019s Shannon Watts on what the media\u2019s missing on guns", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New poll showing support for \"gun rights\" higher than ever misses the big picture, gun-safety activist tells Salon", "title": "The NRA is losing: Moms Demand Action\u2019s Shannon Watts on what the media\u2019s missing on guns", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/01/the_nra_is_losing_moms_demand_actions_shannon_watts_on_what_the_medias_missing_on_guns/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/wayne_lapierre3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New poll showing support for \"gun rights\" higher than ever misses the big picture, gun-safety activist tells Salon", "title": "The NRA is losing: Moms Demand Action\u2019s Shannon Watts on what the media\u2019s missing on guns", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/wayne_lapierre3.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, elliot rodgers, everytown usa, Gun Control, Gun Lobby, gun rights, gun safety, moms demand action, NRA, Sandy Hook, Second Amendment, shannon watts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c81\"", "article_summary": "Or at least that\u2019s been conventional wisdom since President Obama decided to buck a decade-plus of Democratic Party strategy and make gun safety legislation a major issue once again.\nWere you surprised by the Pew poll\u2019s results?\nUltimately, there are responsibilities that go along with gun rights.\nMost Americans don\u2019t know where we\u2019re starting on this issue.\nTopics: elliot rodgers, everytown usa, Gun Control, Gun Lobby, gun rights, gun safety, moms demand action, NRA, Sandy Hook, Second Amendment, shannon watts, Media News, News, Politics NewsIn the more than two years that have passed since Adam Lanza murdered 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, the politics of guns in America has changed dramatically."}
