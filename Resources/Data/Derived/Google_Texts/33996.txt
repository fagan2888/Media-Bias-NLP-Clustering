Saving the Smallest: Turning the tide on infant mortality

Babies born in Cleveland have a slimmer chance of celebrating their first birthdays than those born in almost any other major U.S. city.

Black babies born here are as likely to survive their first year as babies born in Syria or Jordan. They're more than two times as likely to die as babies born to white mothers.

White infants in our city don't do a lot better, when you compare their odds of survival against kids born in the rest of Ohio, the nation, or other developed countries. They're as likely to survive to a first birthday as kids born in Cyprus or Ukraine.

Infant mortality rates are measured by the number of babies who die before their first birthday, per thousand live births. Cleveland's rate is about 13, one of the worst in the country. Ohio's infant mortality rate is 7.4, ranking us 45th in the nation.

Why do pregnant women and new babies fare poorly in our region and state? Here, we're looking into the complicated causes of infant deaths, and how we can do better. We'll talk about what works, in Cleveland and in other cities that have already tackled the problem. | Read Brie Zeltner's story
