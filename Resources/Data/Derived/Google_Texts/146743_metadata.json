Rhinelander and the Law of the Multiracial Family.\"\n\nPresident Obama should invite Max Kenner, the founder of the Bard Prison Initiative, to join the first lady at the State of the Union. The sharp growth in the prison population over the past two decades \u2014 despite a decrease in crime \u2014 has had a significant impact on growing racial and class inequality, creating, in the eyes of some, \u201cthe new Jim Crow.\u201d\n\nKenner created the initiative at Bard College in 1999, when he was an undergraduate there. It seeks to provide rigorous college-level education to selected inmates, and to break the link between imprisonment and lack of education. (It is no coincidence that a black male high school dropout has almost a 60 percent chance of being imprisoned by his early 30s.)\n\nInviting Max Kenner, the founder of the Bard Prison Initiative, would send a message that educational opportunity extends to the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThe initiative has transformed the lives of its students and alumni and their families. It has affected the culture of the prisons where its students live. It has shaped the faculty members who work for the program. And it has radically improved the opportunities that await its graduates upon their release.\n\nToday, the Bard Prison Initiative is part of a group of small liberal arts colleges that have started similar programs. If President Obama were to invite Kenner to the State of the Union, he would send the message that his commitment to educational opportunity extends to the most vulnerable populations, including those who do not have a voice through their votes.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/24/opinion/skutnickRFD/skutnickRFD-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/24/opinion/skutnickRFD/skutnickRFD-thumbWide.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/who-should-be-invited-to-the-state-of-the-union", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/24/opinion/skutnickRFD/skutnickRFD-thumbWide.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/24/opinion/skutnickRFD/skutnickRFD-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Inviting Max Kenner, the founder of the Bard Prison Initiative, would send a message that educational opportunity extends to the most vulnerable populations.
