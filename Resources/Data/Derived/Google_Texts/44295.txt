Under pressure from Gov. Charlie Baker, four gubernatorial appointees on the Health Connector Board resigned today -- including Jonathan Gruber.

George Gonser, Jr., John M. Bertko, Gruber and Rick Jakious all resigned from the board today, according to the Governor's Office.

All four members were appointed by former Gov. Deval Patrick. The resignations give Baker control of the 11-member board, which also includes two Baker administration bosses. Board chairwoman Marylou Sudders is Baker's secretary of health and human services and board member Kristen Lepore is the secretary of administration and finance.

Gruber, an MIT economics professor, was videotaped saying the “stupidity of the American voter” was key to getting the Obamacare reform passed. His comments sparked outrage and a congressional hearing.

In the video from an October 2013 conference that went viral on the Internet shows Gruber admitting Obamacare was “written in a tortured way” so the feds wouldn't classify the mandate as taxes, which likely would have killed its political chances.

“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” Gruber said in the video. “Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass. I wish ... we could make it all transparent. But I'd rather have this law than not.”

He apologized for the comments during an appearance on MSNBC, yet declined to comment to the Herald. Gruber could also not be reached today for comment.
