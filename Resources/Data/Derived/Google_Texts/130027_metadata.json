We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\"\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the phrase \"I LOVE THE POORLY EDUCATED\" was trending heavily. On Twitter, it was tweeted roughly 15 times a minute, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.\n\n\"I am, by modern standards, poorly educated, and I think that Donald Trump is a threat to America,\" tweeted Aaron Camp (@AaronApolloCamp).\n\nAnother Twitter user, Kat (@VTweddingPhoto), wrote, \"This is an embarrassment. For the GOP and for us as Americans. The world is once again laughing.\"\n\nOthers said Trump's remark was being taken out of context, as he also touted having won the support of \"the highly educated.\"\n\n\"To be fair with Trump, he said 'I love the highly educated and the poorly educated'. Don't take it out of context,\" tweeted Super Bowl Champs (@Josh_D_Manning).\n\nDan Slott (@DanSlott) was not swayed. \"We won the poorly educated vote. I love the poorly educated\" - Trump Not a joke. Not parody. Not out of context. Trump ACTUALLY said this.\"\n\nTrump has won three of the four state-by-state Republican nominating contests, including Nevada, in the run-up to the party nominating convention in July and the Nov. 8 general election to succeed President Barack Obama.\n\n(Reporting by Melissa Fares; Editing by Dan Burns and Howard Goller)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Trump loves 'the poorly educated' ... and social media clamors", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/24/Trump-loves-poorly-educated-and-social-media-clamors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/24/Trump-loves-poorly-educated-and-social-media-clamors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "(Reuters) - U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"To be fair with Trump, he said 'I love the highly educated and the poorly educated'.\nI love the poorly educated\" - Trump Not a joke.\n\"We won the poorly educated vote.\n\"I am, by modern standards, poorly educated, and I think that Donald Trump is a threat to America,\" tweeted Aaron Camp (@AaronApolloCamp).\nWe won with poorly educated."}
