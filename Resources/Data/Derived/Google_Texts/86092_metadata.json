The shares jumped.\n\n\u201cSome of the Gulf airlines have expressed an interest in SpiceJet as we have come back into the market, but this is not the right time to be diluting the equity,\u201d Chairman Ajay Singh said in Dubai Sunday, without naming the companies. \u201cThere is some dialogue which is ongoing and we continue to explore other types of relationships we could have,\u201d he said, adding now isn\u2019t the right time to sell a stake as the shares remain undervalued.\n\nGulf carriers including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar Airways Ltd. have acquired stakes in airlines to quickly expand their networks. Etihad has stakes in eight companies, while Qatar Airways Ltd. said earlier this month that it was interested in boosting its 10 percent holding in British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA and taking up to 49 percent of Indian budget carrier IndiGo.\n\nSpiceJet jumped as much as 5 percent to 68.80 rupees and was trading at 67.75 rupees as of 10:18 a.m. in Mumbai.\n\nSpiceJet is planning to order new planes after co-founder Singh rescued the company from the verge of shutdown last year. After reporting a profit for the past three quarters, the airline is planning to finalize an order for over 150 single-aisle jets from either Boeing Co. or Airbus Group SE during the current financial year, which ends March 31, Singh said. The company is also planning an additional order of up to 50 regional jets and is in talks with suppliers including Bombardier Inc., he said.\n\n\u201cSpicejet is generating enough cash internally to sustain those orders,\u201d said Singh. \u201cIf we need to raise any money to fund those orders, which looks unlikely at this time, there are enough unutilised credit lines available to us.\u201d\n\nNew aircraft would be used to open new routes and increase the frequency of flights to existing destinations, he said. SpiceJet currently has 25 Boeing 737 jets, two Airbus planes, and 14 Bombardier aircraft and flies to 40 destinations, including the Maldives, Dubai and Sri Lanka and 34 domestic locations.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matthew Martin", "twitter": {"description": "Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd., which has surged more than 280 percent this year, said it\u2019s received interest from Gulf airlines looking to acquire a stake.
