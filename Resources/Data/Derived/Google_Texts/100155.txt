Sean Hannity will interview Donald Trump for a full hour in Las Vegas Monday night.

On the eve of the Nevada GOP caucuses, Trump will assess his chances for the nomination and his position as top dog after a major victory in South Carolina, according to FoxNews.com.

The front-runner made the rounds on Sundayâ€™s talk shows after a rough week of negative press over statements on the Obamacare mandate, the Bush war in Iraq and Planned Parenthood.

If you are not Trumped-out, you can catch the interview on Fox News Channel at 10 PM ET.
