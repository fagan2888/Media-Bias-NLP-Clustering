The goal was to create one website where people could get coverage, whether they qualified for tax credits, Medicaid or Minnesota Care.\n\n\u201cThe downside of going to healthcare.gov \u2026 is that it is much more challenging to try to integrate that with the unique state systems,\u201d Corlette said.\n\nIn 2013, Minnesota was one of more than a dozen states to launch its own health \u00adinsurance exchange as part of the federal Affordable Care Act. Exchanges are marketplaces where individuals can purchase policies from commercial health insurance \u00adcompanies.\n\nThe federal health law clearly allows for people buying through state-based exchanges to obtain federal tax credits that significantly discount premium costs.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 vote, rejected arguments saying those subsidies aren\u2019t available to people buying through healthcare.gov.\n\nRepublicans said the ruling could prompt Minnesota to switch to a \u201cfederally supported state-based marketplace,\u201d where the state would be responsible for performing all exchange functions except providing the information technology system. Consumers would apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov.\n\nAnother option, Republicans said, is a state partnership model, where Minnesota would continue to provide in-person assistance to \u00adconsumers while handing off all other tasks to the federal government.\n\nRep. Tara Mack, R-Apple Valley, said the issue should be considered by a new state task force on health care finance that\u2019s scheduled to generate recommendations by early next year on improving health care access and quality in \u00adMinnesota.\n\n\u201cI think we need to take a serious look at partnering, and going toward the federal exchange, in areas where it\u2019s just working better \u2026 than it is on MNsure,\u201d Mack said.\n\nIT problems from the get-go\n\nMinnesota received about $155 million in federal grants to launch MNsure, but the exchange suffered from a balky website and overwhelmed call center in the months following its launch in October 2013. There were significantly fewer problems during a second open enrollment period that started in November 2014, as MNsure added staff and improved its technology.\n\nMNsure received $34 million more in federal grant money late last year, in part to fund ongoing fixes to the IT system. It continues to cause trouble for state and county workers who use MNsure for people enrolled in Medicaid and MinnesotaCare insurance.\n\nThe grant triggered Medicaid spending that takes the MNsure tab to more than $250 million, Republicans say.\n\nThe technology problems thus far at MNsure, plus the expense of trying to fix them, bolster arguments for exploring whether healthcare.gov is a viable option, said Peter \u00adNelson, public policy director at the Center of the American Experiment, a conservative group in Golden Valley.\n\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions about how it would work, Nelson acknowledged, saying: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a learning process.\u201d\n\nLast week, MNsure supporters were busy raising a lot of those questions.\n\nJoe Campbell, a MNsure spokesman, argued that by giving up the exchange, Minnesota would lose the right to seek waivers under the federal health law that could allow for future innovations. Republicans and Democrats have put forward ideas for improvements under these waivers.\n\nBrian Beutner, the former chairman of the MNsure board, said that the idea of moving to the federal exchange is a \u201cgreat sound bite\u201d that masks a more complicated reality.\n\nAll health exchanges in the country let consumers purchase commercial insurance policies, but MNsure also was built to replace the antiquated information technology system used in the state\u2019s \u00adMedicaid and MinnesotaCare public insurance programs.\n\nMany ongoing IT fixes at MNsure are focused on the \u201cback end\u201d system for these public programs, Beutner said.\n\n\u201cWhen you try to unscramble all that, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is -- purely speculative -- that you\u2019d be spending a lot of state money now to improve that back-end, rather than federal money.\u201d\n\nMinnesota could move to the federal exchange for people buying commercial policies, said Thompson Aderinkomi, a former MNsure board member. But he added: \u201cWe would still need MNsure to do Medicaid eligibility.\u201d\n\nMack said she agrees that the IT system for public programs must be fixed, and she has questions about how they would connect with the healthcare.gov system. But she said other states that have switched to the federal exchange apparently are building off the \u00adfederal system for their public programs.\n\nWaivers could be a better way to improve the system, Mack said, but it\u2019s not clear which ones would be granted by the federal government.\n\nThe \u201cone-stop shop\u201d idea behind MNsure is a great concept, Mack said, but the exchange\u2019s track record so far suggests that it\u2019s too ambitious. \u201cThe reality,\u201d she said, \u201cis that we are so far from it being what it was supposed to be.\u201d\n\n\u00a92015 the Star Tribune (Minneapolis), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Republicans have renewed their calls to drop MNsure in favor of the federal government\u2019s online marketplace for health \u00adinsurance, while MNsure supporters say the switch could be costly and a bad fit with Minnesota\u2019s large public health insurance programs.", "pubDate": "2015-06-29", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/MNSURE.jpg", "title": "Minnesota Wrestles with Dumping MNsure HIX Website"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/state", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "State", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(TNS) \u2014 Changing Minnesota\u2019s approach to health insurance wouldn\u2019t be simple after years of work to establish the MNsure exchange.\nMNsure supporters countered the switch could be costly, and a bad fit with Minnesota\u2019s large public health insurance programs.\nThe federal health law clearly allows for people buying through state-based exchanges to obtain federal tax credits that significantly discount premium costs.\nBut she said other states that have switched to the federal exchange apparently are building off the \u00adfederal system for their public programs.\nExchanges are marketplaces where individuals can purchase policies from commercial health insurance \u00adcompanies."}
