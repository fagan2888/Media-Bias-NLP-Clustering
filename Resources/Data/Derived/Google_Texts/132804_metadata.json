Though Michael Carvin, the lead lawyer challenging the law, attempted to extract himself from this roadblock, he quickly ran into an entirely different obstacle \u2014 his own past writings.\n\nCarvin claims, in a case called King v. Burwell, that Obamacare should be read to deny tax credits that enable millions of Americans to afford health insurance in states that elected not to set up their own health exchange (under the Affordable Care Act, states have \u201cflexibility\u201d to decide whether to set up their own exchange or to allow the federal government to do so). During oral arguments on Wednesday, however, several justices raised concerns about the catastrophic damage Carvin\u2019s reading of the law could inflict on those states\u2019 insurance markets.\n\nIf the tax credits disappear, millions of people\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for their insurance will more than triple, leaving many healthy individuals unable to afford to remain insured. Yet, as healthy consumers drop out of the health insurance markets, the insurers will lose revenues they need to cover the costs of their sick consumers, forcing them to raise premiums even more. The result is a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d where higher premiums beget fewer customers, which beget higher premiums.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Justice Kennedy said that this risk of a death spiral raised a \u201cserious constitutional problem\u201d for Carvin. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s first Obamacare decision, Congress may not coerce states into acting against their will, and Kennedy was concerned forcing states to choose between setting up an exchange or having their individual insurance markets collapse amounted to unconstitutional coercion. Given two different ways of reading a law, Kennedy indicated that he may be obligated to choose the one that doesn\u2019t raise this constitutional concern.\n\nCarvin tried to downplay the risk that consumers would simply stop buying plans in the law\u2019s health exchanges if the tax credits were cut off, claiming that these consumers would still be attracted to exchange plans by the fact that the exchanges offer \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d for people looking to buy insurance. He also claimed that Congress wasn\u2019t worried about the risk of death spirals if the tax credits get cut off. According to Carvin, \u201cthere\u2019s not a scintilla of legislative history suggesting that without subsidies, there will be a death spiral.\u201d\n\nBut Carvin himself sang a very different tune three years ago. Indeed, Wednesday was not the first time he\u2019s stood in the well of the Supreme Courtroom and asked the justices to gut the Affordable Care Act. Carvin was also one of the lead attorneys in NFIB v. Sebelius, the first Supreme Court case attacking the law.\n\nIn a brief filed in NFIB, Carvin explained that \u201c[w]ithout the subsidies driving demand within the exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no reason to offer their products through exchanges, where they are subject to far greater restrictions.\u201d And, contrary to his more recent suggestion that Congress never envisioned any danger if the tax credits are cut off, Carvin wrote in 2012 that \u201cthe insurance exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent those provisions.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent brief, Carvin elaborated that \u201cthe federal subsidies are the incentive to participate in the exchanges, and without those subsidies, there will be no mechanism to sustain the exchanges.\u201d He also seemed to contradict his central claim that different states are treated differently depending on whether their exchange is operated by a state or the federal government. The Affordable Care Act, according to the Michael Carvin of 2012, \u201cenables uniform and acceptable federal premium subsidies\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nCarvin\u2019s inconsistencies did not go unnoticed by the justices. After Carvin denied the importance of the tax credits, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that he said otherwise \u201cin the prior case.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts, in an exchange that was more comic than pointed, asked Carvin whether he\u2019d won that previous case. After the audience\u2019s laughter died down \u2014 much of the room knew that Carvin did not \u2014 Roberts quipped \u201c[s]o maybe it makes sense that you have a different story today?\u201d\n\nRoberts was probably willing to excuse Carvin\u2019s inconsistencies because Carvin is an advocate, and in that role he makes arguments that serve his client\u2019s interest even if those arguments may contradict the views of a previous client. But Carvin is far from alone in his willingness to change his story in order to advance whatever may be the current legal argument against Obamacare.\n\nAfter Carvin argued in 2012 that the tax credits are essential to making the Affordable Care Act work, four of the Court\u2019s conservative members believed him. A dissenting opinion signed by Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito embraced Carvin\u2019s 2012 argument:\n\nIn the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges. Under the ACA\u2019s scheme, few, if any, individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the exchanges\u2019 onerous regulations. That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\n\nJustice Kennedy, to his credit, appears to be willing to accept the implications of the opinion he signed in 2012 for this latest challenge to Obamacare, even though those implications could lead him to uphold the tax credits in King. Kennedy understood that tax credits were essential to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s framework in 2012 and he appears to understand that removing them would trigger a death spiral in 2015.\n\nJustices Scalia and Alito, by contrast, spent much of the oral argument on Wednesday trying to rip apart Solicitor General Donald Verrilli\u2019s arguments in defense of the tax credits. Like Carvin, they said one thing in 2012 when it was useful to opponents of the Affordable Care Act, but they are now willing to claim that the Affordable Care Act should be read to ensure that many of its exchanges will \u201cnot operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\u201d\n\nCarvin, as Roberts alluded to, is an advocate who is paid to advance the views of his client. Scalia and Alito do not have the same excuse.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Oops.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Oops.", "title": "The Lawyer Telling The Supreme Court To Gut Obamacare Explained Why He Should Lose In 2012", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/03/05/3630173/lawyer-telling-supreme-court-gut-obamacare-explained-lose-2012/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oops.", "title": "The Lawyer Telling The Supreme Court To Gut Obamacare Explained Why He Should Lose In 2012", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@imillhiser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-05T16:06:26+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0f1\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, Wednesday was not the first time he\u2019s stood in the well of the Supreme Courtroom and asked the justices to gut the Affordable Care Act.\nHe also claimed that Congress wasn\u2019t worried about the risk of death spirals if the tax credits get cut off.\nJustice The Lawyer Telling The Supreme Court To Gut Obamacare Explained Why He Should Lose In 2012 CREDIT: AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Attorney Michael CarvinOn Wednesday, a lawsuit seeking to defund much of the Affordable Care Act appeared to hit a roadblock when Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concerns that the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law is unconstitutional.\nThat system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated.\nJustices Scalia and Alito, by contrast, spent much of the oral argument on Wednesday trying to rip apart Solicitor General Donald Verrilli\u2019s arguments in defense of the tax credits."}
