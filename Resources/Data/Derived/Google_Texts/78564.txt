The Avalanche will make its first step back toward normalcy in net Tuesday night when backup goaltender Reto Berra starts for Colorado against the Florida Panthers at the Pepsi Center.

The Avs, though, have a ways to go to improve their defense.

“We’re definitely going to be more urgent tonight. We need to play with some desperation,” Avs defenseman Tyson Barrie said at the team’s morning skate.

“I think this is huge.”

“Huge” games don’t normally crop up in the second week of the season. But the Avalanche, at 1-4-1 after a four-game road trip, is on the brink between struggling and falling into a deep hole.

But the Avs — who face a fellow one-win team in the Panthers — play seven of their next nine games in Denver.

Step 1 in reversing their early-season slide is limiting the number of opponent shots. The Avs are allowing 35.7 shots per game, the third-worst mark in the NHL.

“It’s tough,” Barrie said. “There aren’t many teams who come out with winning records when they’re getting outshot by crazy amounts or when the possession is lopsided.”

The Avs will put Berra back in net for the first time since he injured his neck early in a game last week at Ottawa.

No. 1 goaltender Semyon Varlamov will come off the Avs’ injured reserve list Wednesday, coach Patrick Roy said, and will start in net Friday against Vancouver.

“We want to make sure we skate well on our forecheck (defensively) and get some pucks back to generate some offense,” Roy said.
