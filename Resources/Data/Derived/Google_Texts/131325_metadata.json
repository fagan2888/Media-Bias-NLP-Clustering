The question came from Jose Antonio Vargas, a filmmaker and journalist whose organization, Define America, has led the charge to remove the term \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d from presidential campaigns.\n\nMr. Vargas asked Mrs. Clinton if she would stop using the term.\n\n\u201cYes, I will,\u201d Mrs. Clinton responded while logged in to Facebook during a stop in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cThat was a poor choice of words. As I\u2019ve said throughout this campaign, the people at the heart of this issue are children, parents, families, Dreamers. They have names, and hopes and dreams that deserve to be respected.\u201d\n\nDreamers refers to illegal immigrants who were brought into the country as children and grew up in the United States. Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, these illegal immigrants are eligible for a renewable two-year work permit and exempt from deportation.\n\nMrs. Clinton uttered the descriptor for people who enter the U.S. illegally during a town hall meeting in New Hampshire.\n\nDefending her record on border security, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state said that she voted numerous times \u201cto spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.\u201d\n\nThe support for the fence is galling enough to immigrant-rights advocates, but her use of the term \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d landed her in more hot water.\n\nThe Dream Action Coalition, a group advocating an end to deportations, said at the time that it sounded like Mrs. Clinton was having an \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is Hillary\u2019s casual use of the word \u2018illegal\u2019 offensive and dismissive, it shows us that she is out-of-touch with the community she claims to be advocating for by reducing them to a derogatory term,\u201d said Hina Naveed, co-director of Dream Action Coalition. \u201cThere is no room to uplift a community when the conversation begins by taking away their identity.\u201d\n\nTwo founders of Dream Action Coalition, who are no longer with the group, have taken jobs with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top competitor for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernard Sanders.\n\nIn her campaign for the White House, Mrs. Clinton has promised to fulfill a wish list of activists who want an end to deportations and citizenship for illegal immigrations.\n\nShe has proposed expanding President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, implement reforms to immigration laws and open a pathway to citizenship for most illegal immigrants.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s apology coincided with Mr. Sanders releasing his immigration agenda. He described it as a platform for creating a \u201chumane\u201d immigration system.\n\nHe promised that within his first 100 days as president that he would expand Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions. The executive actions, however, have been halted by courts while the legitimacy of the actions are litigated.\n\nMr. Sanders, a Vermont independent and avowed socialist, said that he would allow all undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years to stay without threat of deportation. He said that would cover nearly 9 million illegal immigrants.\n\nFurthermore, he would pursue a complete overhaul of immigration laws and open a path to citizenship for current illegal immigrants.\n\nThe anti-deportation group #Not1More called Mr. Sanders\u2019 plan \u201cthe most sweeping proposal for humane policy we\u2019ve seen to date.\u201d\n\nThe gushing praise for Mr. Sanders\u2019 plan underscored the tentative relationship Hispanic activists have with Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe platform sets a floor for Democratic candidates in the debate to address the historic suffering that immigrants have faced in this country,\u201d said Marisa Franco, director of #Not1More.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton bowed to pressure from Hispanic activists Tuesday and apologized for using the term \"illegal immigrants\" at a town hall earlier this month.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton bowed to pressure from Hispanic activists Tuesday and apologized for using the term \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d at a town hall earlier this month.", "title": "Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/24/hillary-clinton-apologizes-for-saying-illegal-immi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/24/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/24/HillaryClinton.jpg", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton bowed to pressure from Hispanic activists Tuesday and apologized for using the term \"illegal immigrants\" at a town hall earlier this month.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019"}, "Author": "S.A.
