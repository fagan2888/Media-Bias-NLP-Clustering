Liberal journalists seem the most enamored of all. For the past two years, they\u2019ve produced a steady stream of gushing tributes to Francis, praising him as \u201cvisionary,\u201d a \u201cflaming liberal\u201d and even \u201cradical.\u201d Just last week, Naomi Klein wrote a glowing encomium to Francis for his encyclical on climate change\u2013without once mentioning that one of the most powerful tools for reducing our carbon footprint is birth control, which Francis opposes. Also the last week, the New Republic\u2019s Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig penned yet another valentine to the man, this time praising \u201cFrancis\u2019s feminism.\u201d\n\nWait\u2014what? Pope Francis, feminist? In what sense is Francis\u2014a man who presides over one of the most deeply patriarchal institutions in human history, which bans women from positions of authority and restricts them to subservient roles; who preaches a doctrine of \u201cseparate spheres\u201d for women that reads like a musty Victorian-era relic; and whose unwavering support of Catholic doctrine on abortion and birth control is responsible for the death and suffering of countless women across the globe\u2014a feminist? To label Francis a \u201cfeminist\u201d is downright Orwellian. It twists the meaning of the word beyond all recognition.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty wrong with the piece, including its hilariously awkward subhead: \u201cHe\u2019s no Amy Schumer, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d (Ah, if only he were!) Let\u2019s start with a subject that Bruenig, who identifies as a feminist and a woman of the left, should care about: poor women. Bruenig misleadingly claims that the ideas about family planning Francis expresses in his climate change encyclical are consistent with feminism. Yet neither that nor any other Vatican document supports key feminist goals such as a woman-centered, rights-based approach to contraception. Bruenig also recycles the Catholic canard that making birth control freely available to those who want it is a form of oppressive \u201cpopulation control.\u201d\n\nBut as the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported, an estimated 225 million women in developing countries would like to prevent pregnancy but are not using birth control, for reasons that include lack of access and religious prohibitions against contraceptive use. WHO and other organizations have found that in developing countries, lack of contraceptive access is associated with significantly elevated rates of AIDS/HIV, as well as some 290,000 pregnancy-related deaths each year. Bruenig\u2019s data-free piece does not engage with this tragic reality.\n\nBruenig also lauds Francis for his statements condemning capitalism and global poverty and championing economic justice. I agree that Francis\u2019 comments on these subjects have been moving and powerful, and may even end up doing real good. Yet Bruenig seems unaware that one of the keys to reducing global poverty and promoting economic development is strengthening women\u2019s agency\u2014including their reproductive agency.\n\nA vast literature exists on this subject, including work by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Expanded reproductive freedom for women is associated with significantly reduced poverty, in part because it enables women to pursue education and paid employment. Additionally, children from smaller families stay in school longer. As Adele Stan wrote, if Francis \u201creally wanted to help the poor, he\u2019d be a feminist.\u201d Claiming you want to end poverty but failing to support reproductive rights makes about as much sense as claiming you support low-income workers while opposing the minimum wage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Argentinian pontiff has earned plaudits from the left.
