Beijing PE Firm Gobbles Up U.S. Beef Company Ruprecht

Hosen Capital is one of several Chinese companies looking for food distribution deals

Chinese private equity firm Hosen Capital has acquired beef processor Ruprecht Co. for an undisclosed price.

The Mundelein, Illinois-based target is a proteins producer for the retail, food service and private label industries. Founded in 1860, it serves restaurants, local and national chains, as well as distributors and retail supermarkets.

Hosen facilitated the transaction through its New Hope Investment Fund, a major shareholder of Kilcoy Pastoral Co., a beef supplier for international customers based in Kilcoy, Australia.

The move comes as China-based buyers benefit from the strength of its currency, which makes acquisitions abroad relatively cheaper in Chinese terms. This is especially evident in the food sector, following 2013's $4.72 billion of Smithfield Foods Inc. to Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., Chinas biggest pork producer.

Currently, Bright Food Group Co. the dairy and consumer-products group backed by the Shanghai government  is in the final stages of closing a deal for Israels Tnuva Food Industries Ltd., ending a process that began in late 2013.

Deloitte Corporate Finance ran the sale process for Ruprecht.
