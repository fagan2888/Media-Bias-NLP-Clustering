A top public health official says there's been no local transmission of the Zika virus in the United States, so any talk about women in the country delaying pregnancy "is not even an issue for discussion at this point."

Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health also says it's "very likely" the U.S. could see "local transmitted cases as we get into the robust mosquito season" this summer.

He says if there's a "local outbreak," it's up to health officials to work to contain it.

For now, he says, women in the U.S. who are getting pregnant "should not be worried about anything regarding pregnancy" -- but steer clear of countries where there are outbreaks.

Fauci appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation" and "Fox News Sunday.
