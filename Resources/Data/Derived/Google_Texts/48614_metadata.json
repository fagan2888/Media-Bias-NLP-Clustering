Against the Cowboys in Dallas in 2013. The 37-year-old Manning faked a handoff to Knowshon Moreno then curled around to the left as the scrum collapsed on Moreno. Without a defender in sight, Manning trotted into the end zone leaving millions watching in disbelief.\n\nWare included. He was still with the Cowboys at the time and remembers it vividly. While reflecting on his two years with Manning in Denver and congratulating the quarterback on his Hall of Fame career, Ware looked back to that 2013 play.\n\n\u201cYou always hear about Peyton Manning and how he controls the game, uplifts other players to his standards, and I was fortunate to see it as a teammate and opponent,\u201d Ware said. \u201cHe was one of those guys who was a great competitor who took chances. When I played against him in Dallas (2013 game), I had the bootleg responsibility and I never thought he would do it. The weird thing is, he looked at me before with this image of, \u2018I got you.\u2019\n\n\u201cBeing his teammate, I saw how he carried himself, how meticulous he was, how much of a competitor and how great he was off the field. He was one of those guys that if you had an event, a dinner, he was always engaged in every guy\u2019s life. He knew what the trash man\u2019s name was, the trainers, the cafeteria workers\u2014all by name. He always thought about everyone else. When you think of the word \u2018champion,\u2019 he\u2019s the image that you see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "While congratulating Peyton Manning on his Hall of Fame career, DeMarcus Ware reflected on Manning's memorable naked bootleg at Dallas in 2013.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware still vividly remembers The Peyton Manning bootleg", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2016/03/06/38705/38705/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2016/03/183460182-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "While congratulating Peyton Manning on his Hall of Fame career, DeMarcus Ware reflected on Manning's memorable naked bootleg at Dallas in 2013.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware still vividly remembers The Peyton Manning bootleg", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2016/03/06/38705/38705/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2016/03/183460182-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DeMarcus Ware may never forget The Peyton Manning Naked Bootleg, even if he tried.\nWhile reflecting on his two years with Manning in Denver and congratulating the quarterback on his Hall of Fame career, Ware looked back to that 2013 play.\n\u201cYou always hear about Peyton Manning and how he controls the game, uplifts other players to his standards, and I was fortunate to see it as a teammate and opponent,\u201d Ware said.\nThe 37-year-old Manning faked a handoff to Knowshon Moreno then curled around to the left as the scrum collapsed on Moreno.\nWhen I played against him in Dallas (2013 game), I had the bootleg responsibility and I never thought he would do it."}
