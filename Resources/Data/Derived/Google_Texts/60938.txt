Midwest Collaborative Aims to Shrink Costs, Boost Care

Independent providers have not historically worked together to solve their challenges, but six Ohio-based health systems are joining forces to share resources, lower costs, and reduce variations in care—all while continuing to operate as independent systems.

As healthcare provider organizations look for more effective ways to contain costs and improve quality, some are finding strength in numbers.

Six Ohio-based health systems are joining forces to form the Midwest Health Collaborative to exchange best practices, share resources, lower costs, develop population health innovations, and reduce variations in care—all while continuing to operate as independent systems.

Comprised of Aultman, Cleveland Clinic, OhioHealth, Premier Health, ProMedica, and TriHealth, the collaborative consists of 40 hospitals and hundreds of care sites throughout the state.

"There is a lot of mutual respect among the systems, and we don't believe we have to have a merger model to take advantage of best practices and everything each system is doing separately. We are all committed to remaining independent but focusing on a bigger vision," says Karen Strauss, chief marketing, strategic planning, and communications officer for ProMedica, a Toledo-based system with 2,268 licensed beds and fiscal year 2014 budgeted revenue of $2.6 billion.

Learning from Each Other

Independent hospitals and health systems have not historically worked together to solve their challenges, but that is beginning to change in the face of health reform, says ProMedica's president and chief executive officer Randy Oostra.

"One of the things that has happened since the [Patient Protection and] Affordable Care Act and that concerns everyone in healthcare is there is this need to be more efficient and more effective. Some of the cost pressures that everybody is facing have created a lot more dialogue in the healthcare community," he says.
