Roosevelt \u2014 the philosophy was that private developers had no interest in constructing quality housing for people with low incomes.\n\nBy the time of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration in the 1960s, the idea of subsidizing rent with vouchers became a more popular concept.\n\nHoward Husock, in a 2009 article written for the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that vouchers would lead to an end of \u201cconcentrated poverty.\u201d\n\nHusock said federal housing efforts through the years had actually served to undermine neighborhoods. \u201c(T)hey encourage dependency, and they do not create incentives for long-term maintenance and improvements,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe 1998 Faircloth Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 basically stipulated that HUD couldn\u2019t fund construction or operating assistance for any new public housing units that would result in an increase in the number of units in operation as of Oct. 1, 1999.\n\nHUD money drying up\n\nThe Northwest Georgia Housing Authority, which oversees public housing in Rome and Rockmart, is seeking to become what amounts to a private developer of housing for people with low to moderate incomes.\n\nSome of that is out of necessity.\n\nLee Hight, chairwoman of the NWGHA, said HUD does allocate money to replace demolished housing such as\n\nHight Homes, Fairgrounds and Altoview Terrace \u2014 but offers little for repairs and maintenance.\n\n\u201cThey are not giving anybody money like they used to,\u201d Hight said. \u201cWhen you start fixing something it actually costs you more than to start over.\u201d\n\nIn fact, HUD estimates that the need for repairs nationally is roughly 10 to 15 times the amount of money available. And there is no money for the construction of additional new housing.\n\nLocally, the need for new development is evidenced by a couple of waiting lists maintained by the Housing Authority.\n\nOne list is for space in public housing \u2014 the high-rise apartments of North Fifth Avenue, for example. Another wait list exists for Section 8 vouchers, which subsidize rent payments to private landlords.\n\nNWGHA Executive Director Sandra Hudson said that, in the last several years, her office has been receiving more applications for housing help than ever before. The wait lists for public housing and Section 8 vouchers now have close to 3,000 names.\n\n\u201cPeople are calling me every day saying, \u2018Ms. Hudson what can I do? I\u2019m homeless, where can I go?,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMore than a year ago, the Housing Authority partnered with the owners of the Ashland Park Apartments, which overlook the intersection of Veterans Memorial Highway and Ga. 53 in North Rome.\n\nThe partnership with Vantage Development is allowing the Authority to get some tax-credit housing management experience, which is something that HUD and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs require before the agency can become a developer.\n\nThe two groups are working on what\u2019s known as a Rental Assistance Demonstration project that will involve the complete overhaul of more than 90 duplex homes in the Willing ham Village neighborhood off Division Street in West Rome.\n\nHight said some housing authorities have not had the best experience with the RAD program because private developers come in, get their tax credits, make money and then pull out.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we\u2019ve found a group that we\u2019re happy with,\u201d she said.\n\nLong-range vision\n\nHight said if the Housing Authority gets the necessary tax-credit experience, the Authority could become its own developer.\n\n\u201cThat way we make our own money, do everything ourselves, under our own umbrella,\u201d Hight said.\n\nBy getting involved in tax-credit development, Hudson said, the Housing Authority would be eligible to receive development fees that would be used to bolster its other programs.\n\n\u201cThat would allow the money to continue to purchase single-family homes to rent out as affordable housing for people across the community,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nCreating a revenue stream as a developer is significant because the NWGHA is extremely proud of the new housing stock that has been created in recent years.\n\nTwo side-by-side developments along Division Street \u2014 the environmentally efficient 10-unit Village Green complex and the 27-unit Willingham at Division apartments \u2014 don\u2019t fit the traditional image of public housing.\n\n\u201cLow-income folks need adequate, decent housing in Rome,\u201d Hight said.\n\nShe said the NWGHA is trying to be a good steward of the money it gets from the federal and state governments while at the same time doing right by the citizens of Rome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight,\u201d Hight said.\n\nThe NWGHA board of directors did have some difficult initial negotiations with Vantage related to the quality specifications for the Willingham Village project.\n\n\u201cIf you put up something cheap, you end up with something cheap, and you wind up replacing and replacing,\u201d Hight said.\n\nShe said when tenants have quality housing they tend to care more about maintaining it.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had to replace anything in our new units,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because someone has low income doesn\u2019t mean they should not have something that\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nHight makes it very clear that the authority is not trying to put itself in a position where it is trying to compete with other private housing developers.\n\n\u201cThis is strictly public housing,\u201d she said.\n\nHusock argued in his 2009 paper that it\u2019s wrong to think it\u2019s important to provide better housing to all who claim need. It is \u201cthe effort to achieve the better home, not the home itself, that is the real engine of social improvement,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHight said that is not what the housing authority is doing by constructing nicer homes for those with low incomes. The tenants there, she said, are putting forth efforts to achieve.\n\n\u201cPeople who are living out in those units on Division Street are paying $500 to $600 a month for rent. They are going to school, to jobs and are trying to better themselves,\u201d Hight said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "The face of public housing has changed dramatically in Rome over the last decade.", "title": "Northwest Georgia Housing Authority changes with the times", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/business/northwest-georgia-housing-authority-changes-with-the-times/article_b25f46da-1f4f-11e4-b6b7-0017a43b2370.html", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/12/e1266502-1f4f-11e4-9b6b-0017a43b2370/53e5573d9912d.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C562", "height": 562}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "The face of public housing has changed dramatically in Rome over the last decade.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "business", "news_keywords": "business"}, "article_summary": "Long-range visionHight said if the Housing Authority gets the necessary tax-credit experience, the Authority could become its own developer.\nHUD money drying upThe Northwest Georgia Housing Authority, which oversees public housing in Rome and Rockmart, is seeking to become what amounts to a private developer of housing for people with low to moderate incomes.\nLocally, the need for new development is evidenced by a couple of waiting lists maintained by the Housing Authority.\nHight said that is not what the housing authority is doing by constructing nicer homes for those with low incomes.\nOne list is for space in public housing \u2014 the high-rise apartments of North Fifth Avenue, for example."}
