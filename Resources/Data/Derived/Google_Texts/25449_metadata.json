The cases\u2014Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius\u2014along with others that rely on claims of religious liberty to avoid following the law, are a crucial element of a widening debate that has far-reaching implications about religious liberty, fairness, and equality.\n\nThe states, in particular, have become a focus of policy battles involving progressive initiatives and religious liberty in recent years. Recent victories on marriage equality, for instance, have triggered a conservative backlash that is using religious liberty as a cover to push back against these victories and turn back the clock. The truth is that religious liberty is not in conflict with marriage equality or with women\u2019s reproductive rights. But opponents are claiming a conflict in an attempt to gain public sympathy and support for what would otherwise be unpopular positions.\n\nReligious liberty is a core American value. Furthermore, the vast majority of Americans know that this core value is not hanging by a thread, despite conservative claims. Americans recognize the need to negotiate concerns about religious liberty in a pluralistic democracy where there are many different beliefs with sometimes competing claims in order to ensure fairness and equality for all Americans. Moreover, a majority of the public believes that our existing laws strike the right balance and that there is no need for new laws or overly broad loopholes and exemptions that could result in discrimination and undermine a wide variety of laws and regulations wholly unrelated to the exercise of religion.\n\nThis issue brief focuses on the recent history of the religious liberty debate, the current state of play in states across the country, and the threat to progressive values and accomplishments posed by exceedingly broad religious liberty exemptions that open the door to discrimination.\n\nBackground", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "name", "description": "The conservative campaign for \u201creligious liberty\u201d undermines fairness and liberty for all.", "title": "Religious Liberty for Some or Religious Liberty for All?", "url": "https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/civil-liberties/report/2013/12/12/80968/religious-liberty-for-some-or-religious-liberty-for-all/", "image": "http://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP120323112975-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 217056148424105}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "elq-topic": "civil-liberties"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a27\"", "article_summary": "This issue brief focuses on the recent history of the religious liberty debate, the current state of play in states across the country, and the threat to progressive values and accomplishments posed by exceedingly broad religious liberty exemptions that open the door to discrimination.\nThe states, in particular, have become a focus of policy battles involving progressive initiatives and religious liberty in recent years.\nThe truth is that religious liberty is not in conflict with marriage equality or with women\u2019s reproductive rights.\nReligious liberty is a core American value.\nThe cases\u2014Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.
