On Monday, a Bible scripture was written on it and removed hours later at the behest of commanders. Both actions are under scrutiny. Air Force bosses say it\u2019s a big reaction to a tiny incident.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest frustration I\u2019ve had in this job is the perception that somehow there is religious persecution inside the United States Air Force,\u201d Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, told the committee after questions about the incident. \u201cIt is not true. We have incidents like everybody has incidents.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. Michelle Johnson, the academy superintendent, addressed the issue, which some have since dubbed \u201cwhiteboard gate,\u201d in her office on campus. She said she\u2019s under fire from religious groups and organizations that want religion out of the military.\n\n\u201cWe really find ourselves in the middle of this national debate,\u201d she said.\n\nAcademy leaders say the recent issue was handled within hours. A cadet complained to a sergeant that the overt religious display made him \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe sergeant and other leaders met with the cadet who posted the Scripture and he agreed to take it down, said Brig. Gen. Gregory Lengyel, the academy\u2019s commandant of cadets. No orders were given regarding the posting, which academy bosses say falls into a gray area of Air Force rules.\n\nThe Air Force forbids leaders from expressing religion in ways that would pressure subordinates or promote their brand of faith, or lack of it. But airmen have a right to practice their faith freely.\n\nJohnson said the academy is working to balance those opposing forces in the dormitories where cadets live and work during their four years at the school.\n\n\u201cAre we perfect? Probably not,\u201d she said.\n\nThe removal of the Bible verse prompted U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs, to claim in a letter to the academy that commanders are quashing religion.\n\nOn the other side is Mikey Weinstein, head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, who says any Scripture posted in hallways is an affront, and Johnson is wrong for seeing two sides to the dry-erase Bible message.\n\nSince Monday, there has been a wave of freedom, religious and otherwise, on the 2,000 whiteboards outside cadet dorm rooms.\n\nIn response to the online flap that developed over Monday\u2019s posting and erasure, hundreds of cadets took up their pens and posted quotes from the Bible, Talmud, Koran and nonreligious sources.\n\n\u201cIt seems 20-year-olds have a sense of humor,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe academy has told cadets to use taste and caution in what they post. The goal, Johnson said, is to have a climate of respect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to try to legislate everything they do,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe want them to develop the judgment to balance their beliefs against their responsibilities.\u201d\n\nAnd whiteboards, regardless of the message, will be handled on a case-by-case basis, she said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Whiteboard at Air Force Academy has controversy written all over it", "title": "Whiteboard at Air Force Academy has controversy written all over it", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/15/whiteboard-at-air-force-academy-has-controversy-written-all-over-it/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-15T18:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T18:01:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "article_summary": "On Monday, a Bible scripture was written on it and removed hours later at the behest of commanders.\nNo orders were given regarding the posting, which academy bosses say falls into a gray area of Air Force rules.\nAir Force bosses say it\u2019s a big reaction to a tiny incident.\n\u201cThe single biggest frustration I\u2019ve had in this job is the perception that somehow there is religious persecution inside the United States Air Force,\u201d Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, told the committee after questions about the incident.\nAcademy leaders say the recent issue was handled within hours."}
