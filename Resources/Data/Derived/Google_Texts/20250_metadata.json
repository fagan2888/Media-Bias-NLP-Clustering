As such, the law could be used \"as a pretext to harass hotel operators and their guests,\" she wrote.\n\nThe court's four liberals were joined in the ruling by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the decisive vote in close cases.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the law \"is eminently reasonable,\" given the use of cheap motels as places to stash migrants who have been smuggled across the border and as rendezvous points for child sex workers and their clients.\n\n\"The warrantless inspection requirement provides a necessary incentive for motels to maintain their registers thoroughly and accurately: They never know when law enforcement might drop by to inspect,\" Scalia wrote. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.\n\nSotomayor noted that police will still be able to make surprise inspections by getting a warrant or in instances in which an officer suspects the hotel operator might tamper with the registry.\n\nWire services", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a 5-4 decision, justices say ordinance infringed on hotel operators' Fourth Amendment rights", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/22/supreme-court-throws-out-los-angeles-ordinance.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/6/22/supreme-court-throws-out-los-angeles-ordinance/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Supreme_Court_062215.1435015450450.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "In a 5-4 decision, justices say ordinance infringed on hotel operators' Fourth Amendment rights", "title": "Supreme Court tosses LA ordinance giving police access to hotel records"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/6/22/supreme-court-throws-out-los-angeles-ordinance/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Supreme_Court_062215.1435015450450.jpg", "description": "Justices say ordinance infringed on hotel operators\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court tosses LA ordinance giving police access to hotel records"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Supreme Court, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In a 5-4 decision, the justices upheld an appeals court ruling that struck down the ordinance, saying it violated Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful searches and seizures.\nAs such, the law could be used \"as a pretext to harass hotel operators and their guests,\" she wrote.\nShe noted that hotel operators may be arrested on the spot if they refuse to give police access to their records.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said the ordinance penalizes hotel operators \"for declining to turn over their records without affording them any opportunity for precompliance review.\"\nCircuit Court of Appeals struck down the ordinance in December 2013."}
