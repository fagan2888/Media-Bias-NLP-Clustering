James Antle III, News, Politics News\n\nWatching the debate over Arizona\u2019s SB 1062 (better known as the state\u2019s anti-gay Jim Crow law) unfold this past week, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the already iconic line from Matthew McConaughey\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d character Rust Cohle: \u201cTime is a flat circle.\u201d As is always the case with the nihilistic and willfully esoteric Cohle, it\u2019s not entirely clear what he\u2019s trying to say with the metaphor, but we get the gist: Like Nietzsche\u2019s \u201ceternal return,\u201d Cohle\u2019s flat circle theory holds that all of us are destined to relive every moment of our conscious lives, forever. It\u2019s as if we all were stuck in the late Harold Ramis\u2019 \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d but instead of repeating a single day, we repeat our entire lives.\n\nBeyond the fact that, like many others, obsessing over \u201cTrue Detective\u201d has increasingly become the chief way I spend my free time, Arizona\u2019s brief foray into the politics of segregation reminded me of the flat circle quote because I had recently seen Bryan Cranston\u2019s Broadway debut, \u201cAll the Way,\u201d in which the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d star plays former president Lyndon B. Johnson during the historic period between Kennedy\u2019s assassination and Johnson\u2019s reelection, a time when the 36th president was working feverishly to ensure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The play is good and Cranston is great, but what was most striking throughout was how much Johnson\u2019s opponents then sounded like SB 1062\u2019s supporters today. It was, as Cohle would say, some \u201cheavy shit.\u201d\n\nThe similarities weren\u2019t merely superficial, either. Sure, the play, written by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Robert Schenkkan (who obviously did his homework), was littered with hysterical charges of \u201cfascism\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cbig government\u201d from no-name Dixiecrats that most of us never knew or were happy to forget. And of course these moments brought to mind much of the anti-Obamacare rhetoric that has emanated from conservatives during the past five years. But the parallels went deeper than that. It wasn\u2019t just the language that sounded so familiar, but the logic behind it, too. Whether conservatives were defending Jim Crow proper or the Southwest\u2019s latest variant, their worldview, all these years later, was disturbingly unchanged.\n\nTo explain what I mean, allow me to cite two of conservatism\u2019s leading lights: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and all-around media mogul Glenn Beck.\n\nAs the opposition to SB 1062 increased in fervency and numbers, the usually loquacious Paul was, unlike his fellow Senate Republican John McCain (who opposed the bill), deafeningly mute. Anyone familiar with Paul\u2019s history knows why: Because the obvious presidential aspirant wanted to avoid reminding people of the unfortunate 2010 interview with Rachel Maddow in which he stated that, even today, he would not support the government-run dismantling of Jim Crow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be associated with those people,\u201d Paul said, referring to white supremacists who\u2019d bar blacks from their restaurants, \u201cbut I also don\u2019t want to limit their speech in any way\u2026\u201d Paul\u2019s orthodox libertarianism told him that the freedom to discriminate was too valuable, too sacred, to let the federal government stand in its way. Like Sen. Barry Goldwater did in 1964, when he voted against the Civil Rights Act, Paul argued that the Constitution had no room for anti-discrimination.\n\nRoughly four years later, Glenn Beck made a similar argument, this time in defense of SB 1062. After doing his best impression of Hamlet, grappling aloud with his competing interest to not be a bigot while on the other hand maintaining allegiance to his understanding of liberty, Beck cut to the chase, telling his coworkers that he could only support Arizona\u2019s bill, because \u201cfreedom is ugly.\u201d Like Paul, Beck was sure to make clear that he held no sympathy for anyone who would ban LGBTQ people from their premises. But also like Paul, Beck had no choice but to conclude that the freedom to ostracize and discriminate was, in part, what the American experiment was all about. \u201cI don\u2019t like that world,\u201d Beck said, \u201cbut that\u2019s freedom! That\u2019s freedom! Freedom is ugly. It\u2019s ugly.\u201d\n\nHigh-profile though they may be, Beck and Paul are hardly the only conservatives who still cling to a vision of freedom that many Americans wrongly thought was swept into Reagan\u2019s \u201cash-heap of history\u201d decades before. Tucker Carlson \u2014 who, if Paul is to be Goldwater, we must describe as today\u2019s version of the braying, segregationist Dixiecrats \u2014 was adamant in his defense of SB 1062, saying on Fox News that opponents of the bill were advocating for \u201cfascism\u201d and had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d in their quest to prevent state-sanctioned bigotry. \u201cEverybody in America is terrified to tell the truth,\u201d Carlson warned, \u201cwhich is, this is insane, this is not tolerance, this is fascism.\u201d Tellingly, when his sparring partner, Fox\u2019s house liberal, Alan Colmes, asked Carlson whether he would have supported the Civil Rights Act, the editor of the Daily Caller could only respond by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t bring [that] into this,\u201d with a sneer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives' defense of Arizona's anti-gay bill shows just how little they've grown since the 1960s", "title": "The right defends a new Jim Crow: 50 years since the Civil Rights Act, wingnuts still don\u2019t get it", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives' defense of Arizona's anti-gay bill shows just how little they've grown since the 1960s", "title": "The right defends a new Jim Crow: 50 years since the Civil Rights Act, wingnuts still don\u2019t get it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/01/the_right_defends_a_new_jim_crow_50_years_since_the_civil_rights_act_wingnuts_still_dont_get_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/paul_beck.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives' defense of Arizona's anti-gay bill shows just how little they've grown since the 1960s", "title": "The right defends a new Jim Crow: 50 years since the Civil Rights Act, wingnuts still don\u2019t get it", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/paul_beck.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alan Colmes, All the Way, anti-gay Jim Crow, Barry Goldwater, Bryan Cranston, Cato, civil rights act of 1964, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Glenn Beck, Ilya Shapiro, Jan Brewer, Jim Crow, kevin williamson, LBJ, LGBT, LGBT Rights, LGBTQ, Lyndon B.
