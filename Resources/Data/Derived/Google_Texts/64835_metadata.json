A new video from The Economist claims that 2016 will be the year of the \u201cvirtual reality takeover,\u201d when technology blossoms even further to reach areas including tech, journalism, shopping, and even medicine.\n\n\u201cIt actually allows people to be transported to these other worlds and feel like they\u2019re actually there,\u201d J.B. McRee, a leader at HTC, a virtual reality company developing an interactive headset, said in the video. \u201cWe\u2019re finally at a point now where the technology is capable of providing what is a very, very real and immersive experience with minimal latency.\u201d\n\nIn the aughts, iPods became incredibly popular, transforming the way we heard music; social media and smartphones likewise began changing the world in the past decade. But in the next coming years, an integration of virtual reality into nearly every aspect of our lives might actually happen. The video predicts that nearly 25 percent of the world\u2019s population will be on a smartphone, so it appears it\u2019s only a matter of time before virtual reality also takes over. In addition, the video states, virtual reality products may bring in $3.8 billion in revenue over the course of 2016 \u2014 a bold claim, but something to think about.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, virtual reality isn\u2019t all just fun and games; it\u2019s expanded into the medical world, offering new therapies for people suffering from autism, anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The video describes the use of virtual reality exposure therapy for a former soldier suffering from PTSD, noting that it can help ease the mental illness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping patients to confront and process difficult emotional memories by putting them back in simulations of what they were traumatized in,\u201d Skip Rizzo, a psychologist who works with virtual reality exposure therapy, said in the video.\n\nRecently, virtual reality has been used to help women \u201cswap\u201d bodies virtually, and fight eating disorders; act as a therapist for people suffering from anxiety and depression; and surgery simulation for medical students. There are myriads of other ways that virtual reality has already begun to be incorporated into the medical world; it can help as exposure therapy to reduce drug and alcohol addiction; assist glaucoma patients in remaining balanced; and even fight racial biases. It really does seem as though the possibilities are endless.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "virtual, reality, takeover, 2016, may, be, year, virtual, reality, can, treat, anxiety, autism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new video outlines the strides that virtual reality has made in recent years, highlighting the potential it has to expand in 2016.", "title": "2016 May Usher In A New Era Of Virtual Reality In Medicine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/virtual-reality-takeover-2016-may-be-year-virtual-reality-can-treat-anxiety-autism-367204", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/29/virtual-reality-takeover-2016-may-be-year-virtual-reality-can-treat-anxiety-autism.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new video outlines the strides that virtual reality has made in recent years, highlighting the potential it has to expand in 2016.", "title": "2016 May Usher In A New Era Of Virtual Reality In Medicine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/virtual-reality-takeover-2016-may-be-year-virtual-reality-can-treat-anxiety-autism-367204", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/29/virtual-reality-takeover-2016-may-be-year-virtual-reality-can-treat-anxiety-autism.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/virtual-reality-takeover-2016-may-be-year-virtual-reality-can-treat-anxiety-autism.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-12-29T17:01:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T18:27:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new video outlines the strides that virtual reality has made in recent years, highlighting the potential it has to expand in 2016."}, "article_summary": "Perhaps most interestingly, virtual reality isn\u2019t all just fun and games; it\u2019s expanded into the medical world, offering new therapies for people suffering from autism, anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nBut in the next coming years, an integration of virtual reality into nearly every aspect of our lives might actually happen.\nThe video describes the use of virtual reality exposure therapy for a former soldier suffering from PTSD, noting that it can help ease the mental illness.\nIn addition, the video states, virtual reality products may bring in $3.8 billion in revenue over the course of 2016 \u2014 a bold claim, but something to think about.\nA new video from The Economist claims that 2016 will be the year of the \u201cvirtual reality takeover,\u201d when technology blossoms even further to reach areas including tech, journalism, shopping, and even medicine."}
