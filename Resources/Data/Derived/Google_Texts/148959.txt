An early Sunday morning standoff ended with an Aurora police SWAT team arresting a shotgun-wielding man, who had an outstanding arrest warrant for attempted homicide.

Aurora police said the man is Adeeb Mohammed.

At around 2 a.m., Aurora police received a report of a man with a gun at the Silverbrook Apartments, at 15453 E. First Ave., police said.

A resident who heard a fight in the parking lot told police that he saw a man with a gun when he looked out the window.

When officers arrived at the scene, a man told them that the suspect had pointed a shotgun at him and also hit him with the gun.

The man told police that the suspect ran into one of the complex’s buildings and took shelter in apartment 302.

When officers learned the identity of the suspect, they discovered there was a warrant for his arrest for attempted homicide, police said.

Officers set up containment around the apartment and evacuated surrounding apartments as a precaution. There were unsuccessful attempts to contact the man in the apartment by phone.

Using a loudspeaker, police ordered occupants of the apartment to come out.

Four occupants left the apartment — leaving the suspect and two others inside. Throughout the incident, continued attempts were made to contact the suspect by cellphone, and police also used a loudspeaker to order him to surrender, police said.

At 4:30 a.m., the SWAT team arrived. At around 7:15 a.m., the SWAT team shot a nonlethal foam round at the window of the apartment to get the attention of the remaining three occupants. The three then surrendered, including the suspect, who was taken into custody without incident. A shotgun was located inside the apartment.
