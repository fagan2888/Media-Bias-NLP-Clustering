Cordileone, chairman of the USCCB\u2019s Subcommittee for the Promotion and Defense of Marriage, responded in a joint statement released Oct. 6, \u201cThis is a time when marriage needs to be strengthened, not redefined.\u201d\n\nThey prefaced, \u201cGlobally, we are at a time of recognizing the decisive importance of marriage and the family when it comes to addressing challenges of poverty and serving the good of all.\u201d\n\nPope Francis has stated, \u201cIf someone is gay who searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\u2026 The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalized because of this (orientation) but that they must be integrated into society.\u201d\n\nOld ways, new ways\n\nFor the millions of Latinos who follow the faith and rituals they were raised with, the issue has become a generational one, with the younger generations being more open to changes in the traditional definition of marriage.\n\nOne of the major struggles for Hispanics is their cultural heritage, which most often means religion but not necessarily Catholicism, explains Arnold Torres, national Latino policy consultant now based in Sacramento, Calif. As Hispanics continue to shift away from Catholicism and its ritualistic themes, traditions change. That\u2019s why, he explains, more people are accepting of the restructuring of marriage laws.\n\nImpact of partner benefits\n\nThis new definition opens doors for same-sex couples. They can now realize the legal benefits of the life they\u2019ve established together. These include filing joint tax returns, receiving inheritance benefits and enrolling in family healthcare plans.\n\n\u201cEven after the Affordable Care Act, many people are still struggling to access healthcare,\u201d Daniel Leyva, senior director for prevention and education with the Latino Commission on Aids, tells Hispanic Link. \u201cThose benefits should resonate with the Latino community because many who identify as lesbian, gay, transgender or questioning are Latinos.\u201d\n\nLeyva says marriage equality will finally put an end to some issues, particularly when a partner dies of HIV or AIDS.\n\n\u201cPeople who lived together, bought a house together, lost everything because of the lack of marriage equality. A lot of people were taken advantage of by the families of the deceased who took everything even though curiously the family originally rejected them because of their lifestyle,\u201d Leyva says. \u201cMarriage equality prevents that kind of situation. The legal system is going to help them live in peace and with dignity.\u201d\n\nEdgardo Guerrero, 47, of Washington, D.C., felt the effects of a court ruling on marriage equality firsthand when his partner was facing deportation after they had lived together seven years.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage changed my life and that of many gay and lesbian Latinos living in the U.S.,\u201d says Guerrero. \u201cPedro\u2019s visa expired and he had to return to his native Panama or stay in the U.S. without legal documents.\u201d\n\nThey were able to wed last year and Guerrero was able to apply to change his husband\u2019s immigration status.\n\nChanging states\n\nThe non-decision allows lower court rulings to stand in Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin, bringing the number of accepting states to 24 plus the District of Columbia. Six more states within those circuits \u2013 North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wyoming, Kansas and Colorado \u2013 are bound by the same decisions which allow same-sex marriage, essentially giving same-sex couples the rights and protections of marriage in three-fifths of the country.\n\n\u201cFamily matters just as much to LGBT Latinos as it does to the larger Latino community, and building strong families is still the best way to build strong communities,\u201d emails Mart\u00edn Diego Garc\u00eda of the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club in the capital.\n\n\u201cSame-sex couples and their kids in many more states will enjoy the legal protections that come with civil marriage, but it also means the love and commitment they share will be more easily recognized by their communities.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Borderzine", "description": "By Vanessa Hornedo,\u00a0Hispanic Link News Service WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 8 \u2013The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision\u00a0to\u00a0not hear five states\u2019 appeals that challenge same-sex marriage, coinciding with the majority of\u00a0states now accepting\u00a0the rapid social change, leaves the nation\u2019s 54-million Hispanics trying to determine where their cultural heritage fits in. \u201cHispanics have been lagging a couple of stepsRead More", "title": "For Hispanics, same-sex marriage another sign of generational culture shift - Borderzine", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://borderzine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/san-elizario-outside-600x396.jpg", "url": "http://borderzine.com/2014/10/for-hispanics-same-sex-marriage-another-sign-of-generational-culture-shift/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/borderzine", "section": "Diversity & Ideas", "published_time": "2014-10-22T00:56:27-06:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1399456243688082}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "NextGEN Gallery Optimizer Basic v2.1.3"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople who lived together, bought a house together, lost everything because of the lack of marriage equality.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage changed my life and that of many gay and lesbian Latinos living in the U.S.,\u201d says Guerrero.\n\u201cMarriage equality prevents that kind of situation.\nSix more states within those circuits \u2013 North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wyoming, Kansas and Colorado \u2013 are bound by the same decisions which allow same-sex marriage, essentially giving same-sex couples the rights and protections of marriage in three-fifths of the country.\nThat\u2019s why, he explains, more people are accepting of the restructuring of marriage laws."}
