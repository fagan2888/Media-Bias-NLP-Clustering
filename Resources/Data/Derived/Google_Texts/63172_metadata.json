We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.\n\nChina doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.\n\nSo I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.\n\nIt begins with tax reform. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let's allow companies to immediately expense.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.\n\nHow about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.\n\nTRUMP: Neil, the problem...\n\nBARTIROMO: We're getting...\n\nTRUMP: ... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can't do it any longer.\n\nCAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.\n\nBUSH: Absolutely.\n\nTRUMP: You looking at me?\n\nBUSH: Yeah.\n\nBARTIROMO: Prices go higher for...\n\nTRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up. They're never going to let it happen.\n\nJapan, the same thing. They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Komatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Komatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.\n\nAnd that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.\n\n(APPLAUSE)", "article_metadata": {"description": "During Thursday night's GOP debate, Donald Trump cited problems faced by Caterpillar Inc. in regards to the value of currency in countries around the world.\r\n\"You look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Komatsu. a tractor company in Japan.
