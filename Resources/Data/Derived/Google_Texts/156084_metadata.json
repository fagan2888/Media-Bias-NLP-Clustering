The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\n\nJune 26, 2015 (Photo: Steve Benson/The Republic)\n\nIn a case of solid reasoning, common sense and plain speaking, the U.S. Supreme Court has \u2014 once more -- upheld President Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court's premier conservative crank, Antonin Scalia, is recovering from a babbling meltdown he suffered while being rejected by his colleagues for his quaint rabidness.\n\nNever gracious in defeat, Scalia grumped that his colleagues' interpretation of the ACA's legislative lingo was proof that \"words no longer have meaning.\"\n\nAs if he's one to talk.\n\nIn a blubbering, discombobulated hissy-fit of flummoxed, flabbergasted gobbledygook, Scalia labeled his fellow jurists' ruling \"jiggery-pokery,\" \"pure applesauce\" and \"SCOTUS-care.\"\n\nSay what?\n\nScalia: \"You would think the answer would be obvious.\"\n\nYou would think so, Antonin \u2014 but not from anything you just said.\n\nHe then signed off with a curt \"I dissent\" \u2014 which was the only intelligible thing he managed to utter during his entire tantrum.\n\nA 6-to-3 rout.\n\nA surly Scalia pout.\n\nFollowed by a hearty Obama shout-out.\n\nAs the president remarked a few days before the ruling came down in his--and America's--favor:\n\n\"This should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably should not even have been taken up . . . .\n\n\"What's more, the thing's working. Part of what is bizarre about the whole thing is that we have not had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them have come to pass.\"\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n--Steve Benson\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1NjLie4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Justice Scalia can scream and pout all he wants.
