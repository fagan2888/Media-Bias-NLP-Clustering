The Swedish scientists developed a mouse strain with high levels of PGC-1(alpha)1 in their muscles and exposed them (and normal mice) to a stressful environment of noises and flashing lights.\n\nAfter five weeks, the normal mice showed evidence of depressed behavior, but the modified mice did not.\n\nThe reason, the scientists believe, was that the modified mice also had higher-than-normal levels of an enzyme called KAT, which, under stress, converts kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In effect, KAT in these muscled-up mice detoxed their brain of stress-related neurochemicals.\n\nThe Swedish study was published in the online version of the journal Cell.\n\n\u2013 Amy Ellis Nutt, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hffitbrief071.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2e2\"", "article_summary": "After five weeks, the normal mice showed evidence of depressed behavior, but the modified mice did not.\nA: Swedish researchers have discovered a new reason for lacing up those sneakers: Exercise not only feels good, it protects the brain from depression.\nQ: How does exercise help with depression?\nThe Swedish scientists developed a mouse strain with high levels of PGC-1(alpha)1 in their muscles and exposed them (and normal mice) to a stressful environment of noises and flashing lights.\nIn effect, KAT in these muscled-up mice detoxed their brain of stress-related neurochemicals."}
