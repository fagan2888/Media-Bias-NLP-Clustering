A Deloitte spokesman did not immediately respond to an Associated Press call and email seeking comment after business hours Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience this has caused to our customers and do not take this issue lightly,\u201d Onizuka said. \u201cExchange customer support representatives, staff members, navigators and registered insurance brokers are already working with impacted customers to help them reconfirm their 2015 coverage.\u201d\n\nThe 6,000 accounts represent \u201ca portion\u201d of the total number of customers enrolled for coverage beginning Jan. 1, he said. It wasn\u2019t clear how sizeable a portion that was.\n\nExchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey said Tuesday night in an email that she didn\u2019t yet have a total enrollment figure for 2015, \u201cwe just know the 6,000 isn\u2019t all of them.\u201d She said the 6,000 accounts likely include both new and renewing customers.\n\nOne affected customer, Jeffrey Greene, told KING-TV that he renewed his account through the state\u2019s Healthplanfinder website last month, and when he called the state he was told there was a technical glitch, that his account had been canceled.\n\nGreene said he\u2019s not too worried yet.\n\n\u201cIf mid- to late December comes and this ticket isn\u2019t reinstated, then yeah, I\u2019ll be very concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, the board that oversees Washington Healthplanfinder approved a motion to conduct a full review of the code and architecture behind the health insurance marketplace, Onizuka said in his statement.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to providing a better customer experience to Washington residents and are taking aggressive steps to ensure our IT vendors are delivering us a quality product and our customers are receiving an excellent online experience,\u201d he said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
