Boehner \"immediately shut down this abusive, wasteful and obviously partisan effort.\"\n\nBut barring that unlikely decision, the Democrats said in a statement that they would continue to serve on it \"to make sure that the facts are known and conspiracy theories are debunked.\"\n\nThe five members \u2013 including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Linda Sanchez (D-Whittier) \u2013 also called on the panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, to release the transcripts of all witness interviews.\n\nBefore Thursday's hearing, Schiff was among those suggesting that by continuing to participate in the probe, Democrats were granting it legitimacy it did not deserve. He pointed to the Republicans' move to form a similar committee to investigate Planned Parenthood as an example of why Democrats should be concerned with what they increasingly see as a partisan investigation.\n\nBut if they were to leave the committee, they would lose the ability to access its work, of concern in the event of selective leaks from the other side.\n\nAt a Democratic National Committee event earlier Friday, Pelosi praised the five Democratic members of the committee for the role they played at the Clinton hearing and cited the comment from a Clinton rival during last week's Democratic debate that the panel's ongoing probe into her emails is overblown.\n\n\"As Bernie Sanders said, and as we all know, enough is enough,\" Pelosi said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hillary Clinton on Benghazi, Biden and Democratic departures: 'Quite a week'", "Description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 11 Ben Carson joins Donald Trump as a threat to leave Republicans behind Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 11 Ben Carson joins Donald Trump as a threat to leave Republicans behind Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about...", "title": "Hillary Clinton on Benghazi, Biden and Democratic departures: 'Quite a week'", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-10232015-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562eceb9/turbine/la-na-trailguide-10232015", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-10-23", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Before Thursday's hearing, Schiff was among those suggesting that by continuing to participate in the probe, Democrats were granting it legitimacy it did not deserve.\nAt a Democratic National Committee event earlier Friday, Pelosi praised the five Democratic members of the committee for the role they played at the Clinton hearing and cited the comment from a Clinton rival during last week's Democratic debate that the panel's ongoing probe into her emails is overblown.\n\"As Bernie Sanders said, and as we all know, enough is enough,\" Pelosi said.\nBut they backed off a previous threat to quit the committee altogether.\nThe five members \u2013 including Rep.
