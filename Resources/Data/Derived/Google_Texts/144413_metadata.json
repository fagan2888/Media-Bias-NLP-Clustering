Two more matches will be played - on Sunday and Tuesday.\n\nHe said AlphaGo was not perfect and had weaknesses, although he did not elaborate on them, holding out hope that someone might beat it.\n\n\"Lee Sedol is the one who lost today, not humanity,\" he said.\n\nA top player in China fancies his chances.\n\nKe Jie, an 18-year-old Chinese player who has already achieved the highest possible professional rank of 9-dan, told media this week he had a 60 percent chance of beating AlphaGo.\n\n(Reporting by Se Young Lee and Jee Heun Kahng; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The victory for the AlphaGo program, designed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, over Sout", "title": "Google AI program wins third straight match to take Go series", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/12/Google-AI-program-wins-third-straight-match-take-Go-series", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/science-intelligence-go_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/12/Google-AI-program-wins-third-straight-match-take-Go-series", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/science-intelligence-go_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The victory for the AlphaGo program, designed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, over Sout", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"I am very sorry for the powerless display,\" a dejected Lee told reporters in the South Korean capital, Seoul, after his defeat.\nExperts did not expect an artificial intelligence program to beat a human professional for at least a decade, until AlphaGo beat a player last year.\nThe victory for the AlphaGo program, designed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, over South Korean professional player Lee Sedol, the holder of 18 international titles, has surprised many, including its designers and has underscored advances in AI.\n\"Lee Sedol is the one who lost today, not humanity,\" he said.\nLee had initially expected to win the series, even if he were to lose a match or two."}
