Appearing Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Ben Carson stood by an earlier comment he made about Obamacare being the worst thing since slavery.

Speaking at the Values Voter Summit in October, the retired neurosurgeon said the Affordable Care Act is “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”

“And it is in a way,” he said then. “It is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.”

Host David Gregory ran a clip of the comment, then put Carson on the spot.

“First, recognize what I said,” Carson replied. “The worst thing since slavery. I didn’t say it was slavery.”

“You said it is slavery in a way,” Gregory chimed in, reading Carson’s quote back to him.

“In a way anything is slavery that robs you of control of running your own life,” Carson answered, showing a verbal fluency that rivals the great orator of the left, Barack Obama. “And, when you take the most important thing you have, which is your health care, and you put that in the hands of government bureaucrats, I think you have done the wrong thing.”

Carson made reference to “neo-Marxist literature,” which had the assembled panel’s full attention.

“You go back and look at the neo-Marxist literature and look at what they say, you don’t have to look at what I say, about taking control of the health care of a populace and making the people dependent,” he said. “This is not what America is about.”
