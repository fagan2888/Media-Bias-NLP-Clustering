As the planet warms further, heatwaves and other weather extremes, which today we call once\u00ad-in\u00ad-a-century events, would become the new climate normal, a frightening world of increased risk and instability. The consequences for development would be severe, as crop yields decline, water resources shift, communicable diseases move into new geographical ranges, and sea levels rise,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that the dramatic weather extremes are already affecting millions of people, such as the five to six feet of snow that just fell on Buffalo, and can throw our lives into disarray or worse. Even with ambitious mitigation, warming close to 1.5C above pre\u00ad-industrial levels is locked in. And this means that climate change impact such as extreme heat events may now be simply unavoidable.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the bank, which has traditionally been one of the world\u2019s largest funders of fossil fuel projects and has been accused of adding to the problem of climate change, said it could not ignore the poorest countries\u2019 need for power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to focus all of our energy to move toward renewable and cleaner forms of energy. But on the other hand we believe very strongly that the poorest countries have a right to energy and that we not ask these energy \u00adpoor countries to wait until there are ways of ensuring that solar and wind power can provide the kind of base load that all countries need in order to industrialise,\u201d said Kim.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe stakes have never been higher.We cannot continue down the current path of unchecked growing emissions. The case for taking action now on climate change is overwhelming, and the cost of inaction will only rise,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nKim was backed by Rachel Kyte, World Bank group vice president and special envoy for climate change. \u201cIt will only be in circumstances of extreme need that we would contemplate doing coal again. We would only contemplate doing [it] in the poorest of countries where their energy transition as part of their low-carbon development plan means that there are no other base load power sources available at a reasonable price,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe focus is on being able to ramp up our lending and the leveraging of our lending into all forms of renewable energy. That\u2019s the strategy. It includes everything from all sizes of hydro through to wind, to solar, to concentrated solar, to geothermal. I think we\u2019re invested in every dimension of renewable energy. That is what we\u2019re concentrating on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bank\u2019s report showed that with a 2C warming, soya and wheat crop yields in Brazil could decrease 50-70%. \u201cIn the Middle east and north Africa, a large increase in heatwaves combined with warmer average temperatures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30% at 1.5-2C and by almost 60% at 3-4C. Pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nClimate change posed a substantial risk to development and cutting poverty, the report said, adding that action on emissions need not come at the expense of economic growth.\n\nBut the bank made no commitment to cut funding for oil or other fossil fuel exploration. Analysis earlier this year by Washington-based NGO Oil Change International showed that the bank had funded $21bn (\u00a313bn) of fossil fuel projects since 2008, including $1bn of oil and other fossil fuel exploration in 2013.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bank has taken an important first step in essentially stopping its support for coal-fired power plants, but climate change is caused by more than just coal,\u201d said Stephen Kretzmann, director of Oil Change International. \u201cThe vast majority of currently proven fossil fuel reserves will need to be left in the ground if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change, but last year the bank provided nearly $1bn in support for finding more of these unburnable carbon reserves.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "World Bank will only fund coal projects in cases of \u2018extreme need\u2019 due to the risk climate change poses to ending world poverty, says Jim Yong Kim", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "John Vidal", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "World Bank will only fund coal projects in cases of \u2018extreme need\u2019 due to the risk climate change poses to ending world poverty, says Jim Yong Kim", "title": "World bank to focus future investment on clean energy", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/23/world-bank-to-focus-future-investment-on-clean-energy", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416589508731/World-bank-to-switch-futu-010.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=1b1c74c836cab3e59a7df075d82c3146", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://environment/2014/nov/23/world-bank-to-focus-future-investment-on-clean-energy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/23/world-bank-to-focus-future-investment-on-clean-energy", "iphone": "gnmguardian://environment/2014/nov/23/world-bank-to-focus-future-investment-on-clean-energy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416589508731/World-bank-to-switch-futu-010.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://environment/2014/nov/23/world-bank-to-focus-future-investment-on-clean-energy?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Climate change,Renewable energy,World Bank,Environment,World news,Coal,Energy,Greenhouse gas emissions,Fossil fuels", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-23T21:01:05.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnvidal", "section": "Environment", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T21:01:05.000Z", "tag": "Climate change,Renewable energy,World Bank,Environment,World news,Coal,Energy,Greenhouse gas emissions,Fossil fuels"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416589508731/World-bank-to-switch-futu-010.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5633768f8ed409af6502a26e473c7e34", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Climate change,Renewable energy,World Bank,Environment,World news,Coal,Energy,Greenhouse gas emissions,Fossil fuels"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a5d\"", "article_summary": "Kim was backed by Rachel Kyte, World Bank group vice president and special envoy for climate change.\nThe case for taking action now on climate change is overwhelming, and the cost of inaction will only rise,\u201d he said.\nThe World Bank will invest heavily in clean energy and only fund coal projects in \u201ccircumstances of extreme need\u201d because climate change will undermine efforts to eliminate extreme poverty, says its president Jim Yong Kim.\n\u201cWe are going to have to focus all of our energy to move toward renewable and cleaner forms of energy.\nBut the bank made no commitment to cut funding for oil or other fossil fuel exploration."}
