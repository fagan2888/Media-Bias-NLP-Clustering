He answered most of District Judge Bill Musseman's questions with a simple \"yes sir\" or \"no sir.\" When Musseman, at Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond's request, asked Mooney if Escue was the person he shot and killed, Mooney again said \"yes sir.\"\n\nThe plea agreement stipulates that Mooney, who turned 16 on Friday, will serve a life sentence with the possibility of parole. He received life sentences on the murder and robbery-with-a-firearm charges, as well as a seven-year sentence for burglary. All counts will be served concurrently, and Mooney will receive no credit for time already spent in the Tulsa Jail.\n\nMooney told authorities he had broken into the house in the 400 block of East 111th Street to steal money and then held Escue at gunpoint before killing her. Chief Prosecutor Steve Kunzweiler said Mooney was arrested when a random piece of evidence \u0097 a business card of Escue's mother's \u0097 appeared on a Sapulpa lawn following the shooting. Without it, he said, authorities might never have been able to solve the crime.\n\n\"They called Mrs. Robinson and said 'Hey, we've got your business card down here,' \" Kunzweiler said. \"Fortunately, the sheriff's department was still there. They raced down to that location in Sapulpa; that's where we ended up finding (Mooney).\"\n\nAccepting the plea deal meant being convicted as an adult \u0097 an appeals court decided in January that Mooney would be treated as an adult in court proceedings. It also meant that Mooney will eventually be eligible for parole, though that won't happen until at least 2052. First-degree murder is an 85 percent crime in Oklahoma. Because a life sentence is calculated at 45 years, he'd first be eligible for parole after spending 38 1/4 years in prison. Mooney would be 54 years old. The sentence was technically the lightest available to someone facing a murder charge.\n\nEscue's father, William \"Dick\" Robinson, said Friday that Escue was a \"happy, joyful, outgoing person.\" He said he still has text messages on his phone from Escue, sent the night he and his wife found her body inside their house.\n\nAlthough he said he doesn't understand why Mooney did what he did and doesn't intend to, still, he offered prayers to Mooney's family.\n\n\"It's a tragedy, for both sides,\" Robinson said. \"He's a person that made a big mistake. Originally, I started out mad as hell. But as time passed, I softened.\"\n\nMarellie Robinson, Escue's mother, said the family was eager to place some focus back on their daughter, after more than a year of updates on the case from Mooney's perspective.\n\n\"Mary was a joy to everyone she encountered,\" she said. \"She was very loved and touched many lives. We will always cherish our wonderful memories of her.\"\n\nMooney's attorney, Jack Zanerhaft, said he and Mooney's family were pleased with the sentence.\n\n\"Given the options, given what a Tulsa County jury might have done, it was very likely that Josh would never have seen the light of day of freedom,\" Zanerhaft said. \"This sentence gives Josh at least an opportunity to have a life at some point.\"\n\nMooney had previously been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive disorder and was taking a prescription drug, according to an Office of Juvenile Affairs report.\n\nIn May 2012, he was placed on probation under OJA supervision after being found delinquent on a Creek County charge of cruelty to animals, according to court records. Mooney, who was 13 at the time, and another teen were accused of stabbing a show pig in the livestock show barn at Depew Public Schools in December 2011, charges show.\n\nThe case was transferred because of his family's residence in Tulsa County.\n\nZanerhaft said Mooney's family had worked over the years to correct his behavior.\n\n\"This was not a child who had a family who didn't care, who wasn't invested, who wasn't engaged,\" Zanerhaft said. \"It's so complicated. There are social issues, genetic issues, medical issues, mental health issues. I think for the family it makes it even more difficult when you're not detached. They're very attached (to Mooney). He did have family support, and he'll continue to have that support.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "A Jenks teenager charged with first-degree murder accepted a plea deal on Friday that will send him to prison until he's at least 54 years old.", "title": "Jenks 16-year-old pleads guilty in 2012 murder; parole possible at age 54", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/courts/jenks--year-old-pleads-guilty-in-murder-parole-possible/article_78214dda-0aeb-53f6-92fd-dafa8cee10c5.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/83/b83a6621-ea35-568f-88d4-de261e711216/533faca0337dd.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C387", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A Jenks teenager charged with first-degree murder accepted a plea deal on Friday that will send him to prison until he's at least 54 years old.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "2012,robinson,com,escue,family,friday,jenks,mooney,murder,plea,courts,crimewatch,local,state,news,newshomepage3,communities,jenks,news,staff,dylangoforth", "news_keywords": "2012,robinson,com,escue,family,friday,jenks,mooney,murder,plea,courts,crimewatch,local,state,news,newshomepage3,communities,jenks,news,staff,dylangoforth"}, "article_summary": "Because a life sentence is calculated at 45 years, he'd first be eligible for parole after spending 38 1/4 years in prison.\nThe plea agreement stipulates that Mooney, who turned 16 on Friday, will serve a life sentence with the possibility of parole.\nZanerhaft said Mooney's family had worked over the years to correct his behavior.\nMooney's attorney, Jack Zanerhaft, said he and Mooney's family were pleased with the sentence.\nAlthough he said he doesn't understand why Mooney did what he did and doesn't intend to, still, he offered prayers to Mooney's family."}
