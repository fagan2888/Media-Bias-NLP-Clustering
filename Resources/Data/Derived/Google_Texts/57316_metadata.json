But a few minutes with Zach Silverzweig would likely rid you of any such notion.\n\nSilverzweig is a co-founder of CipherHealth, a New York-based provider of patient-engagement systems to hospitals. CipherHealth\u2019s first product, launched in 2011 and known simply as \u201cVoice,\u201d is a platform used to call patients after they\u2019ve been discharged from a hospital to determine if they\u2019re having any problems, so those problems can be resolved before the patient has to be readmitted. Since the ACA penalizes hospitals whose readmission rates rise above a certain level, hospitals have been incentivized to reduce those rates. And CipherHealth figured that helping hospitals accomplish that would lay the foundation for a viable business model.\n\nSince the emergence of Voice, CipherHealth has launched four additional products: Orchid, a recording tool for nurses to use when they make their rounds; Echo, a tool that aids the process of providing patient discharge instructions; Link, a remote patient monitoring system; and View, a patient care plan management tool.\n\nI spoke with Silverzweig earlier this week, and I centered the discussion around Voice, since that was the ACA-inspired vehicle that kick-started CipherHealth. He explained that with Voice, post-discharge calls are made to triage patients after they return home, so that high-risk patients can be identified and routed to a caregiver in a hospital system who can intervene before a readmission is required. He said there are two key elements:\n\nThe first is around using a very direct avenue of patient communication. We are able to reach 70 percent of patients after they go home from the hospital with our voice calling platform. That number is huge. Surveys show that in the best cases, that percentage has traditionally been in the teens, maybe 20 percent. With the outreach model we have, and perfecting it over the last three or four years, we\u2019re really able to get in touch with a high volume of patients, and ask them very simple questions that have a high predictive value in terms of identifying those who are at risk for readmission. So when we do that, in concert with a hospital intervening with those patients who are having trouble, there\u2019s a very direct result. We\u2019re able to solve those patients\u2019 problems before they come back to the hospital for readmission.\n\nThe second element, Silverzweig explained, has to do with the integrated nature of CipherHealth\u2019s product suite:\n\nThis comes more into play with the larger hospital systems that we work with\u2014the hospital clients we have that use multiple parts of our solution. Everything is really built on a single platform. For each of our five products, any concerns that are identified by any of those products all go to the same space for being resolved. That allows you to create an integrated model for managing care in a complex system.\n\nSilverzweig went on to elaborate on the Obamacare connection:\n\nIt\u2019s really a direct line. The very first project we were working on was analytics to identify patients who were at risk for readmission. We had read through the Act, and saw the penalties that were going to come through from CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] related to the readmission of CHF [Congestive Heart Failure] patients. At the outset of the Affordable Care Act, it was something like one in four CHF patients who were readmitted. The Affordable Care Act had these very specific penalties related to these readmissions, and we directly targeted that in our value proposition. Clients are seeing 15 percent to 30 percent reduction in readmissions, bringing them below the national average so they don\u2019t get penalized.\n\nI asked Silverzweig how CipherHealth might be affected if there are changes to Obamacare brought about by a Supreme Court ruling or by revisions championed by a Republican-controlled Congress. He said the parts of the ACA that are core to CipherHealth\u2019s business are safe:\n\nWe were really nervous about that, when the Supreme Court was first ruling on major aspects of the bill. As far as we can tell, we\u2019re not that concerned about it because the entirety of the Affordable Care Act is not as contentious as certain parts of it. The insurance exchanges are extremely contentious, and there\u2019s more uncertainly in that area, as well as in the Medicaid Expansion, vs. the areas where we work, which are really the quality incentive and preventative care programs that were put into place as part of the Act. These things have been very effective in terms of producing a reduced readmission rate and saving money overall.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, by the way, that CipherHealth was recently named the No.1 Best Place to Work in Healthcare by Modern Healthcare, so I asked Silverzweig what advice he might have for other small tech companies to help them become a best place to work. He said the most important thing is transparency:\n\nHaving a great culture when you\u2019re just starting with five or seven people, that\u2019s easy\u2014it takes a very particular kind of person to join a company that\u2019s that small. You\u2019re working with folks who are incredibly committed, and who just have a different set of values and beliefs in what you\u2019re doing\u2014that\u2019s the easy part. With the next 10, and the next 10, and the next 10, it gets harder and harder and harder. So what we\u2019ve tried to do is create an extremely transparent culture. We do things like sending out a quick survey to rate us from one to 10 on a particular aspect of the company. We\u2019ve come up with core value statements to identify what it is that drives success in our company, and really live up to those. So the first step is to create that transparent framework, and collecting that information from your team; and the second is making sure you act on it.\n\nAnother key component, Silverzweig said, is diversity:\n\nDiversity in the workplace is huge, in terms of creating a very balanced, very smart company. We deal in a unique world, because we\u2019re in the world of nursing\u2014our primary audience is the nursing leadership, and as a result, we deal with female executives a lot more than most folks do. It\u2019s been relatively easy to maintain a diverse work force, but thinking about that balance, and making a concerted effort, especially in IT, to find folks from various backgrounds who are open-minded to joining a company like this, and starting that process really early, is really important. If you start with a team of 10 male developers, it\u2019s going to be really hard to start building a balanced group. If you start with a diverse group of 10, it\u2019s already self-reinforcing, and helps you grow to that next level while maintaining a balanced structure.\n\nA contributing writer on IT management and career topics with IT Business Edge since 2009, Don Tennant began his technology journalism career in 1990 in Hong Kong, where he served as editor of the Hong Kong edition of Computerworld.
