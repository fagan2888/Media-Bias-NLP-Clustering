Scott said people would “challenge the system immediately” if the scandal was over racial discrimination rather than discrimination over conservative groups.

“It’s very important for us to restore confidence in the IRS,” he said. “I was very frustrated with the fact that we continue to see people targeted. And imagine if this was racial targeting. We would explode with amazement and challenge the system immediately. We’ve had no such challenge in the IRS.”
