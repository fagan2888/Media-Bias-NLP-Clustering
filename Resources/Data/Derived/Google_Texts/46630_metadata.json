Ms. Allen herself is the kind of musician that jazz produces only when its philosophies and systems are working. Her playing keeps getting bigger, showing no contradiction between tradition and risk; it teaches as it challenges.\n\nBut she\u2019s hired excellent musicians as instructors, and to keep them busy at night, she\u2019s booked them for a series of gigs at the Stone this week, through Sunday. Thursday night\u2019s show was billed ahead of time as Ms. Allen and the flutist Nicole Mitchell, a pairing that deserves immediate attention as an idea: because of each musician\u2019s power and depth as composer and improviser, because Ms. Mitchell has often singled out Ms. Allen as a hero; and because they\u2019d never performed together before.\n\nBy Thursday\u2019s first set, the show had become a trio, including the drummer Pheeroan akLaff, which sounded less streamlined and more like an ad hoc band. The gig was slightly planned and mostly open-ended, louder and looser than it might have been without a drummer. (The bassist Henry Grimes joined for the second set.) The performance became a placeholder for a future encounter. You were mostly hearing possibility.\n\nThey were playing songs by Ms. Allen going back to the late \u201980s, including \u201cSkin\u201d and \u201cWood,\u201d and Ms. Mitchell\u2019s \u201cIf I Could Have You the Way I Want You\u201d; they closed with a version of Eric Dolphy\u2019s \u201cMiss Ann,\u201d with walking swing and a medium-tempo, analytical kind of feel. In general, they were taking apart the songs, pushing them to see how much they could be destabilized \u2014 Ms. Allen and Ms. Mitchell carefully, Mr. akLaff roughly but infectiously.\n\nBeyond her ambitions as a composer, Ms. Mitchell generates an energized connection between musician and instrument, a discipline and excitement about song and tone and technique that don\u2019t run dry and put the idea of virtuosity in its best light. (If you want a direct example, hear her solo record \u201cEngraved in the Wind.\u201d) She used circular breathing and sang over notes to create multiphonics, and altered her tone and vibrato constantly.\n\nMs. Allen, too, got into the songs as songs, making them rich with chords and then chopping them up with rhythmic and murmuring figures around the bottom and middle of the keyboard. It was all friendly, but with tension: Mr. akLaff\u2019s strengths lay in his disruptions, and Ms. Allen and Ms. Mitchell were investing in forward motion.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140704164318, "twitter": {"description": "Geri Allen and fellow jazz musicians have been teaching by day and performing by night this week.", "title": "Geri Allen Shares Jazz at the Stone and in Class", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/arts/music/geri-allen-shares-jazz-at-the-stone-and-in-class.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002982483"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/arts/05GERI/05GERI-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/arts/music/geri-allen-shares-jazz-at-the-stone-and-in-class.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002982483", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/arts/music/geri-allen-shares-jazz-at-the-stone-and-in-class.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/music", "hdl_p": "When Pupils Are Away, Teachers Play (and Jam)", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 4, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Allen  Geri,Jazz,Music,Mitchell  Nicole", "news_keywords": "Jazz,Music", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ben Ratliff", "SCG": "music", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Allen, Geri", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BEN RATLIFF", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Geri Allen and fellow jazz musicians have been teaching by day and performing by night this week.", "tom": "Review", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/arts/05GERI/05GERI-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/arts/05GERI/05GERI-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Geri Allen and fellow jazz musicians have been teaching by day and performing by night this week.", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Review", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ben_ratliff/index.html", "section": "Music", "modified": "2014-07-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "tag": "Music", "published": "2014-07-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "05geri", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140711143135, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/arts/music/geri-allen-shares-jazz-at-the-stone-and-in-class.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/arts/05GERI/05GERI-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Geri Allen and fellow jazz musicians have been teaching by day and performing by night this week.", "title": "Geri Allen Shares Jazz at the Stone and in Class"}, "pdate": 20140704, "des": "Music", "articleid": 100000002982483, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Geri Allen Shares Jazz at the Stone and in Class", "col": "Music Review", "PST": "Review"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd08f\"", "article_summary": "Ms. Allen herself is the kind of musician that jazz produces only when its philosophies and systems are working.\nIt was all friendly, but with tension: Mr. akLaff\u2019s strengths lay in his disruptions, and Ms. Allen and Ms. Mitchell were investing in forward motion.\nIn general, they were taking apart the songs, pushing them to see how much they could be destabilized \u2014 Ms. Allen and Ms. Mitchell carefully, Mr. akLaff roughly but infectiously.\nMs. Allen, too, got into the songs as songs, making them rich with chords and then chopping them up with rhythmic and murmuring figures around the bottom and middle of the keyboard.\nPhotoThe pianist Geri Allen has been running an educational residency this week for female jazz musicians ages 14 to 25, administered by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and housed at Montclair State University."}
