That\u2019s when banks started clamping down on loans after the credit bubble burst and the nation fell into a deep recession.\n\nPart of the problem is that the banks look at West Las Vegas and see too much of a risk in loaning money, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration, a federal agency designed to guarantee bank loans as much as 90 percent, seems to be coming up short, as well. In September 2012, black firms across the country received only 1 percent of all SBA loans; in 2011 only 2 percent; September 2010, only 2 percent again; in September 2009, 3 percent, according to Fountain.\n\nIn Nevada, only three loans were made to black businesses in 2012, he said. In 2011, only four loans. In 2010, only three.\n\n\u201cA lot of small businesses are suffering. We\u2019re not in control of the loans; that\u2019s up to the banks,\u201d said Bob Holguin, deputy district director with the federal agency in Las Vegas. \u201cWhen you apply for a loan, you need to be ready. Lenders aren\u2019t going to lend you money unless they know you have a business plan and you have a way of paying the banks back.\u201d\n\nHolguin said business owners who are having a rough go should seek out free business counseling, which is offered by the Urban Chamber of Commerce. It has a small-business development center office, with counselors and trainers. He said they also can get help from the Service Corps of Retired Executives, or SCORE, which has seasoned executives who are retired and are looking to help.\n\nBut for some businesses, such advice is too little too late.\n\nFountain ticks off the victims that have fallen prey to what he calls a combination of \u201cundercapitalization\u201d and \u201ca lack of access to capital.\u201d They include Town Tavern, Love Cocktail Lounge, Survivor\u2019s Fish Market, Community Store, Hamburger Heaven, Hick\u2019s Barbecue, People\u2019s Choice, Jimmy\u2019s Cheyenne Market, Tallulah Too, Chez Polle, and even a pair of fairly large bus companies that once catered to tourists on the Strip\u2019s periphery, Ray and Ross and Western Coach.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks struggle for a long time before they put their hands up and give up,\u201d said Fountain, who is trying to convince Barlow to look at some sort of financial assistance program, perhaps a revolving loan. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who started with nothing but shoeshine money and then operated their business on a shoestring budget.\u201d\n\nSPRUCE UP VERSUS INVEST MORE\n\nBarlow said he is familiar with the concept, and that it\u2019s something the city did in the mid-1980s, but has since dismantled. Barlow said the answer is in sprucing up the neighborhood, which could only lead to more \u201cre-gentrification,\u201d eventually making West Las Vegas not just a pass-through point, but an ultimate destination to live.\n\nStill, Fountain can\u2019t help but imagine what the millions of dollars in street improvements could have done for the struggling businesses that have been squeaking by, including Jackson Market, owned by Lillian McMorris. The convenience store on D Street has doubled as a clothing store for the past three years; it\u2019s the latest in a long line to hold a clearance sale, its doors shutting at the end of this month.\n\nLeroy Mack, the store\u2019s manager, places the blame on the lousy economy, but he is not going to let Barlow and the city get off so easily. He blames the store\u2019s demise in part on the ongoing construction of D Street.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to do business when the D Street exit off the I-15 is closed.\n\n\u201cWe may have had a fighting chance, if somebody came in to assist us economically and help us grow while the street was being worked on,\u201d said a visibly upset Mack from behind the counter. \u201cBut the construction killed the traffic, and you can\u2019t operate a business when you don\u2019t have the traffic.\u201d\n\nThe goodbye letter on the front of the door, scrawled in pen, tells it all: \u201cAnother black owned business closing and the city and Ricki Barlow opening a new district. Millions spent on the new street project, but no money for district business. Everybody helps their people but us. We got too righteous and we forget where we come from.\u201d\n\nBarlow, who grew up on the outskirts of West Las Vegas and has a master\u2019s degree in public administration from UNLV, defends his capital improvement projects. In the short term, things may look bad, he says; but in the long term, when the dust has settled and the asphalt has cooled, the new look will create a healthier, more robust West Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cRight now, nobody\u2019s going to lend to the Westside,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to lend to an area that\u2019s in decay. People are just going to have to be patient. Transformation isn\u2019t going to happen overnight.\u201d\n\nWEST LAS VEGAS FLIGHT\n\nThe downturn of the community didn\u2019t happen overnight. There was a time, back in the 1950s, when the place was hopping, with at least a dozen casinos, hotels and motels. Then the Strip started growing and the exodus began.\n\nOther neighborhoods flourished, but West Las Vegas\u2019 black residents, no longer forced to live a life of segregation, started moving out. They found homes and jobs elsewhere in a sort of reverse \u201cwhite flight\u201d that occurred in the inner cities of America in the mid-1980s.\n\nThey left behind those who were born and raised in the neighborhood and refuse to leave.\n\nChurches have cropped up amid the rows of abandoned buildings, offering hope and prayer at a time of high un\u00ademployment, particularly among blacks.\n\nTo survive, some business owners have opened their own churches next door or down the street, their customers becoming a part the congregation, the congregation a part of their customer base.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find Jesse L. Wesley Sr., 85, preaching God\u2019s saving grace to some of the rougher set while he cuts their hair at his barber shop at D and Jackson streets. In the name of Jesus, he occasionally persuades them to find the light at El Bethel MB Church next door, the former site of Survivor\u2019s Fish Market.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of lost souls out here,\u201d said Wesley, who has lived in the community since 1951, always within a mile of his barber shop. \u201cAnd if they aren\u2019t lost, then they\u2019ve already left town.\u201d\n\nHe compares the neighborhood to Detroit, saying, \u201cWe have to find a way to bring the people back.\u201d\n\nAnnie Thompson, who cooks some serious ribs and chicken at Annie\u2019s Kitchen on D Street, next door to the failing Jackson Market, was hoping to bring at least some of the residents back with a fabulous family restaurant that would rival Famous Dave\u2019s.\n\nFor the past seven years, the restaurant has been a diamond in the rough of vacant lots. Her recipes are top secret, having been passed down from her grandmother and mother.\n\nBut she recently received the bad news from Fountain: Her application for a $120,000 loan was denied by the banks. Fountain\u2019s job often waivers from savior to deliverer of such bad news.\n\nThompson and her husband, Bill, a pastor at Hallelujah Praise Ministries down the street, were hoping to buy the building they now pay rent on, expand and refurbish the joint, then hoist a beacon of a sign that could be seen from I-15. Now they\u2019re back to the drawing board, but they adamantly believe they\u2019ve got God on their side.\n\nThe white painted cross on the storefront says it all \u2014 \u201cGreat God.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur No. 1 ingredient is the seasoning,\u201d said Bill Thompson, 61, a former Marine wearing a black beret as he sat in the rib shack. \u201cNo, let me take that back. That\u2019s our No. 2 ingredient. Our No. 1 ingredient is God. We pray over what we make and God makes it the best.\n\n\u201cAnd the sauce is boss.\u201d\n\nJohn Edmond, owner of the Edmond Town Center, says plenty of businesses in his center have been doing well for themselves, including the Buy Low grocery store that replaced a Von\u2019s, which shut its doors several years ago.\n\nBut the grocery store is a metaphor for the changing neighborhood. These days it mostly caters to Latinos, whose presence is on the rise and who make up 65 percent of the population. The store\u2019s delicatessen offers tacos and menudo, a tripe soup that usually is served on the weekend because it\u2019s supposed to be the perfect cure for a hangover.\n\n\u201cIt would be silly not to cater to them,\u201d Edmond said.\n\nContact reporter Tom Ragan at tragan@reviewjournal.com or 702-224-5512.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Small black-owned businesses in West Las Vegas, often considered the last stand in any struggling inner-city neighborhood, are failing even as the city of Las Vegas and the Regional Transportation Commission inject money into the neighborhood.", "parsely-tags": "Las Vegas", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/black-owned-businesses-struggling-west-las-vegas", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-789341"}, "author": "TOM RAGAN LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Black-owned businesses struggling in West Las Vegas", "twitter": {"description": "Small black-owned businesses in West Las Vegas, often considered the last stand in any struggling inner-city neighborhood, are failing even as the city of Las Vegas and the Regional Transportation Commission inject money into the neighborhood.", "title": "Black-owned businesses struggling in West Las Vegas", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/black-owned-businesses-struggling-west-las-vegas", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_004--1-.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_005.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTSIDE_001.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_002.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTSIDE_003.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_003.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTSIDE_002--1-.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_001.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTSIDE_004.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTSIDE_005.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=106087", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=106087", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "TOM RAGAN LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Las Vegas,,", "parsely-section": "Las Vegas", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T21:55:39-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Small black-owned businesses in West Las Vegas, often considered the last stand in any struggling inner-city neighborhood, are failing even as the city of Las Vegas and the Regional Transportation Commission inject money into the neighborhood.", "title": "Black-owned businesses struggling in West Las Vegas", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/black-owned-businesses-struggling-west-las-vegas", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_004--1-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WESTEDIT_004--1-.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-15T04:55:39Z"}, "article_summary": "Other neighborhoods flourished, but West Las Vegas\u2019 black residents, no longer forced to live a life of segregation, started moving out.\nPart of the problem is that the banks look at West Las Vegas and see too much of a risk in loaning money, he said.\nTransformation isn\u2019t going to happen overnight.\u201dWEST LAS VEGAS FLIGHTThe downturn of the community didn\u2019t happen overnight.\nWe got too righteous and we forget where we come from.\u201dBarlow, who grew up on the outskirts of West Las Vegas and has a master\u2019s degree in public administration from UNLV, defends his capital improvement projects.\nIn the short term, things may look bad, he says; but in the long term, when the dust has settled and the asphalt has cooled, the new look will create a healthier, more robust West Las Vegas."}
