Mike Pompeo (R-KS) and co-sponsored by a bi-partisan group of his colleagues\u2014twelve Republicans and eight Democrats\u2014would amend both FDA and USDA law.\n\nIt contains several key provisions. The bill would prohibit the federal government from enforcing any mandatory labeling of foods that contain GMO ingredients. It would also permit the voluntary use of GMO-free labeling claims and the use of claims pertaining to GMO ingredients.\n\nThe bill would prevent makers of foods that are GMO-free or that contain GMOs from touting the safety of their foods based solely on that status. In other words, neither foods containing GMOs nor foods free of GMOs could say either choice is a safer one than the other.\n\nThe bill would also require the federal government to \u201cestablish a non-bioengineered food certification program\u201d and set national standards for the labeling of non-GMO food. And it would permit the use of the term \u201cnatural\u201d (and similar terms) so long as such use is consistent with the government\u2019s \u201cexisting policy for such claims.\u201d\n\nFinally, and perhaps most controversially, the bill would preempt states from enacting laws that conflict with any language in the bill.\n\nA similar bill stalled in Congress last year.\n\nThis year\u2019s bill \u201chas the support of the food, biotechnology and agriculture industries,\u201d reports POLITICO. Newspapers\u2014including The Washington Post\u2014have hailed the measure.\n\n\u201cCongress is right to be moving toward a more sensible policy that allows companies to label products as free of GM ingredients but preempts states from requiring such labels,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote this week.\n\n\u201cCreating unique labeling standards in different states has the effect of taking the United States\u2019 unified food system and breaking it into pieces,\u201d argued Richard Felts, the head of Kansas\u2019s farm bureau, in an op-ed last week.\n\nI agree with Felts\u2019s concerns. As I\u2019ve written before, mandatory state labeling schemes are unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cGMO-labeling laws restrict interstate commerce,\u201d I wrote last year. \u201cThat's the primary reason why I opposed proposed laws in Washington state and California, both of which were rejected by voters.\u201d\n\nWhether or not such laws are unconstitutional is a question now before a federal court, thanks to a lawsuit filed by the Grocery Manufacturers Association against the state of Vermont after that state passed a mandatory GMO-labeling law last year (which I discussed here).\n\nCritics have cleverly dubbed Rep. Pompeo\u2019s bill the DARK Act, short for \u201cDeny Americans the Right to Know.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), who opposes the House bill, said it violates GOP sensibilities.\n\n\u201cThey are states\u2019 rights people and they are for a capitalist system under the precepts of Adam Smith,\u201d said DeFazio, \u201cwho said you\u2019re supposed to give information to the consumers that they want.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a competing Senate bill calls for mandatory labeling of all foods containing GMO ingredients.\n\nAs I wrote last year, I believe Rep. Pompeo\u2019s bill is mostly sensible. Food companies and consumers can\u2019t coexist under a host of conflicting state labeling laws. When those laws violate the Constitution, then a solution is needed.\n\nVoluntary, privately certified labeling is the best solution. But Rep. Pompeo\u2019s bill is a flawed version of a voluntary labeling law, as it would expand the government\u2019s role in food labeling by creating new bureaucracies to carry out the mandated voluntary non-GMO certification.\n\nUltimately, I think this is an issue most properly decided by courts\u2014not Congress or the states. That\u2019s why I\u2019d prefer the Supreme Court strike down the Vermont GMO-labeling law and effectively settle the issue once and for all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Congress, the states, and courts all vie to decide the future of GMO labeling.", "title": "The Supreme Court Must Rule on Mandatory GMO Labelling", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/04/04/the-gmo-labeling-saga-continues", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14280926556299.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress, the states, and courts all vie to decide the future of GMO labeling.", "creator": "@baylenlinnekin", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14280926556299.jpg", "title": "The Supreme Court Must Rule on Mandatory GMO Labelling", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-04-04T12:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/baylen-linnekin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd1f\"", "article_summary": "The bill would prohibit the federal government from enforcing any mandatory labeling of foods that contain GMO ingredients.\nAs I\u2019ve written before, mandatory state labeling schemes are unconstitutional.\nFood companies and consumers can\u2019t coexist under a host of conflicting state labeling laws.\nLast week, Congress proposed a sweeping federal GMO-labeling bill that would establish rules for labeling foods that are free of or that contain GMO ingredients.\nIt would also permit the voluntary use of GMO-free labeling claims and the use of claims pertaining to GMO ingredients."}
