He is being charged with attempted murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and could face additional charges, ABC 7 New York reports. The shooting occurred before hip-hop artist T.I. took the stage. Police said first there was a fistfight, which escalated to a gunfight, and they are not sure if another shooter was involved.\n\nThe NYPD says Troy Ave shot himself in the leg, and 33-year-old Ronald McPhatter was shot in the stomach and pronounced dead at the hospital. A 26-year-old woman inside the green room was shot in the leg, and a man downstairs in another room was shot in the abdomen when a bullet went through the floor. McPhatter's mother, Rose, said she is \"trying to figure out what happened and why,\" and said her son \"jumped in to assist Troy. He was very protective.\" T.I. was not in the green room at the time, and police say he is not believed to be connected to the shooting.
