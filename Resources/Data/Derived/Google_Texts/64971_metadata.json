( Jonathan Castner / Daily Camera )\n\nThrongs of families showed up at the Longmont Museum Saturday to learn about and help celebrate Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.\n\nLongmont residents Kayla Mathias and Kylie Anderson, two 14-year-old Mead High School students, decorated sugar skulls to honor the memories of grandfathers, who they said had both recently passed away.\n\n\"I didn't really get a way to say good-bye to him,\" Mathias said of her grandfather, John Elsiner.\n\nLong lines of youngsters waited their chance to decorate sugar skulls in one museum room, while another line formed for a paper-flower-making room.\n\nCostumed celebrants included Xochitl Lopez and her daughter, Nahomi Reza, both elegantly dressed as La Catrina, a skeletal figure traditionally associated with the Mexican holiday \u2014 now celebrated in other cultures, as well \u2014 that remembers friends and family members who have died.\n\nThe Longmont Museum began organizing its Day of the Dead celebration 14 years ago, and museum officials have said it's now the largest of its kind in Colorado.\n\nAs of about 1:15 p.m., when the event had been under way a little more than two hours and with nearly three hours left to go before it ended, more than 1,300 people had already come through the museum's doors, with more than two hours to go before it was to ended\n\nSaturday's activities featured musical and dance performances, colorfully dyed sawdust \"carpets,\" an altar room to commemorate loved ones' lives, and such activities as making skull masks as well as decorating sugar skulls decorating and making paper flowers.\n\nSaturday's family celebration was the main feature of the museum's annual Day of the Dead exhibits and events, which opened on Sept. 26 and are to run through Nov. 9.\n\nAmy Fontenot, a children's librarian at the Longmont Public Library and a member of the Day of the Dead organizing committee, said she said the occasion is \"more of a celebration of life\" than an occasion for grief.\n\nIts cultural roots include a fun-making recognition, Fontenot said, that \"no matter what class we are, we are the same in death. We're all reduced to bones.\"\n\nThe Longmont Museum's Day of the Dead exhibits and programs are supported by the Longmont Community Foundation, the Community Foundation Serving Boulder County, and the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District, along with individuals and businesses in the community.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26845775/longmont-museum-hosts-day-dead-family-celebration", "modificationDate": "2014-11-01T18:10:23-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1101/20141101__02TCADAYw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "Throngs of families showed up at the Longmont Museum Saturday to learn about and help celebrate Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26845775:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-01T16:01:58-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26845775/longmont-museum-hosts-day-dead-family-celebration", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1101/20141101__02TCADAYw~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Throngs of families showed up at the Longmont Museum Saturday to learn about and help celebrate Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.", "title": "Longmont Museum hosts Day of the Dead family celebration"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Throngs of families showed up at the Longmont Museum Saturday to learn about and help celebrate Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.", "title": "Longmont Museum hosts Day of the Dead family celebration", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26845775/longmont-museum-hosts-day-dead-family-celebration", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1101/20141101__02TCADAYw~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-01T16:01:58-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-11-01T15:54:34-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont Museum hosts Day of the Dead family celebration", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John FryarTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1101/20141101__02TCADAYw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-11-01T16:04:09-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb76\"", "article_summary": "Celebration of life, not expression of griefNahomi Reza of Longmont at El Dia De Los Muertos celebration at the Longmont Museum on Saturday afternoon.\nThe Longmont Museum began organizing its Day of the Dead celebration 14 years ago, and museum officials have said it's now the largest of its kind in Colorado.\n( Jonathan Castner / Daily Camera )Throngs of families showed up at the Longmont Museum Saturday to learn about and help celebrate Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.\nThe Longmont Museum's Day of the Dead exhibits and programs are supported by the Longmont Community Foundation, the Community Foundation Serving Boulder County, and the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District, along with individuals and businesses in the community.\nLong lines of youngsters waited their chance to decorate sugar skulls in one museum room, while another line formed for a paper-flower-making room."}
