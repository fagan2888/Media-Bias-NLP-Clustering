However, many insurance carriers are already covering the screening. Some insurance companies are requiring authorization prior to screening.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved CT lung cancer screening for Medicare recipients, saying the evidence is sufficient to justify screening high-risk individuals until the age of 74 years.\n\nFor private pay patients, the cost is $199 and includes hospital and radiologist fees.\n\nA lung nurse navigator is available to answer questions, explain required criteria and assist people in obtaining a physician order for the screening. The navigator can be reached by calling 251-435-2522.\n\nFor more information on the low-dose lung cancer screening program, visit http://infirmaryhealth.org/services/cancer.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "AL.com and Press-Register staff", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Infirmary 65, lung cancer, Mobile Infirmary, Thomas Hospital, news", "title": "Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65, Thomas Hospital offer low-dose CT lung cancer screening", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65, Thomas Hospital offer low-dose CT lung cancer screening\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/press-releases/2014/11/mobile_infirmary_infirmary_65.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14597650\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-25T21:58:37Z\", \"author\": \"AL.com and Press-Register staff\", \"tags\": [\"Infirmary 65\",\"lung cancer\",\"Mobile Infirmary\",\"Thomas Hospital\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@aldotcom", "image": "http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "description": "Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65 and Thomas Hospital now offer a low-dose CT lung cancer screening program for early diagnosis of lung cancer.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@alcommobile"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 25, 2014,  3:58 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"bamaprstaff\", \"author_nickname\": \"AL.com and Press-Register staff\", \"author_id\": \"1825269\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Alabama Press Releases\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/press-releases/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65 and Thomas Hospital now offer a low-dose CT lung cancer screening program for early diagnosis of lung cancer.", "title": "Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65, Thomas Hospital offer low-dose CT lung cancer screening", "url": "http://blog.al.com/press-releases/2014/11/mobile_infirmary_infirmary_65.html", "image": "http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, November 25, 2014,  3:58 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65 and Thomas Hospital now offer a low-dose CT lung cancer screening program for early diagnosis of lung cancer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1075\"", "article_summary": "MOBILE, Alabama -- Mobile Infirmary, Infirmary 65 and Thomas Hospital now offer a low-dose CT lung cancer screening program for early diagnosis of lung cancer.\nThe new low-dose CT lung cancer screening can detect lung cancer early before symptoms occur increasing the likelihood of survival.\nFor more information on the low-dose lung cancer screening program, visit http://infirmaryhealth.org/services/cancer.\nCT lung cancer screening is a diagnostic imaging test targeted for long-time smokers, ages 55 to 80, who have a 30 \"pack years\" history of smoking.\nThe CT imaging technology uses an eighth the amount of radiation as that of standard CT so there is very little risk in lung cancer screening."}
