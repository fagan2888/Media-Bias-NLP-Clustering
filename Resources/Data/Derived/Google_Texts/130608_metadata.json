Sign up for our morning blast HERE\n\nHillary Clinton is way more out of touch than we even realized.\n\nDuring a small gathering of women in Lorton, Virginia, Clinton was confronted by a small business owner who said her health insurance costs under Obamacare have left her paying $500 more a month for coverage, which now keeps her from providing insurance to her employees.\n\n\u201cI have seen our health insurance for my own family, go up $500 dollars a month in the last two years,\u201d said the small business owner to Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re just fighting to keep benefits for ourselves. The thought of being able to provide benefits to your employees is almost secondary.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I guess my question to you is not only are you looking out for people that can\u2019t afford health care,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m someone that can afford it, but it\u2019s taking a big chunk out of the money I bring home for myself.\u201d\n\nClinton responded in disbelief, wondering how the small business owner\u2019s health insurance costs had possibly increased.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is one of the real worries that we\u2019re facing with the cost of health insurance because the costs are going up in a lot of markets \u2014 not all, but many markets,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cRight now, like with so many of these programs, there\u2019s just a cut off instead of what I would like to see a kind of gradual diminishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I mean that\u2019s my point \u2014 It\u2019s like what could have possibly raised your costs,\u201d a bewildered Clinton asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve got to pick that apart to really make sure we understand it.\u201d\n\nWatch the full segment here:\n\nSign up for our morning blast HERE\n\nShare Tweet", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Hillary almost turned herself into a pretzel trying to weasel out of this one.", "title": "'What could have possibly raised your costs?'
