A driver got into a vehicle and used it to strike two bystanders -- including his ex-wife and an 18-year-old man -- and four vehicles after a fight Sunday, officials said.

The suspect has been identified as Kevin Eugene Bartlett, 37.

The Rockingham County Sheriff's Office said Bartlett was at a home on Vance Street to pick up his son when he got into a fight with another man in the yard.

After the fight, Bartlett got into his vehicle and drove it across the property, striking his ex-wife and the son of the person with whom he had just fought, deputies said. The woman is also the current girlfriend of the man who got into a fight with Bartlett.



Bartlett then began ramming four cars parked on the property with his car.

Both victims were standing in the yard in the 3300 block of Vance Street.

The victims were taken to the hospital for treatment.

Deputies said Bartlett was also treated at an area hospital before being taken in to custody Sunday.

Bartlett will be charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and is being placed in the Rockingham County Jail under a domestic hold.

Bartlett is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 4.
