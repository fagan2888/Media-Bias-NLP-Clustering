BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) published a new study that shows the varying price ranges for hip and knee replacements based on which hospital performed the procedure. In order to maintain a healthy stream of consumer revenue, healthcare providers and insurance companies must work to compile data to show their facilities provide the best value for their quality of care.\n\nThe survey reviewed hip and knee replacement procedures in 64 different markets across the country. It focused on these procedures specifically because they are some of the fastest growing procedures on the market. Their findings showed a 313 percent difference in cost depending on the market in which the procedure took place.\n\nOn average, the study indicated that a median typical cost for knee-replacement surgery was $31,124. Yet prices ranged from as high as $69,654 in New York, New York and as low as $11,317 in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nSimilarly, the study indicated a large difference in the prices for hip-replacement surgery. The median price for a hip-replacement is $30,124, yet it could cost as much as $73,987 in Boston, Massachusetts and as little as $11,327 in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n\u201cExtreme price variation in healthcare can have obvious financial consequences for individuals and employers as well as serious implications for the sustainability of a U.S. healthcare system that is exceeding its economic capacity,\u201d Maureen Sullivan, senior vice president of strategic services and chief strategy officer for BCBSA, saidin the report\u2019s press release. \u201cTo effectively address healthcare costs and ensure access to care, consumers, employers and industry leaders must have information on these price variations and be provided with the tools to become informed shoppers.\u201d\n\nAs the economy gradually heals, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows more coverage to previously uninsured patients national healthcare spending is anticipated to increase. Medicare has predicted that healthcare costs will increase by approximately 5.7 percent annually. Providers should ensure that they are ready to compete with other healthcare facilities for the wave of newly insured consumers.\n\nA report published on EHRIntelligence.com, concluded that the end of 2015 would be a turning point for healthcare spending. It surmised that although studies predicted economic growth would be slower than in the past, it would be much improved from the dimmed annual growth rates during the recession. This will be driven by the demand for healthcare coverage, services and goods that increase with the economy. Though at the time, it was unclear how the implementation of the ACA would impact healthcare spending.\n\nAnother report on RevCycleIntelligence.com, indicated a growing optimism for financial status for 2015 and less concern about the healthcare reforms. Specifically, 68 percent of industry leaders predicted that financially this would be a good year for their healthcare business.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study shows a 313 percent price variation depending on the market in which the procedure took place.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/price-variations-in-healthcare-have-financial-consequences-for-providers", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Retail-health-clinic.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Price Variations in Healthcare Have Financial Consequences for Providers"}, "twitter": {"description": "Study shows a 313 percent price variation depending on the market in which the procedure took place.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Retail-health-clinic.jpg"}, "title": "Price Variations in Healthcare Have Financial Consequences for Providers", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2abd\"", "article_summary": "Another report on RevCycleIntelligence.com, indicated a growing optimism for financial status for 2015 and less concern about the healthcare reforms.\nProviders should ensure that they are ready to compete with other healthcare facilities for the wave of newly insured consumers.\nOn average, the study indicated that a median typical cost for knee-replacement surgery was $31,124.\nSpecifically, 68 percent of industry leaders predicted that financially this would be a good year for their healthcare business.\nSimilarly, the study indicated a large difference in the prices for hip-replacement surgery."}
