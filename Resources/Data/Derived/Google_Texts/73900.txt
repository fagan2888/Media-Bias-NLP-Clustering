Sarah Skiba stayed with her father every other weekend after her parents divorced in 1993.

The Sunday she disappeared, Feb. 7, 1999, the 9-year-old girl had climbed into her father’s moving truck and went to work with him.

Paul Carroll Skiba, 38, owned a small moving company called Tuff Movers.

That day, two of Skiba’s employees called in to say they couldn’t work. He scrambled to fill in so that the company wouldn’t lose moving jobs.

He called one of his employees into work.

Lorenzo Chivers was 36 at the time. He agreed to come in and work. With two employees ditching the job at the same time, Skiba may have decided that he needed to go himself even though he had his daughter Sarah with him.
