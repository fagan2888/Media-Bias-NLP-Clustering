TUPELO – Renasant Corp. has completed its acquisition of Georgia-based KeyWorth Bank for $59 million in stock.

The merger bulks up the presence of Renasant in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, adding six locations. Renasant has been gobbling up other banks, acquiring seven in the last 11 years.

It is Renasant’s second acquisition in the Peach State within a year. Last July, Renasant completed a merger with Heritage Financial Group of Albany, Georgia, in a merger valued at more than $250 million. That transaction brought in 36 locations in Alabama, Georgia and Florida.

KeyWorth, based in Johns Creek, Georgia, had $408 million in assets, with four branches and a fifth planned to open by June. Renasant says it will complete the integration of KeyWorth’s systems by mid-June.

Renasant says the merger gives it $8.3 billion in assets and more than 175 offices in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida.
