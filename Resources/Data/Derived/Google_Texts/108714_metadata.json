Bense chairs the Florida State University trustees, who named state Sen. John Thrasher FSU president Tuesday.\n\nWeatherford has seen almost all of his legislative goals fulfilled, including overhauls of campaign finance, ethics and elections law, and expanding access to school vouchers.\n\nThat\u2019s because he had a willing partner in Gaetz. The men presented a united policy front for the two sessions over which they presided.\n\n\u201cWith most presidents and most speakers, when their two years are up, you\u2019re lucky if they\u2019re still talking to each other,\u201d Weatherford said. \u201cDon Gaetz and I are better friends now than when we started two years ago.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship stands in contrast to that of their immediate predecessors, Senate President Mike Haridopolos and House Speaker Dean Cannon, who presided over the \u201cmidnight meltdown\u201d of 2011.\n\nBoth chambers were at an impasse over competing priorities, including tax breaks and claim bills, and adjourned separately late into the night without the traditional joint \u201chanky drop\u201d that marks the end of a legislative session.\n\nBut Weatherford, stymied by others in the Senate, lost an effort to close the state pension fund to new employees and shift them to a 401(k)-style retirement plan.\n\nDespite the relative strength of the Florida Retirement System, Weatherford has long complained of the millions of dollars still needed to shore up the fund each year.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nFor many, though, his legacy will be as the man who said \u2018no\u2019 to Medicaid expansion.\n\nTwo years in a row, Weatherford successfully blocked the state from taking federal money under the Affordable Care Act to insure about 1 million Floridians \u2014 those still considered poor but making enough to put them over the poverty line.\n\nWeatherford and House Republicans said they didn\u2019t trust federal officials to follow through, and bucked Gov. Rick Scott, Senate Republicans, progressives, and business, medical and labor groups, all of whom favored some form of Medicaid expansion.\n\nWeatherford offered an alternative House plan to cover about 115,000 residents using more than $200 million in state money. That was rejected by the Senate.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe there is a way to provide free-market health care to the citizens of Florida who are in the greatest need,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one is refuting that there are people who live within our state who have a need for health care and currently do not have access to it,\u201d Weatherford said. \u201cBut to just put them on Medicaid, by the millions across the country, and claim that you\u2019re solving the health care challenges of our citizens, is false.\n\n\u201cThat is not a true solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a government solution that will not lead to better health outcomes.\u201d\n\nKaren Woodall, executive director of the progressive Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, is puzzled by Weatherford.\n\nHe was so entrenched against Medicaid expansion, she said, but he championed passage of in-state tuition for undocumented immigrant students \u2014 something many Republicans still oppose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical to me that he stood so firm against expanding coverage for hundreds of thousands of Floridians, yet also did something heroic and correct that he\u2019s not going to get a lot of kudos for from his party,\u201d Woodall said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nIn the last few months, Weatherford also has opened a political action committee, seeded with $425,000 from the Republican Party of Florida, and has given to several GOP legislative candidates running this year.\n\nIn turn, through the Committee for a Stronger Florida, Weatherford has dispensed $1,000 each to the campaigns for Scott, CFO Jeff Atwater, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Attorney General Pam Bondi, all incumbent Republicans.\n\nCampaign finance records show his committee also has passed through $10,000 to a PAC controlled by fellow Pasco County GOP representative Richard Corcoran, on tap to be speaker in 2017-18, and sent $5,000 to another PAC chaired by state Rep. Eddy Gonzalez, R-Hialeah.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to support Republicans and conservative Republican across the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I do because I believe in the party. I understand how important it is to have resources to win elections. We help our friends, people who share our values and our worldview.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nBut political fundraising is just a sideline for him, Weatherford said. For instance, he mentioned doing \u201cbusiness development,\u201d though didn\u2019t have specifics yet.\n\nWeatherford is private about details of his work, though he has disclosed his primary income coming from an environmental remediation company owned by Sen. Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby.\n\n\u201cWhile I have not asked him about his long range plans, it is my hope that he will continue to work for Simpson Environmental Services, Inc.,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cHe is a valuable member of the team.\u201d\n\nFamily friend and Florida real estate executive Dewey Mitchell says Weatherford has had \u201ca lot of offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I mean is, a lot of people have reached out to him,\u201d said Mitchell, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Florida Properties Group. He didn\u2019t drop any names, however.\n\n\u201cHe will be successful at whatever he decides to do,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe he doesn\u2019t have a very good political future ahead of him.\u201d\n\nWeatherford was inducted last week into the Hall of Fame at Land O\u2019 Lakes High School, where he played football.\n\nWeatherford\u2019s pastor, Ken Whitten of Idlewild Baptist Church in Lutz, says that \u201cGod has something in store for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too young to sit on the sidelines or pull up a rocking chair,\u201d Whitten said. \u201cI do believe he has a gift in the area of politics.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 28 Sep 2014 22:57:11 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford departs the political scene, he sounds like a man focused more on now than later.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford departs the political scene, he sounds like a man focused more on now than later.", "title": "Power brokers see bright future for departing house speaker Weatherford", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/power-brokers-see-bright-future-for-departing-house-speaker-weatherford-20140928/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140928/ARTICLE/140929160/EP/1/1/EP-140929160.jpg", "height": 2644}, "updated_time": "2014-09-28T22:57:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford departs the political scene, he sounds like a man focused more on now than later.", "title": "Power brokers see bright future for departing house speaker Weatherford", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140928/ARTICLE/140929160/AR/0/AR-140929160.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-28T22:57:11Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-28T22:57:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "campaign,will weatherford"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd261f\"", "article_summary": "As Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford departs the political scene, he sounds like a man focused more on now than later.\nWeatherford and House Republicans said they didn\u2019t trust federal officials to follow through, and bucked Gov.\nBense chairs the Florida State University trustees, who named state Sen.
