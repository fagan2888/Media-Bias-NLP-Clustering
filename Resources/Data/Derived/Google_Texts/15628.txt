Richard Kirk, the man accused of shooting and killing his wife in their Observatory Park home, pleaded not guilty on Friday.

Kirk, 48, is charged with one count of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, 44-year-old Kristine Kirk, on April 14, 2014.

A two-week trial has been set to begin on Oct. 26.

Kristine Kirk called 911 and reported that her husband was ranting, asking her to shoot him and “totally hallucinating.” More than 12 minutes after she called 911, what sounded like a gunshot was heard, followed by silence.

The couple’s three young sons were home at the time of the shooting.

Kirk nibbled on a marijuana candy before the shooting. Investigators later found a partially eaten marijuana candy and an untouched joint in the home.

On Friday morning, Kirk entered the courtroom wearing gray jail scrubs and restraints. He repeatedly twisted around at the podium to look at his family. He did not speak.

During a preliminary hearing in August, investigators said a blood test administered after the shooting revealed a low level of THC — marijuana’s psychoactive ingredient — but no alcohol or other drugs were detected in Kirk’s system.

Defense attorneys have argued that on the night of the shooting, Kirk did not have the mental capacity to plan or intentionally kill his wife.

But prosecutors claim Kirk acted deliberately, and despite his erratic behavior before and after the shooting, Kirk was still able to remember the combination to the gun safe, grab his gun and fire it.
