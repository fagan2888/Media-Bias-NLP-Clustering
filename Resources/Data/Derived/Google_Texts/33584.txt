Lena Dunham, creator of the show that everyone has an opinion on, “Girls,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” March 8th and starred in an amazing parody of the HBO show, called “Girl.”

Fans and critics alike who were wondering how “SNL” would tackle Dunham’s frequent nudity in the hit series — one of its most polarizing aspects — got their answer in “Girl,” in which Dunham plays Eve in the biblical Garden of Adam and Eve.

The story gets a modern feminist make-over, where an ever-inquisitive, slightly neurotic Dunham stars opposite Taran Killam, who does a spot-on impression of “Girls’s” Adam Driver.

“You’re like a part of me. Literally. God made you from my rib, kid,” Adam says to Eve.

“Oh my God, that is like so sexist, I can’t believe you’d even bring that up right now!” cries Eve.
