(Cal. Fish and Game Code, Section 2077). The DFW has listed 235 species for more than five years, but it has conducted the required five-year status reviews on only two of them \u2014 the Swainson\u2019s hawk and the California least tern. The rest have not been monitored under the five-year review process mandated by law. PLF\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 a petition for writ of mandamus \u2014 asks the courts to declare that the DFW is in violation of law for failing to monitor these 233 species in a timely manner, and to order the agency to move forward with status reviews on all of them, as required by California Fish and Game Code Section 2077.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to ensure that species protection in California is pursued with integrity, effectiveness, and accountability to science and the rule of law,\u201d said PLF attorney Wencong Fa. \u201cThe state\u2019s failure to monitor protected species is an abdication of both legal and environmental responsibilities, and a violation of public trust. It is unfortunate that the Department of Fish and Wildlife has to be sued to do its duty and conduct five-year reviews, because keeping current on the condition of protected species is fundamental for credible regulations.\u201d\n\nConducting timely status reviews isn\u2019t just common sense \u2013 it\u2019s the law\n\n\u201cThe law requires five-year status reviews for an obvious, commonsense reason \u2014 so regulators can base decisions on up-to-date scientific information,\u201d Fa continued. \u201cTimely reviews allow officials to determine whether there is a need for a change in a species' listing and in the level of regulatory protection. Indeed, keeping current on the status of listed species is the only way to monitor the effectiveness of regulatory protections.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeriodic status reviews also safeguard property owners from unnecessary regulatory burdens imposed for species that no longer need protection,\u201d Fa continued. \u201cAnd five-year reviews protect taxpayers \u2014 and the cause of efficient environmental policy \u2014 by making sure resources are focused on species that need them, and not diverted to species that are out of danger.\u201d\n\nFeds update the status of species \u2014 while the state stalls\n\nThe list of plants listed as \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d under the CESA is available at https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=109390&inline.\n\n\n\nThe list of animals listed as \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d under the CESA is available at https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=109405&inline.\n\n\n\n\u201cTellingly, seven of the species listed under California\u2019s ESA law have already been reclassified or recommended for reclassification by federal officials under the Federal ESA,\u201d Fa noted. \u201cBecause California officials have not conducted status reviews on any of those species within the last five years, they have no idea whether reclassification is also appropriate under state law.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose seven species are the Beach Layia (found in Humbolt County, Marin County, Monterey County, and Santa Barbara County); Santa Cruz Cypress (San Mateo County and Santa Cruz County); Modoc Sucker (Lassen County); Least Bell\u2019s vireo (found in 20 counties in both Northern and Southern California); and the San Clemente Island Indian Paintbrush; San Clemente Island larkspur; and San Clemente Island bush-mallow.\n\n\n\n(Note: This federal updating of species listings came about as a result of earlier PLF legal action that prodded federal officials to conduct their own overdue five-year status reviews of federally protected species, as required by the U.S. Endangered Species Act.)\n\nPlaintiff: The California Cattlemen\u2019s Association\n\nIn the lawsuit against DFW, PLF attorneys represent the California Cattlemen\u2019s Association (CCA), a nonpartisan, nonprofit trade organization founded in 1917 to represent beef cattle producers in legislative and regulatory affairs. The association currently has over 3,000 individual members and 38 affiliated county or multi-county cattlemen\u2019s associations located throughout California. CCA has members in every county in California, and its members raise cattle in every county except for San Francisco. The beef cattle industry contributes over 26,000 jobs and more than $1.5 billion annually to California\u2019s agricultural economy.\n\n\n\nBeef cattle producers own or manage approximately 38 million acres within California. A substantial number of CCA members own or manage properties inhabited by species listed as either \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d under the CESA. Because species listings can impose economically harmful regulatory restrictions on grazing and other responsible property use, CCA members have a vital interest \u2014 along with all taxpayers and everyone who values sound, informed environmental policy \u2014 in ensuring that the status of listed species is reviewed as required by CESA, so that listings and regulations reflect accurate, up-to-date science.\n\n\n\nThe case is California Cattlemen\u2019s Association v. Department of Fish and Wildlife.
