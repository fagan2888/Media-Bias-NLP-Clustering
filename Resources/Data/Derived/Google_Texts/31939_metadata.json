It is completely inappropriate and it needs to be addressed,\" the victim said.\n\nCary Police Capt. Don Hamilton said investigators are still working to determine if any of the videos were posted online.\n\n\"You go to school and you think school's some place that you're going to be safe and not have to worry about stuff like this,\" he said. \"For it to be another student, I'm sure it's got to be very upsetting for the victims and the parents.\"\n\nNeither Hoffman, his parents nor his attorney could be reached for comment. He was out of jail Wednesday evening on a $15,000 bond and was expected to make his first court appearance Thursday morning.\n\nRenee McCoy, director of public relations for the Wake County Public School System, could not comment on the matter Wednesday but said that, generally, students who violate the school system's code of conduct can face disciplinary action.\n\nParents were shocked over the news.\n\n\"It's not something that you expect, especially at a school like Panther Creek that has a great reputation,\" said Marie Wagner, whose daughter graduated from the school last year.\n\nFriends described the incident as out of character for Hoffman.\n\n\"He was a cool kid. He is pretty funny,\" said Baaqir Yusef, one of Hoffman's classmates. \"I talk to him every now and then because he's in my class. Doesn't seem like the kind of kid that would do that.\"\n\nRyan McNulty, another classmate, was just as surprised.\n\n\"He was a quiet kid. He was nice and smart,\" he said. \"He didn't really say much. It's kind of like unexpected, kind of shocked that happened. It just boggles my mind.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-05-21 13:11:00", "description": "Bradley Gray Hoffman, a senior at Panther Creek High School, faces felony charges after authorities say he used a smartphone to take videos underneath women's skirts.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-05-21 22:25:26", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13663891|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bradley Gray Hoffman, a senior at Panther Creek High School, faces felony charges after authorities say he used a smartphone to take videos underneath women's skirts.", "title": "Cary teen accused of taking cellphone video underneath women's skirts :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/cary-teen-accused-of-taking-cellphone-video-underneath-women-s-skirts/13663891/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/05/21/13663892/13663892-1400725391-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-21T13:11:00-04:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Bradley Gray Hoffman, a senior at Panther Creek High School, faces felony charges after authorities say he used a smartphone to take videos underneath women's skirts.", "title": "Cary teen accused of taking cellphone video underneath women's skirts :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/cary-teen-accused-of-taking-cellphone-video-underneath-women-s-skirts/13663891/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/05/21/13663892/13663892-1400725391-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbabe\"", "article_summary": "Investigators say those charges stem from cases from March 10 to May 8 at Panther Creek.\n\"It's not something that you expect, especially at a school like Panther Creek that has a great reputation,\" said Marie Wagner, whose daughter graduated from the school last year.\nIt's kind of like unexpected, kind of shocked that happened.\nA 44-year-old victim in the Target cases \u2013 who did not want to be identified \u2013 said Wednesday that she felt violated after seeing video of her on Hoffman's cellphone.\n\"For it to be another student, I'm sure it's got to be very upsetting for the victims and the parents.\""}
