In recent years the farm-to-city example set by \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d way back in 1962 has been far more common among Americans than the reverse trek that forever changed the life of a young Kevin Bacon in \u201cFootloose.\u201d According to census data, the percentage of Americans living in urban areas increased from 79 percent to 80.7 percent during the \u201900 decade, while rural areas saw a corresponding decline.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why people might be tempted to move to the city. There are high-paying jobs; delicious foods; and the opportunity to see, hear, and experience world-class cultural events. But the desire to move to the city is only one part of the equation. In order for the share of city-dwellers to increase year over year, residents of cities must also choose to stay put.\n\nA pair of recent studies might help to illustrate how city residents perceive their surroundings in a way that encourages them to stay put.\n\nThe first study, led by the University of Western Australia\u2019s Sarah Foster, investigated how neighborhood density influences perceptions of crime. Over a five-year period the researchers collected data from nearly 1,200 people who had resided in their homes for about 36 months. Survey items were used to measure fear of crime and perceived risk of crime, while data on walkability, density, and commercial development was collected from public records.\n\nFoster\u2019s team found that the participants who lived in denser or more developed neighborhoods reported a larger perceived risk of crime, but a diminished fear of it. In other words, being surrounded by more people made residents more likely to believe they would be victims of a crime, but less likely to fear the specifics of such an outcome. Because high crime tends to be a major downside of living in an urban area, not fearing it can make life a lot more pleasant.\n\nIn another study, based in part on the late Nalini Ambady\u2019s ideas regarding the power of instant judgments called \u201cthin slices,\u201d researchers from the University of Surrey examined how a mode of transportation influences a person\u2019s evaluation of what they observe. Participants in the experiment watched one of four different ambiguous videos in which two teenage boys fought over a sheet of paper as a teenage girl sat sending text messages on a nearby park bench. The only difference between the videos was that they were shot from either the perspective of a car driver, a bus rider, a cyclist, or a pedestrian.\n\nThe researchers found that participants who saw the video from the perspective of a car rated the actors higher on negative characteristics (threatening, unpleasant) than participants in the other three conditions. Participants who saw the video from the perspective of the pedestrian rated the actors higher on positive characteristics (considerate, well-educated) than those in the car condition.\n\nHow might these findings influence residency preferences? Imagine you randomly select two people who spend an evening in a city, one who lives there and another visiting from a rural area. It stands to reason that the person from the rural area will spend a higher proportion of their time traveling through the city in a car relative to the person who lives there. So for each scene the two people observe, the city resident, more likely to be on foot, ought to walk away with a more positive evaluation. Over time, the tendency to evaluate urban environments from the pedestrian perspective will lead city residents to place a higher value on city life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New studies suggest the longer city-dwellers spend in their urban environment, the less likely they are to leave", "title": "Your move to the big city may be your last", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New studies suggest the longer city-dwellers spend in their urban environment, the less likely they are to leave", "title": "Your move to the big city may be your last", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/27/your_move_to_the_big_city_may_be_your_last_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_125115182.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New studies suggest the longer city-dwellers spend in their urban environment, the less likely they are to leave", "title": "Your move to the big city may be your last", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_125115182.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Hoskowitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Census Data, city, kevin bacon, Metropolis, Pacific Standard, The Beverly Hillbies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc57e\"", "article_summary": "Over time, the tendency to evaluate urban environments from the pedestrian perspective will lead city residents to place a higher value on city life.\nTopics: Census Data, city, kevin bacon, Metropolis, Pacific Standard, The Beverly Hillbies, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nA pair of recent studies might help to illustrate how city residents perceive their surroundings in a way that encourages them to stay put.\nTelevision and movies are littered with fish-out-of-water tales about city slickers or country yokels transplanted into an unfamiliar environment.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why people might be tempted to move to the city."}
