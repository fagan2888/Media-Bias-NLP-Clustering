Yesterday, California Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez warned about something called \u201cmulti-automatic weapons\u201d flowing into the state:\n\nAppearing on MSNBC Live with Tamron Hall on Thursday, Sanchez made up a term to describe a gun while blasting congressional inaction. \u201cThe reality is that Congress has been trying to get up some of these issues [relating to mental health] for the last five years, and we haven\u2019t been able to,\u201d she said We let the assault weapons ban, which was led by our senator Dianne Feinstein, we let that lapse. So you know, multiautomatic round weapons are easily available, even though not in California, but they can cross the state line, as you know,\u201d Sanchez insisted.\n\nSanchez was a professional at naming everything on the gun control wish list\u2013like waiting periods and closing the (phantom) gun show loophole\u00ad. Regardless, this isn\u2019t the first time a liberal just made up words when talking about gun control. In January of 2014, California State Sen. Kevin de Leon infamously warned the public about ghost guns that \u201chas the ability with a .30 caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within a half a second. Thirty magazine clip in half a second.\u201d Yes, mockery ensued. Last August, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon didn\u2019t know the difference between semi-automatic and automatic.\n\nIf liberals want to brush up on their firearm lexicon, the National Rifle Association is just one phone call away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uh, what are those?.05/26/2016 12:03:43PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Uh, what are those?", "title": "Facepalm: Rep.
