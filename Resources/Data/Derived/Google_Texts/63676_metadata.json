It\u2019s that the feds, who will cover the overwhelming share of the cost of expansion for the first several years, might skedaddle and leave the state on the hook \u2014 after these people get used to being healthy on the government dime.\n\nSince we\u2019re talking about government-supported health care, we shouldn\u2019t forget that these same legislators, their spouses and their children remain quite healthy, thank you, on that same government dime. Why are they so fortunate? Because, as those who craft our laws, they made sure that we taxpayers subsidize ridiculously cheap insurance coverage for them, to the tune of the low double-digits per month for the whole family. And it\u2019s good year-round.\n\nNot too shabby for a crowd that works only a few weeks per year. Judging by the fact that the Legislature has displayed no shame for accepting this sweetheart deal, it\u2019s easy to see why they\u2019re worried somebody else \u2014 a needy person, for example \u2014 might develop a sense of entitlement if also allowed to slurp at the public trough. All our lawmakers have to do is look in the mirror to see how easily government funds can be misused.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Florida, Legislature, Medicaid, expansion, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA, health care, medical, health insurance, subsidies, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is considered a nonpartisan outfit, there are 760,000 uninsured Florida adults who aren't eligible for medical care because our Legislature has...", "title": "Florida Legislature and Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-01-09/news/sfl-florida-legislature-and-medicaid-expansion-20140109_1_legislature-chan-lowe-expansion", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52cf1f9b/turbine/sfl-florida-legislature-and-medicaid-expansion-001/555/555x378", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is considered a nonpartisan outfit, there are 760,000 uninsured Florida adults who aren't eligible for medical care because our Legislature has"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce98d\"", "article_summary": "According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is considered a nonpartisan outfit, there are 760,000 uninsured Florida adults who aren't eligible for medical care because our Legislature has refused to expand Medicaid.\nAll our lawmakers have to do is look in the mirror to see how easily government funds can be misused.\nNot too shabby for a crowd that works only a few weeks per year.\nThe reason our esteemed leaders use to explain their intransigence isn\u2019t the real one, which is that expanding the program might, God forbid, help Obamacare succeed.\nSince we\u2019re talking about government-supported health care, we shouldn\u2019t forget that these same legislators, their spouses and their children remain quite healthy, thank you, on that same government dime."}
