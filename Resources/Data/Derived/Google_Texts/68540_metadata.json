Bush with alacrity.\n\nShow creator Lorne Michaels has a reason why SNL is tougher on Republicans these days. They can take a joke better.\n\nMichaels actually trotted out that excuse during an interview with Vulture.com, an exchange that illustrated the bias behind the show as well as the faulty logic used to try and explain it away.\n\nAre there any basic rules for what works and what doesn\u2019t politically? Republicans are easier for us than Democrats. Democrats tend to take it personally; Republicans think it\u2019s funny. But we\u2019re not sitting here every week going, \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to do the First Family\u2026.\u201d We\u2019re doing more of [current pop culture events] than stuff about Benghazi or the new budget agreement. The country has lost interest in it. I can\u2019t tell you why. It\u2019s no less important, but in some way you can\u2019t do health care more than twice, at which point there\u2019s just nothing left. But Jay Pharoah does a really good Obama.\n\nComedy is all about themes, from Bush\u2019s alleged stupidity to Clinton\u2019s raging libido. SNL once tore into those memes without regret. Heck, former SNL star Will Ferrell continued his Bush bashing on Broadway. Now, after two weeks a topic like ObamaCare, which affects millions of people, is off limits after two consecutive shows. Tell that to Jay Leno, currently scoring big ratings while mocking ObamaCare for the last few months.\n\nLater in the Q&A, Michaels swears the show doesn\u2019t have an agenda.\n\nOur job\u2013and it sounds too grand to say and none of us ever say it\u2013is speaking truth to power. I\u2019m registered as an Independent, not because everything that we do would be undermined if we were partisan\u2013Jon Stewart has that role. Us? Theoretically, whoever it is in power, we\u2019re against them.\n\nMichaels sounds like a mainstream media reporter who insists he or she has no liberal bias, all the while public trust in journalism continues to plummet due in part to that very bias.\n\nSNL couldn\u2019t mock anything about Obama for four-plus years, and only when the ObamaCare web site became a national laughingstock did the show wake up to the fact that Obama might not be ready for Mr. Rushmore.\n\nIf Michaels\u2019 and co. are there to speak truth to power with comedy, their dereliction of duty is palpable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" creator Lorne Michaels has a reason why his sketch show is tougher on Republicans these days.
