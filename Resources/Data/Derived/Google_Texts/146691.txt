It wasn’t the funniest segment on “The Daily Show,” but it was one of the most sobering in recent memory: Upon the Senate Intelligence Committee’s recent vote to declassify a portion of the documents outlining the CIA’s torture abuses during the Bush administration, Jon Stewart took a moment to see how Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and George W. Bush have fared in the aftermath.

Bush has returned to public life with, like, 30 pictures he made.”
