Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) delivered the official Republican response to the President\u2019s State of the Union Address on Tuesday night, pushing individual empowerment instead of increased government control.\n\nWhile expressing confidence that both the President and Republicans want Americans to succeed, the Congresswoman pointed out that they have different solutions for making that happen. McMorris Rodgers concisely articulated the \u201cmore hopeful, Republican vision\u201d for the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one that champions free markets \u2014 and trusts people to make their own decisions, not a government that decides for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps working families rise above the limits of poverty and protects our most vulnerable. And it\u2019s one where Washington plays by the same rules that you do.\u201d\n\nMcMorris Rodgers outlined the Republican plan in regard to both healthcare and education, noting that the GOP believes people should not be bound by the circumstances into which they were born, but should be able to become who they want to be. The Congresswoman took a swipe at President Barack Obama\u2019s redistributionist tendencies.\n\n\u201cThe President talks a lot about income inequality, but the real gap we face today is one of opportunity inequality,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd with this administration\u2019s policies, that gap has become far too wide. We see this gap growing every single day.\u201d\n\nAs examples of the widening opportunity gap, McMorris Rodgers referenced those unemployed and underemployed along with cost-prohibitive college tuition rates.\n\nShe criticized the President\u2019s policies for making life more difficult, pointing to Obamacare as one example of that. Citing an example of a constituent facing skyrocketing insurance costs under Obamacare, McMorris Rodgers stated that Republicans don\u2019t want to go back to the way things were, but that there needs to be a change from the current system.\n\n\u201cThis law is not working,\u201d the Congresswoman said. \u201cRepublicans believe health care choices should be yours, not the government\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOf particular interest, McMorris Rodgers\u2019 claimed that the GOP has \u201cplans to improve our education and training systems so you have the choice to determine where your kids go to school.\u201d For millions of children currently trapped in failing government schools, the power to choose between both public and private education options could dramatically close the opportunity gap. Compared with top-down programs such as No Child Left Behind and Common Core, school vouchers enable individual choice and foster competition.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers reflected on her husband and three children throughout her speech, highlighting the personal nature of the American Dream.\n\n\u201cThe President said many things tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, we ask him to listen \u2014 to you \u2014 for the true state of the union lies in your heart and in your home.\u201d\n\nSuch a conclusion proved consistent with her message of promoting individual responsibility and personal choice through a realignment of government power.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rep.
