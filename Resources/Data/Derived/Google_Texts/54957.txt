Fox News “On the Record” host Greta Van Susteren was plenty steamed Friday night, and the object of her anger was New York City’s new mayor, Bill DeBlasio.

DeBlasio closed three charter schools in the city that made use of public school facilities, claiming it to be a cost-saving measure. Van Susreren cried “phooey!” and said it was because the teachers union — the mayor’s friend — don’t like charter schools.

Whatever the reason, the result is the same — poor kids will be denied the quality education they want and deserve.

She laid it all out in two short segments. In this first, she went “Off the Record” to deliver her “Tale of Two Bullies — U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and De Blasio. But she spent almost the entire time on De Blasio.

Right after her commentary, Van Susteren brought on Fox Business “The Independents” co-host Kmele Foster to ask if she was “off her rocker.”

Not so, said Foster, who observed that one of the schools set to close is the Success Academy, which “is one of the best schools the state in terms of its English and math numbers.”

Van Susteren said that she visited a New York charter school sharing facilities with its public school counterpart, and going from one to the other “was like walking through some time warp.”

When Foster brought up the costs of associated with charter school, she repeated her assessment that it was because of the teacher’s union.

“They hate the charter schools, and they got him elected,” she said.
