The Justice Department found that Millennium Health billed the government for unnecessary urine drug tests and genetic testing.\n\nThe whistleblower in the suit was Melbourne, Florida-based Omni Healthcare Inc. As a whistleblower, Omni Healthcare will get a cut of the settlement. Check here to read the announcement.\n\nMarc Vezina is a lawyer representing Omni Healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere will be a sizable portion of money being returned to the state of Florida Medicaid program, both for the urine drug testing and for the genetic testing,\u201d Vezina said.\n\nHealth insurer Cigna recently announced it would no longer sell individual health plans in Florida because of rampant drug testing fraud.\n\n\u201cIt would be silly to think what Millennium was doing to the government, that they weren\u2019t also trying to do to private payers,\u201d Vezina said.\n\nIn a statement, Millennium Health said the settlement closes an investigation started nearly four years ago. The company now plans Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.\n\nMillennium Health also agreed to have most of its board of directors replaced with independent members, and will be under government oversight for the next five years.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
