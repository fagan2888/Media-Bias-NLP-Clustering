(AP) \u2014 Cam Newton threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Domenik Hixon with 23 seconds left to lift the Carolina Panthers past the New Orleans Saints 17-13 and clinch the team\u2019s first playoff berth since 2008. Carolina (11-4) can wrap up the NFC South and a first-round bye with a win next Sunday at Atlanta.\n\nThe Panthers intercepted Drew Brees twice and sacked him six times to avenge a 31-13 loss two weeks ago.\n\nStill, the Panthers needed some last-minute big plays from Newton. After being held to 116 yards passing for the game\u2019s first 59 minutes, Newton led the Panthers 65 yards in 32 seconds for the winning score.\n\nThe Saints (10-5) still are in position to clinch a playoff berth. The Saints have dropped five of their last six games away from the Superdome.\n\nBENGALS 42, VIKINGS 14\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Vincent Rey returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown as Cincinnati clinched the AFC North. Andy Dalton threw four touchdown passes.\n\nThe Bengals (10-5) remained perfect at home and secured an unprecedented third straight playoff appearance when Miami lost at Buffalo. Then the Bengals won the division when the Ravens fell to the Patriots.\n\nIn his past four home games, Dalton has thrown for five, three, three and four touchdowns. The Bengals have topped 40 points in each of their past four home games, a club record.\n\nThe Vikings (4-10-1) had knocked off playoff contenders Chicago and Philadelphia in the past three weeks. Even with Adrian Peterson back from a foot injury, they couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nThe Vikings had allowed the second-most points in the league heading into the game. They gave up 40 for the third time this season.\n\nCARDINALS 17, SEAHAWKS 10\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Carson Palmer overcame four interceptions to throw a 31-yard touchdown to Michael Floyd with 2:13 left. The Cardinals kept their postseason hopes going while snapping the Seahawks 14-game home win streak.\n\nArizona (10-5) had to win after Carolina beat New Orleans. And the Cardinals did thanks to a stingy defense that flustered Russell Wilson into one of his worst days as a pro, delaying any celebration of an NFC West championship. The Seahawks can still clinch the NFC West with a win over St. Louis next Sunday.\n\nPalmer twice was intercepted in the end zone, including Richard Sherman\u2019s second pick of the game early in the fourth quarter. After Seattle (12-3) took a 10-9 lead with 7:26 left, Palmer led the Cardinals 75 yards and found Floyd for a juggling TD catch with 2:13 left.\n\nSTEELERS 38, PACKERS 31\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Le\u2019Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown with 1:28 left, then Pittsburgh withstood Green Bay\u2019s last throw into the end zone and dealt the Packers\u2019 playoff hopes a blow.\n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, but the Steelers (7-8) are still mathematically in the hunt for an AFC wild-card spot. They need a lot of help.\n\nThe loss meant Green Bay (7-7-1) needed Chicago to lose at Philadelphia on Sunday night to stay in playoff contention.\n\nBell\u2019s TD came soon after scrambling Packers quarterback Matt Flynn fumbled while being tackled by Troy Polamalu. The Steelers recovered at the Packers 17 and scored five plays later.\n\nMicah Hyde\u2019s 70-yard kickoff return to the Steelers 31 gave the Packers one last chance. Green Bay got to the 1, but after a Packers penalty the game ended when Flynn\u2019s pass to Jarrett Boykin sailed incomplete in the end zone.\n\nCHIEFS 23, COLTS 7\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck threw for 241 yards and a touchdown, Donald Brown ran 51 yards for another score in a potential preview of an AFC wild-card game.\n\nThe Colts (10-5), who have already wrapped up the AFC South, took advantage of four turnovers by the Chiefs (11-4) to win for the fifth time in their last six tries against Kansas City.\n\nIf Indianapolis ends up as the No. 4 seed in the playoffs \u2014 the Chiefs are assured the fifth seed \u2014 the teams will meet again in the warmer environs of Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nAfter missing his first field-goal attempt, Adam Vinatieri hit his next three despite frigid temperatures and swirling winds at Arrowhead Stadium. He came into the game needing one point to pass fellow kicker Jason Elam (1,983) for the seventh-most points in NFL history.\n\nAlex Smith threw for 153 yards, but he fumbled once and was picked off twice after throwing just six interceptions in his first 14 games. Jamaal Charles ran for 106 yards and the game\u2019s opening score.\n\nBILLS 19, DOLPHINS 0\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The Dolphins had a three-game winning streak snapped and are in jeopardy of missing the playoffs for a fifth consecutive season. With the loss, Miami (8-7) needs help from other teams. Miami hosts the New York Jets next weekend.\n\nThe Dolphins\u2019 loss clinched the AFC East for New England.\n\nKyle Williams had two of Buffalo\u2019s season-best seven sacks to key a stifling defensive performance.\n\nFred Jackson had 111 yards rushing and scored on a 9-yard run, while the Bills limited the Dolphins to a season-low 103 yards and six first downs. The Bills (6-9) closed their home schedule with seven sacks for 56 this season, breaking their previous high of 50 during a 14-game season in 1964.\n\nThe shutout was Buffalo\u2019s first since a 23-0 win over Washington at Toronto on Oct. 30, 2011. And it was the Bills\u2019 first shutout at Ralph Wilson Stadium since a 21-0 win over Miami on Dec. 17, 2006.\n\nCHARGERS 26, RAIDERS 13\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 The Chargers beat hapless Oakland by overcoming three turnovers while benefiting from two turnovers and 12 penalties for 73 yards by the Raiders.\n\nPhilip Rivers threw a go-ahead, 4-yard touchdown pass to rookie Keenan Allen and Ryan Mathews ran for 99 yards and one touchdown, setting a career high with 1,111 yards. Nick Novak kicked four field goals for San Diego.\n\nThe Chargers also got help from Buffalo, which beat Miami 19-0, and New England, which beat Baltimore. The Chargers (8-7) have won three straight games for the first time this season, but need more help to end a three-year playoff drought. They have to beat Kansas City at home next Sunday and have Miami and Baltimore both lose.\n\nOakland (4-11) helped San Diego, too, by committing all those penalties.\n\nGIANTS 23, LIONS 20, OT\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Josh Brown\u2019s 45-yard field goal on the third drive of overtime lifted the Giants and knocked the Lions (7-8) from postseason consideration. They lost for the fifth time in six games, blowing fourth-quarter leads in each setback that might seal Jim Schwartz\u2019s fate.\n\nThe embattled coach chose to play for overtime by running out the clock with 23 seconds and two timeouts left from the Detroit 25. When the crowd reacted with a chorus of boos, Schwartz turned his head toward the stands and appeared to angrily shout back at the fans.\n\nSchwartz has lost nine straight games in December or January, leading to his job being in jeopardy.\n\nThe Giants (6-9) overcame Eli Manning\u2019s interception late in regulation and Andre Brown\u2019s fumble on the opening possession in overtime to win for the second time in five games.\n\nRAMS 23, BUCCANEERS 13\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Robert Quinn got three of St. Louis\u2019 seven sacks and set a franchise season record. Quinn leads the NFL with 18 sacks. He broke Kevin Carter\u2019s franchise record of 17 in that 1999 Super Bowl title season.\n\nZac Stacy rushed for 104 yards on 33 carries and a touchdown, and the Rams (7-8) matched their victory total from last year. Fellow rookies Stedman Bailey scored on a 27-yard reverse, and Alec Ogletree forced two fumbles.\n\nThe Rams won without left tackle Jake Long, who injured his knee on the first series. Coach Jeff Fisher believes Long tore a knee ligament.\n\nThe Buccaneers (4-11) managed just 170 total yards, setting a season low for the second straight week.\n\nJETS 24, BROWNS 13\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Geno Smith threw two touchdown passes to David Nelson and ran for another score. Smith had his first game with at least two TD passes since October, with no turnovers or sacks. The rookie was 20 of 36 for 214 yards and also ran for 48 yards \u2014 including a 17-yard scoring scamper in the fourth quarter.\n\nChris Ivory rushed for 109 yards on 20 carries for the Jets (7-8), who were eliminated from the playoff picture last week. Nelson, cut by the Browns after training camp, finished with four catches for 33 yards.\n\nJason Campbell was intercepted twice as the Browns (4-11) lost their sixth straight. Edwin Baker had a touchdown run, and Josh Gordon was somewhat held in check by rookie Dee Milliner, catching six passes for 97 yards.\n\nTITANS 20, JAGUARS 16\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Nate Washington scored on a 30-yard reception in the fourth quarter and Tennessee got a much-needed defensive stop late to end a three-game losing streak.\n\nTennessee (6-9) overcame a 10-point deficit in the second half and won for just the third time since September. Washington finished with six catches for 117 yards.\n\nThe Jaguars (4-11) were in position to take the lead after that, but Ropati Pitoitua stuffed Maurice Jones-Drew on a fourth-and-1 play at the Tennessee 20 with 5:21 remaining.\n\nThe highlight for the Jaguars came when Jacksonville honored retiring center Brad Meester with a reception \u2014 the pass-catching kind.\n\nThe Jaguars called a screen play for the 14-year veteran center who announced Wednesday that Sunday\u2019s game would be his home finale. Meester reported as an eligible receiver, lined up at tight end and then caught the screen pass to gain 9 yards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After being held to 116 yards passing for the game's first 59 minutes, Newton led the Panthers 65 yards in 32 seconds for the winning score.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After being held to 116 yards passing for the game\u2019s first 59 minutes, Newton led the Panthers 65 yards in 32 seconds for the winning score.", "title": "NFL roundup: Cam Newton leads Panthers back to playoffs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/22/nfl-roundup-cam-newton-leads-panthers-back-to-play/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_nfl-roundup-cam-newton-lead-p18201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_nfl-roundup-cam-newton-lead-p18201.jpg", "description": "After being held to 116 yards passing for the game's first 59 minutes, Newton led the Panthers 65 yards in 32 seconds for the winning score.", "card": "summary", "title": "NFL roundup: Cam Newton leads Panthers back to playoffs"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Carolina Panthers, Cam Newton, New Orleans Saints"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb160\"", "article_summary": "After being held to 116 yards passing for the game\u2019s first 59 minutes, Newton led the Panthers 65 yards in 32 seconds for the winning score.\nThe Panthers intercepted Drew Brees twice and sacked him six times to avenge a 31-13 loss two weeks ago.\nBENGALS 42, VIKINGS 14CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Vincent Rey returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown as Cincinnati clinched the AFC North.\nJETS 24, BROWNS 13EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.
