That\u2019s not a war on them, it\u2019s a war for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it,\u201d Huckabee added.\n\nAlso read: Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers to Receive Diversity Award From Directors Guild\n\nRhimes wasn\u2019t the only one to take offense to the remarks. Actresses Sarah Silverman and Lizz Winstead said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cNow With Alex Wagner\u201d that the comments threatened their sexual health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cWhen a politician is speaking on behalf of those people who are pulling their strings, for their purse and for the \u2026 betterment of their career, it\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to stop feeding into this narrative that it\u2019s somehow awful to be a sexual being,\u201d Winstead said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total hypocrisy. I mean, these are people who are anti-big government and yet they want to make laws about my vagina and what I do with my body,\u201d Silverman added.\n\nAlso read: 10 Things We Learned About Sarah Silverman on Reddit\n\nEven the White House objected to Huckabee\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen that report, but whoever said it, it sounds offensive to me and to women,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at Thursday\u2019s briefing.\n\nIn a statement to TheWrap, Huckabee said the comments to which Rhimes and others have reacted were taken out of context and missed the point of what he was trying to say about how Democrats regard women:\n\n\u201cMs. Rhimes\u2019 comment seems to be directed at the misquotations of my speech which were made by certain members of the media. Even they were forced to admit they got it wrong and had to issue a correction. Maybe Ms. Rhimes will issue a correction as well. As a strong, and powerful woman, I believe Ms. Rhimes would agree that women are not helpless, and they have the capacity to manage their lives without the intervention of big government. The real scandal is the fact that Democrats continue to portray the women of America as helpless victims of gender who need government assistance in order to manage their reproductive systems. I think far more highly of women than that.\u201d\n\nWatch the video of Huckabee\u2019s remarks below:\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Huckabee-Rhimes1-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "L.A.
