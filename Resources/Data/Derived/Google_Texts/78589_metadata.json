It is a symbol of the authority that they represent and that pride goes with that,\u201d he told News 9.\n\nSchoenberger said he served with pride for more than 30 years as an officer with Oklahoma City police, before opening COPS Products, a supply store for first responders.\n\nNow, he's fallen victim to a crime he investigated countless times; burglary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dishonorable act committed by somebody who is unwilling to adhere to a strict code of ethics. That\u2019s what bothers me the most,\u201d Schoenberger explained.\n\nThe police report said it happened late Wednesday night.\n\nSomeone apparently broke through the front door, and took their hammer to the glass cases inside.\n\nSchoenberger said they stole binoculars, flash lights and knives.\n\nSome of the pocket knives have images of police badges on them from Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and Edmond police.\n\nBut Schoenberger said no uniforms or guns were taken. The police report said the hammer was left behind.\n\nIt was a bold a desperate move to steal from those helping service men and women keep the community safe.\n\n\u201cIf you take it upon yourself to do it, you might oughta come in and just turn yourself in because you will be found soon,\u201d he assured those responsible.\n\nShoenberger said his surveillance cameras caught a person and vehicle that night. He is in the process of turning that footage over to police.\n\nIf you have any information, call Oklahoma City police at 235-7300.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars\u00a0worth of their gear is gone.", "author": "Christy Lewis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31053910/police-supply-store-burglarized-in-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9729070_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars\u00a0worth of their gear is gone.", "title": "Police Supply Store Burglarized In OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9729070_G.jpg", "description": "A store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars\u00a0worth of their gear is gone.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police Supply Store Burglarized In OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "police-supply-store-burglarized-in-okc", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/25", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Burglary, Police", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Burglary, Police"}, "article_summary": "Some of the pocket knives have images of police badges on them from Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and Edmond police.\nIf you have any information, call Oklahoma City police at 235-7300.\nA store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars worth of their gear is gone.\nSchoenberger said he served with pride for more than 30 years as an officer with Oklahoma City police, before opening COPS Products, a supply store for first responders.\nIt is a symbol of the authority that they represent and that pride goes with that,\u201d he told News 9."}
