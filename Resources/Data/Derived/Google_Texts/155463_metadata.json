Ted Cruz, a vocal conservative running for president, will push to expose fellow members of Congress for \u201cexempting\u201d themselves from Obamacare this week, adding sparks to an already-fraught debate over a highway bill that needs to pass by July 31.\n\nMr. Cruz, Texas Republican, will try to force votes on an amendment that would cancel the subsidy lawmakers collect to help cover their insurance costs when they buy plans on an Obamacare exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s a thorny issue for his colleagues, many of whom defend the subsidy as the equivalent of the arrangements most businesses have with their employees. But Mr. Cruz and a cadre of fellow senators argue that Obamacare is different, and lawmakers have given themselves a sweetheart deal no other exchange customers enjoy.\n\nSEE ALSO: Scott Walker: \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 if being gay is a choice\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress retain their illegal exemptions from Obamacare, and it\u2019s time to end the Washington favors that have gone on for far too long,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\nThe wrinkle is that the fight would happen on an unrelated bill to renew the federal highway fund, which would otherwise expire at the end of the month, shutting down road projects across the country.\n\nConsidered a must-pass bill, the highway legislation is already attracting the interest of lawmakers who want to tack their own priorities onto it.\n\nSEE ALSO: Watchdog finds potential for fraud in Obamacare subsidies\n\nIn addition to Mr. Cruz\u2019s Obamacare fight, some senators have said they\u2019ll force a vote to revive the Export-Import bank. Still others, including Mr. Cruz, want to have a fight over federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nHis Obamacare exemption push may be one of the thorniest, though.\n\nUnder Obamacare, members of Congress and their official staffers lost their generous federal health plans and are instead required to buy insurance on the exchanges. But the administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management decided in 2013 that lawmakers and staffers who use the D.C. small-business exchange can still get their employer subsidies to cover premiums.\n\nRegular Americans who buy plans through the exchange are restricted from having employers contribute to their premiums.\n\nThe disconnect plays into Mr. Cruz\u2019s claims there is a \u201cWashington cartel\u201d of lawmakers and lobbyists who put their own interests first. It\u2019s also the type of elbow-throwing that\u2019s won him support from conservative quarters and scorn from centrist GOP colleagues who said his anti-Obamacare strategy led them into a 16-day shutdown in fall 2013.\n\n\u201cHe never is going to win the most popular legislator award so it makes more sense for him to play to outside constituencies and go after unpopular perks,\u201d said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAnything that challenges special privileges is going to be popular with voters.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Cruz signaled he might actually buy an Obamacare plan because his wife, Heidi, decided to take an unpaid leave of absence from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Houston, as the senator runs for president. But instead, his family decided to purchase an off-exchange plan on the open market from Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nOther lawmakers have bought coverage in exchanges in their home states, shunning the subsidy. And still others have insurance unrelated to their jobs.\n\nThe issue is a sensitive one, since it involves lawmakers\u2019 personal finances and health decisions.\n\nFor years Sen. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, led a one-man crusade to expose lawmakers who take the employer subsidy.\n\nBut Mr. Vitter is a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee that wrote the highway bill, and is reluctant to see it slowed by unrelated fights. Instead, he will reintroduce standalone legislation Tuesday that prohibits lawmakers from getting the employer subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Obamacare exemption represents a level of arrogance from Congress and D.C.\u2019s elite that fundamentally undermines our nation\u2019s government of the people, by the people, and for the people,\u201d Mr. Vitter said.\n\nEach of the GOP senators running for president \u2014 Mr. Cruz, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 voted earlier this year for a non-binding amendment to the budget to stop the subsidy.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress shouldn\u2019t get a benefit while hardworking Americans have to pay full freight for their health insurance,\u201d Cruz campaign spokesman Brian Phillip said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of fundamental fairness and Americans deserve to know where the candidates for any federal office, Congress or the presidency, stand on it.\u201d\n\nCongress needs to pass a highway funding bill before the end of the month, when the federal government will no longer be able reimburse states for their road projects. The House passed a short-term extension of the highway trust fund through Dec. 18 to buy time to negotiate a six-year deal this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
