In this challenge, PLF represents the California Building Industry Association (CBIA) \u2014 free of charge.\n\n\n\nSan Jose\u2019s ordinance requires developers of 20 homes or more to dedicate 15 percent for city-designated buyers at below-market prices. Alternatively, a builder must pay a fee, estimated by the city itself as $122,000 for each unit that would otherwise have to be dedicated for the inclusionary housing program.\n\n\n\nAs argued in PLF\u2019s petition for certiorari, received this morning by the U.S. Supreme Court, this costly demand constitutes an \u201cexaction\u201d in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ban on uncompensated takings of private property, because it singles out homebuilders to turn over a property interest to underwrite a government program \u2014 a below-market housing program \u2014 which the entire community should be responsible for funding.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court truncates U.S. Supreme Court property rights precedents\n\nUnder established U.S. Supreme Court precedents against takings \u2014 including PLF\u2019s landmark victories in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District \u2014 demands for property or money as a condition of a land use permit must be tied to some societal need created by the building project. Yet San Jose has not even tried to show that the construction of market-rate housing creates a need for additional below-market units. For this reason, a Superior Court struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, that ruling was reversed on appeal, and in June the California Supreme Court upheld the reversal, affirming San Jose\u2019s ordinance. It did so by announcing arbitrary exceptions and limits to Nollan\u2019s and Koontz\u2019s reach and application, exempting San Jose\u2019s inclusionary housing permit conditions from any requirement that they relate to impacts from the builders\u2019 projects.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the ruling suggested that government could shield a permit condition from meaningful takings scrutiny, simply by asserting that the condition is intended to serve some general public purpose, and not to mitigate for the building project\u2019s impacts. The ruling also suggested that a condition could escape takings review if it could be characterized as a land use regulation or restriction \u2014 even though the condition invalidated in Nollan (a requirement to set aside property as a public access easement) amounted to a land use restriction. The ruling also held that the Nollan line of takings cases does not apply to permit conditions enacted through legislation rather than ad hoc, by regulators; yet the easement condition invalidated in Nollan was an application of a general coastal commission policy, and courts in other parts of the country have rejected the legislation/ad-hoc-regulation distinction in applying Nollan review.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court gives politicians a roadmap around constitutional prohibitions on unjust land use conditions\n\n\u201cThe California Supreme Court\u2019s ruling carves arbitrary limits and loopholes in core constitutional property rights safeguards as laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney Brian Hodges. \u201cThat is why this case should be accepted by the justices \u2014 because the integrity of their fundamental property rights precedents is under assault.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe California Supreme Court has given politicians and regulators a road map for evading the constitutional ban on unjust land use conditions,\u201d Hodges continued. \u201cAll they have to say is that the condition isn\u2019t meant to be a mitigation measure. With those magic words, they\u2019re free from having to tailor and limit the condition so that it responds to some need created by the proposed project. In other words, they\u2019re allowed to do precisely what the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ban on takings is meant to forbid: exploit property owners by forcing them to fund community programs and political wish lists that, in all fairness, should be funded by taxpayers as a whole.\u201d\n\nPLF and CBIA appeal on behalf of property rights \u2014 and housing affordability for California families\n\n\u201cThe state Supreme Court\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t just subvert constitutional property rights principles, it also, ironically, contributes to the housing affordability crisis,\u201d said PLF Senior Staff Attorney Tony Francois. \u201cPenalizing homebuilders with more costs and mandates deters the creation of more housing, and raises the overall cost of market-rate homes. In short, the ruling from which we\u2019re appealing will make it even harder for average families to afford a home in California.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case is California Building Industry Association v.
