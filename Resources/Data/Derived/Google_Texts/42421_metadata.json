Andy Barr won his first re-election campaign in Kentucky's 6th congressional district, defeating challenger Elisabeth Jensen.\n\n\"Tonight is a victory for those who want to change the direction of our country,\" Barr told supporters on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Tonight is not about me,\" he said. \"'We the people': that is what tonight is about.\"\n\nBarr defeated Democratic Congressman Ben Chandler in 2012 in a district that was redrawn to favor Democrats. In his first term, Barr sponsored bills that would have imposed term limits and reduced politicians' pay if they failed to cut spending.\n\n\"[This election] was really about holding Washington accountable, about fiscal responsibility and about getting the American people - especially the people of central and eastern Kentucky - back to work, to create more opportunities for jobs and upward mobility for all of our people,\" Barr said.\n\nBarr commended Jensen for what he called an \"important\" debate of ideas during the campaign.\n\nJensen, the president of an education nonprofit in Lexington, garnered attention for running radio ads against Barr for voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She was one of the few Democratic candidates in a Republican-leaning state to try that strategy.\n\nIn an email sent to her supporters on Tuesday night, Jensen vowed to continue to fight for the issues she outlined during the campaign.\n\n\"While we weren't successful tonight, we sent a strong message that we want our issues considered - like jobs, health care, education, protections for our seniors, and fair pay,\" Jensen said.\n\n\"I will be here in Central Kentucky, working with you to make our communities stronger, healthier, and smarter,\" Jensen said. \"I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and keep working.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican U.S. Rep.
