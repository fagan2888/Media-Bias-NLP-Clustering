Indeed, a recent analysis in nine states with large rural populations found that 7.2 percent closed their obstetrics units between 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe closures are largely due to small hospitals feeling the funding pinch, particularly in states where Republican governors have refused to expand Medicaid coverage. Obstetrics units are expensive to operate and some rural hospitals may see fewer than 100 deliveries per year.\n\nA 2015 study by iVantage Health Analytics analyzed more than 2,000 rural hospitals nationwide, and found that nearly 300 of those were in danger of shutting down altogether. In order to face the challenging times ahead, rural hospitals need trustees who are forward-thinking and who understand the real nature and magnitude of the shakeups taking place in the healthcare industry.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the KHN article\n\nRelated articles:\n\nRural health crisis: 4 ways hospitals can beat the odds [Special Report]\n\nRural healthcare crisis: 13% of rural hospitals could close\n\nRural hospitals ally with bigger providers to weather financial crisis\n\nRural health crisis: Hospital survival may depend on trustees who understand industry shakeups\n\nForward-looking boards of directors critical to rural hospitals' health\n\nWhy it's vital to integrate rural hospitals into value-based payment programs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some rural hospitals are being forced to close their labor and delivery units as they cut costs in order stay afloat, according to a report published by Kaiser Health News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Some rural hospitals are being forced to close their labor and delivery units as they cut costs in order stay afloat, according to a report published by Kaiser Health News.", "title": "Rural health in crisis: Hospitals close labor and delivery units", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/rural-health-crisis-hospitals-close-labor-and-delivery-units/2016-02-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "hospital closures,Labor And Delivery,Operations & Business Management,rural health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Some rural hospitals are being forced to close their labor and delivery units as they cut costs in order to stay afloat.\nTo learn more:- read the KHN articleRelated articles:Rural health crisis: 4 ways hospitals can beat the odds [Special Report]Rural healthcare crisis: 13% of rural hospitals could closeRural hospitals ally with bigger providers to weather financial crisisRural health crisis: Hospital survival may depend on trustees who understand industry shakeupsForward-looking boards of directors critical to rural hospitals' healthWhy it's vital to integrate rural hospitals into value-based payment programs\nObstetrics units are expensive to operate and some rural hospitals may see fewer than 100 deliveries per year.\nAround 500,000 women give birth in rural hospitals each year, but access to reproductive health services is declining, according to the article.\nA 2015 study by iVantage Health Analytics analyzed more than 2,000 rural hospitals nationwide, and found that nearly 300 of those were in danger of shutting down altogether."}
