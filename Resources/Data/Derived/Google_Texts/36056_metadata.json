He said of Woolard: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know me because she quit on the job long before she had a chance to know me. She quit two years into her job as president of the city council. She decided to give up on the city she loves. I\u2019m not willing to do that.\u201d Woolard resigned her post in an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\nLamar Willis, incumbent\n\nhttp://hlamarwillisforatlanta.com/\n\n\n\nParty Affiliation: Democrat\n\nTotal budget: $200-250,000. As of Sept. 30, Willis had raised $87,910 and has $45,089.24 cash on hand, according to the state ethics commission.\n\nEndorsements to date: Mayor Kasim Reed, AFSCME Union, Rev. Walter Kimbro, Rosel Fann\n\nAs the incumbent, why should LGBT people continue to support you being in office?\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender voters should support because I have a track record of supporting the LGBT community; not with just words, but with action. Most recently, I voted in support of Councilmember Alex Wan\u2019s legislation supporting same sex marriages and have always advocated for equal benefits for same sex couples. I was also the author of legislation creating the Citizens Review Board which protects all residents, but particularly LGBT residents, from being mistreated or discriminated against by law enforcement.\n\nIf you review my record on LGBT issues, you will see a record of someone who believes in equity for all of our citizens no matter their sexual orientation. So there is no guesswork as to what side of the issue I will be on when it comes to the LGBT community!\n\nYou did receive a favorable rating from Georgia Equality which then decided to take that back and fully endorse your challenger. What was your reaction to that news?\n\nI was disappointed with the news, but respect their decision. The fact remains that I have always supported Georgia Equality and the LGBT community. As an incumbent whose support for the LGBT community has never wavered, I would have hoped that I had earned a conversation with Georgia Equality prior to their decision. Unfortunately, there was no attempt to understand how or why that happened. No matter who they lend support, if re-elected I will always advocate for equal rights, equal treatment, and equal access for all citizens, no matter their sexual orientation, race, or religious affiliation.\n\nMany allegations of corruption have been labeled against you and you were recently disbarred. What do you say to voters upset with these developments and could in turn vote for someone else?\n\nI take serious issue with any allegations of corruption. Any such claims are false and a gross misrepresentation of my challenges. There were mistakes made that have been contrary to rules of registering a nonprofit in Georgia and my failure to respond to an official complaint. My disbarment is directly tied to my failure to respond while going through a very difficult time in my personal life.\n\nFurther more, I ask voters to judge me by my work on council, not my missteps away from council. I have a 12-year record on council to be judged. Look at how I voted in support of marriage equality. Look at how I stood with community\u2019s to fight against unwanted developments like the proposed big box along the Eastside of the Beltline or Family Dollar in SW Atlanta.\n\nJudge me by how I worked shoulder to shoulder with Mayor Reed to increase our city\u2019s reserves from $7 million to over $126 million, or how I worked with this mayor to increase our police force to 2000 officers for the first time.\n\nTypically when I have the opportunity to explain the circumstances behind my mistakes along with my record on council, I retain and often gain supporters.\n\nWhat has been your involvement with the LGBT community?\n\nMy office has been and will continue to be an ally of the LGBT community. I have marched in the Gay Pride Parade, sponsored and hosted annual welcome receptions for gay pride weekend, and have been an ardent supporter of those issues that are important to Georgia Equality over the course of my three terms.\n\nI have worked with Councilmember Alex Wan, his predecessor and others to promote and support all legislation calling for equal treatment of our city\u2019s LGBT residents and employees.\n\nI have long recognized the great contributions the LGBT community makes to our city. To that end, I will continue to support and advocate for those issues that impact the LGBT community\u2019s quality of life.\n\nWhat are the two most important challenges all residents in your city face in the next two years? What do you propose as solutions to these challenges?\n\nOne of the most important challenges facing our city faces is turning around our education system. While that does not fall directly under the purview of the city, our school system has an enormous effect on our local economy, crime, and overall quality of life. I think in the next term, it is important that the city strengthen its relationship with Atlanta Public Schools and partner with APS on programs that keep our children mentally and physically active in a productive way. We have already taken steps by re-opening all of our recreational facilities, but we need to find ways to attract more children to them and expand our programming.\n\nUnder the city\u2019s purview, the two biggest challenges facing our residents are public Safety and economic development.\n\n\n\nImproving public safety is also a major challenge for the city, which is why I joined the mayor in his efforts to increase the city\u2019s police force to 2,000 officers, which is the largest level in our city\u2019s history. Our efforts, along with my council colleagues have led to an 18 percent decrease in violent crime and the lowest murder rate in nearly 50 years.\n\nOur police for is also more involved on the community level with the Community Oriented Police (C.O.P.S) unit. We\u2019ve also hired two police LGBT liaisons to focus on issues specific their needs. If re-elected, I will continue invest in our public safety to not only increase police presence, but make sure that these resources are used effectively.\n\nAtlanta was hit particularly hard by the great recession because of our large construction industry. We are gradually recovering, but continuing our progress is extremely important. I created the Downtown Development Technical Advisory Group to help look at ways we can bring economic development and residents to our downtown core. The group consists of business, civic, and community leaders with a vested interest in downtown, who will develop a set of recommendations for the city.\n\nI will continue to work with this group, as well as future advisory groups so that we can find opportunities to put all of our residents back to work in a way that doesn\u2019t discriminate against any individual.\n\nGiven that LGBT residents make up nearly 11 percent of Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District (encompassing Atlanta), and the fact that there are roughly 180,000 LGBT residents in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta Metropolitan Statistical Area, please explain how you would work with the Atlanta mayor in order to ensure this diversity is reflected in the leadership roles of your municipality\u2019s non-elected workforce.\n\nMayor Kasim Reed continues to make strides, which I support, to ensure the inclusion of LGBT workers in the city. He recently hired attorney Robin Shahar as his LGBT advisor. Among other things, Ms. Shahar will be tasked with looking at ways that city government can continue to be inclusive of LGBT residents and employees. Ms. Shahar and I have worked together on a number of legislative projects and I am certain we will be able to work effectively together in her new role.\n\nMy office will offer any resources available to us to help Ms. Shahar in her efforts, as well look work with our HR department to determine stamp out any intentional or unintentional discriminatory practices, if there are any. I believe a diverse workplace brings diverse ideas that only enhance an organizations performance.\n\nIf re-elected, in what ways would you serve an advocate for the LGBT community of your municipality through interactions with other governmental bodies, such as the state legislature, the U.S. Congress, and the federal government, particularly on issues sensitive to the LGBT population, including marriage equality, military service, accurate counting in the U.S. Census, and healthcare?\n\nAs an elected official, I believe the most powerful tool I can use to advocate for the LGBT community is with my vote on council. If elected, I will continue to vote in support of issues such as marriage equality, equal health benefits, accurate Census counting, and military service. I will also support any resolutions at the council level that encourages other governmental agencies to adopt LGBT friendly legislation.\n\nAnd while I believe my vote is my strongest advocacy tool, if anyone from the LGBT community felt it would be beneficial for me to participate in vocal manner, I would be open to doing so.\n\nIf re-elected, in what ways would you advocate support for people living with HIV/AIDS?\n\nAs a former board member of the NAMES Project Foundation, the international caretaker of The AIDS Memorial Quilt, I am an ardent advocate for people living with HIV/AIDS. While human services does not fall under the city\u2019s charter, I will work with Mayor Reed\u2019s administration in identifying resources from private industries to assist non-profits and other organizations that support individuals living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nIf re-elected, in what ways would you advocate for increased support, housing and services for transgender individuals?\n\nAs a council member, I would solicit the expertise of organizations like Georgia Equality, possibly HUD, and the Atlanta Housing Authority, to find out what some of the best practices are in supporting housing services for transgender individuals. By doing so, we could then look our legislative options for the city to assist transgender individuals needing housing options.\n\nWould you appoint openly-LGBT individuals to local boards and commissions?\n\nI would absolutely appoint openly LGBT individuals to local boards and commissions. Since serving on council, I have voted to appoint board members of all ethnicities and sexual orientation.\n\nDo you support a policy of dealing with transgender sex workers that include supporting organizations working with the population to provide housing, substance abuse treatment, job training and assistance, and HIV prevention? Specifically, how would you deal with the\u201dbanishment\u201d law proposed?\n\nI recognize that there are numerous reasons why someone becomes a sex worker. As an elected official, I believe that it is in the best interest of that individual, as well as our city to find productive means to help them out of this situation rather than incarceration or banishment. It is not just good policy, but it is right morally. For those reasons, I definitely support policy the help organizations that work to save the lives of transgender sex workers.\n\nAndre Dickens\n\nhttp://andredickens.com/\n\n\n\nOccupation: Assistant Director, OMED Educational Services \u2013 Responsible for outreach programs such as the 5-week summer bridge program for incoming freshmen called Challenge and the graduate recruitment program called FOCUS. Also responsible for a new targeted initiative of the University System of Georgia \u2013 the African-American Male Initiative (AAMI).\n\nParty affiliation: Democrat\n\nEndorsements to date: Endorsements to date: Georgia Stonewall Democrats, Georgia Equality, former Mayor Shirley Franklin, former City Council President Cathy Woolard, Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, State Senator Vincent Fort, State Representative Ronnie Mabra, International Brotherhood of Police Officers Local 623, Atlanta Professional Firefighters IAFF Local 134, Communication Workers of America/AFL-CIO Local 3204, Atlanta Progressive News, former Councilwoman Anne Fauver, former Councilwoman Debi Starnes, former State Representative Ralph Long, Joe Beasley \u2013 Rainbow Push Coalition, Ben Johnson III retired managing partner at Alston & Bird, Elaine B.

What does that mean to you?\n\nAs a long-time supporter of full equality for LGBT persons, I am thrilled to receive the endorsement of Georgia Equality. It means a great deal to receive the consideration and then endorsement from an organization that works consistently to advocate for the LGBT community, and as an Ally to the community I will continue to push for equality and inclusion for all the people of Atlanta including LGBT persons.\n\n\n\nWhat has been your involvement with or within the LGBT community?\n\nI have been an active supporter and contributor to organizations such as Georgia Equality. In my position at Georgia Tech, I frequently act on behalf of LGBT students in matters of inclusion and diversity within the campus community and as a public ambassador for promoting a diverse, welcoming environment for all.\n\nWhat are the two most important challenges all residents in your city face in the next two years? What do you propose as solutions to these challenges?\n\nJob creation and retention continues to be a major focus for our city as we work our way out of the recession. As the City of Atlanta continues to strive to be the preferred place to start and own a business, we must take care of our existing businesses as well as our local entrepreneurs by ensuring advocacy for and access to the myriad of local, state and federal programs available to small business owners. By increasing the job opportunities at all levels, we can continue to lift the individuals who are more experienced, while also filling positions for less-skilled workers.\n\nIn addition to creating jobs, making sure that there is equitable access to these new opportunities is also important. Workplace equality is not only good for business; it\u2019s good for Atlanta. I will also advocate for programs to help our unskilled workers acquire a pathway out of perpetual poverty by equipping them with training and knowledge. If we invest in the future and help people by giving them the tools to break prior trends, I believe our entire community will benefit. Rising tides lift all boats.\n\n\n\nLooking long-term, job creation/retention also means ensuring Atlanta\u2019s children have access to a world-class education. If we have a strong school system, I believe employers will be more apt to bringing good paying jobs to the market. As a father, I want more for my children than I had for myself.\n\n\n\nThe second issue is higher ethics in government. My opponent has proven to have numerous ethical challenges. It is time for us to no longer tolerate unethical behavior \u2013 in any form. Some may argue that there are no absolutes, but to me, as a public servant the bottom line is about acknowledging right from wrong \u2013 even in so called, gray areas. You are either trustworthy or not. Ethics requires knowing difference between what you \u201ccan do\u201d by virtue of position, and what is \u201cright to do\u201d then acting appropriately.\n\n\n\nAs stewards of the public\u2019s trust, I believe the onus is on elected officials to avoid conflicts of interest and comply with all ethics codes and regulations. I strongly support upholding the code of ethics that was strengthened in 2002 by Mayor Shirley Franklin. There are certainly many honest public servants in Atlanta and if elected, I plan to be one of them.\n\n\n\nWhat have LGBT residents discussed as being some of their concerns with Atlanta?\n\nMany of their key issues are similar to issues for the population at-large including public safety, ethics and job creation. In addition to these main issues, many would like to see the liaison position that has been created between the Atlanta Police Department and the LGBT community to continue and broaden particularly in efforts of two-way communication between the APD and the LGBT community.\n\nOther concerns have been ensuring that appointments to city commissions and councils be inclusive of members of the LGBT community which I have pledged to do, and that I continue to promote fairness and equality for LGBT individuals in every aspect of the council\u2019s business to affordable housing, homelessness, teen and at-risk youth programs and other such initiatives of the city council.\n\n\n\nWhy should LGBT voters support your candidacy?\n\nI have a long history of promoting diversity, fairness and access for LGBT persons, and in me the LGBT community will have a very strong ally on the City Council who can be depended upon to do the right thing with concern, thoughtfulness and integrity.\n\n\n\nGiven that LGBT residents make up nearly 11 percent of Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District (encompassing Atlanta), and the fact that there are roughly 180,000 LGBT residents in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta Metropolitan Statistical Area, please explain how you would work with the Atlanta mayor in order to ensure this diversity is reflected in the leadership roles of your municipality\u2019s non-elected workforce.\n\nContinuing open communication with the mayor, the city council president and the individuals and leaders in the LGBT community will be a key effort of my work as a member of the City Council. I will provide an open ear and a strong advocacy for members of the LGBT community in both listening to concerns of everyone and pushing for diversity and inclusion in the City\u2019s workforce, contracting and appointments.\n\n\n\nIf elected, in what ways would you serve an advocate for the LGBT community through interactions with other governmental bodies, such as the state legislature, the U.S. Congress, and the federal government, particularly on issues sensitive to the LGBT population, including marriage equality, military service, accurate counting in the U.S. Census, and healthcare?\n\nAgain, open dialogue, serving as a liaison for all Atlantans, and maintaining relationships with other elected officials will be a key part of my work on the city council. I will be a resource for members of the LGBT community who need an open and honest representative and ambassador not just on the Council, but in City government as a whole and interactions between Atlanta and our affiliated elected officials.\n\n\n\nI have years of experience both as a business leader and a community organizer in establishing relationships between elected officials, government agencies, private institutions, academia and other organizations such as non-profits and neighborhood associations and NPUs. I will leverage this experience and my connections as an elected official to push for full equality and fairness for all members of my City including the LGBT community.\n\n\n\nOn Marriage Equality: I fully support marriage equality and will actively and vocally stand with members of the council and the LGBT community.\n\nOn Military Service: The repeal of Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell was a major milestone in equality for our brave men and women and their partners and families. I fully support the efforts of the DoD in including domestic partners and married LGBT couples in benefits and rights that should absolutely be afforded to LGBT persons and their loved ones who serve our country.\n\nOn a state level, I believe the governor and leaders in our National Guard should follow the lead of the DoD and extend full benefits to married LGBT couples and their families.\n\nOn US Census: It is vitally important that education in the LGBT community continue the importance of the LGBT community in the Census and that all members of Atlanta\u2019s diverse community be counted and included in this information. I will fully support and help with any efforts in this regard.\n\nOn healthcare: While many health concerns are the same for the LGBT community and all communities in Atlanta, the LGBT community has many unique challenges as well. I full support the efforts of organizations like Project Open Hand and Positive Impact in providing unique care services, and I absolutely will be an public advocate for ADAP funding and other key funding and education programs specifically impacting the LGBT community.\n\n\n\nIf elected, in what ways would you advocate support for people living with HIV/AIDS?\n\nI would advocate for equal treatment in all matters such as housing and access to health care. I support increased funding for ADAP and will work alongside Georgia Equality and other organizations in this matter.\n\n\n\nIf elected, in what ways would you advocate for increased support, housing and services for transgender individuals?\n\nMaintaining open dialogue and routine interaction with leaders and policy makers at Atlanta Housing Authority will be a key part of my advocacy for increased support for transgender individuals. This would also apply to any contractors and vendors who receive funding and grants from the city for housing and services. I can be a very effective voice for those who cannot or are unable to speak for themselves, and I would be proud to advocate for fairness and support for transgender persons.\n\n\n\nWould you appoint openly-LGBT individuals to local boards and commissions?\n\nAbsolutely. Atlanta is blessed to have such a diverse and talented and active LGBT community, and it would be my honor to promote and appoint these members to public positions and community boards and commissions.\n\nDo you support a policy of dealing with transgender sex workers that include supporting organizations working with the population to provide housing, substance abuse treatment, job training and assistance, and HIV prevention? Specifically, how would you deal with the \u201cbanishment\u201d law proposed?\n\nAbsolutely. This is a crisis that is often overlooked in the increasing market of human trafficking, and I would be honored if I could help in any way\u2013 including support of a collaborative, comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying issues, which often fuel prostitution.\n\nSpecific to SOAP, in spite of the policies initial intentions, I believe it does not afford equitable treatment to LGBTs under its current form. Recently, I had an extensive conversation with a transgendered woman who was quite outspoken in her views on several policies, like SOAP, that impact the LGBT community. We agreed that regardless of any individual\u2019s personal views, there must be equality in the legal system. This includes equitable, fair treatment and a balanced approach to ensuring that the LGBT community is not unlawfully targeted and subject to discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nCitizens of Atlanta, both LGBT and straight, have expressed concern that an LGBT perspective is represented at the mayor\u2019s office and on the council, and that the system of advocates or advisors continues. I would work to make this so. As part of this effort, many are also encouraged by the liaison position with the City of Atlanta Police Department. I would like to see this effort continue to receive support and look forward to working with the LGBT community to fight for true equality and to protect the gains made to date.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "andre dickens, atlanta, city council, lamar willis, lgbt, lifestyle, culture, gay georgia, gay atlanta, gay georgia news", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Voice - Gay & LGBT Atlanta", "description": "Allegations of fraud followed by being disbarred by the state Supreme Court has Atlanta City Council Post 3 At-Large incumbent Lamar Willis facing an uphill battle to hold onto the seat he's held since 2001.
