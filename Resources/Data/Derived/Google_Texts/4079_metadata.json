The 6% add-on is recognized as payment for a physician\u2019s resource costs and overhead.\n\nThe formula, mandated by the Affordable Care Act, was designed to reduce or eliminate the financial incentive to prescribe the biologic with the higher ASP, typically the reference product, according to Covington and Burling lawyers writing in the National Law Review .\n\nReed also told us that the statute \u201cdoes not require CMS to combine ASPs for multiple biosimilars of the same reference product. The Biosimilars Forum strongly believes that a scenario for payment that blends biosimilars into the same payment group/ASP would be very detrimental to the adoption of biosimilars. Such a decision would not foster a sustainable or vibrant biosimilar market.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If each biosimilar to a reference product doesn\u2019t get a different HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) code, providers \u201cmay not be confident that they they will receive appropriate payment,\u201d Juliana Reed, President of the Biosimilars Forum, told BioPharma-Reporter.com.", "copyright": "William Reed Business Media", "author": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "og": {"site_name": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "description": "If each biosimilar to a reference product doesn\u2019t get a different HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) code, providers \u201cmay not be confident that they they will receive appropriate payment,\u201d Juliana Reed, President of the Biosimilars Forum, told BioPharma-Reporter.com.", "title": "Biosimilars Forum says CMS coding issues could discourage US biosimilar adoption", "url": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/Biosimilars-Forum-says-CMS-coding-issues-could-discourage-US-biosimilar-adoption", "image": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/biosimilars-forum-says-cms-coding-issues-could-discourage-us-biosimilar-adoption/9942100-1-eng-GB/Biosimilars-Forum-says-CMS-coding-issues-could-discourage-US-biosimilar-adoption_medium_vga.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "biopharma-reporter.com", "description": "If each biosimilar to a reference product doesn\u2019t get a different HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) code, providers \u201cmay not be confident that they they will receive appropriate payment,\u201d Juliana Reed, President of the Biosimilars Forum, told BioPharma-Reporter.com.", "title": "Biosimilars Forum says CMS coding issues could discourage US biosimilar adoption", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "biopharma-reporter://Markets-Regulations/Biosimilars-Forum-says-CMS-coding-issues-could-discourage-US-biosimilar-adoption"}, "name": {"iphone": "BioPharma-Reporter"}, "id": {"iphone": "id1023356457"}}, "site": "@BioPharmaReport", "image": {"src": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/biosimilars-forum-says-cms-coding-issues-could-discourage-us-biosimilar-adoption/9942100-1-eng-GB/Biosimilars-Forum-says-CMS-coding-issues-could-discourage-US-biosimilar-adoption_medium_vga.png"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "CEC8ACB0DB9777352167906B78F1EF96", "fb": {"admins": 100000722238608}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "keywords": "biopharmaceutical manufacturing, development, biopharmaceutical process, upstream production, downstream processing, upstream processing, biologics", "verify-v1": "WHomov305bLuKa7U4ALUYG/IcW/V1/nBXyagl4I9gR0=", "news_keywords": "biosimilar payments, Medicare Part B, CMS, biosimilars"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d63\"", "article_summary": "The Biosimilars Forum strongly believes that a scenario for payment that blends biosimilars into the same payment group/ASP would be very detrimental to the adoption of biosimilars.\nThe newly created, industry-led Biosimilars Forum is seeking to raise new awareness around issues related to the biosimilars industry, and member companies include all of the leading biosimilar developers, such as Hospira, Amgen, Pfizer and Samsung.\nReed also told us that the statute \u201cdoes not require CMS to combine ASPs for multiple biosimilars of the same reference product.\nThe latest issue for the group centers on Medicare Part B coding and payment policy suggestions for CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services).\nIf each biosimilar to a reference product doesn\u2019t get a different HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) code, providers \u201cmay not be confident that they they will receive appropriate payment,\u201d Juliana Reed, President of the Biosimilars Forum, told BioPharma-Reporter.com."}
