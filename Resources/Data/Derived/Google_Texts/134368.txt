Sandcreek Drive at East 49th Avenue in Denver was shut down in both directions at about 6 p.m. after a crash involving a minivan and a box truck.

Three children were transported to a hospital with minor injuries and all are doing OK, according to the Denver Police Department. One person was transported with non-life threatening serious bodily injury.

The accident was caused because the box truck was driving out of turn — violating right of way — and its driver will be cited with careless driving resulting in serious bodily injury, Denver Police Department said.
