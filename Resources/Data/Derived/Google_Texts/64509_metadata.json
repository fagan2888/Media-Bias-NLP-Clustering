We have engaged a broad array of issues including public management, health care, transportation, infrastructure, energy, budgeting, campaign finance, marijuana, elections, immigration, transparency, the environment, financial regulation, labor, LGBT rights, and more. In a system facing so many policy needs, our mission to examine problems and offer solutions is quite broad.\n\nSome of our proposals have made their way into legislation, elected officials\u2019 rhetoric, media coverage of policy and politics, and ongoing work inside and outside of Brookings. At the same time, much work remains. As we launched FixGov, Congress was at war over whether to fund the government. Less than a week after our inaugural post, the government shut down for seventeen days. In 2013, the sticking point in the funding legislation was whether to fund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPast is, of course, prologue, as the saying goes. As we pop corks to celebrate our blog\u2019s second birthday, we also shake our heads, as our Congress once again barrels toward another shutdown\u2014once again over healthcare-related funding, but this time involving Planned Parenthood of America. Political grandstanding, heated up by election season politics, has left us with the prospect of a legislative branch unwilling to let the executive branch keep the lights on.\n\nAnd so, we continue our work, indebted to the 108 individuals who have authored or co-authored blog posts for us and the hundreds of thousands of people who have clicked on our pages more than 1.2 million times. Even if the government shuts down, the lights stay on at the Brookings Institution, and we\u2019ll continue to deliver content on a variety of topics.\n\nAs always, we thank you for your readership, and welcome any and all feedback at FixGov@brookings.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years ago this week, the Center for Effective Public Management launched FixGov\u2014\u201ca blog focused on mending broken government and heralding smart governance solutions.\u201d", "title": "FixGov\u2019s 2nd birthday & the prospect of another government shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Two years ago this week, the Center for Effective Public Management launched FixGov&mdash;&ldquo;a blog focused on mending broken government and heralding smart governance solutions.&rdquo;&nbsp;", "title": "FixGov\u2019s 2nd birthday & the prospect of another government shutdown", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2015/09/25-fixgov-anniversary-hudak", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/c/ca%20ce/capitol_dome_fireworks_025/capitol_dome_fireworks_025_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two years ago this week, the Center for Effective Public Management launched FixGov&mdash;&ldquo;a blog focused on mending broken government and heralding smart governance solutions.&rdquo;&nbsp;", "creator": "JohnJHudak", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/c/ca%20ce/capitol_dome_fireworks_025/capitol_dome_fireworks_025_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "title": "FixGov\u2019s 2nd birthday & the prospect of another government shutdown", "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 151106990}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "title": "FixGov\u2019s 2nd birthday & the prospect of another government shutdown", "topicsspecialized": "Political Leadership ; U.S. Congress ; U.S. Politics", "topicsbroad": "Politics and Elections ; U.S. Government", "centers": "Center for Effective Public Management", "experts": "John Hudak", "programs": "Governance Studies", "authors": "John Hudak", "contentdate": "2015/09/25 10:45:00", "researchactivities": "Center for Effective Public Management ; Governance Studies", "topics": "Politics and Elections ; U.S. Government ; Political Leadership ; U.S. Congress ; U.S. Politics"}, "keywords": "government, fix government, solutions, dysfunction, polarization, shutdown, congress, president, obama", "article": {"tag": "U.S. Politics", "published_time": "2015-09-25", "modified_time": "2015-9-25", "author": "John Hudak"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd45c\"", "article_summary": "We have engaged a broad array of issues including public management, health care, transportation, infrastructure, energy, budgeting, campaign finance, marijuana, elections, immigration, transparency, the environment, financial regulation, labor, LGBT rights, and more.\nFixGov has cast a wide net discussing everyday politics in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches and in the states.\nIn a system facing so many policy needs, our mission to examine problems and offer solutions is quite broad.\nSome of our proposals have made their way into legislation, elected officials\u2019 rhetoric, media coverage of policy and politics, and ongoing work inside and outside of Brookings.\nPolitical grandstanding, heated up by election season politics, has left us with the prospect of a legislative branch unwilling to let the executive branch keep the lights on."}
