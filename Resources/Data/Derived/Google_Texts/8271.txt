During the American Music Awards this year, rapper Waka Flocka Flame made an appearance in a Pine Brothers commercial advertising throat lozenges — and made it pretty clear that he was aiming at weed smokers who might want to soothe their scratchy throats after taking several hits of pot.

The video was shared 45,000 times just minutes after it aired, pretty much stealing the show. But due to the weed innuendos, the commercial has been banned by NBC and CBS — because it not-so-subtly encourages smoking weed. In the commercial, Waka sits alone on a couch, surrounded by what is seemingly weed smoke. “Can’t live without my Pine Brothers… Straight up,” he says, holding up several bags of Pine Bros Cough Drops.

“So next time you need sore throat relief” — here Waka pauses, glancing down at the apparent weed smoke coming from his hand-held blunt, “for whatever reason, take your Pine Brothers.”

The 28-year-old rapper is notorious for his pot use, especially when he tweeted about hiring a personal blunt roller who’d be paid $50,000 a year. “All resumes must be sent on a rolling paper or blunts,” he tweeted. Later, comedian and actor Seth Rogen got the job as his blunt roller.

Originally, Pine Brothers had planned to have Martha Stewart in the commercial, but decided to drop her for Waka instead. “We just like to change up our creative every year, and Waka couldn’t be more different,” Pine Brothers spokesman David Roach said. “We got a lot of pushback from NBC and CBS. They’re in the Stone Age, because there is nothing offensive about the ad.”
