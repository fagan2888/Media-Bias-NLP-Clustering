Still time to sign up for Jan. 1 health coverage

In addition to the new deadline for Affordable Care Act sign-ups, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last week announced other changes to help people with enrollment and to maintain coverage without a gap.

There is still time to sign up for 2014 health insurance through the federally run state insurance marketplace, http://www.healthcare.gov . People enrolling through the marketplace, also called an exchange, now have until Tuesday, Dec. 23 to enroll in coverage effective Jan. 1, 2014.

These included the requirement that people enrolled in the federal Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan be allowed to extend that coverage for a month through the end of January. Another requirement was that insurers accept premium payments from subscribers through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace/exchange as late as Dec. 31 for coverage starting Jan. 1. Subsequent to the government edict, several insurance companies have agreed to extend the first premium payment to Jan. 10, 2014, in order to facilitate the process.

Celebrate Healthcare, a Peninsula health advocacy group, and the Urban League of Hampton Roads are conducting two more insurance enrollment events with hands-on help from certified application counselors. Last week's event in Virginia Beach drew more than 250 people, "and the website was working," reported organizer Gaylene Kanoyton.

• 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Saturday, Dec. 21, at Ivy Baptist Church, 50 Maple Ave., Newport News.

• 4:30 to 7 p.m., Monday, Dec. 23, at the YWCA South Hampton Roads, 5215 Colley Ave., Norfolk.

The events are free and open to the public. For information, call Gaylene Kanoyton, 757-287-0277 or email celebratehealthcare@gmail.com.
