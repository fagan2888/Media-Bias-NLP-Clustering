Potential tenants can walk two blocks to the Metro and arrive on Capitol Hill in under 20 minutes.\n\nThe office space wraps around the entire fifth floor of a 13-story building with windows lining the outer walls, allowing natural light to pour into the roughly 30 rooms Brockhaus is hoping to fill.\n\nHe plans on transforming the space into a full-service co-working platform, providing administrative amenities from office basics to a media room where tenants can record audio and video.\n\nBrockhaus said those shared services will allow individuals and organizations from varied industry and professional backgrounds to focus their time on impacting constituents to a greater extent while pushing their message out.\n\n\u201cWe spend so much of our time at work that I want a place where people feel productive while advancing the movement,\u201d Brockhaus said. \u201cThis is the place where you go to get out of the coffee shop, get out of your basement, and come network.\u201d\n\nAfter working as a bond trader at Edward Jones on the bustling trade floor in St. Louis for three years, Brockhaus noticed that the physical environment helped shape a positive atmosphere where employees worked collaboratively and efficiently.\n\nHe brought that insight to Washington, D.C., in 2003, where he first became involved in the conservative movement. He was drawn to the potential of physical operations after working at The Heritage Foundation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He saw how the organizations were able to use their resources and events to promote a cause.\n\n\u201cBut what I noticed is that smaller organizations in the movement don\u2019t have those resources,\u201d Brockhaus said. \u201cThey are in tiny office shares, or they are at someone else\u2019s place borrowing space. They are not maximizing their time in the office, and they don\u2019t have the resources that a large, well-funded organization has.\u201d\n\nAs co-working spaces for tech firms and business groups began to trend across the United States, Brockhaus decided he would start his own office share incubator geared specifically toward conservatives.\n\nHe went to his former colleague, Becky Norton Dunlop, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s vice president for external relations, who immediately became his counselor throughout the process.\n\n\u201cHe knows that I\u2019m a big advocate for supporting young entrepreneurs and conservatives,\u201d said Dunlop, the strategic adviser for Red Sycamore Group.\n\n\u201cIt just struck me as something that the business world has found that works and that maybe if conservatives worked together in a shared office arrangement that included some mentoring opportunities, it would be good for the movement.\u201d\n\nDunlop\u2019s connectivity across D.C. and within the conservative movement has given Brockhaus the access needed to elevate his brand.\n\nBut Dunlop said there are two big challenges Brockhaus will have to overcome.\n\n\u201cConservatives tend to like to buy buildings. This is not buying a building, so I think that will be a challenge,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other, she continued, is that while many people have expressed interest in the concept, every organization has a budget it has to work with along with particular needs that have to be met, \u201cso everyone is going to have to sit down with Rob and say, \u2018What do you offer, what\u2019s the cost\u2019 and see how that works for them.\u201d\n\nRed Sycamore Group will offer 31 offices ranging in size, along with a number of cubicles and communal tables. Private offices will begin at a base of $2,000 a month, while a cubicle will likely be priced around $500, and an open desk from $200 to $250.\n\nBrockhaus said the range in office size and space gives groups the ability to scale up and scale down, depending on their needs at any given time.\n\nUltimately, he hopes the space will provide an environment where conservatives can meet people they would not have otherwise met while coming together to advance liberty-focused policies.\n\n\u201cSome of my best friends are people that I met while working\u2014you\u2019re in the trenches together, you\u2019re trying to beat a deadline. People will form lasting relationships here, so it is a community, not a network,\u201d he said.\n\nRed Sycamore Group will host its first open house Nov. 4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rob Brockhaus wants to bring conservatives under one roof, where Wi-Fi, printing and ideas are collectively shared and like-minded individuals can connect.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Rob Brockhaus wants to bring conservatives under one roof, where Wi-Fi, printing and ideas are collectively shared and like-minded individuals can connect.", "title": "The Conservative Movement\u2019s First Co-Working Space", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151030_RedSycamore_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T06:27:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Wm4l0e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Rob Brockhaus wants to bring conservatives under one roof, where Wi-Fi, printing and ideas are collectively shared and like-minded individuals can connect.", "title": "The Conservative Movement\u2019s First Co-Working Space", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151030_RedSycamore_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "founding principles", "published_time": "2015-11-02T22:55:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T06:27:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Red Sycamore Group, Rob Brockhaus, office share, co-working, Becky Dunlop, The Heritage Foundation"}, "article_summary": "Come March 1, freelancers, small non-profits, and liberty-oriented businesses will have the opportunity to do just that in Brockhaus\u2019 newly launched Red Sycamore Group, the conservative movement\u2019s first shared office.\nHe brought that insight to Washington, D.C., in 2003, where he first became involved in the conservative movement.\n\u201cAnyone can get office space; that\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d Brockhaus said.\n\u201cWe spend so much of our time at work that I want a place where people feel productive while advancing the movement,\u201d Brockhaus said.\nRed Sycamore Group will host its first open house Nov. 4."}
