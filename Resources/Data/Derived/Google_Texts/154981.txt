Whether you're a fan of the teams on the field or not, Super Bowl Sunday is typically a day celebrated by all football fans. But some Packer fans are less than enthused this year.

All day the snow has been falling and the wind has been blowing. Perhaps this recent storm is a sign that Mother Nature is just as disappointed as many Packer fans in Wisconsin.

Joe Baumann with the VFW Post 7591 recalls, "We were watching the NFC Championship game and near the end of the game, the Packers were so far ahead, people started to leave and all of a sudden it took a turn for the worst."

For those that haven't blocked that game out of their memory, you'll recall there was a lot of nail-biting and disbelief in the end.

Baumann adds, "We figured they were dead to us, so we decided we would have a funeral lunch for the Super Bowl instead of celebrating the Super Bowl like we really wanted to."

In a dark bar, with a few friends and some cold drinks. It seems appropriate enough for fans that could almost taste a Super Bowl berth.

Baumann says, "Oh, we're taking it with stride, we're getting pretty excited about the Puppy Bowl right now, so it is what is, we got to make do somehow. There's always next year, you bet."
