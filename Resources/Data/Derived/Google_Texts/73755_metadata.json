So she knows a thing or two about long-term patient care.\n\nAs Americans live longer, more are suffering from multiple chronic health conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, cancer and heart disease. Care of chronic conditions accounts for 75% of U.S. health-care spending, according to the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease.\n\nMarketWatch contributor Kristen Gerencher recently sat down with Sweet to discuss what the country can learn from the almshouse system, the cost-effectiveness of \u201cslow medicine,\u201d and how to handle the tensions that can arise when caring for the chronically ill.\n\nMarketWatch: Almshouse is a word that has almost fallen out of our vocabulary.\n\nVictoria Sweet: They were how we used to take care of the sick poor before there was health insurance. There would be a county hospital that was essentially free; anybody could go. That would be for the acutely ill, and then there would be an almshouse for everyone else. The almshouse would usually be a great big old place at the edge of a city, usually on many acres of land.\n\nDr. Victoria Sweet\n\nThat\u2019s where the homeless were, the mentally ill, and sometimes pregnant, unmarried women. It used to be that in America every county pretty much had a county hospital that was free and a county almshouse, and that\u2019s where you went if you didn\u2019t have any place else to go. Interestingly enough, they didn\u2019t do means testing. So if you were rich, you could show up.\n\nIt worked pretty well, but it wasn\u2019t a fair system and it wasn\u2019t an equal system. In the \u201950s, all the almshouses in the country started to be closed for reasons, from the left, of justice \u2014 because they were unequal \u2014 and for reasons, on the right, of economy \u2014 they were pretty expensive. Almost all the almshouses were closed except for Laguna Honda, and Laguna Honda was originally called the San Francisco Almshouse.\n\nI believe that the county hospital and the county almshouse system is a very efficient system for taking care of the sick poor. It\u2019s not just, and it\u2019s not equal, but you know what? It\u2019s adequate. I think what we need to start looking at is what\u2019s adequate.\n\nMW: You make an argument that all the focus on efficiency has actually made medicine less efficient.\n\nVS: A study just came out that ER docs now spend 43% of their time on electronic health records inputting data and 28% seeing patients. That\u2019s just ridiculous. The ER doc is spending almost half the time just sitting there inputting data? That\u2019s insanity. Part of it has been all the documentation. It turns out electronic health records were sold to us as being more efficient, but they\u2019re actually less efficient \u2014 if by efficient you mean how much time do I have left to spend with you, examining you, and how much time am I spending filling out forms. That whole thing has shifted.\n\nI\u2019m defining efficient as you pay for me. How many patients can I take care of well?\n\nIf I have enough time to take care of patients, my experience at Laguna Honda tells me, I order many fewer tests, I get the right diagnosis, and I use many fewer medications.\n\nI\u2019d have patients that I would just schedule on a regular basis to see for maybe 10 minutes every month or two because that\u2019s what kept them on the right track. It kind of kept things from turning into an emergency \u2014 emergencies are expensive.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole model for this that\u2019s been going on, which is this concierge model, direct patient care model. All the data is being generated right now with doctors who have dropped out and are taking only the number of patients that they can do a good job with.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of obvious. You send your kid to a private school and they\u2019ve got eight students and tutoring. Are they going to do better? Yeah.\n\nMW: I can\u2019t help thinking the benefits of the concierge model are somewhat oversold \u2014 that the benefits are more for the doctor: a less hurried lifestyle, fewer forms. Don\u2019t doctors try to pick the patients that are the healthiest to begin with?\n\nVS: What we need is a concierge practice for the sick poor. Let\u2019s do that for two years and see what data we get. The really sick patients, let\u2019s give them the doctors they need and enough time.\n\nI do believe in a capitalist system. I believe if we can show the insurance companies that it is cheaper to do it this way than that way, they will pile on. So let\u2019s take the hardest patients, let\u2019s take the sickest patients, and give them their own doctor.\n\nMW: With the Affordable Care Act, are you optimistic that the poor will receive better care?\n\nVS: I thought Obama\u2019s original idea of how to do health reform was really brilliant and I think that\u2019s what we should do still. I think we should exchange the entire Affordable Care Act for the following: If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you can buy into Medicare. I averaged it out. If you take the sum total cost of Medicare and divide it by the number of people getting Medicare, it works out to about $800 a person a month, which is basically what my health insurance costs. I mean, many Americans have health insurance that they like, so leave them alone. If you want health insurance, let\u2019s let you buy into Medicare. If you have the money, you can just buy into it for $800 a month. And if you don\u2019t have it, we kick in subsidies from the government.\n\nMedicare is already in place. It\u2019s like a sick body: Use what still works. That was Obama\u2019s original idea, and I thought that was genius. Don\u2019t create any new programs. Take what works and expand it. That\u2019s what I would do.\n\nMW: You mentioned the idea of open wards and the danger of too much solitude. What do you mean by that?\n\nVS: Part of it is the difference between being acutely ill and being chronically ill. If you\u2019re chronically ill, and you need to be in for months or years or even weeks and you\u2019re stuck in a private room and you can\u2019t get out, it is so lonely. It\u2019s not good for patients. We have a really interesting comparison now. I\u2019m not working at Laguna Honda, but I visit my patients there now and then and it\u2019s fascinating because they were in the old one and now in they\u2019re new one and they say it is so much lonelier.\n\nI counted the last time I visited one of my patients \u2014 I had to go through 12 doors to get to her. She has M.S. and she\u2019s in an electric wheelchair and that means to get out, she\u2019s got to go through 12 doors. I mean, she has to ask 12 different people. So she never goes out of her room anymore.\n\nMW: Another problem that comes up a lot is the balance between fall prevention and exercise, allowing people to move \u2014 because if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s deadly, and if they do, sometimes it\u2019s deadly. How do you split the difference?\n\nVS: I\u2019ve heard a lot about that from the therapists, the physical therapists and occupational therapists. It makes them insane. That\u2019s a big problem. What happens is that administrators, understandably, don\u2019t want a fall, because that\u2019s what they get nailed for. They don\u2019t get nailed for someone who gradually deteriorates because they\u2019re not getting any exercise. When you make everything punitive, then the nurses and the certified nursing assistants and everybody is going to lean on the side of no falls, and they\u2019re going to be very nervous when a patient wants to get up. The more staff you have, the better it is, and the less staff you have, the worse it is.\n\nWhen anybody I know goes into the hospital, anybody I love goes into the hospital, I go with them. I meet everybody, and I talk to everybody, and I check things out and keep an eye on things. In a chronic setting, it\u2019s much harder, but I still do that as much as I can. Just go by and check things out and make friends with the nurses and have an open heart to them. If you go in there with your magnifying glass and want to look at everything, they\u2019re going to look at you and go, \u201cYour great-grandfather is not the person I\u2019m going to let stand up when he wants to stand, because if he falls or breaks something here, my ass is grass.\u201d So you also have to respect that the world\u2019s not perfect. Where do you place freedom vs. safety?\n\nMW: What about the chronic-care aspect? Would you prefer that your loved one fall while attempting to exercise, or would you prefer not to have them risk it? Should there be a philosophical agreement between parties?\n\nVS: In reality, I would hope that the doctors and nurses would know that and do that. We\u2019d have those discussions. Once you get to know someone and they\u2019re in a chronic-care setting, if they have family, the family comes in and you can figure that out. They come in and say, \u201cHow much exercise is my husband getting? How come last time I was here he was just in that position and just in that chair and what\u2019s that thing around him?\u201d The care-giver can say, \u201cThis is why and how do you feel if we give him more? We don\u2019t have somebody there all the time.\u201d\n\nMy mom\u2019s frail and I know she\u2019s going to fall eventually. I just don\u2019t know when \u2018eventually\u2019 is. Eventually hasn\u2019t been for 87 years.\n\nMW: She\u2019s living independently?\n\nVS: My dad\u2019s 91 and the two of them are just really amusing people. They still live by themselves and manage. They have somebody now who drives for them and stuff like that.\n\nI\u2019m just waiting for the call, but what\u2019s the opposite? If she sat in one place, she\u2019d get a bed sore way sooner than she\u2019s going to fall. So don\u2019t fall, Mom. That\u2019s what we say. She\u2019s smart enough. She\u2019s not demented. It\u2019s the dementia picture that gets confusing.\n\nMW: If you could give patients one or two pieces of advice for improving their health care this year, what would it be?\n\nVS: I would like a patient when they meet me to assume that I have their best interests at heart. Meet me halfway on that. Deal with me the way you want me to deal with you. It\u2019s a relationship between the two of us.\n\nI\u2019d like my patients to really enjoy the life they have. Do not get caught in what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s all time-limited. Don\u2019t worry so much about what you eat. Just enjoy it. I tell my patients who smoke, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you smoke. All I ask is you enjoy every single thing about your cigarette.\u2019 Opening the pack, getting that first one out. Because if you do enjoy it, you can\u2019t smoke two packs a day.\n\nSit down, enjoy your friends and enjoy your life. That\u2019s what I really would like for people.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"site": {"id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV817_pfvict_MG_20140303170552.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Focusing on efficiency make doctors less efficient, says Dr. Victoria Sweet."}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Kristen Gerencher", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-04T08:26:00-05:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/everything-modern-medicine-gets-wrong-2014-03-04", "author": "Kristen Gerencher", "parsely-title": "Everything modern medicine gets wrong", "description": "Focusing on efficiency make doctors less efficient, says Dr. Victoria Sweet.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Focusing on efficiency make doctors less efficient, says Dr. Victoria Sweet.", "title": "Everything modern medicine gets wrong", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/everything-modern-medicine-gets-wrong-2014-03-04", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV817_pfvict_MG_20140303170552.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV817_pfvict_MG_20140303170552.jpg"}, "article.id": "E3954492-A322-11E3-AA57-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf431\"", "article_summary": "If she sat in one place, she\u2019d get a bed sore way sooner than she\u2019s going to fall.\nI believe that the county hospital and the county almshouse system is a very efficient system for taking care of the sick poor.\nVictoria Sweet: They were how we used to take care of the sick poor before there was health insurance.\nI mean, many Americans have health insurance that they like, so leave them alone.\nBefore there was health insurance, there were almshouses \u2014 county hospitals for the chronically ill, available to anyone."}
