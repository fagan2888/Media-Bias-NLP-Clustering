A new Gallup survey finds those federal workers have it pretty good \u2014 or better than the rest of the workforce, at least.\n\nGallup found that 44 percent of federal workers are \u201cthriving\u201d financially, compared with 34 percent of all other workers. Another 39 percent of government employees were classified as \u201cstruggling\u201d \u2014 a rate that, while high, is still three percentage points lower than for non-government workers. Gallup found that 17 percent of federal workers are \u201csuffering\u201d financially, compared with 24 percent of other workers.\n\nRelated: America's 21st Century Challenge \u2014 Restoring Faith in Government\n\nGallup says its measure of financial well-being goes beyond simply asking about salary and benefits to factor in more subjective answers about perceived standards of living, affordability of basic necessities and financial anxiety. The results are colored by the region of country respondents live in, their family size, cost of living, debt and other factors, Gallup\u2019s Jessica Mangskau and Steve Ander wrote in detailing the survey findings.\n\n\u201cThese data show that federal employment is likely associated with higher levels of economic stability and reductions in the stress of providing for a comfortable lifestyle because federal workers report higher financial well-being,\u201d Mangskau and Ander wrote.\n\nRelated: Americans Are About to Get a Nice Fat Pay Raise\u200b\n\nThe pollsters noted that federal pay has been a subject of debate in recent years \u2014 and it\u2019s an increasingly critical question now as the federal workforce will soon face a significant brain drain, with 31 percent of government employees eligible for retirement by 2017. Civilian federal employees saw their pay frozen from 2011 through 2013, and got 1 percent raises the follow two years. President Obama has proposed a 1.3 percent pay increase for federal employees in his 2016 budget and called for expanding federal health benefits and allowing six weeks of paid family or parental leave.\n\n\u201cThe last several years have been challenging for the federal workforce,\u201d the White House budget said, warning that budgetary spending caps for next year and beyond \u201cwill make it increasingly challenging for the federal government to keep pace with the private sector, especially in hard to recruit fields, both in terms of pay and in areas such as training.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Federal Agencies in the GOP\u2019s Crosshairs\u200b\n\nBut Gallup found that \u201cfederal employees consistently have higher financial well-being,\u201d even compared to non-federal workers with the same household income or similar levels of education, suggesting that the lifestyle benefits, job security or other factors in government work help reduce financial stress and provide a stronger overall sense of well-being. In short: It\u2019s not just about the money.\n\nGallup\u2019s figures were based on more than 80,000 interviews with American ages 18 and older who had full-time jobs. The interviews were conducted in the 12 months through Feb. 15.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government is America\u2019s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million worke", "title": "Why Federal Workers Are Better Off Than the Rest of Us", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/05/Why-Federal-Workers-Are-Better-Rest-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062013_govworkers_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/05/Why-Federal-Workers-Are-Better-Rest-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062013_govworkers_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal government is America\u2019s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million worke", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4fe\"", "article_summary": "A new Gallup survey finds those federal workers have it pretty good \u2014 or better than the rest of the workforce, at least.\nGallup found that 44 percent of federal workers are \u201cthriving\u201d financially, compared with 34 percent of all other workers.\nGallup found that 17 percent of federal workers are \u201csuffering\u201d financially, compared with 24 percent of other workers.\n\u201cThese data show that federal employment is likely associated with higher levels of economic stability and reductions in the stress of providing for a comfortable lifestyle because federal workers report higher financial well-being,\u201d Mangskau and Ander wrote.\nCivilian federal employees saw their pay frozen from 2011 through 2013, and got 1 percent raises the follow two years."}
