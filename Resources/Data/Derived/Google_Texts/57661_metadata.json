But after almost a month of distributing it to more than 15,000 pharmacies across the nation, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says the drug will still be subjected to the same rules as other pseudoephedrine drugs, even though its makers say that it\u2019s very difficult to make methamphetamine with their product.\n\nCommon methods for making methamphetamine wouldn\u2019t work with Zephrex-D, Westport officials told the Associated Press. The \u201cone pot\u201d and \u201cshake-and-bake\u201d methods, which involve mixing pseudoephedrine drugs with other ingredients in a bottle would result in a gooey substance rather than meth\u2019s signature crystal structure. The company says that although meth can be produced in small quantities in actual labs, the yield would be so small that it would drive up the cost to between $250 and $500 per dose \u2014 almost 20 times the street value of the drug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not economically feasible for the meth-maker to use this product,\u201d Jason Grellner, narcotics enforcement commander in Franklin County, Mo., told the AP.\n\nStill the DEA says that government chemists were able to manufacture meth from Zephrex-D, and therefore, should be sold behind the counter like other pseudephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine drugs under the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. Under the law, retail of these drugs are limited to a certain daily and monthly amount, and customers must also show identification, after which their names are logged into tracking databases.\n\n\u201cDEA commends the efforts of companies to develop products that deter the production of illicit drugs,\u201d DEA Spokesman Rusty Payne said in a statement. \u201cWhile this particular company claims that their \u2018drug delivery system provides a new and unconventional approach to combat drug misuse,\u2019 this product can still be utilized to manufacture methamphetamine.\u201d\n\nMethamphetamine production has grown exponentially over the past few years. In 2011, there were a reported 10,287 meth lab incidents, 39 percent more than in 2008. Missouri started selling Zephrex-D before any other state because it holds the record for most meth lab incidents \u2014 there were 1,825 in 2012 \u2014 followed by Tennesse, at 1,585 incidents.\n\nMeth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It increases dopamine levels in the brain, which results in feelings of euphoria. However, abusing the drug can lead to reduced motor skills and impaired verbal learning, as well as severe structural and functional changes in areas of the brain associated with memory and emotion, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "crystalmeth, meth, methamphetamine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, zephrexd, chemists, westport, dea,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although the makers of Zephrex-D claim it's just \"not feasible\" for meth-makers to use their drug, the DEA is still halting all over-the-counter sales.", "title": "DEA Halts OTC Sales Of Zephrex-D; Use In Meth Production Still Possible", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-halts-over-counter-sales-cold-and-allergy-drug-zephrex-d-use-meth-production-still-possible", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/meth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although the makers of Zephrex-D claim it's just \"not feasible\" for meth-makers to use their drug, the DEA is still halting all over-the-counter sales.", "title": "DEA Halts OTC Sales Of Zephrex-D; Use In Meth Production Still Possible", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-halts-over-counter-sales-cold-and-allergy-drug-zephrex-d-use-meth-production-still-possible", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/meth.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/meth.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-09-10T17:52:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T17:53:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although the makers of Zephrex-D claim it's just \"not feasible\" for meth-makers to use their drug, the DEA is still halting all over-the-counter sales."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcfd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDEA commends the efforts of companies to develop products that deter the production of illicit drugs,\u201d DEA Spokesman Rusty Payne said in a statement.\nSt. Louis pharmaceutical company Westport started distributing the cold and allergy decongestant Zephrex-D to Missouri pharmacies in December.\nCommon methods for making methamphetamine wouldn\u2019t work with Zephrex-D, Westport officials told the Associated Press.\nIn 2011, there were a reported 10,287 meth lab incidents, 39 percent more than in 2008.\nMissouri started selling Zephrex-D before any other state because it holds the record for most meth lab incidents \u2014 there were 1,825 in 2012 \u2014 followed by Tennesse, at 1,585 incidents."}
