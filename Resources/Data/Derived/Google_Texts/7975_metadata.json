The computer\u2019s IP address allegedly led investigators to Hernandez.\n\nProsecutors said undercover agents also traced suspected child pornography being shared online to Leonardo\u2019s IP address.\n\nInvestigators executed search warrants at both men\u2019s homes and seized their computers.\n\nBoth Hernandez and Leonardo are charged with distributing and possessing child pornography and criminal use of a communication facility.\n\nBoth suspects were released from jail after posting 10 percent of $25,000 bail. Each man is next due in court April 17 for a preliminary hearing.\n\nPolice also took into custody 25-year-old Samuel Askinas, of Downington, who allegedly used at least two online programs to search for \u201cpreteen hardcore\u201d pornography.\n\nProsecutors said a search of Askinas\u2019 computer turned up about 100 child pornography videos, as well as nearly 700 more videos that were in the process of downloading.\n\nIn addition, the sting resulted in the arrests of David Burke Sr., 60, of Altoona; Charles Weiher, 67, of Shaler; Edward Campion Jr., 41, of Charleroi; Justin Sells, 32, of North Versailles and Dane Blood, 30, also of North Versailles.\n\nEach suspect is charged with multiple counts of possessing child pornography and related offenses.\n\nSuspected Internet predators in Pennsylvania can be reported to the attorney general by calling the child predator hotline at 1-800-385-1044.\n\nContact Alex Wigglesworth at 215-854-2305 or awigglesworth@philly.com.
