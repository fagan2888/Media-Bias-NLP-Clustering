It was a short term relationship, and once again an Eastern Carolina hospital is without a partner.

Lenoir Memorial Hospital has decided to break off a partnership with Novant Health.

Novant was selected back in January after a year long process.

The hospital says both sides decided to end the management agreement in September, while LMH says it may revisit pursing a partnership with another hospital group in the future.

Hospital CEO Gary Black will again become an LMH employee.

The hospital says they do plan to contract with speciality consulting firms to assist with the some specific areas of the hospital.
