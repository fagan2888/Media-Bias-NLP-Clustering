The Hilltoppers averaged 374.3 passing yards per game last year, second in the nation in FBS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a great place to be as a quarterback, a great atmosphere,\u201d said Duncan, who also had offers from Appalachian State, Western Carolina, Towson and Cornell, as well as interest from Yale and Harvard.\n\n\u201cThey are one one of the top passing teams in the country, and to be able to sling the ball around 45 times a game is a dream come true.\u201d\n\nWestern Kentucky\u2019s coach is former Louisville quarterback Jeff Brohm. Under his tutelage, WKU quarterback Brandon Doughty passed for 4,830 yards and 49 touchdowns, and was named MVP of Conference USA.\n\nAt Western Kentucky, Duncan will be able to play against his stepbrother, Vanderbilt tight end Kyle Anderton. The two teams will play each other in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThat was another big reason,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWestern Kentucky plays big Division I schools all the time. We play Alabama my freshman year, have a three-year deal with Vandy and play Indiana and LSU.\u201d\n\nDuncan threw for 2,589 yards and 29 touchdowns for Ashley Ridge last season, and said he wanted to make his commitment before his senior season.\n\n\u201cI wanted to commit and be able to focus on being the best quarterback, the best teammate and best overall player I can be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my last year in high school, and I want to try to do great things for this team, be be best teammate I can for these guys.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ashley Ridge QB Steven Duncan commits to Western Kentucky, Sports, \r\nSportsHigh School, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Ashley Ridge High,Steven Duncan", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "With 17 offers to choose from and a few more pending, Ashley Ridge quarterback Steven Duncan had no shortage of college options.", "title": "Ashley Ridge QB Steven Duncan commits to Western Kentucky", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150801/150809877/ashley-ridge-qb-steven-duncan-commits-to-western-kentucky", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809877/AR/0/AR-150809877.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809877/AR/0/AR-150809877.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With 17 offers to choose from and a few more pending, Ashley Ridge quarterback Steven Duncan had no shortage of college options.", "title": "Ashley Ridge QB Steven Duncan commits to Western Kentucky", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809877/AR/0/AR-150809877.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150809877}}, "keywords": "Ashley Ridge QB Steven Duncan commits to Western Kentucky , Sports, \r\nSportsHigh School, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Ashley Ridge High,Steven Duncan", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T16:29:45Z", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T16:29:00Z", "author": "Jeff Hartsell"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "With 17 offers to choose from and a few more pending, Ashley Ridge quarterback Steven Duncan had no shortage of college options."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d21\"", "article_summary": "The 6-5, 230-pound senior made his decision on Saturday, verbally committing to Western Kentucky of Conference USA.\nAt Western Kentucky, Duncan will be able to play against his stepbrother, Vanderbilt tight end Kyle Anderton.\nThe reason -- Duncan is a quarterback, and Western Kentucky loves to throw the football.\nWith 17 offers to choose from and a few more pending, Ashley Ridge quarterback Steven Duncan had no shortage of college options.\n\u201cWestern Kentucky plays big Division I schools all the time."}
