This compares with 68,561 in 2001. During that same decade, half a million registered nurses and 90,000 licensed practical nurses joined the ranks of the employed.\n\n\n\n[BROWSE: Top Graduate Nursing Schools]\n\nSome predict that such high growth will saturate the nursing job market down the road. The Department of Health and Human Services projected that by 2025, the U.S. could have more professionally trained nurses than jobs in that field.\n\nThe report predicts a national surplus of hundreds of thousands of nurses; its model shows that 16 states will have a shortage of registered nurses and 22 states will have a shortage of licensed practical nurses by that time.\n\nHHS officials said the job model does not account for other factors. For example, while it takes into account an increase in those insured under the Affordable Care Act, the model does not predict how having insurance might change the way people seek and receive treatment in coming years.\n\nNurses began pouring into the workforce in the early 2000s in part because of looming job vacancies created by impending baby boomer retirements. At the same time, the federal government began putting more money into nursing education, according to Dr. Peter McMenamin, senior policy fellow at the American Nurses Association.\n\nNursing education programs are authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama have increased Title VIII funding significantly, from $65.6 million in 2000 to a peak of $243.9 million in 2010.\n\n\n\n[READ: Best Jobs: Registered Nurse]\n\nAs Title VIII funding remains high and the number of nursing graduates continue to increase, some in the field worry about a saturation of the job market.\n\n\u201cThis is what has led to conjecture about, \u2018Are we producing too many nurses or not enough nurses?\u2019\u201d McMenamin said in a phone interview.\n\nMcMenamin said that workforce projections are complicated by how far into the future analysts attempt to look. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, predicts a continued shortage of nurses into 2022.\n\nThe retiring boomers, people moving into Medicare and Obamacare coverage, and a resurgent economy cloud the picture, he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the assumptions are not very different, but with such a large base and the 10-year timeframe, it\u2019s compound interest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes a big difference in your projections.\u201d\n\nAt Johns Hopkins, Griffin said that more students are seeking out the school\u2019s accelerated nursing programs to fill needs that the Affordable Care Act has created. \u201cWe have seen a significant increase in nurse practitioners,\u201d Griffin said.\n\n\n\n[BROWSE: The 36 Top Health Care Jobs of 2015]\n\nStudents are entering Hopkins programs saying, \u201cWhere I\u2019m working right now \u2026 they need NPs,\u201d she said.\n\nA nurse practitioner has a graduate degree and is qualified to perform certain treatments without the supervision of a doctor. Nurse practitioners may be the primary care providers in places such as drugstore clinics, for example.\n\nGriffin says prospective students should not rule out a nursing career. \u201cI think there\u2019s just a really good energy, and I would encourage people to jump in.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for African American and white women in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Nursing programs remain popular but professionals are unsure if the market is slated for growth or saturation.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Haley Hinkle", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Nursing programs remain popular but professionals are unsure if the market is slated for growth or saturation.", "title": "Nursing Workforce Continues to Grow, but Profession\u2019s Future Is Uncertain", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/03/20/nursing-workforce-continues-to-grow-but-professions-future-is-uncertain", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/69/ac0425c7b5a1baa79320189502ad9f/29953FE_DA_120619_nurse-laptop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nursing programs remain popular but professionals are unsure if the market is slated for growth or saturation.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Nursing Workforce Continues to Grow, but Profession\u2019s Future Is Uncertain - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-03-20", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/0a42c96/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F69%2Fac0425c7b5a1baa79320189502ad9f%2F29953FE_DA_120619_nurse-laptop.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "nurses,nursing programs,education,employment,LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Johns Hopkins University,Haley Hinkle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-03-20"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z7ttmo", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "nursing, education, jobs, employment, registered nurses"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8982\"", "article_summary": "[BROWSE: Top Graduate Nursing Schools]Some predict that such high growth will saturate the nursing job market down the road.\nAvailable nursing jobs are on the rise due to economic changes and retirements, experts say.\nChanges in the economy and the retirement of hundreds of thousands of baby boomers will contribute to a growing number of available nursing jobs, they say.\n[BROWSE: The 36 Top Health Care Jobs of 2015]Students are entering Hopkins programs saying, \u201cWhere I\u2019m working right now \u2026 they need NPs,\u201d she said.\nNursing education programs are authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act."}
