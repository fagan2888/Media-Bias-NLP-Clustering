Similarly, Baylor Scott & White Health is working on an agreement to become part of the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s national cardiology network.\n\nMeanwhile, Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp., one of the nation\u2019s largest for-profit hospital companies, is busy collaborating across the country.\n\nIn El Paso, it is partnering with Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center to build a new hospital. In Connecticut, it has formed a partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System. And in Arizona, it is talking with two not-for-profit Catholic health systems about a joint venture.\n\n\u201cToday, things are happening that we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter said.\n\nIndustry leaders foresee continuing consolidation through mergers and acquisitions as well as other types of alliances. Last year, Tenet acquired Nashville-based Vanguard Health Systems Inc., and Baylor Health Care System merged with Temple-based Scott & White Healthcare.\n\nScale \u2014 the right scale \u2014 is more important than ever, industry experts say. Providers want to maximize benefits from investments in technology and expertise and offset emerging risks as they take responsibility, in some cases, for the health of entire workforces of companies.\n\n\u201cThe future is collaboration and partnerships,\u201d Baylor CEO Joel Allison said.\n\nMuch of the change accompanies full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which, among other provisions, penalizes hospitals that have excess patient readmissions. As providers become more accountable for the care they offer, they are focusing on keeping patients healthy, not just treating those who are sick.\n\nIn the industry, that\u2019s sometimes called a population health approach.\n\nIt requires a system that offers care from the simplest procedures to the most complex, all performed in the most appropriate, cost-effective settings. There also should be appropriate follow-ups and monitoring, especially for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nAllison called it a continuum of care. \u201cYou may not own it all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you make sure you and your partners agree on quality.\u201d\n\nMore and more, Fetter said, especially in population health, hospital systems have to be able to handle just about everything.\n\n\u201cWhere you get killed is where you get some very expensive cases that go out of your network,\u201d Fetter said.\n\nNate Kaufman is a San Diego-based industry consultant who has worked with Baylor and others. \u201cIt\u2019s all pretty chaotic,\u201d he said of the state of the industry.\n\nHe said smaller hospitals are limping along. Some won\u2019t make it. Larger players are looking at how to connect, and not necessarily through mergers.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not just to be big but to be effective,\u201d he said.\n\nTechnology is accelerating change. Kaufman said it\u2019s possible to do a real-time $49 doctor \u201cvisit\u201d through a smartphone or tablet. The average waiting time at American Well, a Boston company, is two minutes, Kaufman said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of experimentation going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all going to work, but we do need to experiment.\u201d\n\nCooperative agreements come in many forms.\n\nEarlier this summer, Arlington-based Texas Health Resources said it was teaming with CVS on clinics at selected sites here. At the same time, Baylor said it was near similar deals with Walgreens and Wal-Mart.\n\nTwo years ago, THR and Methodist partnered with Louisiana-based LHC Group, a for-profit company, on a venture offering a full range of home health services for North Texas patients.\n\nMethodist CEO Stephen Mansfield described his organization\u2019s new alliance with Mayo, based in Minnesota, as a \u201cclinical collaboration\u201d that will help Methodist and its physicians continuously improve their quality of care.\n\nIn an interview, he said that much of the consolidation and collaboration occurring in the industry is driven by efforts to deliver better patient experiences \u2014 and quality \u2014 at lower prices.\n\n\u201cScale is a key part of the equation,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cYou need sufficient size.\u201d\n\nTenet, with revenue now running at the rate of more than $15 billion a year and with more than 105,000 employees, has 80 hospitals and nearly 200 outpatient centers. As such, the company sees all types of competition.\n\nFetter, the CEO, called California-based Kaiser Permanente the \u201cultimate example\u201d of a population health organization. Kaiser has a large physician group, a comprehensive hospital system and an insurance organization, which helps it bid for employers\u2019 business.\n\nTo better compete with Kaiser in Modesto, Fetter said, Tenet\u2019s lone hospital there partnered with a physician group and Blue Shield of California, trying to mimic the Kaiser model.\n\nThe Tenet accountable care plan in Modesto began in 2012 and has been profitable each year, Fetter said. Member enrollment has grown 20 to 25 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experimenting with all this stuff all over the country,\u201d Fetter said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care providers are teaming up on investments on technology and expertise as the Affordable Care Act takes effect.", "og": {"description": "Health care providers are teaming up on investments on technology and expertise as the Affordable Care Act takes effect.", "title": "Big-name hospitals, retailers, clinics collaborate for cost control", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140910-big-name-hospitals-retailers-clinics-collaborate-for-cost-control.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140910-nb_9mayo1_39685251.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_9MAYO1_39685251.JPG", "height": 490}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-09-11T04:57:53Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-09-11T04:21:58Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Big-name hospitals, retailers, clinics collaborate for cost control\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140910-big-name-hospitals-retailers-clinics-collaborate-for-cost-control.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140910-nb_9mayo1_39685251.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_9MAYO1_39685251.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1910808\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-11T04:21:58Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140910-nb_9mayo1_39685251.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_9MAYO1_39685251.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-09-11T04:21:58Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Last year, Tenet acquired Nashville-based Vanguard Health Systems Inc., and Baylor Health Care System merged with Temple-based Scott & White Healthcare.\nEarlier this summer, Arlington-based Texas Health Resources said it was teaming with CVS on clinics at selected sites here.\nNever has more change come more rapidly to the health care industry.\nThis week, Dallas-based Methodist Health System said it was becoming part of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s nationwide Care Network.\nIn Connecticut, it has formed a partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System."}
