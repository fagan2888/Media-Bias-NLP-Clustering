SOUTH BRUNSWICK A 24-year-old man, who has addresses in Franklin Park and Brooklyn, New York, was arrested and charged in connection with the theft of a pastor's purse, police said.

On June 28, the pastor of Christ the King Church on Route 27 arrived early for the 9:30 a.m. mass and left a bag containing her purse in the church office, Capt. James Ryan said. She did not realize it had been stolen until 6 p.m. when American Express called to let her know someone was trying to use her credit card, Ryan said.

A few days later, police received a report from a person connected to a different church on Sandhill Road, who reported that a man, Nigel Barnes, had come to the church looking for assistance. A member of the church took him in, but grew suspicious, Ryan said.

Detective Eric Tighelaar learned that Barnes had been connected to similar church thefts in Princeton and New Brunswick in the past several months, Ryan said. In some cases Barnes would identify himself as homeless and ask for assistance, while in others he would outright steal purses. Tighelaar was able to link Barnes to the theft from the Route 27 church and using the credit cards at a nearby Stop & Shop.

Barnes was charged with burglary for entering the church to commit a crime and theft for stealing the purse. He was lodged at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick in default of $25,000 bail.

Anyone with information about Mr. Barnes activities can contact Detective Tighelaar at 732-329-4000, ext. 7486.
