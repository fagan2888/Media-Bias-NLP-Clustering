With all the suits, security and cameras following her, you would have thought that President Obama was visiting Tuesday afternoon in what was clearly a highly orchestrated media event to focus on the positive, after so many negative media reports about the Obamacare sign-up process.\n\nSebelius, wearing green, walked through the front doors of North Shore Hospital near Miami Shores where she shook hands with hospital staff and members of the Epilepsy Foundation who are staffing the Obamacare Navigation center housed off the hospital\u2019s lobby. There she met with the team helping South Floridians to sign-up on line or on paper.\n\n\u201cSo she is being helpful,\u201d asked the secretary to a couple sitting at one table of a navigator. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d they responded.\n\nAt a second table, the secretary met Carmen Salero who was trying to sign up online. As the secretary and Salero made small talk, CBS4\u2019s Brian Andrews noticed the site crash on the lap top in front of them.\n\n\u201cThe screen says I\u2019m sorry but the system is temporarily down,\u201d Andrews pointed out. \u201cUh oh,\u201d responded the secretary. \u201cThat happens every day,\u201d said Salerno, \u201cit must mean a lot of people are on there trying to get coverage.\u201d\n\nA throng of cameras and reporters trailed the secretary\u2019s every move in the small room. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bring the Paparazzi,\u201d the Secretary joked as she met Willy Williams of Miami who was working with a navigator to get signed up. \u201cIt went down three times,\u201d said Williams referring to the site, \u201cbut we\u2019re just going to keep trying,\u201d he added.\n\nNick Bianchi, who owns a Social Media Consulting firm on Miami Beach, was selected by HHS to meet the secretary personally based on what he posted on Twitter about his positive experience during the sign up process.\n\n\u201cI selected a silver plan,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThe website didn\u2019t work for me so I ended up waiting on papers from the provider I selected.\u201d Nick told the secretary his new plan, effective January 1st, will run a little more than $300.00 a month. \u201cHearing your situation is really helpful,\u201d the secretary told Bianchi.\n\nLater, at a news conference, Secretary Sebelius told reporters, \u201cThe only way to change the narrative is to change the narrative and get people connected with the coverage they need.\u201d She said that she was told that since Tuesday morning, at least two more South Floridians had successfully signed up for the program. She repeatedly said the government website did not have enough testing before it was launched.\n\n\u201cHad I known then, what I know now, things would have been different,\u201d she added.\n\nIn response to a question from CBS4\u2019s Brian Andrews about what she learned from her visit to South Florida today, the secretary said it\u2019s the frustration so many are feeling.\n\n\u201cThey are frustrated with the web experience they had but they are eager enough to get coverage that they are going to return over and over again.\u201d The secretary went on to say she knows some people out there have just had it. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to have to work really hard to get you to come back,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seven weeks to the day since the troubled healthcare.gov website was launched, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in Miami, meeting with so-called \"navigators\" who are helping the public get signed up for coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/11/19/hhs-secretary-sebelius-visits-south-florida-to-meet-with-healthcare-navigators/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sebelius.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sebelius.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "Seven weeks to the day since the troubled healthcare.gov website was launched, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in Miami, meeting with so-called \"navigators\" who are helping the public get signed up for coverage.", "title": "HHS Secretary Sebelius Visits South Florida To Meet With Healthcare Navigators"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sebelius.jpg?w=640", "description": "Seven weeks to the day since the troubled healthcare.gov website was launched, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in Miami, meeting with so-called \"navigators\" who are helping the public get signed up for coverage.", "site": "CBSmiami", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "HHS Secretary Sebelius Visits South Florida To Meet With Healthcare Navigators"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, health, local, news, politics, syndicated local, brian andrews, carmen salero, epilepsy foundation, healthcare, healthcare.gov, hhs secretary kathleen sebelius, kathleen sebelius, miami shores, nick bianchi, north shore hospital, obama, obamacare, politics, president barack obama, secretary kathleen sebelius, south florida", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "brian andrews, carmen salero, epilepsy foundation, healthcare, healthcare.gov, hhs secretary kathleen sebelius, kathleen sebelius, miami shores, nick bianchi, north shore hospital, obama, obamacare, politics, president barack obama, secretary kathleen sebelius, south florida"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHearing your situation is really helpful,\u201d the secretary told Bianchi.\nAt a second table, the secretary met Carmen Salero who was trying to sign up online.\nMIAMI (CBSMiami) \u2013 Seven weeks to the day since the troubled healthcare.gov website was launched, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in Miami, meeting with so-called \u201cnavigators\u201d who are helping the public get signed up for coverage.\nThere she met with the team helping South Floridians to sign-up on line or on paper.\n\u201cSo she is being helpful,\u201d asked the secretary to a couple sitting at one table of a navigator."}
