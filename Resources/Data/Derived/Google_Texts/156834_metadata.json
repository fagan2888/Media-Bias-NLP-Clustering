You can now buy tampons and pads with a little less tax attached to the purchase.\n\nChicago's city council voted unanimously to remove the 1.25 percent city tax from feminine hygiene products. Granted, women will still pay the 9 percent state and county taxes, but hey, it's a start.\n\nIt's in response to a national effort to eliminate the tax that women are forced to pay to manage a bodily function that men don't have.\n\nOne California assemblywoman did the math on what that tampon tax adds up to statewide. She found that women spend roughly $7 a month for an average of 40 years on hygiene products. That comes out to \"over $20 million annually in taxes.\"\n\nShe recently introduced Assembly Bill 1561, which would end tampon taxes in California.\n\nAnd in early March, five women filed a lawsuit against New York because \"there is no way these products would be taxed if men had to use them.\"\n\nThey argue that products used by both genders \u2014 like Rogaine, adult diapers and dandruff shampoo \u2014 are not taxed, but tampons and sanitary pads, which are a medical necessity for women, are.\n\nChicago is one of the first cities in the nation to get rid of the tax. Illinois legislators are reportedly considering introducing a bill that would remove the tax statewide.\n\nShould Illinois adopt that bill, it would join five other states that have already killed the tampon tax: Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts.\n\nThis video includes footage from Procter & Gamble and an image from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicago joins a small group of cities that have abolished a tax on tampons and sanitary pads under the argument that they are \"medical necessities.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Chicago joins a small group of cities that have abolished a tax on tampons and sanitary pads under the argument that they are \"medical necessities.\"", "title": "Chicago Just Got Rid Of Taxes On Feminine Hygiene Products", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/chicago-just-got-rid-of-taxes-on-feminine-hygiene-products/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458244887.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chicago joins a small group of cities that have abolished a tax on tampons and sanitary pads under the argument that they are \"medical necessities.\"", "title": "Chicago Just Got Rid Of Taxes On Feminine Hygiene Products", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/chicago-just-got-rid-of-taxes-on-feminine-hygiene-products/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1458244887.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=1ldDk0MjE6MWbr3kJk4az3YZQIj_qEc9&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58149", "iphone": "newsy://58149", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58149", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "tampon tax, chicago tampon tax, feminine hygiene tax, chicago feminine hygiene tax, tampon and sanitary pad tax,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458244887.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "One California assemblywoman did the math on what that tampon tax adds up to statewide.\nChicago joins a small group of cities that have abolished a tax on tampons and sanitary pads under the argument that they are \"medical necessities.\"\nChicago's city council voted unanimously to remove the 1.25 percent city tax from feminine hygiene products.\nShe recently introduced Assembly Bill 1561, which would end tampon taxes in California.\nShould Illinois adopt that bill, it would join five other states that have already killed the tampon tax: Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts."}
