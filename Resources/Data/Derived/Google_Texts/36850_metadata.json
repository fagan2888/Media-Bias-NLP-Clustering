(AP) \u2014 The new director of Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange is making a case for keeping the state-run marketplace, as some lawmakers are calling for its demise.\n\nHealthSource RI has served as a model among the state-run marketplaces. Most other states use the federal exchange.\n\nDirector Anya Rader Wallack says Rhode Island can use the state exchange as a tool to innovate and control health care costs in ways it couldn\u2019t if it switched. Gov. Gina Raimondo supports keeping the program in Rhode Island.\n\nBut some say it isn\u2019t worth it. A group of lawmakers, led by Republican Rep. Patricia Morgan, are actively seeking to transfer its operations to the federal government.\n\nMorgan, the deputy minority leader, said she thinks she\u2019ll get support now that the federal contributions to implement the Affordable Care Act are running out. A similar bill didn\u2019t gain traction last session.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a realization out there that this is a luxury Rhode Island taxpayers can\u2019t afford,\u201d she said.\n\nUntil now, the system has been federally funded. The state must partially fund the exchange starting in July and bear the full cost starting Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nIt will cost more than $50 million to operate the exchange this fiscal year, Wallack said. She said there have been problems with the information system, customer service costs and startup costs. She said she plans to spend less on advertising and marketing, and is working to bring the annual price tag below $20 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of money but I don\u2019t think we need to do that in the long run. We really should be able to have an efficient operation,\u201d she told the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce Tuesday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nicholas Mattiello has indicated he\u2019d consider moving to the federal system if the state exchange isn\u2019t cost effective and efficient. Morgan said HealthSource RI is an expensive platform that no one ever figured out how to pay for, other than charging taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThat attitude has to change in Rhode Island,\u201d she said.\n\nThe future of the federal exchange, however, could be in jeopardy. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case this week that challenges insurance subsidies for residents of states that have not set up insurance exchanges. The federal government has awarded about $150 million to HealthSource RI to date and roughly $87 million was spent through 2014, according to the agency.\n\nMore than 30,000 people enrolled for coverage through HealthSource RI for 2015, including about 80 percent of customers who were covered in 2014, according to figures released Thursday. About 10,000 people signed up for the first time and 450 small employers enrolled. The exchange helped thousands of people secure federal tax credits and Medicaid coverage last year.\n\nBut the system has also been plagued by technical glitches. Hundreds of people have been assigned the wrong coverage, charged the wrong amount and enrolled or unenrolled on the wrong date, Wallack said.\n\nWallack said she knows people question why the state should run an exchange, in light of some of the challenges, its cost and the federal alternative. If Rhode Island did switch, there would be an annual fee based on enrollment, in the range of $5 million to $15 million, she said.\n\nFor a \u201ccomparable\u201d price, Wallack said, the state system can provide better plan choices, prices and customer service. She said health care costs can be controlled through the design of the plans.\n\n\u201cWe can use it as a tool to improve Rhode Island\u2019s health system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can make sure it\u2019s responsive to local needs.\u201d\n\nRaimondo\u2019s spokeswoman, Marie Aberger, said the governor is focused on \u201cright-sizing this initiative\u201d by establishing a sustainable, more streamlined budget.\n\nThe position of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce is that the exchange should remain in the state, but its costs need to be significantly reduced and its function should be limited to helping people access federal subsidies and helping small businesses compare plans, said Laurie White, chamber president.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe it is a mechanism to instigate payment reform,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jan Malik said the state isn\u2019t doing a good enough job of running it and the federal government should take over. Democratic Rep. Raymond Hull said the state chose not to use the federal system and it would be hard to change now, especially if the state had to repay money that was invested.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raymond Gallison, chairman of the House Finance Committee, said he\u2019s reserving judgment until he hears more from HealthSource RI officials, and sees the funding proposal for it when Raimondo submits her budget March 12.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new director of Rhode Island's health insurance exchange is making a case for keeping the state-run marketplace, as some lawmakers are c\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539287", "og": {"site_name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "description": "The new director of Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange is making a case for keeping the state-run marketplace, as some lawmakers are calling for its demise.", "title": "HealthSource RI under fire from state lawmakers", "url": "http://wpri.com/2015/03/01/healthsource-ri-under-fire-from-state-lawmakers/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/healthsource-ri-obamacare.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WPRI.com", "description": "The new director of Rhode Island\u2019s health insurance exchange is making a case for keeping the state-run marketplace, as some lawmakers are calling for its demise.", "title": "HealthSource RI under fire from state lawmakers", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/healthsource-ri-obamacare.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wpri12", "site": "wpri12", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Local News, Mobile, News, Providence  JENNIFER McDERMOTT, Associated Press WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "msapplication-tooltip": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News | WPRI.com: Rhode Island news, weather, information", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wpri", "fb": {"pages": 20074438201}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wpri.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1b04de707c0e872b43e051b6f92f59c6?s=16", "application-name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WPRI12", "published_time": "2015-03-01T17:05:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T17:05:43+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "UWpZtk5XlRP8hEHWWrNPNVI8BulxVr0d1aFCNQQIY9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": ",Local News, Mobile, News, Providence"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaaf3\"", "article_summary": "House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello has indicated he\u2019d consider moving to the federal system if the state exchange isn\u2019t cost effective and efficient.\nFor a \u201ccomparable\u201d price, Wallack said, the state system can provide better plan choices, prices and customer service.\nThe federal government has awarded about $150 million to HealthSource RI to date and roughly $87 million was spent through 2014, according to the agency.\nDemocratic Rep.
