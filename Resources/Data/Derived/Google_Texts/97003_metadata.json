From a report at MassLive.com:\n\nNeal's office organized the trip Monday to both New Haven and Hartford to get Pioneer Valley officials a taste of what transit-oriented development can look like. They met with New Haven officials like David B. Panagore, onetime head of economic development in Springfield. He said people will use Union Station to access Springfield and points north. \"We are your front door. That's the same way Springfield is our front door to the north. But if our station is crap, no one is going to want to take the left turn,\" Panagore said, stressing the importance of the connection between cities along the line. Springfield visitors also heard about New Haven's frustrations, including a lack of viable retail in its station. The problem, Panagore said, is that the station required 30-year leases and didn't give New Haven officials the ability to go out and court local retailers. \"Here we are in New Haven, the home of the greatest pizza in the world,\" Panagore said. \"And we have a Sbarro's here in the station.\"\n\nThe delegation then traveled by train to Hartford, where it was joined by U.S. Rep. John Larson and Connecticut transportation commissioner James Redeker.\n\nNeal led delegation boards train in Hartford for trip back to Springfield. pic.twitter.com/ssUGZs7jDI \u2014 Paul Tuthill (@ptuthill) December 8, 2014\n\nThe trip concluded with a news conference at Springfield's Union Station, which is currently undergoing an $82 million renovation.\n\nNeal said in a statement that $73 million in federal stimulus funds were spent since 2009 to revitalize the regional rail line that runs parallel to Interstate 91.\n\nThis report includes information from The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Environment", "description": "Massachusetts and Connecticut officials are riding the rails on Monday to highlight upgrades in the so-called \"knowledge corridor\" through southern New", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/officials-highlight-regional-rail-line-massachusetts-and-connecticut", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201412/Springfield_Massachusetts.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Massachusetts and Connecticut officials are riding the rails on Monday to highlight upgrades in the so-called \"knowledge corridor\" through southern New", "title": "Officials Highlight Regional Rail Line in Massachusetts and Connecticut"}, "story_id": 369379166, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heddahfeddah"}, "author": "Heather Brandon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Officials Highlight Regional Rail Line in Massachusetts and Connecticut"}, "nid": 32532, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "keywords": "The Daily, Connecticut, Massachusetts, transportation, trains", "wordCount": 602, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb451\"", "article_summary": "Massachusetts and Connecticut officials are riding the rails on Monday to highlight upgrades in the so-called \"knowledge corridor\" through southern New England.\nThey met with New Haven officials like David B.
