Americans are ready to be done with the “Pottery Barn rule” in Iraq.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg survey found a plurality of Americans – 49% — say Washington does not have any responsibility to assist the Iraqi government fend off the insurgent groups seeking its overthrow, a split from the you-break-it, you-own-it rule coined in the runup to the 2003 Iraq war — even though it is not actually the retailer’s policy.

The survey follows President Barack Obama‘s announcement last week that he is deploying 300 military advisers to Baghdad to help the struggling Iraqi government.

While 44% of those polled said the U.S. does have a responsibility to help in Iraq, 71% said the 11-year conflict was not worth it, a figure 12 percentage points higher than in December 2012, a year after President Obama announced the final American combat troops had left Iraq.

There is also an unusual consensus between tea party supporters and the educated and financial elite on whether the U.S. owes it to Iraq to help fight ISIS. Of tea party supporters, 62% say the country has an obligation to help Iraq and 57% of people with college or advanced degrees agree. Of people who earn $100,000 a year or more, 60% say there is a responsibility to help.

The poll of 1,383 people was conducted from June 16-22. It has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
