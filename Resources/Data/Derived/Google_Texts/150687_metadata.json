The challenge was filed by Pittsburgh Bishop David Zubik and other representatives of faith-based groups in Western Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe parties are directed to file supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees,\u201d said the Supreme Court order.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires employers to include free birth control in employee health insurance. While it exempts churches and other core religious institutions that object to that requirement, it does mandate the coverage for employees working for faith-based social-service agencies and schools. That has led to challenges on behalf of such entities as Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, the Presbyterian-affiliated Geneva College of Beaver Falls and several other organizations around the country.\n\nThe act does not require the charities and schools to pay for the birth control coverage \u2014 only to submit a notice saying they won\u2019t, which automatically triggers a process in which the insurers take on the cost. But even submitting an opt-out notice makes them \u201ccomplicit\u201d in what they see as a moral evil, according to the challengers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged,\u201d said attorney Mickey Pohl, who represents the Diocese of Pittsburgh in the case, saying it casts doubt that the \u201cmischaracterizlation of this as a simple opt-out was going to be easily accepted.\u201d\n\nThe court is \u201clooking for less objectionable alternatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s ways of doing this without steamrolling the religious objectors.\u201d\n\nBrigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, called the court\u2019s request unusual but a \u201cpositive sign the court is concerned about taking contraception coverage out of health plans.\u201d The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case in support of the requirement.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be narrowing the question,\u201d she said, as to whether there\u2019s \u201ca way the employer could inform the insurance company, maybe through some other mechanism, so that the employees get the coverage.\u201d\n\nWith the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, watchers of the ideologically divided court have focused closely on swing Justice Anthony Kennedy as to whether the court splits, 4-4, leaving contradictory rulings in lower courts, or the Obamacare provision is upheld, 5-3.\n\nJustice Kennedy ruled in favor of religious business owners\u2019 objections in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case, but he noted that such businesses didn\u2019t even have the option of the opt-out form and that such a solution might be acceptable.\n\nIn the Zubik case, the court gave everyone until April 12 to file initial briefs and until April 20 to file reply briefs. Among the several organizations whose challenges were consolidated into the Zubik case, some are Catholic groups objecting in general to artificial birth control and others are Protestant groups focused primarily on contraceptives they believe can cause early abortions.\n\nPeter Smith: petersmith@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1416; Twitter @PG_PeterSmith.", "article_metadata": {"description": "High court orders new round of legal briefs in faith-based\u00a0challenge to contraception provision under Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 offering a tantalizing clue that it sees a compromise in a standoff between faith-based groups and the U.S. government \u2014 is asking for ideas on how employees can get free birth control without any help from employers that object to it.
