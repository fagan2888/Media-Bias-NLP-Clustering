(Photo: Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images )\n\nFollowing strong gains in the manufacturing sector in 2013, Indiana's unemployment rate has fallen below 7 percent \u2014 its lowest level in more than five years.\n\nThe state's jobless rate in December dropped to 6.9 percent from 7.3 percent in November, said the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, based on a federal survey of 1,000 households in the state.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest since the state reported 6.8 percent in October 2008, the department said.\n\n\"Indiana's economy looks as strong as anybody's in the Midwest,\" PNC Financial Services Group economist Kurt Rankin said.\n\nMany of the 42,600 jobs Indiana added in 2013 were in the highly desirable and well-paying manufacturing and logistics fields. Rankin said the creation of those jobs has led to an increase in spending in Indiana, which he attributed to a 4.3 percent job gain in the retail sector, above the national average of 2.3 percent.\n\nRankin also said the declining unemployment rate will put upward pressure on wages this year.\n\n\"Businesses that do see the opportunity to grow and expand will want to lock up the best talent they can,\" he said.\n\nOn a down note, the state lost 4,800 private-sector jobs in December after gaining about 25,000 of those jobs in November, based on a federal survey of 5,000 businesses. Nearly 6,000 people rejoined the labor force in December.\n\nAlthough Indiana's unemployment rate is slightly higher than the national rate of 6.7 percent, the grass does appear greener here than in neighboring states: Illinois' rate is 8.6 percent, Kentucky is at 8 percent, Michigan is at 8.4 percent, and Ohio is at 7.2 percent.\n\nBall State economist Michael Hicks said Indiana's business-friendly tax laws, regulatory environment and dedicated workforce make it a more attractive place than neighboring states to do business. He expects Indiana will add 60,000 jobs this year, an increase of about 40 percent.\n\n\"Indiana has a much better fiscal environment than the surrounding states,\" Hicks said. \"Companies that locate here are not choosing between, say, New Hampshire and Indiana. They are choosing between Indiana or a neighboring state in the Great Lakes region.\"\n\nTimes still are tough for many workers in Indiana, though. Businesses have reported cutting employee hours in response to increased health-care regulations from the Affordable Care Act. The median household income in Indiana, $48,393, also continued to lag the national average of $52,762.\n\nMore Hoosiers also appear to be looking for work than six years ago. Tuesday's report said 218,100 Hoosiers still were seeking jobs in December, compared to 148,431 when the recession started in December 2007. The state's unemployment rate hit a high of 10.8 percent in 2009, when 350,000 Hoosiers were seeking jobs.\n\n\"There are fewer Hoosiers unemployed now than in the past five years,\" Scott B. Sanders, commissioner of the Department of Workforce Development, said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"Just as important is the fact more than 21,000 folks have returned to the labor force over the past three months, which is unique in the Midwest. Although Hoosiers are encouraged the economy is improving and there are jobs available, there still is more work to be done.\"\n\nCall Star reporter Chris Sikich at (317) 444-6036.
