Great promise has given way to modest solutions. To be sure, the President had difficult economic and foreign policy challenges to navigate and an impossible political climate, to boot.\n\nOur greatest Presidents, however, have faced similarly demanding situations. It is precisely to confront those challenges, enact major change and fundamentally transform the institution of the presidency that distinguished them among historians and the American people as great.\n\nGOP LEADERS REACH LAST-MINUTE BUDGET DEAL WITH OBAMA\n\nAbraham Lincoln empowered the institution to an unprecedented degree, emancipating millions of slaves and preserving the nation along the way. Franklin Delano Roosevelt came into office in the midst of an extraordinary economic crisis; his response was to enact the greatest legislative program in history, one that fundamentally changed both the scope of what government provided its citizens and the size and reach of the executive branch.\n\nGeorge Washington defined how the presidency would function as the first holder of that office. Ronald Reagan leveraged the power of his office to achieve major promises on tax cuts, national defense and returning key powers to the states.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson, too, left major and lasting marks on the Republic.\n\nBy comparison, Obama's inability to triumph over his adversities as President, along with the fact he will leave the institution of the presidency no stronger than he found it, are what separate him from the top tier of our chief executives. In many cases, his grand promises did not yield action, or action did not yield tangible results.\n\nWhich is not to say that he has an entirely unimpressive legacy \u2013 just that the Obama we will remember 50 or 100 years from now will likely be a smaller figure in history than many people imagine, for better and for worse.\n\nNYC POLL WANTS OBAMA TO BYPASS CONGRESS TO AID PUERTO RICO\n\nThe good. It would be disingenuous to suggest Obama's administration is bereft of major achievements. Over the past several years, his administration can count numerous positives on both the domestic and foreign policy fronts.\n\nAt home, Obama scored some early successes, including the stimulus act and Wall Street reform. These actions stabilized a crippled economy and likely prevented further damage. Current economic maladies are in many respects still symptomatic of the catastrophic events that took place before he took office, and the administration gets credit for trussing a fragile economy through their eight years.\n\nUnemployment has gradually fallen, the stock market has significantly risen and public anxiety about the economy has diminished greatly.\n\nOBAMA AND PUTIN SPAR ON SYRIA AND UKRAIN AT UNITED NATIONS\n\nObama, of course, championed and signed the Affordable Care Act, which benefits tens of millions of Americans. Over time, its significance will become clearer but the immediate benefits are impressive. The short run has offered millions of people the opportunity to gain access to health care, especially among the financially vulnerable and racial minorities. Health outcomes have also improved for young participants.\n\nObama has signed into law statutes making it easier for women to claim equal pay \u2013 and enabling gays to serve openly in the military, and his administration orchestrated the bailout many have credited with saving the domestic auto industry.\n\nWhile the President was in many respects behind the popular curve on same-sex marriage, his appointments to the Supreme Court helped push it to the left, and in the end he embraced this major social change soon enough to be celebrating when the court handed down its historic decision. In the history books, he will get some credit.\n\nBARACK OBAMA BECOMES THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO BE NOMINATED BY A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY FOR PRESIDENT\n\nOverseas, Obama has also been active. Eager to improve the nation's standing abroad, he consciously reached out to key nations in the global community with whom our ties were strained. He crafted a major new trade agreement with the Pacific Rim.\n\nMore recently, the administration has begun opening relations with Cuba and reached a major, if controversial, deal with Iran designed to prevent that nation from acquiring nuclear weapons. As controversial as both measures currently are, this is the stuff of history.\n\nThere were successes in the war on terrorism, too, most notably the killing of Osama Bin Laden during a special forces strike on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. No one can take that accomplishment away from this President.\n\nThe bad. At the same time, the great promise of Obama's candidacy and election has been largely unmet. When teary-eyed seniors and excited millennials gathered in Grant Park in Chicago for the President-elect's victory speech, most expected an ambitious policy agenda was in the offing.\n\nIn most cases, the promise did not meet reality.\n\nThough Obama formally ended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both nations are increasingly dangerous \u2014 thanks to insurgent jihadist forces that are virulently anti-American. The administration massively underestimated the threat posed by ISIS; if that terrorist proto-state is defeated, it may be due as much to Russia's recent engagement as to the Obama administration's.\n\nEDITORIAL: GULIANI'S DISGUSTING ATTACK ON OBAMA\n\nThough Obama promised to fight the war on terrorism differently from his predecessor, he has only ratcheted up drone warfare and continued to entrench the type of domestic surveillance that many of his supporters oppose. This is, therefore, mostly a continuation of the history written by George W. Bush.\n\nAll told, it is unlikely this President who won the Nobel Peace Price in his first year in office will be seen, over the long run, as a peacemaker.\n\nOn the domestic front, including education, climate change and immigration, the kinds of seismic shifts Obama said were necessary expected have yet to happen.\n\nThe ambitious Race to the Top program to improve educational quality, make more students college ready and turn around low-performing schools created more enemies than friends by imposing federal standards and only modestly moving the needle on educational equality.\n\nObama considers climate change one of the biggest threats to the planet \u2013 but he was unable to pass major legislation to change the amount of carbon dioxide the nation emits. To the extent that the problem has improved on his watch, it is because of a hydrofracking boom that happened largely despite him.\n\nAnd on immigration, Obama's attempt for comprehensive reform seems to have been flummoxed in much the same way as his predecessor's was.\n\nOne cannot fault the President for a Congress that flatly refused to work with him \u2013 but the failure to change minds, either in the public or in the legislature, is a mark against him in the historical ledger.\n\nAt the same time, despite his claim to the progressive mantle, economic inequality has soared to historic levels. His presidency will be remembered as a time when a problem he decried worsened.\n\nThe gun violence epidemic he has continually spotlighted has continued unabated. Many of the problems that led to the Great Recession remain uncorrected.\n\nAnd despite promises to the opposite, the Obama presidency has failed to embrace the kinds of transparency that good government activists, including Sen. Barack Obama, clamored for during the George W. Bush years. In fact, he has pursued government leaks under the Espionage Act more vigorously than any of his predecessors.\n\nIn the balance. However disappointing, none of these shortcomings mean Obama has had a failed presidency. Even a cursory comparison to our least great Presidents shows that. Herbert Hoover, for example, failed to take steps to avoid the Great Depression and, once it was in full swing, did little to support those hardest hit by the economic collapse.\n\nA quartet of 19th century Presidents also leave an ignominious legacy: Millard Fillmore supported the expansion of slavery by way of the Compromise of 1850; Franklin Pierce also expanded slavery as he sought to expand the nation's borders; Andrew Johnson undermined Reconstruction efforts and was the first President to be impeached, and James Buchanan tacitly supported slavery and proved unable to quell growing Southern secessionist fervor, helping usher in the Civil War.\n\nMost egregiously, Warren Harding was a dilettante who played cards while his friends and allies pillaged national funds.\n\nEven on the worst day of his presidency, Obama hardly merits comparison to these Presidents. Indeed, even critics should acknowledge that the Obama Administration has been relatively scandal-free. Although episodes such as the Fast and Furious debacle, the IRS's political targeting and the Benghazi tragedy are significant, they pale in comparison to the levels of notoriety many of his predecessors' administrations earned.\n\nSignificant scandals in the second terms of Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush loomed large over these White Houses, casting a cloud that compromised the legacy of each. Lack of scandals does not guarantee efficient government, of course, but it can give us a clearer idea about where the President ranks as they leave office.\n\nWe know that Presidential legacies are complex, dynamic and all too often subjective, and Obama's middling ranking as his presidency nears its end does not preclude a more positive judgment of history. Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan both exited office with similarly low rankings only to steadily rise in the esteem of historians and political scientists. Peace and prosperity are notable enhancers of Presidential legacy.\n\nIn any event, it will probably take several decades before any picture of Obama's presidency becomes widely accepted. Attitudes about the President are staggeringly polarized, and those opinions will be quite resistant to change over the course of our lifetimes.\n\nIt will likely not be until a new generation of scholars, one without personal biases in favor of or against the 44th President, begin to craft what Obama has referred to as his \"paragraph\" in the national narrative.\n\nRottinghaus is an associate professor at the University of Houston and Vaughn is an associate professor of political science at Boise State University.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Brandon Rottinghaus, Justin S.
