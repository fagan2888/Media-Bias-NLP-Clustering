They assumed that care was somehow made better just by having an EHR, and thus began to build the case for policy aimed at supporting EHR adoption. Fortunately as the HITECH Act of 2009 makes clear, a maturation of thinking has occurred; it is not the mere presence of technology, but good technology used in meaningful ways that can improve care.\n\nMagical thinking about EHRs has disappeared, but a similar irrational belief has taken its place \u2013 this time around the concept of interoperability, the ability of systems to communicate with each other. Today there are two widely held concerns about the current state of interoperability. The first concern is that the Meaningful Use program, the federal EHR incentive program created by the HITECH Act, was doomed from the outset because it did not begin with the requirement that EHRs be capable of communicating with each other.\n\nThe other is that while it was acceptable not to have required full interoperability at the outset; now it is the single most important task at hand. By this account, interoperability must be put on a fast track, because the American people will be unlikely to reap any benefits from health information technology without it. I strongly disagree with both of these positions.\n\nFirst, if the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) had conditioned the start of Stage 1 of Meaningful Use on full interoperability of EHRs, I believe that the already slow rate of EHR adoption would grind to a halt. Vendor development and purchase decisions would go on indefinite hold awaiting final interoperability specifications.\n\nBut by moving forward with the status quo of partial interoperability, most providers, nurses, clinical, and nonclinical staff now have at least basic if not reasonably good health IT functionality and literacy. For example, the majority of prescriptions for non-controlled substances are now sent electronically \u2014 not a complete remedy for medication errors, but an important move away from those errors due to illegible handwriting. And more importantly, many tens of millions of patients have received (many for the first time) summaries of their health care visits and hospitalizations that provide a list of their active problems, medications, and medical allergies, not to mention written instructions.\n\nSecondly, many providers and provider systems have gone ahead, even where interoperability is limited to laboratory data, with quality improvement programs that leverage their EHRs for analytics, point-of-care decision support, and patient education and engagement tools. As an example, in 2012 the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association launched Million Hearts\u00ae \u2013 a program of education, screening, and treatment \u2013 with an end point of preventing one million new heart attacks and strokes over 5 years.\n\nThe method is known as the \u201cABCS\u201d \u2013 more focused attention to:\n\nA: recommending aspirin where benefit exceeds risk;\n\nB: blood pressure screening and control;\n\nC: cholesterol screening and control; and\n\nS: smoking cessation for current smokers.\n\nPrograms such as Million Hearts\u00ae work because those administering the program can leverage existing EHR technology to embed the necessary screening and treatment protocols into routine care.\n\nLooking Ten Years Down the Road\n\nTo be clear, interoperability provides important benefits, and where secure exchange and sharing of key information is wanted and/or useful, technical interoperability makes information exchange less costly and burdensome. That said, accelerating the transfer of information that is unwanted, incorrect, and or contradictory with known information does not necessarily result in better care. De-siloing information, particularly where the meaning of that information is likely to be different for the author than the reader, is as likely to lead to confusion as to clarity. And where care is managed over time, accelerating the liquidity of discrete information without context can facilitate poor decision-making.\n\nI thus applaud ONC for addressing the call for more interoperability not with an answer, but a thoughtful 10-year roadmap. Even then, technical interoperability by itself does not guarantee that shared information is understandable, useful, and used. Unfortunately, I am concerned that the current primary driver for EHR functionality and adoption, the Meaningful Use program, has inadvertently become an impediment to achieving its own goal of meaningful interoperability.\n\nFirst, the one-size-fits-all approach of Meaningful Use to certified functionality and metrics has created market pressure for systems that satisfy regulations, as opposed to meeting the needs of providers and patients. According to a recent survey conducted by the American College of Physicians, many doctors find it more difficult to find information in their EHRs than they did in their paper records.\n\nWhat is more, for some providers, adding interoperability to the mix without tailoring systems to clinician needs, leads to information overload \u2013 a burden with no benefit to patients. And for other providers like me, a primary care internist, this one-size-fits-all approach has led to mediocre information displays and poor anticipatory guidance. This is woefully inadequate for advanced primary care models, where our job is not just delivering high quality care when someone is sick, but better prevention, proactive management of chronic diseases, and care coordination. Just having EHRs talk to each other won\u2019t fix these problems.\n\nSecond, Meaningful Use mandates a rigidly defined set of information that must make up every summary of care and visit summary, leading to the production of very lengthy and often irrelevant form letters, enabled by a few simple clicks. Granted, providers are free to add to this the few necessary nuggets of information that really matter; but as they are not free to subtract fields that are irrelevant, they may decide that its just not worth the effort. This problem of noise overwhelming signal will not improve simply by having EHRs talk to each other; in fact it may make matters worse.\n\nFinally, even if Meaningful Use course-corrected such that there was true flexibility in metrics and market pressure for specialty-specific innovation, Meaningful Use has no authority over all key stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. For example, electronically posted formularies were supposed to provide patients and providers with accurate and usable information at the point-of-care allowing better decision-making, particularly when there is a choice of prescription drugs. Unfortunately, electronic formularies are no more accurate (and in some cases less accurate) than their paper counterparts from over a decade ago. And misleading, inaccurate and/or non-usable information is not made any more useful, when digitized and electronically shared.\n\nIn summary, ONC\u2019s 10-year iterative approach is the right time frame for enhancing interoperability; but without significant change to the Meaningful Use program, we are not likely to see better interoperability enabling EHRs and other health IT to fulfill the promise of better, safer, and more affordable care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/11/03/oncs-10-year-roadmap-towards-interoperability-requires-changes-to-the-meaningful-use-program/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "ONC\u2019s 10-Year Roadmap Towards Interoperability Requires Changes To The Meaningful Use Program"}, "description": "ONC\u2019s 10-Year Roadmap Towards Interoperability Requires Changes To The Meaningful Use Program | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, I am concerned that the current primary driver for EHR functionality and adoption, the Meaningful Use program, has inadvertently become an impediment to achieving its own goal of meaningful interoperability.\nI thus applaud ONC for addressing the call for more interoperability not with an answer, but a thoughtful 10-year roadmap.\nBy this account, interoperability must be put on a fast track, because the American people will be unlikely to reap any benefits from health information technology without it.\nThat said, accelerating the transfer of information that is unwanted, incorrect, and or contradictory with known information does not necessarily result in better care.\nFinally, even if Meaningful Use course-corrected such that there was true flexibility in metrics and market pressure for specialty-specific innovation, Meaningful Use has no authority over all key stakeholders in the health care ecosystem."}
