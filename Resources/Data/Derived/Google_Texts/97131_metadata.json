Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, winner of the Iowa caucuses, said at the debate in Des Moines Jan. 28 that the health law has been \u201ca disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in our country.\u201d\n\nDemocrats largely support the law, but even they can\u2019t agree on how to fix its problems. Hillary Clinton said at the Jan. 25 town hall on CNN that she wants to \u201cbuild on the ACA. Get costs down, but improve it, get to 100 percent coverage.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s rival for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things,\u201d but added that \u201cthe United States today is the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right.\u201d Sanders is pushing a government-run \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan instead.\n\nIn some cases candidates are bending the truth. But in general, both praise and criticisms of the law are accurate. That\u2019s because the health law is so big and sweeping that it has had effects both positive and negative.\n\nHere is a brief guide to some things the health law has \u2014 and has not \u2014 accomplished since it was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.\n\nCLAIM: The law has increased the number of people with health insurance coverage.\n\nThis is true, no matter what measure you use. The official Census Bureau and polling firm Gallup both found substantial drops in the percentage of people without health insurance after the majority of the law\u2019s coverage expansions took effect in 2014.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: There are still millions of Americans who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nThis is also true. Even though approximately 90% of Americans now have insurance, that remaining 10% amounts to more than 30 million people.\n\nMillions aren\u2019t eligible for coverage under the law because they\u2019re not in the U.S. legally. Another 3 million are in the so-called \u201cMedicaid gap,\u201d meaning they would be eligible for Medicaid under the ACA except their states opted not to accept the expansion after the Supreme Court effectively ruled the expansion optional.\n\nStill others are eligible to purchase coverage on a health insurance exchange but either can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t think the insurance available offers a good value or don\u2019t know they are legally required to obtain it. An estimated 7.5 million Americans paid a fine to the IRS for failing to get covered in 2014; millions more were exempt from the requirement and didn\u2019t have coverage.\n\nIn recognition of the fact that enrollment has been smaller than expected, the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its projections for those who will buy insurance under the law from 21 million to 13 million in 2016.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has fixed the dysfunctional individual insurance market.\n\nPrior to the passage of the health law, millions of people who did not have work-based or government coverage were shut out of buying their own insurance because they had been sick or because the coverage offered did not cover the services they needed.\n\nThe law aimed to address the problems in the individual market in several ways, including requiring insurers to sell to those with preexisting conditions at the same price as healthier people; standardizing the benefits package; and limiting the size of deductibles. Tax credits were made available in order to help people afford coverage. And the law created insurance exchanges intended to help consumers compare, choose, sign up and pay for health insurance.\n\nHow well these changes succeeded in stabilizing the market is not yet clear. What is clear is that more people are now insured through the market.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: The ACA has made the individual market worse.\n\nAll is not well in the reformed individual market.\n\nEven with help paying premiums, many moderate-income Americans are finding that their deductibles and copayments are so high they cannot afford to use their insurance.\n\nIn other cases, individuals can get insurance they can afford to use, but it does not include their regular doctors and hospitals. In fact, plans that do offer coverage outside of the insurer\u2019s network are becoming harder to find and more expensive.\n\nThat change affected Cruz, who initially claimed his private insurance had been cancelled. In fact, his insurer had stopped offering his broad-choice plan and automatically transferred him to a narrow-network product.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has improved the Medicare program.\n\nWhile most of the law was aimed at those without insurance, lawmakers also took the opportunity to beef up some benefits for the 55 million Americans in the Medicare program.\n\nMedicare enrollees got new coverage for preventive services and annual checkups, and those with high prescription drug expenses got help to fill the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201dgap left by the 2003 Medicare drug program.\n\nOver the longer term, the law created several payment experiments intended toimprove the quality of care Medicare patients receive and lower costs. These include efforts to prevent patients from going back to the hospital after they\u2019ve been discharged.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: The ACA has not saved money for Medicare.\n\nThe rate of increase in Medicare spending has slowed since the health law was passed in 2010. But it\u2019s not clear how much of that can be attributed to the law, aside from some provisions that actually cut payments to hospitals and other health providers.\n\nAnd some of the most highly anticipated projects, including \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d that are paid bonuses for keeping Medicare patients healthy and lowering spending, have not so far shown very good results.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has killed jobs.\n\nOne of Republicans\u2019 favorite talking points \u2014 that the health law would depress employment, particularly part-time employment \u2014 has turned out not to be the case.\n\nAn analysis in 2015 by the Urban Institute found that the health law \u201chad virtually no adverse effect on labor force participation; employment; the probability of part-time work; and hours worked per week by nonelderly adults.\u201d\n\nWhile there would be fewer people in the workforce due to the law, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2014 that \u201calmost entirely\u201d stems from voluntary actions by workers who could quit because they no longer depended on their jobs for insurance \u2014 now they could buy it on their own.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has slowed overall health spending.\n\nThe White House trumpeted the fact that health spending grew at its slowest rates ever between 2010 and 2013. But health policy analysts are still engaged in a lively debate about how much of the slowdown was attributable to the recession, to the health law and to other changes in the health care system.\n\nMeanwhile, the rate of spending has begun to accelerate again, jumping from a 2.9% increase in 2013 to 5.3% in 2014. That has occurred as millions more Americans gained access to health care through the law.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.
