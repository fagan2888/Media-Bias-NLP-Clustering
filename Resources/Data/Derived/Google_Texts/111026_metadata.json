More showcase than retrospective, the exhibition consisted of seven paintings at Schaeffer Galleries, a small but important New York gallery that specialized in old master works and sold numerous masterpieces to museums throughout the United States.\n\nFor \u201cPiero di Cosimo: \u201cThe Poetry of Painting in Renaissance Art,\u201d which opened Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, assembled 44 of the painter\u2019s master works from collections throughout the Americas and Europe. However, the exhibition looks more like a collection from several Italian masters than the work of one man.\n\nA chameleon of craft, Piero was as different as his individual works and in many instances playfully quoted the craft of his contemporaries. The figures and translucence of fabric in \u201cThe Finding of Vulcan on Lemnos\u201d recalls qualities of Sandro Botticelli\u2019s paintings. The churning water beneath a dying sea beast in \u201cLiberation of Andromeda\u201d echoes Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s sketchbook studies of waves.\n\nAs with many of his colleagues of the time \u2014 Pietro Perugino, Filippino Lippi and Andea del Verrocchio among them \u2014 the influence of Netherlandish painting, with its acute attention to the details of fabrics, flora and background, is unmistakable.\n\nPiero\u2019s style wasn\u2019t the only thing to shift over time. With his changing style came shifts in subject matter. Like many old masters of the quattrocento, he painted religious works, portraits and mythological scenes. What made Piero\u2019s work unique was how he interpreted the content of the stories. His two wood-panel pieces interpret Lucretius\u2019 \u201cOn the Nature of Things,\u201d and with a relatively muted palette, the old master depicts extreme violence in \u201cA Hunting Scene\u201d as animals are driven from the forest by fire, only to be attacked by dogs and clubbed by satyrs, their corpses carted off by men. A companion piece, \u201cReturn From the Hunt,\u201d depicts a quieter setting away from the hunting fires in the background. Women tend to an orphaned cub, as well as injured men, satyrs and centaurs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost the inverse of what you would expect,\u201d said Dennis Geronimus, who co-curated the exhibition. \u201cAll of these hybrids known for their violence, and [Piero] is asking you to complete the story: that there isn\u2019t one interpretation of how these mythical animals lived.\u201d\n\nBut not all of the magical moments in this exhibition are the result of strange subjects or curious details. Sometimes, just the facts are enough. For example, there is the eloquently painted \u201cMadonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Elizabeth of Hungary, Catherine of Alexandria, Peter, and John the Evangelist with Angels.\u201d It is what one might expect from a Renaissance painting depicting the Madonna and Christ child: The saints are contemplative; objects and gestures are rife with symbolism. Brightly colored garments flow with abundant drapery, accented with fine detail.\n\nCompleted the year after Columbus arrived in the New World, this exhibition is the first and likely only time the painting has traveled outside of Florence. That fact alone underscores the significance of this exhibition, which travels in June to the Uffizi in Florence, the museum which helped organize the exhibition.\n\nAs co-curator Gretchen Hirschauer points out in the accompanying catalog, for the past century Piero was a painter cherished by curators and historians for his idiosyncrasies but little known outside of academia. Because of the age and fragility of the work, few institutions were willing to part with their Pieros for a smaller exhibition featuring a dozen of his paintings from collections across the United States. But, as the scope and scale of the exhibition increased, more institutions made an exception, recognizing that this exhibition might expand our knowledge of the Renaissance.\n\n\u201cThere are some artists in the textbooks today \u2014 like Botticelli or Piero della Francesca \u2014 who were long forgotten for centuries and then rediscovered by writers and artists,\u201d Mr. Geronimus said.\n\nThis exhibition of Piero di Cosimo is a revealing reminder that answers why art history requires constant revision and expansion.\n\n\u201cPiero di Cosimo: The Poetry of Painting in Renaissance Art\u201d runs through May 3 at the National Gallery of Art.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The last time the United States saw a Piero di Cosimo retrospective was in 1938, a few months before Germany invaded Prague.
