For the past five years, the Strategy has charted a path for fighting HIV in the United States. But as our scientific understanding and policy opportunities change, our plan must adapt.\n\nThat\u2019s why last week, the White House released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020.\n\nThis update incorporates work from the HIV Care Continuum Initiative and recommendations by the President\u2019s Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence against Women and Girls, and Gender-Related Health Disparities. This updated Strategy will sharpen its focus over the next five years to deliver effective, evidence-based services that help prevent and treat HIV, particularly in communities where HIV is most concentrated.\n\nAt HHS, we\u2019re committed to transforming our health care system into one that delivers better care, spends our health care dollars more wisely, and puts educated, empowered patients in the center of their care. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing for people living with HIV.\n\nFirst, to deliver better care to people living with HIV and to prevent further transmission, we\u2019re committed to:\n\nWidespread testing and linking people to care and treatment\n\nBroad support for people living with HIV to engage\u2014and remain\u2014in care\n\nUniversal viral suppression among people living with HIV, to ensure they have and keep low levels of the virus in their body and reduce the chance of passing HIV to others\n\nFull access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services, which support people at high risk for HIV by reducing the likelihood of HIV infection with daily medication\n\nSecond, as we invest in quality health care, we will target resources toward HIV prevention, testing, and treatment interventions that have a proven record of success. At HHS, this means spending federal dollars wisely by evaluating outcomes and allocating resources to approaches that work. And as we work to improve health outcomes and find a cure, we will support ongoing research to open up new prevention and treatment options.\n\nFinally, as we help patients and their communities stay healthy, we will focus on key populations most at risk for and disproportionately affected by HIV. We aim to lower the rates of HIV among many high-risk populations, improve outcomes for people seeking care and address the stigma that is still too often associated with HIV. This means focusing on key populations that are disproportionately impacted by this disease.\n\nImagine a day where the President\u2019s vision of an AIDS-free generation has come true, and the HIV epidemic itself is a distant memory confined to our history. With this crucial update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and by working together to find common ground across sectors and states, we are getting closer to that day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
