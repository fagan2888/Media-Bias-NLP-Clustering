Photo by Sarah Dwyer / The Daily Tar Heel\n\nIn the most secret service-studded pep rally of the year, Hillside High School hosted presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for a Get Out The Vote event in Durham Thursday.\n\nCalling for youth participation at the polls and the protection of public schools, Clinton embodied what she referred to as TLC: \u201cteaching, learning, and community\" in the speech and event.\n\nHours before the former Secretary of State took the stage, students from Hillside were already filling the packed gym with performances \u2014 from theatre troops to choruses, marching bands, and dance teams.\n\nFor Ahmad Richardson, a senior at Hillside, seeing the event come to fruition was especially exciting. Until seeing lines of cars Thursday morning, Richardson said he had first thought Clinton's choice of Hillside had been a joke.\n\n\u201cWhether you support Hillary or not, that\u2019s your belief,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut the fact that she had enough hope and had enough respect to come to Hillside High School means a lot.\u201d\n\nBreaking the barrier of education\n\nClinton said she hoped to address the barrier of education for young Americans.\n\n\u201cI think every child in this country deserves a good teacher and a good school regardless of the zip code they live in,\u201d she said.\n\nA product of public schools herself, Clinton said she has watched North Carolina tarnish its educational legacy of the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWe watched your Republican Governor and legislature slowly eroding the base for public education in this state,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband, Clinton said she came up with the \"Chelsea standard\" \u2014 a measure she used of whether she would enroll her own daughter in any given school. And more should meet it, she said.\n\n\u201cThere should not be a single school in the country where anyone wouldn\u2019t want to send their child,\u201d she said.\n\nMinority education was of particular interest for Hillside seniors like Imani Hawley, who planned to ask Clinton how her administration would inspire young Americans in minority communities.\n\nHawley said she hoped the rally would encourage Hillside students \u2014 particularly first-time voters like herself \u2014 to personally consider Clinton's positions.\n\n\u201cI want everybody to really listen and formulate their own opinion,\u201d she said.\n\nAccess to arts education, something she was fortunate enough to have, should be universal in public schools, Clinton said.\n\n\u201cYou should not have to go to a wealthy school in a wealthy suburb to get art and music,\" she said.\n\nJalen McGee, another senior at Hillside, said the school is particularly well known for its arts and sports. And Clinton related to this reputation, saying she, too, loved to sing. Though she jokingly revealed Chelsea was less of a fan of her voice as a child.\n\nNot a single issue nation, candidate\n\nDurham Mayor Bill Bell said Clinton is a candidate who understands the wide range of issues that need to be addressed in an opening speech.\n\n\u201cEducation is not the only barrier that exists because America is not a single issue country,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Clinton\u2019s speech continued to praise President Barack Obama\u2019s work with the Affordable Care Act, as well as call for the final offering of equal pay to women and the end to voter suppression in states like North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous in 2016 we have to say we are for voting rights,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nAs Congressman G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., described in his introduction, Clinton said she will go after the gun lobby.\n\n\u201cThere is not another industry in America that has that kind of free pass,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe talk closed as her introducers began, with encouragements to go out to the polls between now and the North Carolina primary date of March 12.\n\n\u201cStakes are too high for any of us to stay on the sidelines,\u201d said N.C. Rep. Larry Hall, D-Durham, and a fourth generation alum of Hillside High School.\n\nstate@dailytarheel.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the most secret service-studded pep rally of the year, Hillside High School hosted presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Get Out The Vote event in Durham Thursday.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "In the most secret service-studded pep rally of the year, Hillside High School hosted presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Get Out The Vote event in Durham Thursday.", "title": "Clinton event brings \"TLC\" to Durham", "url": "http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2016/03/hillary-clinton-comes-to-hillside-high-school", "image": "http://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/201604217ygrp9dscZ/dist/img/DTH-fb-icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.dailytarheel.com", "site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary"}, "publish_date": "2016-03-11 13:41:00", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytarheel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Clinton event brings \"TLC\" to DurhamCorey Risinger | Published 03/11/16 1:41pmHillary Clinton spoke on topics ranging from the state of public education to critiques of the current North Carolina legislature.\nCalling for youth participation at the polls and the protection of public schools, Clinton embodied what she referred to as TLC: \u201cteaching, learning, and community\" in the speech and event.\nAccess to arts education, something she was fortunate enough to have, should be universal in public schools, Clinton said.\nPhoto by Sarah Dwyer / The Daily Tar HeelIn the most secret service-studded pep rally of the year, Hillside High School hosted presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for a Get Out The Vote event in Durham Thursday.\nA product of public schools herself, Clinton said she has watched North Carolina tarnish its educational legacy of the 1990s."}
