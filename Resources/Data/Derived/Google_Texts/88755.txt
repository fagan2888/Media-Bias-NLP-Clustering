Will the House of Representatives formally demand that Hillary Clinton turn over her private server which the former secretary of state’s lawyer claims has been wiped clean, with all of Mrs. Clinton’s emails during her tenure as America’s chief diplomat deleted?

As The Washington Examiner reports: “The House has the power to subpoena the server, but neither Gowdy nor House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, will say whether it will use that authority.” Experts claim even those “deleted” emails could possibly be recovered.

Meanwhile, Rep. Trey Gowdy, the head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, has formally requested that Mrs. Clinton testify in private, behind closed doors, no later than May 1st. Her appearance, reports The Washington Examiner, would result in a “transcribed interview about the server and email.”

On her Fox News show “Justice,” Judge Jeanine Pirro warned Mrs. Clinton that Gowdy is a tenacious investigator “who doesn’t take kindly to lies and the disregard of subpoenas” that demanded the former State Department head turn over all her work-related emails.
