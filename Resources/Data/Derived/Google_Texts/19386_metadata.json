Meanwhile, a proposed Accessory Dwell\u00ading Unit ordinance is making the rounds to the Planning Commission next week, and then of course there's the whole Planning and Devel\u00adop\u00adment Review Department reorg ....\n\nOn behalf of 182 Texas police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo, AISD Assistant Police Chief Chris Evoy, and Travis Co.
