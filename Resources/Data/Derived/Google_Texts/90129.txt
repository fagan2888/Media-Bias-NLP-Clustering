The proposed Gross Reservoir expansion will be the largest construction project in the history of Boulder County; bigger than building the University of Colorado, NCAR, the Bureau of Standards or IBM. Gross reservoir will triple in size, requiring convoys of trucks to traverse nearly impassable Boulder County mountain roads to deliver concrete and steel payloads.

This Foothills Armageddon, scheduled to last for years, will strip Boulder's mountain communities of their character and peace. The beautiful Fraser River on the Western Slope, a major tributary to the Colorado River, will practically be emptied to satisfy the unchecked thirst of the Denver region. Astonishingly, water conservation measures are not being considered.

There is growing opposition to the project from groups including the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center, The Environmental Group, Save the Colorado, and Save the Poudre. Unfortunately, 25 years ago some of the larger environmental groups entered into an agreement with the EPA not to object to the Gross Dam expansion project in exchange for the EPA's stopping the environmentally destructive Two Forks Dam project.

The groups named above who are mounting organized opposition to the Gross Reservoir expansion are strong, local groups whose members are active and vote. The Boulder County Commissioners have expressed opposition to the expansion, and it's a fair bet that local politicians now supporting this environmentally-destructive, anti-water-conservation expansion will not remain in office once the full devastating effects are realized.
