Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is not yet the Senate Majority Leader, but he\u2019s begun making plans for the new Congress. He told Roll Call something interesting\n\n\u201cNumber one: We certainly will have a vote on proceeding to a bill to repeal Obamacare\u2026. It was a very large issue in the campaign,\u201d McConnell said, reaffirming a commitment to see what can be done against it, also discussing plans to roll back parts of the health care law that have proved to be particularly unpopular.\n\nThis may seem like throwaway rhetoric, but it struck me as fairly important, if for no other reason than it tells us quite a bit about McConnell\u2019s thinking.\n\nFor example, the Republican leaders repealing the Affordable Care Act \u201cwas a very large issue in the campaign.\u201d For those of us who actually followed the 2014 elections, this is demonstrably, quantifiably ridiculous \u2013 Republicans moved away from repeal talk in the spring , and then again in the fall\n\nWe know why, too: repeal isn\u2019t popular. In fact, there\u2019s far less support for repeal than the Affordable Care Act itself, and the ACA isn\u2019t winning any popularity contests. Once the GOP realized this was an electoral loser, the party moved on \u2013 making McConnell\u2019s remarks rather bizarre.\n\nThere\u2019s also the substantive question, of course, of why any lawmaker would want to repeal a law that\u2019s succeeding so well\n\nBut just below the surface, there\u2019s another angle that\u2019s bugging me: isn\u2019t this \u201cpoisoning the well\u201d?\n\nIt was just a few weeks ago that Republicans, riding high ever national victories, said they wanted to begin governing, find \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the Obama White House, and prove that the GOP is a responsible party. President Obama, they soon followed, shouldn\u2019t \u201cpoison the well\u201d by doing anything that Republicans might not like.\n\nThey were referring, of course, to immigration policy, but the general idea was more broadly applicable: everyone can get along, just so long as President Tyrant doesn\u2019t do anything that hurts Republicans\u2019 feelings.\n\nIt was a foolish pitch \u2013 GOP lawmakers are adults; their sensibilities shouldn\u2019t be quite so delicate \u2013 but McConnell\u2019s rhetoric suggest it was also a fraud. What\u2019s a better example of \u201cpoisoning the well\u201d in terms of Beltway comity than Republicans voting to take health care benefits away from millions of families just to spite the president they hold in contempt?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Income Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is readying an ACA repeal vote -- because, in his mind, Republicans are entitled to it.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/poisoning-the-well-mcconnell-eyes-aca-repeal-vote", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Income Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is readying an ACA repeal vote -- because, in his mind, Republicans are entitled to it.", "title": "Poisoning the well?
