Two or more fruits were offered in about 78 percent of schools, up from 68 percent in 2000. About a third of schools now have salad bars.\n\nThe big questions, of course, are whether students are eating these offerings, and, if so, whether that will help ease the obesity epidemic among the nation\u2019s children. Since the 1970s, the prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States has more than tripled, raising the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems.\n\nBut in recent years, health experts have documented small yet promising declines in the rate of childhood obesity, which was about 17 percent in 2012, the most recent year the government has measured. Obesity has decreased among the youngest children, as well as among children of low-income families participating in federal food programs.\n\nExperts are hoping that better offerings in school lunches move the needle for other children too, though the report measured only offerings of food, not what children were actually eating. The federal health authorities say they plan to release obesity figures for 2014 later this year.\n\nStudents consume up to half their daily calories at school, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the data. Interviewers visited a nationally representative sample of schools in 2000, 2006 and 2014.\n\nMostly gone are the days of white bread and canned corn. Canned vegetables are still served, but in far fewer schools. More than half of schools that prepared meals on site used fresh or frozen vegetables instead. For those that still served canned vegetables, 52 percent used low-sodium varieties, up from 10 percent in 2000.\n\nSchool food experts said the findings fit with what they had seen in districts across the country.\n\n\u201cLiterally, the way the school lunch line looks is different,\u201d said Deb Bentzel, senior associate at the Food Trust in Philadelphia, a nonprofit that works to increase access to nutritious food in schools and communities. \u201cIt\u2019s brighter, it\u2019s healthier-looking, it\u2019s fresher.\u201d\n\nThe challenge? Beans\n\nTraditional offerings have become healthier. For example, hot dogs have less fat and are made partly from turkey. A lunch tray is more likely to include legumes \u2014 \u201cBeans and chickpeas, that sort of thing,\u201d Bentzel said.\n\nEven snacks, long problematic as calorie-boosters, have gotten better. For example, in the Philadelphia school district, potato chips are baked, not fried; beverages no longer include sweetened teas or sodas; and serving sizes are smaller \u2014 changes the district began implementing in 2004, years before the stricter school food rules took effect, said Amy Virus, the acting food service director for the district.\n\nThe rules, detailed in 2012 by the Department of Agriculture based on a law that passed in 2010, have prompted broad changes in school menus across the United States. Although the law passed with bipartisan support, its implementation has been politically messier, and some of its core elements \u2014 such as reducing sodium in school food \u2014 have become targets of some Republican lawmakers.\n\nMargo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that with the law\u2019s renewal up for review this fall, consumer groups were watching to guard against rollbacks of any major provisions. The changes have been profound, she said.\n\n\u201cThe improvement to school foods in the last three years is much more than had been done in the last three decades,\u201d she said.\n\nOne criticism of the new meals has been that students were throwing away the healthier food, but Wootan said that problem is eternal in school cafeterias and had even improved slightly since the new rules took effect.\n\nA study in 12 urban schools released this year by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut found the proportion of students choosing a vegetable dropped to 52 percent in 2014 from 68 percent in 2012, but that students selecting vegetables ate nearly 20 percent more of them.\n\nIn Philadelphia, not all of the new foods have gone over well.\n\n\u201cBeans are our challenge,\u201d Virus said. \u201cWe accept that. We are trying.\u201d\n\nAnd the notion that school lunches are simply bad has persisted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to make fun of school lunch \u2014 it\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s mystery meat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve moved so far from that. The perception is the meal is lower-quality, but that\u2019s simply not true.'", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/1003499407-FL_SAR_HFLUNCH2.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "By Sabrina TaverniseThe humble school lunch, that staple of most every American child\u2019s diet, has become healthier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to make fun of school lunch \u2014 it\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s mystery meat,\u201d she said.\nSchool food experts said the findings fit with what they had seen in districts across the country.\nAlthough the law passed with bipartisan support, its implementation has been politically messier, and some of its core elements \u2014 such as reducing sodium in school food \u2014 have become targets of some Republican lawmakers.\nTwo or more fruits were offered in about 78 percent of schools, up from 68 percent in 2000."}
