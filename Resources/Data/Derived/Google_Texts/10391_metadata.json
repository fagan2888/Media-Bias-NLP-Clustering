That\u2019s why its new cover story (available online to subscribers only), \u201cStop Hillary! Vote No to a Clinton Dynasty,\u201d is so interesting. The wannabe opinion leaders of the liberal community turning against Hillary leaves open the door for another Barack Obama-type of fresh-faced challenger. Here is what the New York Post\u2019s Page Six tells us about the piece by writer Doug Henwood, which I have not read.\n\nAccording to Henwood\u2019s in-depth essay on Hillary\u2019s past, she \u201chas a long history of being economical with the truth,\u201d and though \u201cit\u2019s been more than 13 years since the Clintons left the White House, it\u2019s amazing how little there is to say about Hillary\u2019s subsequent career.\u201d He asks of a potential campaign: \u201cWhat is the case for Hillary? It boils down to this: She has experience, she\u2019s a woman, and it\u2019s her turn. It\u2019s hard to find any substantive political argument in her favor.\u201d He adds: \u201cSince leaving the State Department, Hillary has devoted herself to what we can only call\u2026Clinton, Inc. This fund-raising, favor-dispensing machine is key to understanding her joint enterprise with Bill\u2026That means nonstop self-promotion, huge book advances and fat speaking fees.\u201d Henwood could get nobody who is familiar with Hillary but Dick Morris to speak with him for publication, which does seem to indicate the lack of a positive case to be made and a defensive crouch -- a position that is very difficult to maintain for an extended period and win an election. We\u2019ll see how this reverberates in the world of left opinion. It is already quite clear that the progressives, i.e., the outright leftists who usually dominate the Democratic Party, are not happy with Hillary and would prefer someone else, like Elizabeth Warren. Hillary still has the money and muscle to dominate anyone presently on the horizon. But the more times the question of exactly what she has done to merit the presidency is asked, the better. A dispirited, grumbling progressive elite will not be able to fire up the base in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/10/liberal_mag_urges_readers_to_stop_hillary.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Liberal mag urges readers to 'Stop Hillary'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8af\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why its new cover story (available online to subscribers only), \u201cStop Hillary!\nLiberal mag urges readers to 'Stop Hillary'Harper\u2019s Magazine is venerable and reliably left wing magazine catering to a readership that (justifiably or not) prides itself on being intelligent and sophisticated.\nThe wannabe opinion leaders of the liberal community turning against Hillary leaves open the door for another Barack Obama-type of fresh-faced challenger.\nWe\u2019ll see how this reverberates in the world of left opinion.\nBut the more times the question of exactly what she has done to merit the presidency is asked, the better."}
