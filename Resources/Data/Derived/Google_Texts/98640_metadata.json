In the letter, Zahn calls the deal \u201cvalue destructive,\u201d and warns of a \u201clong, drawn-out and potentially extremely expensive process\u201d even if Vonovia investors allow the bid to proceed at their extraordinary shareholders meeting on Nov. 30.\n\n\u201cYou can expect us to do everything in our power to protect our own shareholders against this value-destroying takeover attempt,\u201d Zahn says in the letter. Vonovia shareholders who want to benefit from Deutsche Wohnen\u2019s growth potential should buy its stock instead, he said. \u201cWe would be delighted to welcome you as our shareholder.\u201d\n\nNina Henckel, a Vonovia spokeswoman, said the company made \u201can attractive offer,\u201d while declining to comment on Zahn\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to shareholders to decide on Nov. 30 whether to vote for the deal,\u201d Henckel said.\n\nResidential Demand\n\nGerman residential landlords have bought apartments and listed competitors in record volumes in the past two years as they seek to take advantage of favorable financing conditions, rising rents and growing demand for affordable apartments in large German cities. Vonovia owns 370,000 homes in cities such as Dresden and Berlin, while Deutsche Wohnen has 144,000 units, most of which are in the German capital.\n\nIn the letter, Zahn said that even if Vonovia investors approve, it\u2019s unlikely that a sufficient majority of his shareholders will offer their shares, which could result in a long battle for control.\n\nZahn also repeated his assessment that Vonovia won\u2019t be able to deliver the annual synergies of 84 million euros it has promised, and that high tax and financing costs resulting from the deal will reduce profits at the combined company by as much as 30 million euros per year.\n\n\u201cThis is not an attractive prospect for Vonovia shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should reject the proposed transaction in order to protect the value of your current investment in Vonovia.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Dalia Fahmy", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-08/deutsche-wohnen-urges-vonovia-investors-to-stop-hostile-takeover", "title": "Deutsche Wohnen Urges Vonovia Investors to Stop Hostile Takeover", "description": "Deutsche Wohnen AG Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn plans to publish a personal appeal to Vonovia SE shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against that company\u2019s planned takeover of Deutsche Wohnen and buy stock in his company instead.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Dalia Fahmy", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Michael Zahn,Vonovia SE,Deutsche Wohnen AG", "news_keywords": "Michael Zahn,Vonovia SE,Deutsche Wohnen AG", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-08/deutsche-wohnen-urges-vonovia-investors-to-stop-hostile-takeover", "parsely-title": "Deutsche Wohnen Urges Vonovia Investors to Stop Hostile Takeover", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-08T10:00:15.120Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Deutsche Wohnen AG Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn plans to publish a personal appeal to Vonovia SE shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against that company\u2019s planned takeover of Deutsche Wohnen and buy stock in his company instead.", "parsely-tags": "Michael Zahn,Vonovia SE,Deutsche Wohnen AG,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-11-08T10:00:15.120Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-08/deutsche-wohnen-urges-vonovia-investors-to-stop-hostile-takeover", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Deutsche Wohnen AG Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn plans to publish a personal appeal to Vonovia SE shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against that company\u2019s planned takeover of Deutsche Wohnen and buy stock in his company instead.", "title": "Deutsche Wohnen Urges Vonovia Investors to Stop Hostile Takeover"}, "fb": {"status": "Deutsche Wohnen AG Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn plans to publish a personal appeal to Vonovia SE shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against that company\u2019s planned takeover of Deutsche Wohnen and buy stock in his company instead."}, "parsely-post-id": "NXHOY2SYF01T01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Vonovia shareholders who want to benefit from Deutsche Wohnen\u2019s growth potential should buy its stock instead, he said.\nVonovia owns 370,000 homes in cities such as Dresden and Berlin, while Deutsche Wohnen has 144,000 units, most of which are in the German capital.\n\u201cThis is not an attractive prospect for Vonovia shareholders,\u201d he said.\nDeutsche Wohnen AG Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn plans to publish a personal appeal to Vonovia SE shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against that company\u2019s planned takeover of Deutsche Wohnen and buy stock in his company instead.\n\u201cYou should reject the proposed transaction in order to protect the value of your current investment in Vonovia.\u201d"}
