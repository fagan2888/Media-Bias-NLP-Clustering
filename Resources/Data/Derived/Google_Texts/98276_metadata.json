Here are some highlights:\n\nWhen asked what her worst decision as a leader was, Carly Fiorina went the \u201csometimes I care too much\u201d route and said \u201cthe hardest decisions are where you challenge the status quo.\u201d She did not mention any of those decisions, nor did she mention the time she fired 30,000 people when she was CEO of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nWhen asked whether humans were responsible for climate change, Scott Walker replied, \u201cI\u2019m an Eagle Scout. We were taught to leave our campsite cleaner when we left it.\u201d OK.\n\nGeorge Pataki was asked what three federal agencies he would eliminate. His choices: Obamacare, Common Core, and a 15 percent reduction in the federal workforce. None of those are federal agencies.\n\n\n\nThe moderator also asked Pataki who our tax code treated the most unfairly, to which he responded \u201cveterans\u201d who are only mentioned in the tax code when they receive additional benefits and breaks. He didn\u2019t mention how they were treated unfairly with respect to taxes, but he did complain about the VA.\n\nTed Cruz was asked what his deal with Iran would look like, but instead of answering he called President Obama\u2019s deal with Iran the greatest national security threat facing America.\n\nWhen asked what kind of justice he would appoint to the Supreme Court, Ben Carson mentioned you don\u2019t have to be a lawyer or judge to be a justice, which is true! And terrifying to think he would appoint someone completely unqualified.\n\nThe moderator also asked Rick Perry what agencies he\u2019d eliminate, and everyone had a laugh over his famous 2012 flub of that question. This time he played it safe and ignored the question entirely.\n\nBobby Jindal\u2018s first two executive orders? He\u2019ll overturn Obama\u2019s executive orders (OK, that counts) and will tell the Joint Chiefs to\u2026 tell other countries we\u2019re tough or something? That one was a real head-scratcher.\n\nRick Santorum was asked what the president\u2019s role should be in determining the nation\u2019s abortion policy, to which he naturally replied that the Supreme Court should not have legalized gay marriage.\n\nLast Pataki one, I promise, but he was really something else. When asked if there should be any restrictions on gun ownership, he said he wouldn\u2019t change the Second Amendment, but that we should \u201cenforce our mental health laws.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m starting to get what the Republicans see in Donald Trump.\n\nFollow BNR on Twitter\n\nALSO READ:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most GOP candidates gathered in New Hampshire to answer questions, one-by-one, about what they believed and what they'd do as president.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Most GOP candidates gathered in New Hampshire to answer questions, one-by-one, about what they believed and what they'd do as president.", "title": "You'll Definitely Believe How Much These GOPers Avoid Answering Direct Questions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GOPNewHampshire.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-06T06:51:10-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/youll-definitely-believe-how-much-these-gopers-avoid-answering-direct-questions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Most GOP candidates gathered in New Hampshire to answer questions, one-by-one, about what they believed and what they'd do as president.", "title": "You'll Definitely Believe How Much These GOPers Avoid Answering Direct Questions", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GOPNewHampshire.png"}, "creator": "@jesseberney", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "2016 GOP Presidential Primary,Ben Carson,Bobby Jindal,Carly Fiorina,George Pataki,Rick Perry,rick santorum,Scott Walker,ted cruz", "published_time": "2015-08-03T22:02:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T06:51:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd141e\"", "article_summary": "We were taught to leave our campsite cleaner when we left it.\u201d OK.George Pataki was asked what three federal agencies he would eliminate.\nThe moderator also asked Rick Perry what agencies he\u2019d eliminate, and everyone had a laugh over his famous 2012 flub of that question.\nHe\u2019ll overturn Obama\u2019s executive orders (OK, that counts) and will tell the Joint Chiefs to\u2026 tell other countries we\u2019re tough or something?\nThe night was a parade of misdirection, canned talking points, and world-class ignoring of the moderator.\nWhen asked whether humans were responsible for climate change, Scott Walker replied, \u201cI\u2019m an Eagle Scout."}
