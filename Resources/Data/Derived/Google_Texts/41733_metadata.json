In a sport where stage wins and overall performance in the general classification at the Tour are barometers of success, Cannondale-Garmin is still looking to shoot par for the course.\n\nCrashes, illness and poorly timed mechanical failures have all befallen their riders through 15 stages \u2014 with five more to go before the finale on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris\n\n\u201cJust have to keep trying every day and hope the luck breaks our direction,\u201d Cannondale-Garming manager Jonathan Vaughters told The Denver Post on Sunday.\n\nAfter a spectacular ride in Stage 10 by Sky\u2019s Chris Froome on the first day in the Pyrenees, Cannondale-Garmin was forced to alter strategy the second week toward focusing on stage wins and breakways. Co-leaders Andrew Talansky and Dan Martin both finished nearly 12 minutes back from Froome, ending any hope of them finishing in the top five of the general classification.\n\nThe strategy shift hasn\u2019t produced any victories yet \u2014 just close calls and repeat servings of bad luck.\n\nOn Friday, Australian Nathan Haas \u2014 riding in his first Tour \u2014 aggressively attacked the breakway on a downhill, but was caught inside 15 kilometers from the finish.\n\n\u201cGreat effort by Nathan. Super proud of him,\u201d Vaughters said. \u201cIt almost worked out. We\u2019ll keep searching for similar opportunities.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Talansky and Ryder Hesjedal joined a 20-man breakaway in an attempt to set up Talansky for the Stage 14 win. But in the late parts of the stage, with the gap between the peloton and a depleted five-man break at 40 seconds, Talansky punctured a tube and didn\u2019t have team support vehicles around to assist. Race day over.\n\nOn Sunday in Stage 15 to Valence, Hejedal \u2014 one of two riders left in a nine-rider breakaway \u2014 was caught with about 17 miles left in the stage. Ramunas Navardauskas finished sixth in a sprint finish, but Sebastian Langeveld dropped out of the race earlier in the stage with gastrointestinal illness, the team said, the second Cannondale-Garmin rider to withdraw from the Tour this year.\n\nAnd as the riders draw ever closer to Paris, the chances of unseating Froome diminish. Nairo Quintana, the young Colombian rider known for his prowess in the mountains, is second 3 minutes, 10 seconds behind Froome, and American Tejay van Garderen is third, sitting 3:32 back.\n\n\u201cQuintana might have a shot if the weather went crazy or Froome got ill or crashed,\u201d Vaughters said. \u201c(Tejay) will be hard pressed to stay where he is, so I think he\u2019s pretty focused on maintaining third.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cannondale-Garmin still seaching for elusive 1st stage win at Tour de France", "title": "Cannondale-Garmin still seaching for elusive 1st stage win at Tour de France", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/cannondale-garmin-still-seaching-for-elusive-1st-stage-win-at-tour-de-france/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_054221_cannondale-garmin.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_054221_cannondale-garmin.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T17:44:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:50:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb21d\"", "article_summary": "Boulder-based team Cannondale-Garmin knows this, but it doesn\u2019t make the struggles the team has endured any easier.\nThe Tour de France has an all-too-predictable way of laying waste to the best laid plans formed months in advance.\nIn a sport where stage wins and overall performance in the general classification at the Tour are barometers of success, Cannondale-Garmin is still looking to shoot par for the course.\nWe\u2019ll keep searching for similar opportunities.\u201dOn Saturday, Talansky and Ryder Hesjedal joined a 20-man breakaway in an attempt to set up Talansky for the Stage 14 win.\n\u201cQuintana might have a shot if the weather went crazy or Froome got ill or crashed,\u201d Vaughters said."}
