Mr. Drogin previously served as campaign manager for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2012 Senate campaign and then as the Senator\u2019s state director.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJust about every Republican running for president this year is campaigning as a conservative despite the fact that many of them do not have a record to back it up.\n\nThe second debate underscored the need to verify whether the assertions made on the campaign trail truly match the actual performance of the candidates.\n\nRepublican primary voters want a consistent conservative who has delivered on their promises. Voters want someone they can trust.\n\nThat candidate is U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nAfter he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, he immediately began fighting for the American people on issue after issue \u2014 from opposing Obamacare to defending the Second Amendment to stopping the debt.\n\nDuring his first year in the Senate, the most common feedback I heard from people across Texas was, \u201cWow. Finally, someone is doing what he said he\u2019d do.\u201d\n\nAs conservatives, we can\u2019t afford to nominate another \u201ccampaign conservative\u201d who says one thing in debates, but then does something decidedly different after the election. That disconnect between promise and performance is why so many Americans are upset with Washington.\n\nArmed with poll numbers, it\u2019s easy for a politician to say all the right things during a campaign. But what actually happens when they take office is what really matters. Did they support amnesty? Have they supported higher taxes, bigger government, Common Core, bailouts, and corporate welfare?\n\nTed Cruz was the only candidate on the debate stage who has consistently opposed amnesty. Many of the other candidates claim to have \u201cevolved\u201d on the issue in what can only be described as a convenient election year conversion.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so important for conservatives to unite now in support of a candidate who will keep his word.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to stand up to the Washington establishment, but that is exactly what Ted Cruz has done. He isn\u2019t afraid to stand up to the lobbyists and the party bosses who are destroying this country.\n\nDuring the debate, although he wasn\u2019t given much time, Senator Cruz demonstrated a steady, calm command of conservative issues and presented a clear vision for the future. He also showed willingness to tell the truth about what is really being done in Washington.\n\nHe took on the leadership in his own party over defunding taxpayer dollars for Planned Parenthood, saying Republicans \u201cshouldn\u2019t begin the fight by surrendering to Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nAnd he showed a Reagan-like ability to see the big picture in foreign affairs and maintained an unwavering focus on protecting America\u2019s national interests.\n\nIf we select another campaign conservative for the nomination, we will cross our fingers and hope for the best. But if we select Ted Cruz, we know that he will deliver.\n\nThat\u2019s why a grassroots army of freedom-loving Americans is rising up registering their support for Sen. Cruz. Conservatives know that if he wins, he will fight every day to make DC listen.\n\nJohn Drogin served as campaign manager for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2012 Senate campaign then as his state director.
