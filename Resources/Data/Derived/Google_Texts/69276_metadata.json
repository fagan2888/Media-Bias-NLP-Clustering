But it was a very pleasant scene, almost surreal, aided by weather so mild that some fans wore short-sleeves.\n\nSEE ALSO: Redskins notes: Three offensive line injuries hinder Washington\u2019s attack\n\nThen the game started. Long before it was over, mercifully, at 44-17, reality set in and 50 percent of the crowd checked out.\n\nWashington fans were numb by halftime and comatose by the end. They didn\u2019t have enough energy to boo \u2014 and they were outnumbered to boot \u2014 by the time the lead increased from 10 points midway through the fourth quarter to 27 points with about two minutes left.\n\nFittingly for this franchise, there were flashes that might suggest success isn\u2019t far off.\n\nThere was DeSean Jackson taking a simple receiver screen 69 yards for a touchdown and a 7-3 lead. There was halfback Roy Helu gaining 42 yard on the ground and 41 yards through the air. There was Pierre Garcon with a catch-and-run of 47 yards as Washington drove from its own 10-yard line to the Cowboys\u2019 7-yard line.\n\nBut quarterback Robert Griffin III threw an interception from the Cowboys\u2019 7. Most of Helu\u2019s yardage came in garbage time. And Jackson had just one other reception for 17 yards.\n\nMeanwhile, the defense gave up 294 yards of offense in the first half, playing as if they \u2014 like the fans \u2014 also were anesthetized by 24 losses (en route to 25) the last two seasons.\n\nNo one can blame the Washington fan base if it\u2019s dazed at this point. The back-to-back campaigns of 9-7 and 8-8 in 2007 and 2008 never looked better. Since then, aside from the aberrant 10-6 record in 2012 season, losses have numbered 12, 10, 11, 13 and 12.\n\nSometimes you wonder if the beatings have altered players\u2019 sense of the wretchedness they\u2019re part of.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance to do something special here,\u201d Griffin said after completing 27 of 41 passes for 336 yards with two interceptions and a fumble returned for a short touchdown. \u201cI think great things are ahead here \u2014 not only for this team, but for this city and for these fans who deserve better.\u201d\n\nOr maybe fans are getting what they deserve.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re dazed and confused because their blind allegiance hasn\u2019t resulted in more winning seasons. The lack of success has been disorienting for those who remember the glory years and can\u2019t believe the era occurred so long ago.\n\nBut the truth is the franchise is no better off now than it was when Mike Shanahan was hired. At least he had a Super Bowl pedigree. Now Washington has question marks in his old office and all over the roster.\n\nSurely coach Jay Gruden knows it as well as anyone, but he declined to discuss the obvious in detail right after the game.\n\n\u201cWe have to face a lot of things,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily we have some picks in the draft this year that are pretty high and it starts there with free agency and evaluation our talent. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to throw anybody under the bus and saw we need to upgrade this, this, this, right now.\u201d\n\nThe needs are clear: secondary, offensive line, linebackers \u2026 and defensive coordinator. Safety Ryan Clark continued to passionately support Jim Haslett, but the results dictate a change. The Cowboys scored two 65-yard touchdowns and had an 80-yarder called back.\n\nFans sat through this debacle of a season finale, not in disbelief but not all the way there, either. Mustering up a few half-hearted cheers was difficult; the game seemed out of reach even when Washington closed to 27-17 with 6:45 left.\n\nDallas got the ball and drove for a field goal. At one point during the drive, the scoreboard and cheerleaders urged the crowd to make noise. But it was useless. It was like Washington fans were detached from what was happening \u2014 or knew what would come next.\n\nBy the time Joseph Randle broke one tackle and raced 65 yards to create the final margin with 1:40 left, there were few burgundy jerseys in the stands. Those fans had long since departed.\n\nThey walked away in a fog, wondering what has happened to their team.\n\nMore importantly, when will it end?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington's supporters were numb by halftime and comatose by the end.
