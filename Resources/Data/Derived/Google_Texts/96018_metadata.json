On the Senate floor on Tuesday, McConnell suggested that Democrats should agree to a one-year delay in Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate in order to offset the cost of reinstating unemployment benefits for one year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to propose that\u2026 my side be allowed to offer an amendment to pay for these benefits by lifting the burden of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate for one year, and take care of our veterans who were harmed by the recently agreed to budget deal while we are at it, in the same amendment,\u201d the Kentucky lawmaker said.\n\nThe GOP has repeatedly pushed to delay Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, a proposal that would ultimately increase the number of uninsured Americans and raise premiums in the individual market. Health policy experts agree that it\u2019s too late to make such a major change to the structure of the health reform law, since the individual mandate \u2014 which incentivizes people to purchase health care \u2014 is a central component of Obamacare. On January 1, the health law\u2019s coverage expansion officially took effect.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that delaying this Obamacare provision could saving the U.S. $35 billion over the next 10 years. But that\u2019s because it would prevent millions of low-income people from accessing Medicaid coverage, so fewer taxpayer dollars would be spent on extending health care to that population.\n\nSen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has already rejected McConnell\u2019s request.\n\nQuickly reaching a deal on unemployment benefits, rather than haggling over proposals to attack the health law, could actually end up benefiting the economy. In the week immediately following Congress\u2019 failure to extend unemployment benefits, states lost out on $400 million. According to the CBO, if these federal benefits aren\u2019t restored, the U.S. could lose about 200,000 jobs this year due to reduced consumer spending.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Mitch McConnell suggests that Democrats should agree to a one-year delay of Obamacare's individual mandate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Mitch McConnell suggests that Democrats should agree to a one-year delay of Obamacare's individual mandate.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Attempts To Hold Unemployment Benefits Hostage For Obamacare Delay", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/07/3128111/mcconnell-obamacare-unemployment/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MitchMcConnell3x2-e1389987159206.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mitch McConnell suggests that Democrats should agree to a one-year delay of Obamacare's individual mandate.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MitchMcConnell3x2-e1389987159206-321x214.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell Attempts To Hold Unemployment Benefits Hostage For Obamacare Delay", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MitchMcConnell3x2-e1389987159206.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MitchMcConnell3x2-e1389987159206.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-07T11:05:29+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1090\"", "article_summary": "Health Mitch McConnell Attempts To Hold Unemployment Benefits Hostage For Obamacare Delay CREDIT: APAs Congress is attempting to negotiate a deal to extend unemployment benefits to the 1.3 million Americans who lost them at the end of December, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is seizing the opportunity to refocus attention on Obamacare.\nIn the week immediately following Congress\u2019 failure to extend unemployment benefits, states lost out on $400 million.\nThe GOP has repeatedly pushed to delay Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, a proposal that would ultimately increase the number of uninsured Americans and raise premiums in the individual market.\nOn the Senate floor on Tuesday, McConnell suggested that Democrats should agree to a one-year delay in Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate in order to offset the cost of reinstating unemployment benefits for one year.\nQuickly reaching a deal on unemployment benefits, rather than haggling over proposals to attack the health law, could actually end up benefiting the economy."}
