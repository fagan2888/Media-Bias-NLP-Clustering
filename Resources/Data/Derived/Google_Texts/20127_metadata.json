Intense coverage of economic news, good or bad, can amplify the swing in consumer sentiment directly attributable to the economic trend; and incorrect or skewed coverage of economic data can temporarily pull consumer sentiment against its tendency to flow with the actual economy.\n\nThat means news outlets dutifully reporting economic news, but engaging in hyperbolic or excessive coverage (say, during an election season, when ratings swell and the public is engaged) can undeservedly harm or goose an incumbent party.\n\nIt also means that if a news outlet's primary purpose is political engineering, it will have an incentive to play economic news strategically. And from that vantage point, conservative media's dismissive treatment of good economic news, along with good news about Obamacare and so on, is completely logical, as is its asymmetrical obsession with bad economic news, Obamacare glitches, and on down the line. If elections turn in large part on public perception of the economy, then weighing down that perception as much as possible isn't heavy-handed. It's judicious. At the level of individual story selection, it's all totally rational.\n\nBut taken together it sums to a tremendous amount of misinformation. And that in turn creates all kinds of detrimental strategic and political consequences. I don't mean just things like Karl Rove embarrassing himself on election night because he only put stock in polls (skewed or otherwise) that showed Romney winning. It also manifests as mutual incomprehension and gridlock, as a large swath of the population convinced that deficits are high and climbing, that the IRS only targeted conservative non-profits, that Obamacare created more losers than winners\u2014just as doomsayers predicted\u2014and should be repealed. It's all great fun if the only consequence is that partisans end up blindsided by election results everyone else saw coming. Less so when the political machine that created the alternative belief system suddenly has no room to negotiate or operate on real-world terms, because its adherents won't tolerate it.\n\nWhich is not to say that the conservative information bubble is entirely an artifact of discrete, rational actions that together comprise a perverse, irrational environment. There are actors on the right (much more than on the left) who are possessed of great confidence in their ability to create desired realities with the right combination of action, messaging, and commitment to purpose. Rove himself famously chest-puffed at Ron Suskind a dozen years ago that \"when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality\u2014judiciously, as you will\u2014we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.''\n\nI think a judicious study of the realities Karl Rove has been able to create wouldn't flatter him. And that we'd all be better off if he and his confederates started taking things as they are, not as they'd like things to be.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Last week, the Department of Labor released one of its strongest official jobs reports in years\u2014capping off the best five-month stretch of job growth in nearly a decade\u2014and if you're a consumer of conservative news, you probably had no idea.Indeed, if you get your news from Fox or conservative talk radio, you were much likelier to learn a couple weeks ago about outlying first quarter GDP figures (...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Fox News has every incentive to downplay any good news for Obama\u2014and the result is disastrous.", "title": "Conservatives Hurt the Economy When They Downplay a Good Jobs Report\u2014But It's a Rational and Effective Strategy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d6c68b021424d3c911e3a755fdc6344f5778d23d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/118610/fox-news-downplays-good-economic-news-and-they-have-reason", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News has every incentive to downplay any good news for Obama\u2014and the result is disastrous.", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d6c68b021424d3c911e3a755fdc6344f5778d23d.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Conservatives Hurt the Economy When They Downplay a Good Jobs Report\u2014But It's a Rational and Effective Strategy", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/d6c68b021424d3c911e3a755fdc6344f5778d23d.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Conservatives Hurt the Economy When They Downplay a Good Jobs Report\u2014But It's a Rational and Effective Strategy\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/118610/fox-news-downplays-good-economic-news-and-they-have-reason\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-09T11:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":118610,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Karl Rove\",\"Economy\",\"Economic Growth\",\"FOX News\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-07-09"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb14\"", "article_summary": "And from that vantage point, conservative media's dismissive treatment of good economic news, along with good news about Obamacare and so on, is completely logical, as is its asymmetrical obsession with bad economic news, Obamacare glitches, and on down the line.\nIt also means that if a news outlet's primary purpose is political engineering, it will have an incentive to play economic news strategically.\nI think a judicious study of the realities Karl Rove has been able to create wouldn't flatter him.\nStudies have shown that both the volume and tone of economic reporting can move consumer sentiment.\nIntense coverage of economic news, good or bad, can amplify the swing in consumer sentiment directly attributable to the economic trend; and incorrect or skewed coverage of economic data can temporarily pull consumer sentiment against its tendency to flow with the actual economy."}
