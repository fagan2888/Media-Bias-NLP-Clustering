Hicks said it remains to be seen if the company will be retained on that program or what direction Covered California will take. Accenture will remain the lead technology contractor overall for Covered California, he later added.\n\nIn an email response, Accenture spokeswoman Joanne Giordano pointed out that Covered California officials acknowledge the SHOP portal worked as designed.\n\n\u201cAccenture built the SHOP portal to the original, agreed specifications but then Covered California received good feedback from brokers and agents and is being responsive by focusing now on ways to enhance it,\u201d Giordano said.\n\nThere are no reports of similar issues with other states\u2019 SHOP portals.\n\nDespite the length of the shutdown, it\u2019s unlikely this technical issue will create the same furor as the troubles with the HealthCare.gov web site that stumbled out of the gate when Obamacare opened for business in October. The reason: SHOP is serving only small businesses of less than 50 employees. And those businesses aren\u2019t required to provide coverage for their employees but plan on doing so anyway and are seeking assistance though the public exchanges.\n\nFurther, Hicks said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of the 571 businesses representing 4,490 workers and dependents were filing paper applications anyway. Companies that want to go through public exchanges to insure workers can still do so, he added. Another 200 companies representing 1,200 people are being processed.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nMoody\u2019s says new Obamacare proposals would hurt insurer ratings\n\nMolina shares climb back on rosy forecast\n\nMedicines Co. plummets after FDA panel rejects drug", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-13T17:54:56-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "There's another Obamacare-related computer problem that has surfaced, but this one won't be as devastating to the Affordable Care Act as those responsible for the program's rocky start in October.", "title": "Flaws shutter Obamacare Web portal for small firms in California", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/13/flaws-shutter-obamacare-web-portal-for-small-firms-in-california/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU625_covere_MG_20140213174326.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Covered California,health care,Obamacare,small-business portal", "article.headline": "Flaws shutter Obamacare Web portal for small firms in California", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Covered California,health care,Obamacare,small-business portal", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "There's another Obamacare-related computer problem that has surfaced, but this one won't be as devastating to the Affordable Care Act as those responsible for the program's rocky start in October.", "article.published": "2014-02-13T17:54:56-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/13/flaws-shutter-obamacare-web-portal-for-small-firms-in-california/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "There's another Obamacare-related computer problem that has surfaced, but this one won't be as devastating to the Affordable Care Act as those responsible for the program's rocky start in October.", "title": "Flaws shutter Obamacare Web portal for small firms in California", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/13/flaws-shutter-obamacare-web-portal-for-small-firms-in-california/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU625_covere_MG_20140213174326.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2087", "article.updated": "2014-02-14T10:05:43-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d14\"", "article_summary": "Covered California Despite the \u201copen\u201d sign on Web portal for California small businesses, the site has been shuttered.\nIn an email response, Accenture spokeswoman Joanne Giordano pointed out that Covered California officials acknowledge the SHOP portal worked as designed.\n(Editor\u2019s note: Updates with statement from Accenture, says vendor will be retained for overall Covered California contract.)\nAccenture will remain the lead technology contractor overall for Covered California, he later added.\nThe Web portal known as the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, has been shuttered until the fall because design flaws have made it \u201ccumbersome\u201d for small businesses to go online to get coverage for employees, said Larry Hicks, Covered California spokesman."}
