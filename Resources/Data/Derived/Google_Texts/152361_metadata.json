Dennis Daugaard expects to hear soon whether he will receive federal approval for his plan to expand Medicaid, a federal health care program for needy individuals.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll hear by the end of the (legislative) session,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could hear in two weeks.\u201d\n\nDaugaard provided the update this week during an interview with the Press & Dakotan.\n\nHis plan calls for the federal government to pay the entire bill for Native Americans receiving care outside the Indian Health Service. In turn, the state \u2013 which currently covers half the amount for those patients\u2019 care \u2013 would use the freed-up dollars to expand Medicaid for another 50,000-55,000 South Dakotans.\n\nMedicaid expansion would cost the state an estimated $57 million by 2021, the governor said. The $57 million price tag would eat up the state\u2019s projected revenue growth factor of $59 million, leaving little or nothing for current or new programs, he said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where shifting all Native American health costs to the federal government comes into play, he said. The state paid $67 million for Native American health care last year, so freeing up those dollars would make Medicaid expansion affordable for South Dakota, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just asking the federal government to honor its treaty obligations (for providing Native Americans with health care),\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nThe Republican governor said he has seen encouraging signs from the federal government regarding his proposal.\n\n\u201cThe feds have put out a white paper on this,\u201d he said, referring to an authoritative report or guide on an issue. \u201cIt would affect not just South Dakota but all states with a Native population.\u201d\n\nAnyone with Native American ancestry, regardless of whether they live on a reservation, is entitled to use the Indian Health Service, he said.\n\nHowever, not all Native Americans live near an Indian Health Service facility, Daugaard said. In other cases, Native Americans may require additional or specialized care found in another facility, he said. The specialized care could range from cancer to cardiac problems to neonatal care.\n\nThe governor pointed to the example of a Yankton Sioux tribal member using Avera Sacred Heart Hospital in Yankton or a Rosebud Sioux tribal member using Rapid City Regional Hospital.\n\nFor Daugaard, the call for Medicaid expansion \u2013 given the proper funding \u2013 represents a change from his past position.\n\nHe had opposed expansion because of the demand for ongoing state funding, particularly as the federal share declines in future years. He also held concerns whether the federal government would honor its financial commitment. He pointed to the rising national debt and the federal government\u2019s past failure to pay its share of programs.\n\nHowever, Daugaard said his current proposal would allow Medicaid expansion without the ongoing commitment of additional state dollars.\n\nDaugaard acknowledged his proposal faces a challenge winning passage in the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats have actively sought Medicaid expansion in South Dakota. Democrats point to the available federal funds for Medicaid expansion and the projected boost to South Dakota\u2019s economy and health care. In addition, they note the prediction of lower medical costs under Medicaid expansion. Fewer low-income patients would postpone care until their condition worsened or rely on the emergency room for expensive treatment, they say.\n\nDistrict 18 Sen. Bernie Hunhoff (D-Yankton) has served on the governor\u2019s Medicaid expansion task force. Hunhoff stepped down from his legislative leadership role to focus on the issue.\n\nHunhoff told the Press & Dakotan Tuesday that federal officials had arrived in Pierre for a fact-finding mission on the governor\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cA team of IHS and Medicaid folks from Washington and around the state are here at the Capitol today, working to figure out some of the intricacies of how IHS and Medicaid might work together. I\u2019ll be meeting with some of them tonight, so I\u2019ll know more (Wednesday),\u201d Hunhoff said.\n\n\u201cBut overall, I believe the plan is coming together nicely. We may be able to provide health care access to 50,000 low-income South Dakota workers without raising taxes \u2014 and in fact by possibly spending less than we are today. So, as unbelievable as it sounds, it would be a big public policy win.\u201d\n\nHunhoff said he sees Daugaard\u2019s plan as a good starting point.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with all the details of the governor\u2019s plan. We should expand the poverty limits for Medicaid, for example,\u201d Hunhoff said. \u201cBut we\u2019re all going to have to compromise.\u201d\n\nHunhoff said he has seen opposition among some GOP lawmakers.\n\n\u201cSome of my Republican colleagues are justifiably concerned about the soundness of the federal budget and whether Medicaid expansion will add to the nation\u2019s deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid concern, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Affordable Care Act could actually reduce the federal budget by taking advantage of preventative care, improving technology and finding smarter ways of doing things, such as providing medical \u2018homes\u2019 or advisors for chronically ill patients who often need assistance as they access services.\u201d\n\nThe issue regarding federal coverage of Native American health care isn\u2019t new, Daugaard said. He pointed to frustrations experienced by former South Dakota governors Bill Janklow and Mike Rounds.\n\nJanklow complained to the federal government, while Rounds filed a lawsuit seeking relief, Daugaard said.\n\nMedicaid expansion and the agreement with the Indian Health Service could open the door for more medical options for Native Americans, Daugaard said.\n\nYankton Sioux tribal leaders have spoken about the growing problem of drug use \u2013 particularly methamphetamine \u2013 among tribal members.\n\nIn response to a question about the issue, Daugaard said law enforcement cases involving Native Americans are handled by tribal and federal officials. However, the governor said his health plan could offer more substance-abuse treatment for Native Americans and others.\n\nFollow @RDockendorf on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Yankton Press & Dakotan", "description": "Gov.
