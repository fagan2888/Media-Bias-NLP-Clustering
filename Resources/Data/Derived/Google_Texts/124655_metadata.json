Between 2000 and 2007, per capita health spending grew at an average annual rate of 7.55 percent. Then we saw a steep decline between 2008 and 2014, when the rate dropped to an average 3.2 percent per year.\n\nMany Americans, however, may be scratching their heads because they notice the effect health care costs have on their family budgets. That is because more of the burden for out-of-pocket costs is falling on the consumer, where the average deductible for an employer-provided health plan surged nearly 9 percent in 2015 to more than $1,000. In fact, consumers have seen their out-of-pocket costs nearly double since the 1970s. For these reasons and more, AARP is working to reduce the percentage of income currently allowed for those 64 and under to deduct medical expenses on their tax return and also to make sure the threshold point does not increase for the 65 and older, which it is set to do on Jan. 1, 2017.[1]\n\nAARP has endorsed HR 3590, bipartisan legislation introduced by Reps. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and 12 other members of the House of Representatives. Known as the Halt Tax Increases on the Middle Class and Seniors Act, it would roll back the threshold for the ability to deduct medical expenses from its current 10 percent of income for Americans under 64 years old. The bill also would prevent a scheduled tax increase from taking effect for those 65 and older, when next year the threshold would increase from its current 7.5 percent of income to 10 percent. Depending on the year, between 8 million and 10 million Americans claim this deduction on their tax returns, almost three-quarters of whom reported less than $75,000 in income.\n\nAARP supports this bill as a step in the right direction to restore needed tax relief for Americans with high out-of-pocket health care costs. According to preliminary 2013 IRS tax data, about 52 percent of those claiming the medical expense deduction earned $50,000 per year or less.\n\nAARP believes every effort should be made to keep the threshold for the medical expense deduction as low as possible to help protect people with high health care costs. This is consistent with our long-stated goal to increase health care access and affordability for all Americans, especially those age 50 and older who tend to have higher health care expenses.\n\nWe will continue to work with the bill\u2019s sponsors to pass this legislation into law. In the meantime \u2014 and of particular interest during tax season \u2014 the IRS lays out here all of the medical expenses for which you can claim a deduction.\n\n[1] Section 213(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n\nJoyce Rogers is AARP senior vice president for government affairs.
