JaVale McGee’s long injury saga has taken yet another negative turn.

The Nuggets reserve center is expected to be out a “significant” amount of time after he aggravated a muscle near the tibia in which he had a stress fracture repaired, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said Sunday.

“I heard six weeks at one point,” Shaw said. “I don’t know. I don’t think he’s anywhere close to coming back right now.”

McGee was back with the team on Sunday after taking a couple of days off to get his left leg examined by a doctor. He has played in just one game since Nov. 23.

“It’s unfortunate that he hasn’t been able to consistently be out there on the floor for us,” Shaw said. “From what I understand the area that he had the surgery on – the stress fracture – is fine. I think the muscle around that area, he’s done some damage to. So that’s what’s been very painful; it’s been hot. So that has to calm down. So I think he’s going to have to miss a significant amount of time for that to calm down.”

McGee, who missed 77 games last season due to the stress fracture, is averaging 5.4 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 14 appearances this season.
