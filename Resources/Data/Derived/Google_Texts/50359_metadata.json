But as the economy bloomed and conditions changed, the city reached 86 percent of the plan\u2019s office cap in the last four years alone.Calls to freeze growth come as cloud storage firm Box prepares to move to its new headquarters at 900 Middlefield Road, in one of the most significant real estate deals on the Peninsula this year. Scheduled for November, the move of Box\u2019s employees is expected to spur more development down the road, as it may attract shops, restaurants and transportation systems catering to the incoming workforce. The company currently has a little over 1,300 employees worldwide and expects to have around 1,000 employees in Redwood City when the move happens in November.Residents, who are upset about the height of the Box building, are now trying to prevent another project from gaining approval. Dostart Development Company is proposing a nine-story office building and 270 parking spots at 601 Marshall Street. Redwood City\u2019s Planning Commission says the 112-foot-tall building won\u2019t dwarf historic buildings like the City Hall of Justice (143 feet) or the Old Courthouse (118 feet). But residents remain skeptical, arguing that the project\u2019s modern architecture will change the downtown look and feel.\n\n\u201cIt is simply too much,\u201d said Tania Sole, who is running for city council in November. \u201cWithin less than 12 months, four huge buildings went up and totally changed the character of the city. We\u2019ve gone from a suburban environment, to an urban environment.\u201d\n\nSole calls for a new precise plan based on a five-year horizon that would account for changes to the area like the drought and new services like Airbnb. \u201cThese factors cascade down into society, and people don\u2019t always think of them until it hits them in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here, it hit people in the face really brutally, with the number of buildings that came up all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nA construction boom is indeed underway: 14 new buildings have been approved under the development plan, and six more are currently being reviewed. From the 500,000 square feet planned for commercial buildings, only 61,341 remain open. In contrast, 1,478 housing units were built to date, from the 2,500 capped \u2014 even though a specific objective of the Precise Plan was to provide more downtown housing.\n\nFor 30-year resident Dave Gahagen, organizer of group \u201cResidents for Sensible Growth in Redwood City\u201d and author of the \u201cToo Tall, Too Fast\u201d petition, the impact of the construction goes beyond downtown. \u201cMy concern is with the neighborhoods surrounding the area, because as these apartments and offices start to fill up, we\u2019re going to see a large influx of traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that a great deal of that traffic will go by my front door.\u201dGahagen believes that the city should allow smaller buildings, and perhaps more of them, at a slower pace. \u201cIf this was the case, I don\u2019t think commissioners would face the kind of antagonism that\u2019s being raised,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, development is like salt in a cookie recipe. If you don\u2019t have it, it tastes funny. But if you have too much, you ruin the recipe.\u201dFor Ralph Garcia, owner of Ralph\u2019s Vacuum on Main Street, a big part of the problem is that residents don\u2019t know how the growth will affect them personally, and the pace is frightening. \u201cObviously [the Precise Plan] is five years ahead of itself and it caught everybody off-guard. But people in general, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m guilty of it too, don\u2019t like change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Increased traffic, soaring construction and rising real estate costs have prompted more than 500 Redwood City residents to sign a petition asking for a moratorium on approval of new commercial buildings.", "title": "Redwood City residents pushing to slow construction amid building boom - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2_landscape_change.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-15T11:09:17+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/10/20/redwood-city-building-boom/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "Urban Development", "published_time": "2015-10-20T22:30:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-15T11:09:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Increased traffic, soaring construction and rising real estate costs have prompted more than 500 Redwood City residents to sign a petition asking for a moratorium on approval of new commercial buildings.", "creator": "@anacrochas", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2_landscape_change.jpg", "title": "Redwood City residents pushing to slow construction amid building boom - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd61a\"", "article_summary": "Increased traffic and soaring construction, combined with rising real estate costs, have prompted more than 500 Redwood City residents to sign a petition asking for a moratorium on approval of new commercial buildings.\n\u201cObviously [the Precise Plan] is five years ahead of itself and it caught everybody off-guard.\nFor 30-year resident Dave Gahagen, organizer of group \u201cResidents for Sensible Growth in Redwood City\u201d and author of the \u201cToo Tall, Too Fast\u201d petition, the impact of the construction goes beyond downtown.\nRedwood City\u2019s Planning Commission says the 112-foot-tall building won\u2019t dwarf historic buildings like the City Hall of Justice (143 feet) or the Old Courthouse (118 feet).\nIn contrast, 1,478 housing units were built to date, from the 2,500 capped \u2014 even though a specific objective of the Precise Plan was to provide more downtown housing."}
