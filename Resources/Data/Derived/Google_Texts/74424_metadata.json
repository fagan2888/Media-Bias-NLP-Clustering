Possibly next week. Any vested veteran (four years or more of NFL service time) who is on a team\u2019s season-opening roster automatically has his full-season salary guaranteed.\n\nVickerson is 31 and coming off a dislocated hip injury, which presents enough question mark for a team to minimize its risk.\n\nBut I would say this to the Bengals: Before he got hurt in game 11 last season at New England, Vickerson was the Broncos\u2019 best defensive lineman.
