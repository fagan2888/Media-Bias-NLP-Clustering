Holden\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Chris.\n\nI am writing in response to your letter (and accompanying materials) dated October 12, 2015. TeamHealth's Board of Directors carefully reviewed and considered AmSurg's proposal with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors. Our Board concluded that AmSurg's proposal is not in the best interests of TeamHealth and its stockholders. Our conclusion was based on the insufficient value indicated in the proposal, the execution risk of achieving that value, and other key strategic factors noted below.\n\nOur Board and management team are committed to executing our current strategic plan. We are extremely enthusiastic about our company's prospects and confident in our ability to grow value for our stockholders. The integration of IPC is a critical element of our plan and we will not compromise that effort. We commend your completion of the Sheridan acquisition, but as evidenced by our 35 year track record of successful acquisitions, we have ample expertise and resources to ensure the successful integration of IPC.\n\nWe agree with your observation that the physician services sector and the healthcare industry more generally are experiencing significant consolidation. While we can certainly understand why AmSurg would find a combination with TeamHealth appealing in such an environment, we are well positioned to independently seize advantageous transaction opportunities that may arise over time.\n\nWe appreciate the time and effort you committed to studying a combination with our company. However, we do not believe any purpose would be served by further discussions regarding your proposal.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Michael Snow\n\nMichael Snow\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/teamhealth-turns-down-78-billion-bid-amsurg-says-its-too-low", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/rejecting-money-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "TeamHealth rejected a $7.8 billion bid by ambulatory surgery giant AmSurg on Tuesday, saying the unsolicited bid undervalues the company.", "title": "TeamHealth turns down $7.8 billion bid by AmSurg, says it's too low"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/rejecting-money-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "TeamHealth rejected a $7.8 billion bid by ambulatory surgery giant AmSurg on Tuesday, saying the unsolicited bid undervalues the company.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "TeamHealth turns down $7.8 billion bid by AmSurg, says it's too low"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "TeamHealth rejected a $7.8 billion bid by ambulatory surgery giant AmSurg on Tuesday, saying the unsolicited bid undervalues the company.&#13; The bid, which had been privately rejected by TeamHealth before AmSurg went public with the proposal on Tuesday, offered $71.47 per share for the company, which at the time was about 36 percent higher than share price.
