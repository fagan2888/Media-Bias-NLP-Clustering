In a national election, this particular demographic can easily make or break a candidate\u2019s run due to its sheer size.\n\nWith an estimated 28 million small businesses across the country, this demographic ultimately represents millions more people courtesy of ownership groups and employees.\n\nCandidates who have already stepped up to the plate for 2016\u2019s run recognize this and are taking steps to reach out to this segment of the population to ensure votes come Election Day.\n\nCandidates, however, are being reminded that while 28 million small businesses exist in the country, there\u2019s a much larger segment of the \u201csmall business\u201d population that performs solo, freelance work.\n\nThis group, representing some 53 million people, is often overlooked by candidates, according to Fast Company.\n\nIts size, however, makes it especially important to candidates as they work to send home messages that resonate with the small business community.\n\nIssues that Matter\n\nCandidates who want to capitalize on the small business vote in the 2016 need to recognize that there isn\u2019t a single issue of importance to the demographic.\n\nSmall business owners cite a diversity of concerns, U.S. News & World Report notes, making it important for candidates to consider a broad agenda in regard to bolstering small business.\n\nSome of the issues that are of concern include:\n\nHelping small banks compete once more \u2013 The Dodd-Frank Act, adopted following the 2008 banking crisis, was an important undertaking to prevent future bank failures. The law, however, has made it difficult for many community banks, those often more likely to back small business, to survive, thrive and compete. Many small business owners would like to see some of the burdens removed from these localized financial institutions.\n\nGovernment contracts \u2013 The federal government has set goals for its agencies to award contracts to small businesses, including those owned by women and those established in economically disadvantaged areas. Despite those goals, the government has come up short on attainment. This is something many small business owners seeking agency contracts would like to see candidates remedy.\n\nRegulation release \u2013 The National Small Business Association would like to see an easing up on regulations that make it difficult for small businesses to function.\n\nTaxes \u2013 Many small business owners would like to see their taxes lowered and current tax breaks made permanent. Newsday points out, however, that achieving this goal might be easier said than done. Doing so would require an overhaul of tax laws and Congressional approval.\n\nMore services for freelancers \u2013 Solo businesses functioning the realm of the freelance world represent an estimated 53 million voting-age people, Fast Company points out. These independent workers would like to see such improvements as an extension of unemployment benefits to them, programs developed to assist and support them and greater access to capital to help them take risks necessary to grow their businesses.\n\nWhile candidates are already wooing small business owners, many publications warn that so far most promises offered have been more sound bite material than solid plans.\n\nWining over this rather large voting bloc, however, remains an important plank in most candidates\u2019 platforms even though small businesses are on firmer ground now than they were back in 2012.\n\n\u201cPresidential candidates aren\u2019t letting go of an issue they think will get them votes,\u201d U.S. News & World Report points out.\n\nAfter all, with 28 million small businesses in the country and millions more freelancers, why would they?\n\nGet Free Updates!
