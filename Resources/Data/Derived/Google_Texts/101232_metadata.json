The soon-to-be ex-Governor of Texas is flying in donors and policy wonks for a series of \u201cDecember sessions,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nThe sessions, taking place in Austin, are to assure the deep-pocketed GOP donors that Perry is a) a serious candidate and b) to show them that he has learned from his mistakes from 2012\u2013and it will be an entirely different campaign. Though many donors still like Perry, it\u2019s not just him running, or thinking about running, in 2016; the field is quite crowded\u2013and with good solid candidates to boot:\n\nThe small-group sessions kick off Tuesday and Wednesday in Austin with a pair of lunches and dinners held in the governor\u2019s mansion wedged between policy briefings at the nearby office of Perry senior adviser Jeff Miller. In all, Perry\u2019s team expects he will meet in person with more than 500 major donors and bundlers from around the country in December as well as a slew of operatives, Republican National Committee members and policy experts. \u2026 Things would be different if he ran again, say sources who have interacted with the three-term governor, who is leaving the office after having held it longer than any other person in Texas history. They describe his health as \u201ctip-top\u201d and his policy expertise as light years ahead of where it was in the last presidential cycle \u2014 all of which he intends to highlight in his December donor meetings. \u201cIf Gov. Perry is going to run, he\u2019s going to be better prepared, and he\u2019s going to have the resources necessary to compete,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Republican national committeeman who is helping plan for a Perry 2016 campaign and organizing next week\u2019s donor sessions. After next week, there will be an additional four or five sessions throughout the month, as well as an array of briefings held at Miller\u2019s office with policy experts from leading conservative think tanks, such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, according to those familiar with the planning. The sources said Perry has been receiving twice-a-week briefings on different policy areas for months, including one on health care this past week in Austin featuring leading Obamacare critic Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute. Perry also has been briefed \u2014both in Austin and over the phone \u2014 by Lanhee Chen, the highly regarded policy director for Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, who authored a 172-page job-creation outline for Romney and likely would have played a leading role in a Romney White House.\n\nIt's still not a done deal. Some donors are waiting to hear what former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has to say regarding his 2016 ambitions, others are waiting for Sen. Marco Rubio, and the rest are waiting to hear from other candidates before they make a decision.\n\nOne lobbyist quoted in the piece said, \u201cHe is a good guy, but Perry\u2019s time has passed.\u201d\n\nAlso, if Jeb does decide to run, his fundraising network virtually overlaps Perry\u2019s\u2013and there\u2019s some bad blood given that the Bush family backed former Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson\u2019s failed gubernatorial primary challenge in 2010.\n\nNonetheless, Rick Perry has held more events in Iowa than any other candidate considered to be a contender for the 2016 Republican nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BUT, donors aren't so sure..05/25/2016 21:39:12PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BUT, donors aren't so sure.", "title": "Matt Vespa - In Texas, Rick Perry Lays The Foundation For His Possible 2016 Run", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/12/03/in-texas-rick-perry-lays-the-foundation-for-his-possible-2016-run-n1926469", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/20/4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BUT, donors aren't so sure.", "title": "Matt Vespa - In Texas, Rick Perry Lays The Foundation For His Possible 2016 Run", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/12/03/in-texas-rick-perry-lays-the-foundation-for-his-possible-2016-run-n1926469", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/20/4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "In Texas, Rick Perry Lays The Foundation For His Possible 2016 Run, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18d9\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s pretty clear that Rick Perry is going to run for president\u2013or is seriously considering it\u2013by the time the 2016 election season begins.\nNonetheless, Rick Perry has held more events in Iowa than any other candidate considered to be a contender for the 2016 Republican nomination.\nThe soon-to-be ex-Governor of Texas is flying in donors and policy wonks for a series of \u201cDecember sessions,\u201d according to Politico.\nPerry is going to run, he\u2019s going to be better prepared, and he\u2019s going to have the resources necessary to compete,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Republican national committeeman who is helping plan for a Perry 2016 campaign and organizing next week\u2019s donor sessions.\n\u2026 Things would be different if he ran again, say sources who have interacted with the three-term governor, who is leaving the office after having held it longer than any other person in Texas history."}
