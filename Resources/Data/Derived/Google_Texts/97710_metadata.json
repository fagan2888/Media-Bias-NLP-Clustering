With its \"Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,\" or CIN, the agency plans to send researchers to grill reporters, editors and station owners about how they decide which stories to run. A field test in Columbia, S.C., is scheduled to begin this spring. The purpose of the CIN, according to the FCC, is to ferret out information from television and radio broadcasters about \"the process by which stories are selected\" and how often stations cover \"critical information needs,\" along with \"perceived station bias\" and \"perceived responsiveness to underserved populations.\"\n\nIn fact, the FCC is now expanding the bounds of regulatory powers to include newspapers, which it has absolutely no authority over, in its new government monitoring program.\n\nThe FCC has apparently already selected eight categories of \u201ccritical information\u201d \u201cthat it believes local newscasters should cover.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, the Obama Administration has developed a formula of what it believes the free press should cover, and it is going to send government monitors into newsrooms across America to stand over the shoulders of the press as they make editorial decisions.\n\nThis poses a monumental danger to constitutionally protected free speech and freedom of the press.\n\nEvery major repressive regime of the modern era has begun with an attempt to control and intimidate the press.\n\nAs Thomas Jefferson so eloquently said, \"our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.\"\n\nThe federal government has absolutely no business determining what stories should and should not be run, what is critical for the American public and what is not, whether it perceives a bias, and whose interests are and are not being served by the free press.\n\nIt\u2019s an unconscionable assault on our free society.\n\nImagine a government monitor telling Fox News it needed to cover stories in the same way as MSNBC or Al Jazeera. Imagine an Obama Administration official walking in to the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal and telling it that the American public would be better served if it is stopped reporting on the IRS scandal or maybe that reporting on ObamaCare \u201cglitches\u201d is driving down enrollment.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything more brazenly Orwellian than government monitors in newsrooms.\n\nIs it any wonder that the U.S. now ranks 46th in the world for freedom of the press? Reporters Without Boarders called America\u2019s precipitous drop of 13 places in its recent global rankings \u201cone of the most significant declines\u201d in freedom of the press in the world.\n\nFreedom of the press is proudly extolled in the First Amendment, yet our nation now barely makes the top fifty for media freedom.\n\nWe cannot allow the unfathomable encroachment on our free speech and freedom of the press to continue.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen, and defeated, this kind of attempt to squelch free speech before in the likes of the Fairness Doctrine and the Grassroots Lobbying Bill (incidentally one of my first projects at the ACLJ). Each one of these euphemistically named government programs is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to circumvent the Constitution and limit free speech \u2013 speech that the government finds inconvenient. They\u2019re equally unconstitutional, and they each must be defeated.\n\nJoin the ACLJ as we take a stand. Sign the ACLJ\u2019s Petition to Stop the Obama FCC\u2019s Free Speech Monitors.\n\nThis article is crossposted on Red State.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ)", "language": "en-us", "og": {"site_name": "American Center for Law and Justice", "description": "The Obama Administration\u2019s Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is poised to place government monitors in newsrooms across the country in an absurdly...", "title": "Why is the Obama Administration Putting Government Monitors in Newsrooms? | American Center for Law and Justice", "url": "http://aclj.org/free-speech-2/why-is-obama-administration-putting-government-monitors-in-newsrooms", "image": "http://media.aclj.org/fs/RTR2A0I2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aclj", "image": {"src": "https://7676076fde29cb34e26d-759f611b127203e9f2a0021aa1b7da05.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/fs/RTR2A0I2.jpg"}, "description": "The Obama Administration\u2019s Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is poised to place government monitors in newsrooms across the country in an absurdly...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why is the Obama Administration Putting Government Monitors in Newsrooms? | American Center for Law and Justice"}, "google-translate-customization": "b9e3cfed32f5d748-542d1652bc3059d9-gd4d1c5bb4fc58f82-8", "revisit-after": "1 day", "article": {"section": "Free Speech", "published_time": "2014-02-19T00:22:46.000Z"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "description": "The Obama Administration\u2019s Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is poised to place government monitors in newsrooms across the country in an absurdly..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd34\"", "article_summary": "Sign the ACLJ\u2019s Petition to Stop the Obama FCC\u2019s Free Speech Monitors.\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is poised to place government monitors in newsrooms across the country in an absurdly draconian attempt to intimidate and control the media.\nEach one of these euphemistically named government programs is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to circumvent the Constitution and limit free speech \u2013 speech that the government finds inconvenient.\nWe cannot allow the unfathomable encroachment on our free speech and freedom of the press to continue.\nWith its \"Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,\" or CIN, the agency plans to send researchers to grill reporters, editors and station owners about how they decide which stories to run."}
