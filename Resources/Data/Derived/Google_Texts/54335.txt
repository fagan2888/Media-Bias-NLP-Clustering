WELLSVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TotalCare Wellness, Inc. has issued a series of white papers on best practices in incentive management for workplace wellness programs. The white papers, authored by senior vice president Bill Danylik, discuss the impact of incentive programs on human resource benefit budgets, offer a comparison of various wellness incentive models, and suggest best practices for designing a program to yield the best results. The white papers are free to download from the TotalCare Wellness Knowledge Center.

Danylik says, “Many employers are unaware of a key provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that enables deep financial incentives associated with employee contributions to the cost of health insurance.” He notes that this ACA provision allows employers to build wellness programs that incent participation, and conversely, to charge nonparticipants up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance. In the case of smoking, the allowable incentive grows to 50 percent. Danylik says, “These mechanisms mean that adding robust employee wellness benefits can be essentially revenue neutral in the short term, and over the longer term, can yield significant productivity benefits associated with improved health of the employee population.”

Danylik notes that there are many varieties of incentive programs and that some employers choose to start small with alternative programs, even non-cash based options. “The ultimate goal is to get more employees engaged in a healthier lifestyle,” he notes.
