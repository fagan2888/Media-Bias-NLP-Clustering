On his radio show Friday evening, Michael Savage claimed that by spending all his efforts on defunding Obamacare, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has engaged in “autoerotic asphyxiation.” According to Savage, Republicans should have let Obamacare take effect so they could pin its negative effects squarely on the Democrats.

“I’d rather have a tooth transplanted into my head than ever have to listen to any conservative bellyaching about Obamacare ever again,” Savage began the monologue. “I don’t know how anyone could take it. How could that be the entire be all end all of the Republican Party?”

While those words may sound supportive of the president’s healthcare bill, Savage clarified that “yes, [Obamacare] is Fidel Castrocare; yes, it’s a catastrophe.” However, he continued, “My position would have been a little different from that of Ted Cruz, who, I would say, has self-asphyxiated from auto-eroticism.”

Savage alleged that by spending his political capital on defunding Obamacare, the Texan senator has engaged in “self-eroticism.” Independent voters, the radio host said, are “fed up with losing,” and so Cruz will further alienate them because, ultimately, he will lose this battle.
