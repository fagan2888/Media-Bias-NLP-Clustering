House Republicans insist on defunding Obamacare, a demand that the Democratic majority Senate is poised to reject this week. Without a deal in place by Oct. 1, the big threat is a government shutdown.\n\nRELATED: MISSING: A GOP EXIT STRATEGY ON BUDGET BATTLE\n\nThat\u2019s a problem \u2013 though Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and many economists think it\u2019s small potatoes compared to what happens in the middle of October.\n\nAt that point, the Treasury Department exhausts the extraordinary measures in place since May to stave off the debt ceiling. The U.S. government, already $16.7 trillion in debt, starts to default on many obligations.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the mere threat of a default back in 2011 was enough to cause the stock market to plunge, hiring to stall, and economists to warn about a recession on the horizon. All of this could be repeated \u2013 but the Fed might not have the ability to cushion the blow.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve's policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on course,\u201d Bernanke said last week in a news conference. \u201cThat being said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited.\u201d\n\nThe fallout would be so devastating that many economists think its specter should be enough to force Obama and Congress to reach an agreement on the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cThis would be disastrous,\u201d Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank, said in a Monday note. \u201cBecause the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling would be so severe, Republicans and Democrats are likely to work out a deal to increase it before the Treasury Department becomes unable to borrow.\u201d\n\nBut just how a deal comes together remains a mystery for the moment.\n\nWHAT THE GOP WANTS\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) recently previewed what the GOP wants in return for raising the debt limit. The wish list includes a delay to implementing Obamacare, tax reform, means-testing on Medicare, and approval to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The House could vote on the proposal\u2014which would raise the debt ceiling through the end of 2014\u2014as early as Friday.\n\nObama refuses to even approach the bargaining table, a position that could become untenable as the deadline approaches.\n\n\u201cWhat I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy,\u201d he said last week in a speech to the Business Roundtable. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible. The last time we did this in 2011, we had negative growth at a time when the recovery was just trying to take off.\u201d\n\nThat previous face-off shows that an extremely rocky road lies ahead. The White House and Capitol Hill eventually reached a last-minute deal in the summer of 2011 that involved more than $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, including the sequester that forced automatic reductions to the budgets of the Pentagon and discretionary social programs.\n\nWhen that drama played out, the stock market plunged, and with it, some investors\u2019 retirement savings. The S&P 500 index dropped by 14.63 percent from July 22 to Aug. 19, 2011. It took six months for stock prices to recover from the dip after a last-minute deal.\n\nSince the House passed its temporary spending measure to defund Obamacare last Friday, the S&P has already fallen by 1.58 percent, closing on Monday at 1,701.84.\n\nINVESTORS: BE PREPARED\n\nOppenheimer Funds\u2019 chief economist Jerry Webman expects some kind of deal to be reached, but \u201cinvestors should be prepared for volatility in the coming weeks, as the brinksmanship in these situations has a recent history of lasting until the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute.\u201d\n\nRELATED: WALL STREET WATCH: FROM FED SURPRISE TO FISCAL SHOCK\n\nThe Treasury market could be even crazier. When a country defaults on obligations, the interest rate paid on its debt should increase\u2014making it harder for everyone to borrow. Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the government\u2019s credit rating in response to the near catastrophe in 2011. In that year, the debt ceiling crisis caused enough of a panic that Treasury notes became a safe haven, with interest rates on the 10-year dropping below 2 percent as investors piled in. The 10-year yield is currently 2.7 percent.\n\nBizarrely, market gyrations did little in 2011 to influence the debt ceiling talks. Politicians seemed unresponsive to the signals coming from investors, doing little to change their rhetoric as the country came perilously close to an unprecedented default.\n\nWith the debt ceiling in 2013, there are overlapping risks that could amplify the damage this time around. Unlike two years ago, the negotiations could occur after a government shutdown, the economic equivalent of being hit by two earthquakes.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America put the odds of a government shutdown at 30 percent, up from 15 percent just a week ago. Brian Gardner, the Washington analyst for the investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, has the chances at 40 percent.\n\nAnd even if Obama and Congress reach a deal on spending, it would only last until Dec. 15. So the debt ceiling is sandwiched between two major budget quarrels.\n\n\u201cThis crisis is sure to last until Christmas and thus could become a headwind for the economy\u2014maybe not a howling headwind, but in a recovery that\u2019s still fragile, this nonsense doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at the Potomac Research Group.\n\nCAPITAL HILL CHAOS\n\nThe potential crisis suddenly has the Fed trying to game Capitol Hill when setting policy, a choice that could weaken the central bank\u2019s credibility as it attempts to steer through the recovery.\n\nLast week, Fed officials decided to continue stimulating the economy with bond purchases totaling $85 billion a month. The market had anticipated that the Fed would reduce the size of its purchases, as suggested by past guidance.\n\nNew York regional Fed president William Dudley said in a Monday speech that \u201cfiscal uncertainties\u201d with Congress influenced their decision. But Dallas regional Fed president Richard Fisher countered in a separate speech that deferring to those concerns hurt the authority of the central bank\u2019s guidance. \u201cYou should never wink at a girl in the dark,\u201d he said. \u201cOur communications policy is a little off \u2013 we should work harder to refine it.\u201d\n\nAll of this creates a troubling hazard for navigating through the debt ceiling maze. If the White House and Capitol Hill are gridlocked, then the ability of the Fed to respond may also be compromised, leaving the economy vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWhen agendas of U.S. politicians do not converge in the national interest and do not have the full or broad support of the country,\u201d David Kotok, co-founder of Cumberland Advisors, wrote to investors, \u201cproblems arise when politics intervene in the conduct of central banking.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The current budget showdown is just a teaser for a vicious battle over the debt ceiling, which could easily tank the entire economy.", "title": "Why Political Gridlock Could Sink the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Why-Political-Gridlock-Could-Sink-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Why-Political-Gridlock-Could-Sink-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_article.jpg", "creator": "@joshboak", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The current budget showdown is just a teaser for a vicious battle over the debt ceiling, which could easily tank the entire economy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last week, Fed officials decided to continue stimulating the economy with bond purchases totaling $85 billion a month.\nWith the debt ceiling in 2013, there are overlapping risks that could amplify the damage this time around.\nAt that point, the Treasury Department exhausts the extraordinary measures in place since May to stave off the debt ceiling.\nThe House could vote on the proposal\u2014which would raise the debt ceiling through the end of 2014\u2014as early as Friday.\n\u201cOur communications policy is a little off \u2013 we should work harder to refine it.\u201dAll of this creates a troubling hazard for navigating through the debt ceiling maze."}
