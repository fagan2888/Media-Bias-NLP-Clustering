He made her the agency\u2019s chief clinical officer in 2010 at a time when both he and the non-profit were in hot water.\n\nBy the end of 2011, Larcenaire was gone and a reconstituted board named Daugherty interim CEO about the same time that El Paso MHMR\u2019s name changed to Emergence Health Network.\n\nShe calls the next eight months \u201cthe longest job interview of my life.\u201d\n\nAfter conducting a national search for a permanent chief executive officer, the Emergence board gave the job to the woman who was already doing the job.\n\nAt the time, the agency responsible for public mental health care services in El Paso was, Daugherty herself says, broken in the eyes of local officials, the public, the people it was supposed to serve and their families.\n\n\u201cThere was a really unfortunate climate and culture here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe attitude was, \u2018These are very sick and poor people. Where else are they going to go?\u2019\u201d\n\nDaugherty recognized that attitude had to change if Emergence was ever going to do its job.\n\nSo did the community\u2019s attitude that one underfunded non-profit was solely responsible for the tens of thousands of children and adults in need of mental health services in El Paso.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since then,\u201d she said.\n\nA meeting of CEOs from area hospitals, the Paso del Norte Health Foundation and Emergence about the fate of the state psychiatric hospital led to a much larger discussion and a critical study of mental health services in El Paso.\n\nAnd that led to an unprecedented alliance, the El Paso Behavioral Health Consortium, made up of public officials, CEOs and agencies who are working with Emergence to bring mental health out of the shadows.\n\nDaugherty sat down with El Paso Inc. for a long conversation about mental health at the family level, how the turnaround at Emergence has gotten the state\u2019s attention, Obamacare, talking to your kids and her thoughts on marijuana.\n\nQ: People have always had a lot of strange ideas about mental problems, probably because we just don\u2019t understand them. This is a big question, but what causes mental health problems? Are people born with them or are they the result of bad experiences growing up?\n\nThere\u2019s many different interpretations of that in my opinion. You could be predisposed to mental illness. There is a lot of research going on now regarding predisposition to mental illness. We could all be carrying around a gene that never goes active. You\u2019re born with it. A lot of times, it\u2019s triggered by trauma. If you have an adverse childhood experience or some sort of traumatic event in your life, it could trigger that gene.\n\nThat\u2019s the research going on now. It\u2019s a chemical imbalance. So you have to think about diabetes and things like that being a chemical imbalance and some of those kinds of things are predisposed, too.\n\nMental illness has been around for a long, long time, but I think the attention to the root cause of it is fairly new in the research. We\u2019re not just putting people in institutions anymore and letting them sit there until they pass away. I think we\u2019re now looking at what are the root causes of mental illness.\n\nQ: How important is it to recognize these issues early? What difference can it make?\n\nIt makes a huge difference. The first episode of a mental illness, whether it is depression or psychosis, is so much more manageable than something that had decompensated or deteriorated to a point of delusions or when paranoia has set in. They\u2019re more likely to be receptive to some sort of help.\n\nThat\u2019s where we as an industry have failed, but it\u2019s being recognized now. When it comes to early adverse experiences, they\u2019re looking at young kids that were abused or neglected and how that has affected them later in life. We see a traumatic event as a cause of mental illness or something that will have an effect later in life.\n\nWe all say you\u2019ve just got to toughen up and deal with it. But some people deal with things differently, and I think we have to look at it not only from a perspective of recognizing signs and symptoms but also recognizing events in individuals\u2019 lives that could cause affects down the road and address them.\n\nQ: What should parents look for and when should they seek professional help for a child or a student in class?\n\nIn children, you\u2019ve got to look at immediate changes in behavior, in friends, grades or interests. If you have a kid who\u2019s very social and then all of a sudden, they\u2019re not interested in things, that\u2019s a huge sign.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to talk to your kids. I have a son who\u2019s 9, and one of the things that we do every night, if it\u2019s possible, is the TV goes off, phones go off and we sit down and have dinner every night, and we talk about what\u2019s going on. He asks me questions, too. We have that exchange and it\u2019s gotten to where he\u2019s very comfortable talking to me. If he\u2019s got a kid at school who\u2019s being mean to him or whatever. Bullying is an unfortunate thing. Kids can be kind of cruel.\n\nWe talk about how he\u2019s going to deal with it tomorrow. Then we talk about it tomorrow, about how it went. You\u2019ve got to talk to your kids. You\u2019d be amazed what your kids want to tell you, and it\u2019s critical that you listen.\n\nQ: This is a little off track, but what are your thoughts on marijuana use and legalization? Do you have concerns from a mental health standpoint?\n\nI do. The problem with marijuana is it\u2019s not just marijuana. It\u2019s laced with something sometimes and you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. I don\u2019t know if you want to compare it to cigarettes, but it\u2019s a stage-one addiction to me, and that\u2019s just my opinion. You start with something that they say is not that big a deal, but they get addicted and then what\u2019s next? What\u2019s next?\n\nQ: The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, puts mental health on the same level as physical health and requires insurers to cover mental health care. How is that working?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of working. Affordable care is not necessarily working. If that\u2019s not working, then the parity may not be working. The thing about parity is, in concept, it\u2019s an amazing idea. In practical terms, it\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s very hard for the mental health industry to meet the need.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the providers. We don\u2019t have the funding. We don\u2019t really have the ability to meet all of the needs. But I think in concept, it\u2019s a great idea. We need to work harder and figure out how to get more folks coming out of school with psychiatry degrees.\n\nMental health parity keeps me up at night because we don\u2019t have the workforce to meet that need.\n\nQ: You mean the industry as a whole, public and private?\n\nThe industry as a whole. The public is competing with the private for the same body as far as the workforce is concerned. But I can\u2019t compete on the salaries with the VA and Beaumont and some of those larger providers.\n\nQ: Are we seeing a significant new demand, a surge of people looking for mental health services? Or is this something people are really not aware of?\n\nThere has not been a surge. I still think the stigma attached to mental health stands in the way of people seeking services.\n\nI was talking with someone recently who said we shouldn\u2019t be saying let\u2019s reduce the stigma of mental illness because you\u2019re saying there\u2019s something wrong with being mentally ill. I completely agree with that. There is nothing wrong with seeking treatment. It is an illness, just like any other illness. There are very successful treatments, whether it\u2019s a medication or therapy, and there are so many successful people living life every day with a mental illness.\n\nQ: I have a friend who is bipolar and has had terrible episodes in her life, but she says, \u201cWhen I\u2019ve got my meds right, everything is just perfect.\u201d She is doing wonderfully now and is very successful.\n\nWhen I do different speaking and even when I talk to our new employees, I say you have to constantly remind yourself that mental illness is the only illness that when you don\u2019t take your medication, you\u2019re at risk of going to jail. There\u2019s something wrong with that.\n\nQ: What brought you to El Paso?\n\nI was recruited by the previous CEO, Gary Larcenaire, to work with a subsidiary that this company owns that\u2019s not really involved in the state dollars. I came in as a contract consultant. I was doing some other things and this sounded interesting because it was a big mess. It was a subsidiary that needed accredited work and that was very interesting to me because that\u2019s what I do very well.\n\nQ: El Paso MHMR was in financial trouble when you came. What was the problem?\n\nBack then the center was kind of shaky because they were not maximizing their billing capabilities. But we\u2019re very good at that now. I brought that from the private sector where you don\u2019t leave dollars on the table.\n\nQ: Did you see yourself working at this level when you were doing social work in the field?\n\nNo, I always knew my forte was program development and fixing things that were broken and giving it to someone else to deliver the service. So when Gary Larcenaire brought me over to do that, it was a challenge and I was interested.\n\nI was deciding what I really wanted to do with my career at the time. I was looking at leaving El Paso, and then things progressed and all of a sudden, I\u2019m sitting in a CEO seat in El Paso and glad to be here.\n\nQ: People are probably wondering how long you\u2019ll be here before another agency in another city or state lures you away.\n\nI have work to do here.\n\nQ: In a 2013 comparison of spending on mental health by states, Texas was No. 47. How much has Emergence\u2019s funding increased since then and what difference has that made in El Paso?\n\nWe\u2019ve increased our budget quite a bit, but it\u2019s not all state money. Over a five-year period, we were able to bring $23 million in new federal money into the system. That has been huge and has had a major impact on what we\u2019ve been able to do.\n\nThe state has also increased our funding so we wouldn\u2019t have a wait list for services. They\u2019ve infused some money so we can expand manpower in a crisis to be available. They\u2019ve also given us money because our psych hospital tends to not have beds available. They\u2019ve given us money to purchase beds at El Paso Behavioral Health.\n\nQ: What new services is Emergence offering?\n\nWe\u2019re offering the same services. On our outpatient clinics, we have a set standard of services the state expects us to offer. We\u2019re offering the same services \u2013 we\u2019re just doing a better job of it. People aren\u2019t waiting four hours to see their doctor, they\u2019re waiting 30 minutes, or they\u2019re getting in and out in 30 minutes.\n\nI\u2019m not exaggerating \u2013 it was bad, because of capacity. Caseworkers were carrying 60 clients. Now they\u2019re carrying 25 because we\u2019ve gotten better at billing and collecting, and I can afford more caseworkers.\n\nWe\u2019ve been able to increase our ability to operate as a business from billing, collecting and authorization to where I\u2019m pulling in money, so I can spend money.\n\nQ: But you do have services that weren\u2019t offered when you got here, right?\n\nThe extended observation unit is a new service. It\u2019s 11 beds over at 1600 Montana and it\u2019s a 48-hour observation unit for people who are in a psychiatric crisis. They can stay there on an emergency detention or voluntarily. They\u2019re seen within 15 minutes by a psychiatrist, usually by tele-med.\n\nThere are nurses there, qualified mental health professionals, licensed professional counselors, and they get served. They get their medications. They\u2019re stabilized with the hope that they don\u2019t go to the hospital.\n\nQ: How far has Emergence come?\n\nI can honestly say the support that Emergence gets from the community has come leaps and bounds. We really appreciate the type of support we get now from the community and from the elected officials. When I took over, we didn\u2019t have that.\n\nIt allows me to do my job and maybe push the envelope a little and try to get things moving at the state or federal level. We\u2019ve put El Paso back on the map. El Paso really wasn\u2019t a player in Austin, and we are now.\n\nWe are being recognized for the things we do and are able to draw money in from grants because El Paso is considered a place to watch and see what\u2019s happening in the mental health system.\n\nEmergence has gained respect in the community. People look to us for guidance and advice on mental health services. It really makes a difference in where we\u2019re going.\n\nI believe we\u2019re getting to the point where people are talking the same language and are on the same page. Before, we weren\u2019t even in the same book.\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter David Crowder at dcrowder@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422, ext. 122 and (915) 630-6622.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "Kristi Daugherty has come a long way, from a social worker in the field to a rising star as Emergence Health Network\u2019s CEO, and she has brought El Paso\u2019s non-profit mental health authority a long way, too.", "title": "Kristi Daugherty, CEO, Emergence Health Network", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/q_and_a/article_6fb7929c-e488-11e5-9310-b779c02af8f2.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b3/3b38bac2-e489-11e5-b2e1-cf796e07ce66/56ddb8f003f94.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Kristi Daugherty has come a long way, from a social worker in the field to a rising star as Emergence Health Network\u2019s CEO, and she has brought El Paso\u2019s non-profit mental health authority a long way, too.", "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "kristi daugherty,el paso inc,emergence health network,obamacare,marijuana,paso del norte health foundation,david crowder,q_and_a", "news_keywords": "kristi daugherty,el paso inc,emergence health network,obamacare,marijuana,paso del norte health foundation,david crowder,q_and_a"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c6f\"", "article_summary": "Q: The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, puts mental health on the same level as physical health and requires insurers to cover mental health care.\nComing to El Paso, she started on an MBA and a consulting job working with El Paso Mental Health Mental Retardation in 2008.\nBy the end of 2011, Larcenaire was gone and a reconstituted board named Daugherty interim CEO about the same time that El Paso MHMR\u2019s name changed to Emergence Health Network.\nKristi Daugherty has come a long way, from a social worker in the field to a rising star as Emergence Health Network\u2019s CEO, and she has brought El Paso\u2019s non-profit mental health authority a long way, too.\nQ: Are we seeing a significant new demand, a surge of people looking for mental health services?"}
