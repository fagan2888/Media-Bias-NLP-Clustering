SARASOTA â€” The Historical Sarasota Lawn Bowling Club is hosting an Open House event from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m this Sunday.

The free family will include opportunities to play, as well as give-aways and snacks, according to a release.

Shoes, I'm told, are optional.

Lawn bowling is a historically European sport that has gained traction in America, particularly in Florida. The game has been played on the waterfront in Sarasota since 1927. The club is scheduled to host the 2016 and 2017 U.S. Open Lawn Bowling Championships.

Similar but not the same as bocce ball, players roll biased composite "bowls" toward targets on a green.

Find the Historical Sarasota Lawn Bowling Club at 809 N. Taimiami Trail (next to the Sarasota Municipal Auditorium and in front of the Van Wezel on 10th and Highway 41).
