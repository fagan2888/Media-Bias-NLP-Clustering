Finally. Last week, the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points. It did so again yesterday morning, before recovering most of the loss by midday. The financial reporters were chasing their tails faster than ever. \u201cThe market is down! What does it mean?!\u201d And then, hours later: \u201cThe market is recovering! What does it mean?!\u201d\n\nBut counterintuitively, what working Americans saving for retirement really need is a market crash that lasts.\n\nA little behind saving for retirement? You need a grizzly bear market\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diligently saving for retirement, say in your 401(k) or IRA, you\u2019ve been buying into a rising market for the past six and half years. And that\u2019s fine, but you could really use a good, solid break in the market. A deep sustained bear market.\n\nThat\u2019s when your retirement savings gets turbocharged. You\u2019ll be buying the market at a discount for the first time in years. With each paycheck-deducted contribution into your retirement savings, you\u2019ll be snapping up shares at a faster than ever pace. You deserve more bang for your buck. With a really horrible stock market, you\u2019ll finally be getting caught up a bit with your life-after-work nest egg.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A little behind on saving for retirement?
