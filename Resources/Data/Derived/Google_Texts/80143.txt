Actor of the stage and melter of preteen hearts James Franco visited the “Tonight Show” on Monday night to share what he’s learned from his 12-week Broadway stint on “Of Mice and Men”: the art of the creepy #selfie, of course. Franco, who enjoys taking selfies with teenage girls and then texting them, opts to wear a baseball cap and dark-tinted sunglasses so he can look good “from any angle.”

Ladies, now you have one more reason to be leery of a dude adopting this look (because it means he idolizes James Franco).
