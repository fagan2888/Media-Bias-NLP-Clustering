But the crowd was too chaotic for them to keep it in check. One 16-year-old, known as Josh, was one of the several attendees who were injured in some way: part of his pinky was ripped off during the rave.\n\nOmg. Just got dropped off in East Croydon and police just broke up a massive illegal rave in The post office!?! pic.twitter.com/abdI9g8ZIr \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Lianna Brinded (@LiannaBrinded) June 14, 2014\n\nIn an interview with VICE, Josh and his friend, Fraser, explained exactly what happened during the rave. They were caught in the midst of a crowd of more than 1,000 people trying to force their way into the building, drinking, smoking weed, and throwing missiles at police. Josh and Fraser made their way to the side of the building in order to get in. It was inside that the fire alarm went off, and Josh \u2014 claiming he was sober at the time \u2014 decided to rip the alarm off the wall, spurred by people shouting \u201cRip it off! Rip it off\u201d His pinky was caught in the broken case and was torn off as he jumped down.\n\nJosh explained to VICE:\n\n\u201cI looked at my hand and my little finger was gone \u2014 the bone was sticking out. It\u2019s the weirdest feeling; one second you\u2019re fine and your little finger is there, and the next second it\u2019s gone. It shoves reality up your backside. I was in so much pain and shock that the first thing that hit my head was the beat and the bass. The bass was hard, so I just ripped off my top, wrapped it around my finger and tied it up as tight as I could and skanked it out for half an hour. My mentality was, 'I\u2019ve only been here for an hour, I\u2019ve paid \u00a310 for this night, I\u2019ve lost my little finger \u2014 am I seriously going to go? Nah, I\u2019m going to skank until I can\u2019t skank any more.' After that, my mate dragged me down to the paramedics.\u201d\n\nHowever, Josh\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t the only \u2014 or the worst \u2014 to occur at the rave that night. One 15-year-old died after collapsing at the rave, reportedly due to drugs. Four people were taken to the hospital in total, and nine were arrested.\n\nWhen asked if he was going to avoid raves from now on, Josh responded: \u201cNo. The next rave is in July \u2014 you\u2019ll see me there. Raving isn\u2019t a dangerous thing. Obviously accidents do happen, but there are people around you 24/7 who are willing to help. It\u2019s a calm environment; everyone\u2019s just there to enjoy themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "croydon rave, illegal rave, pinky, injuries", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 16-year-old partied so hard at a rave in South London that he accidentally ripped off his smallest finger, but kept dancing anyway.", "title": "Teen's Pinky Ripped Off At Rave, But Music Was So Good He Kept Dancing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teens-pinky-gets-ripped-rave-bass-was-hard-so-he-kept-dancing-289022", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/illegal-rave.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 16-year-old partied so hard at a rave in South London that he accidentally ripped off his smallest finger, but kept dancing anyway.", "title": "Teen's Pinky Ripped Off At Rave, But Music Was So Good He Kept Dancing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teens-pinky-gets-ripped-rave-bass-was-hard-so-he-kept-dancing-289022", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/illegal-rave.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/illegal-rave.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-19T15:40:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T15:40:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 16-year-old partied so hard at a rave in South London that he accidentally ripped off his smallest finger, but kept dancing anyway."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24ef\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s the weirdest feeling; one second you\u2019re fine and your little finger is there, and the next second it\u2019s gone.\nJosh explained to VICE:\u201cI looked at my hand and my little finger was gone \u2014 the bone was sticking out.\nMy mentality was, 'I\u2019ve only been here for an hour, I\u2019ve paid \u00a310 for this night, I\u2019ve lost my little finger \u2014 am I seriously going to go?\nOne 16-year-old, known as Josh, was one of the several attendees who were injured in some way: part of his pinky was ripped off during the rave.\nJust got dropped off in East Croydon and police just broke up a massive illegal rave in The post office!?!"}
