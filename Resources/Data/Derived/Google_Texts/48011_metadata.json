(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\n4433706\n\nWhile Mitt Romney is attempting to gin up enthusiasm among supporters for another run for the White House, one former donor is pouring cold water on the idea, encouraging other big money friends not to get behind the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just because we lost and just because our base didn\u2019t show up,\u201d conservative donor Randy Kendrick of Arizona said in an interview with The Daily Caller, discussing Romney\u2019s defeat in the 2012 presidential election. \u201cThose are pretty big reasons. But it\u2019s because he couldn\u2019t fight against the primary thing that motivates me and motivates millions of other Republicans: Obamacare.\u201d\n\nKendrick \u2014 the wife of Arizona Diamondbacks team owner Ken Kendrick, and a frequent donor to conservative causes and candidates \u2014 has been emailing friends and other donors with arguments against supporting another Romney campaign.\n\n\u201cMy family spent enormous time and money to elect Mitt Romney despite our concerns,\u201d Kendrick said in the email, which has been sent to a variety of fellow donors, and was obtained by TheDC. \u201cHowever, lesson learned, I will work early and tirelessly now to make sure he is not our nominee again.\u201d\n\nKendrick, who as a result of her donations was invited to Romney\u2019s Park City, Utah retreat for influential supporters in 2012, said she has not yet committed to another candidate for 2016 but likes Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cCertainly, I would\u2019ve preferred Romney over Obama,\u201d Kendrick said by phone Tuesday. \u201cBut I now do not prefer Romney over any candidate that might be running.\u201d\n\nKendrick referenced the criticism Romney often gets from conservatives that the health care plan he championed while governor of Massachusetts was later a model for President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cHe could never be a strong opponent of Obamacare for obvious reasons,\u201d Kendrick said of Romney in the 2012 election. \u201cAnd our entire base was opposed to this federal takeover, and yet he couldn\u2019t fight against that.\u201d\n\nKendrick also said she was disturbed to learn that former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who Romney tapped to lead his transition team in 2012, ran a health care consulting firm that helped states implement Obamacare.\n\nWhile Romney is busy wooing donors again ahead of a possible run, Kendrick said she isn\u2019t specifically sure which donors are truly excited about a Romney re-run.\n\n\u201cI think people feel like we have an exciting group of accomplished and interesting Republicans,\u201d Kendrick said of the emerging crop of candidates for 2016. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need to repeat 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the base is,\u201d she said, \u201cwho the source of support for Romney is.\u201d\n\nAfter repeatedly saying he would not run again in 2016, Romney announced to donors in New York last Friday that he is considering a run again. Those who know Romney, who also ran in 2008, say he is serious about running for a third time and is likely to make a decision soon.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'It isn't just because we lost'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "While Mitt Romney is attempting to gin up enthusiasm among supporters for another run for the White House, one former donor is pouring cold water on the idea, encouraging other big money friends not t", "title": "Former Mega-Donor Articulates Opposition To Mitt Romney 2016", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/13/former-mega-donor-articulates-opposition-to-mitt-romney-2016/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144029357-e1421174724438.jpg", "height": 495}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It isn't just because we lost'", "title": "Former Mega-Donor Articulates Opposition To Mitt Romney 2016 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/13/former-mega-donor-articulates-opposition-to-mitt-romney-2016/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144029357-e1421174724438.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-13 22:04:25", "sailthru.title": "Former Mega-Donor Articulates Opposition To Mitt Romney 2016", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "mitt-romney,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "mitt romney", "sailthru.description": "While Mitt Romney is attempting to gin up enthusiasm among supporters for another run for the White House, one former donor is pouring cold water on the idea, encouraging other big money friends not t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144029357-e1421174724438.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2b0\"", "article_summary": "Mitt Romney speaks during a campaign stop at Lansing Community College May 8, 2012 in Lansing, Michigan.\nWhile Romney is busy wooing donors again ahead of a possible run, Kendrick said she isn\u2019t specifically sure which donors are truly excited about a Romney re-run.\nMike Leavitt, who Romney tapped to lead his transition team in 2012, ran a health care consulting firm that helped states implement Obamacare.\n\u201cBut I now do not prefer Romney over any candidate that might be running.\u201dKendrick referenced the criticism Romney often gets from conservatives that the health care plan he championed while governor of Massachusetts was later a model for President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\u201cHe could never be a strong opponent of Obamacare for obvious reasons,\u201d Kendrick said of Romney in the 2012 election."}
