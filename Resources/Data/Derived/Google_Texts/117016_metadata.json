Bill Walker\u2019s tax bills is being set aside for further work in the House Finance Committee.\n\nThis past week, the committee rolled into one bill proposed increases in motor fuels, mining and fisheries businesses taxes. The bill was noticed for a hearing Saturday but wasn\u2019t heard.\n\nCo-chair Steve Thompson says concerns were raised during public testimony on provisions related to mining and fishing. He says he wants to work with industry and other legislators to try to come up with something that will be acceptable and still meet some of the goals set out by Walker.\n\nWalker proposed tax increases on various industries as part of a plan to address the state\u2019s budget deficit. The committee also has been hearing Walker\u2019s proposal to reinstitute a personal state income tax.\n\n___\n\n6:05 p.m.\n\nA bill calling for regional representation on the University of Alaska\u2019s Board of Regents has passed the state Legislature.\n\nHB 107 passed the Senate Friday. Reconsideration notice was served, meaning it could have been voted on again, but the Senate did not take another vote Saturday, sending it instead to Gov. Bill Walker.\n\nRegents currently must be Alaska and U.S. residents. But the bill, from Rep. Lynn Gattis, would require that the board include one resident each from Anchorage; the Kenai Peninsula, Matanuska-Susitna and Fairbanks North Star boroughs; the City and Borough of Juneau; and a community not connected by road or rail to Anchorage or Fairbanks. There would be a student regent and four at-large members.\n\nGattis, in a release, said the change would reflect the diversity of Alaska\u2019s population.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nA Senate committee has attempted to address concerns with proposed restrictions on who can teach sex education in Alaska public schools. But a critic says it would still \u201cdrastically limit\u201d access to sex education and place extra burdens on school districts.\n\nA provision included in a bill on student testing and parental involvement in education sought to limit the teaching of sex education to a licensed teacher conducting the class under contract with a school.\n\nA bill rewrite that advanced from the Senate Finance Committee Saturday would broaden that to also allow for someone supervised by a licensed teacher to teach sex education if they\u2019re approved by the school board and parents can review their credentials.\n\nJessica Cler with Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii says the bill unfairly targets sex education and would \u201cdrastically limit\u201d access to those classes.\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nThe Alaska House has passed legislation aimed at curbing and containing costs within the state Medicaid program.\n\nFriday\u2019s vote was 33-6. The bill, SB 74, will return to the Senate, which will have to decide whether to accept the House changes.\n\nThe sprawling bill includes provisions geared toward ferreting out fraud and waste. It calls for a reform program that includes expanded use of telehealth and requiring recipients to get care in their home community to the extent possible to reduce travel costs. Among other things, it also calls for a primary care case management system to increase use of appropriate primary and preventative care and decrease unnecessary use of specialty care and emergency services\n\n___\n\n11 a.m.\n\nWith the end of the 90-day session looming and divisions remaining on key issues, legislative leaders are looking at their options for completing their work.\n\nSenate President Kevin Meyer says a lot will depend on how far apart lawmakers are late Sunday, the scheduled end of session.\n\nVoters approved a 90-day session but the Constitution allows lawmakers to meet in regular session for up to 121 days.\n\nMeyer says lawmakers could continue working if it appears a resolution could be reached in the next few days. If that happens, though, the hope would be to narrow the focus to key bills since all bills would be in play.\n\nIf the sides appear far apart, he says legislative leaders probably would look at other options, such as going into a special session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Latest on issues the Alaska legislature is handling during the final days of the scheduled 90-day session (all times local):", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/16/the-latest-house-passes-medicaid-bill/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Latest on issues the Alaska legislature is handling during the final days of the scheduled 90-day session (all times local):", "title": "The Latest: Thompson eyes further work on tax bill package"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The Latest on issues the Alaska legislature is handling during the final days of the scheduled 90-day session (all times local):", "card": "summary", "title": "The Latest: Thompson eyes further work on tax bill package"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd345f\"", "article_summary": "This past week, the committee rolled into one bill proposed increases in motor fuels, mining and fisheries businesses taxes.\nBut a critic says it would still \u201cdrastically limit\u201d access to sex education and place extra burdens on school districts.\nJessica Cler with Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii says the bill unfairly targets sex education and would \u201cdrastically limit\u201d access to those classes.\nBill Walker\u2019s tax bills is being set aside for further work in the House Finance Committee.\n___1:55 p.m.A Senate committee has attempted to address concerns with proposed restrictions on who can teach sex education in Alaska public schools."}
