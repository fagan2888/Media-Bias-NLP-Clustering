Let\u2019s slow down a touch and look at the rapid succession of events over the weekend and into Monday that brought us to this sadly predictable moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn Friday, terrorists who have since been linked to ISIS attacked Paris, killing 129 and injuring about 350 others. Saturday saw Democratic presidential candidates discuss, without much specificity, their desire to beef up an international coalition to fight ISIS, in which regional countries would take on the lion\u2019s share of fighting on the ground. Republican presidential candidates were exceptionally disappointed that none of the candidates would use \u201cIslamic\u201d to describe the religious nature of the terrorist threat.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates and leaders spent their weekends explaining how they, in contrast to the sitting commander-in-chief, would kill every last radicalized Muslim in the known world through kinetic military action. Jeb Bush, speaking on Meet the Press, argued that the United States should \u201cdeclare war\u201d against the Islamic State and deploy ground troops to the region. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been reluctant to call for any intervention that might represent a long-term nation-building effort, called for a hailstorm of missile strikes that pays no heed to potential civilian casualties. Others have stated that the Obama administration\u2019s policy of targeted airstrikes is nowhere near what\u2019s necessary, but have yet to offer much specificity in how their policies would be any different.\n\nWhat the candidates were in near unanimity about was the need to stop President Obama\u2019s plan to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. Though Donald Trump earned some mockery in early October when he suggested that Syrian refugees could represent an ISIS \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d such a view has quickly come to dominate the Republican field. Cruz and Bush represent different factions of the party but agree that only Christians displaced by the conflict should be allowed to resettle in the United States. Ben Carson called the administration\u2019s decision to accept the refugees a \u201csuspension of intellect.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul said that he wouldn\u2019t have \u201cinvite[d] the refugees in the first place.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio: also not big on accepting refugees.\n\nBy Monday, Republican governors were escalating the issue. As of this writing, 14 governors\u201413 of them Republican\u2014had said that they would seek to prevent the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to the United States Congress and new Speaker Paul Ryan, whose House needs to pass an omnibus appropriations bill by next month to keep the federal government funded. Carson says that he has sent Ryan a letter demanding he push a bill that \u201cterminates all ongoing funding for any federal programs that seek to resettle refugees and/or migrants from Syria into the United States, effective immediately.\u201d He added at a press conference on Monday that \u201cCongress, I think, should defund all the programs that allow all these people to be here. Immediately. Today.\u201d Mike Huckabee, who, like Trump, has been warning about the purported threat of accepting refugees for months, offered similarly pointed instructions for Ryan:\n\nIf @SpeakerRyan will not lead & reject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East he needs to step down today & let someone else lead. \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 16, 2015\n\nAt least one senator, border hawk Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has called for a measure that would \u201crequire a vote on the administration\u2019s refugee plans and funding for resettled Syrian refugees in the spending bill that needs to pass Congress by Dec. 11 to keep the government open.\u201d The chair of the House Freedom Caucus, the several dozen hardliners who effectively hold veto power over Republican legislation, tell a hysterical Breitbart that they\u2019re unsure if Ryan is committed to eliminating funding for Syrian refugee resettlement in the spending battle.\n\nThis sucker\u2019s got a hot head of steam on it, and you can see where it\u2019s headed. Congressional conservatives in recent years have sought to use the funding process to \u201cdefund\u201d the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, and\u2014this one\u2019s still an open question\u2014Planned Parenthood. Now it seems likely they will demand language in the omnibus spending bill that bars the administration from using federal moneys to resettle Syrian refugees.\n\nOne significant variable here is how united Democrats would be against it. A late September survey from Pew showed that 69 percent of Democrats supported the decision to accept more refugees, and each of the three Democratic presidential candidates called for at least the number Obama has thus far offered to accept. We\u2019ll have to see if that position retains such strong support following the Paris attacks. There is, even on the Democratic side, a strain of paranoid NIMBY-ism among lawmakers on these issues. Just last week the Senate voted 91\u20133 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which included \u201ca prohibition on using funds to transfer [Guantanamo] prisoners to the U.S. or to build facilities to house them in the future.\u201d Congressional Democrats have approved such language throughout the Obama presidency. One Democratic governor, New Hampshire\u2019s Maggie Hassan, has already said that her state would not accept refugees for the time being. (Hassan is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Republicans may actually threaten another government shutdown to block them from coming in.", "fb-share": "Wait, what?", "sailthru.author": "Jim Newell", "description": "Go ahead and stop your timers: It took a bit less than 72 hours for Friday\u2019s barbaric attacks in Paris to somehow be turned into a cudgel over funding  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Go ahead and stop your timers: It took a bit less than 72 hours for Friday\u2019s barbaric attacks in Paris to somehow be turned into a cudgel over funding  ...", "title": "The Fight Over Syrian Refugees Is Going to Get Nuts", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/the_political_fight_over_syrian_refugees_is_getting_nuts.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/151116_POL_Paul-Ryan.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Go ahead and stop your timers: It took a bit less than 72 hours for Friday\u2019s barbaric attacks in Paris to somehow be turned into a cudgel over funding  ...", "title": "The Fight Over Syrian Refugees Is Going to Get Nuts", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/the_political_fight_over_syrian_refugees_is_getting_nuts.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/151116_POL_Paul-Ryan.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@jim_newell", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-16T17:34:56Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "The Fight Over Syrian Refugees Is Going to Get Nuts", "sailthru.headline": "The Fight Over Syrian Refugees Is Going to Get Nuts", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"The Fight Over Syrian Refugees Is Going to Get Nuts\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/the_political_fight_over_syrian_refugees_is_getting_nuts.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/151116_POL_Paul-Ryan.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100151116024\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-16T17:34:56Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Jim Newell\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"paris shooting\",\n    \"migrant crisis\",\n    \"terrorism\",\n    \"syria\",\n    \"isis\",\n    \"immigration\",\n    \"2016 campaign\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "The fight over Syrian refugees is going to get nuts:", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "Syrian refugees, ISIS refugees, ISIS, refugees, Syria, Paul Ryan, Jeff Sessions, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "Syrian refugees, ISIS refugees, ISIS, refugees, Syria, Paul Ryan, Jeff Sessions, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Donald Trump", "sailthru.description": "Go ahead and stop your timers: It took a bit less than 72 hours for Friday\u2019s barbaric attacks in Paris to somehow be turned into a cudgel over funding  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/151116_POL_Paul-Ryan.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Now it seems likely they will demand language in the omnibus spending bill that bars the administration from using federal moneys to resettle Syrian refugees.\nRepublican presidential candidates were exceptionally disappointed that none of the candidates would use \u201cIslamic\u201d to describe the religious nature of the terrorist threat.\nAs of this writing, 14 governors\u201413 of them Republican\u2014had said that they would seek to prevent the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states.\nJeb Bush, speaking on Meet the Press, argued that the United States should \u201cdeclare war\u201d against the Islamic State and deploy ground troops to the region.\nWhat the candidates were in near unanimity about was the need to stop President Obama\u2019s plan to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year."}
