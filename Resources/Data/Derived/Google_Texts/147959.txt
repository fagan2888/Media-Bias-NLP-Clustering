In this video with Healio.com, Robert Harrington, MD, of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, reviews the role of the Ryan White Care Act in providing health care to patients with HIV as well as the future of the program with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Harrington discusses how the use of Ryan White funds has changed since the rollout of the ACA, highlighting the ability to use the funds for other services “that we couldn’t cover before” and the future of the program. He highlights a point of contention among other individuals with chronic diseases: The fact that patients with HIV have a program designated entirely for their care.

“The bottom line, though, is that nobody gets all the care that they need,” Harrington said. “… Rather than dismantle it because other groups don’t have the same thing, what we should be using it for is a model so that other people with chronic health conditions would also benefit from like care acts.”
