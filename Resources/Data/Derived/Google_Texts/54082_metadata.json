Do not pursue.\u201d\n\nSuch was the conclusion of a 2009 report funded by the Robert Wood Johnson\u2019s State Coverage Initiative to investigate then-Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Robert\u2019s plan for HealthHub RI. This year, the first budget proposed by Rhode Island\u2019s new governor, Democrat Gina Raimondo, provides proof that the study was right.\n\nIn 2009, the idea was to follow Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Washington in setting up a government-run health benefits exchange. The hope (at least as publicly expressed) was that an exchange would help the state expand access to insurance while lowering the cost of health care. Yet, members of the group conducting the study \u201cwere disappointed to learn that the development of a full exchange model, as established in Massachusetts, would not\u201d accomplish their goals.\n\nA few years later, with the help of the Obama Administration and a party-line vote in the U.S. Congress, creating the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Then following an executive order from Governor Lincoln Chafee, Rhode Island officials went ahead and set up exactly the sort of exchange that their report had warned them not to pursue, calling it HealthSource RI.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act requiring federal funding to cease soon, Rhode Islanders are now finding out what \u201cinsufficient scale\u201d actually means.\n\nTo pay for the exchange, Raimondo\u2019s budget includes a brand new tax on health insurance. The governor\u2019s spokeswoman has been explaining the \u201cfee\u201d as structured similarly to the one that the federal government charges for its exchanges.\n\nPublic perception is also being shaped to make the state-based exchange look as if it won\u2019t cost much more than a federal exchange would. The powerful Speaker of the House, Democrat Nicholas Mattiello, has implied that he\u2019d only support HealthSource at the federal price point, and he has called the budget \u201ca good budget in light of difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nNeither of these impressions of the new \u201cfee\u201d is accurate.\n\nIn order to fund a state\u2019s use of its health benefits exchanges, the federal government charges a 3.5% fee on each premium sold in the exchange (calculated before federal subsidies are applied). However, because the law also forbids insurers from selling the same plan for different prices inside and outside of an exchange, insurers spread the total fees that the government charges across all members with identical plans.\n\nThe proposed Rhode Island health insurance tax, by contrast, does not impose a statutory tax rate on exchange premiums, but rather, it begins with the budget to fund HealthSource RI. That total is then spread out to every small group and individual health insurance premium charged in the state. The one nod to the concept of a \u201cuser fee\u201d is that the rates charged in the small group and individual markets are proportional to those markets\u2019 actual use of the exchange.\n\nIn the first year, with the federal government still funding about 80 percent of the exchange\u2019s budget, the rates will be 1.0 percent for small group plans and 3.8 percent for individual plans. It would be much higher, however, if the rate were calculated in the same way as on federal exchanges.\n\nIn order to raise the estimated $11.8 million in the first year, the fee applied to plans sold through the exchange would have to be 9.1 percent. That\u2019s more than two-and-a-half times the fee on the federal exchanges.\n\nIn the near future, when HealthSource RI has to rely entirely on local money, that rate will increase. During budget battles, last spring, the director of HealthSource at the time, Christine Ferguson, told legislators that she could get costs down to $17 million by stripping out some customer-service bells and whistles. That level of funding would require a fee of approximately 13.1 percent.\n\nThe consideration that makes HealthSource RI a political scandal, rather than simply a taxation scandal, is that the extraordinary step of imposing a brand new tax is not a reaction to unanticipated circumstances. Key figures behind the 2009 report were alongside the prior governor when Lincoln Chafee created HealthSource via executive order and are in the current governor\u2019s administration, and they had every reason to know that a true user fee would not be feasible.\n\nInstead of acknowledging this fact, however, they are manipulating the terminology and the math in order to sell the public something it didn\u2019t request and would never have accepted if the policy had been presented alongside the costs.\n\nThe public, in other words, would have come to the same conclusion as the inside activists who wanted the exchange in 2009: \u201cDo not pursue.\u201d\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Rhode Island's Obamacare exchange, HealthSource RI, cannot be sustained by the state's small population.
