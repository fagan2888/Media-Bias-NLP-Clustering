It's impossible,\" Smedley.\n\nDeckert said Narcan is safe but without a prescription, he's concerned people won't know how to use it properly.\n\n\"Of course, if they are knocked out from an overdose, they can't really give it to themselves,\" Deckert shared.\n\nHe doesn't think people will abuse the drug and neither does Smedley. She hopes it will help people seek treatment to end the cycle of addiction.\n\n\"For some people that is their choice and you can't make somebody quit that doesn't want to quit. You can offer them opportunities, which is what we do and that's all you can do,\" Smedley said.\n\nThe change will affect pharmacies in California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Arkansas.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Supporters say the accessibility will save lives while others are concerned addicts will abuse the medication.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "KRCR", "og": {"site_name": "KRCRTV", "description": "Supporters say the accessibility will save lives while others are concerned addicts will abuse the medication.", "title": "CVS to offer heroin overdose antidote without prescription", "url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/cvs-to-offer-heroin-overdose-antidote-without-prescription/35565920", "image": "http://www.krcrtv.com/image/view/-/35566360/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/nvhk0n/-/1280x960-50505B00-BOWHS-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/cvs-to-offer-heroin-overdose-antidote-without-prescription/35565920", "site": "@krcr7", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 326090907430922}, "keywords": "Redding health news", "google-site-verification": "gTTyxbmKN17E5sKQVjUGk8TIpxo_XoD5X2_F3PXfucg", "news_keywords": "Redding health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7d6\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Andrew Deckert, with Shasta County Public Health, said the change is beneficial because it will help save lives.\nREDDING, Calif. -CVS officials announced last week they are making Naloxone, or Narcan, available to everyone without a prescription.\nThe medication has been widely used to counteract an opiate overdose from heroin or pain medications.\nDeckert said Narcan is safe but without a prescription, he's concerned people won't know how to use it properly.\n\"We have a huge heroin epidemic and you can't possibly get the people to the hospital in time."}
