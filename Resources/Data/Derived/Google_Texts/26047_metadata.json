We\u2019re not running out of oil. In fact, many have been saying we\u2019re going to run out since the 1930s:\n\nThese stupid predictions of the end of oil have been going on for most of the last century. Just over 100 years ago, the U.S. Bureau of Mines estimated total future production at 6 billion barrels, yet we've produced more than 20times that amount. In 1939 the Department of the Interior predicted U.S. oil supplies would last 13 years. I could go on. [\u2026] The folks at the Institute for Energy Research recently published a study showing three data points: first, the government's best estimate of how much oil we had in America 50 years ago. The second was how much U.S. oil has been drilled out of the ground since then. And the third is how many reserves there are now. Today we have twice as many reserves as we had in 1950. And we have already produced almost 10 times more oil than the government told us we had back then.\n\nMoore added that technological advancements are increasing oil production. In fact, Kerry Jackson at Investors Business Daily wrote in November that these advances are going to almost triple the amount of fossil fuel resources if research and development continue. At the current rate, she wrote that 2.9 trillion barrels could expand to 4.8 trillion by 2050, which is \u201calmost twice as much as the projected global demand.\u201d And we also know that energy from these resources is guaranteed to keep economies running, growing, and thriving, compared to the wholly inadequate alternatives such as wind and solar that won\u2019t be able to meet our energy needs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to technological advances\r\n.05/27/2016 6:58:01AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to technological advances", "title": "So, I Guess We\u2019re Not Running Out Of Oil After All", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/29/so-i-guess-were-not-running-out-of-oil-after-all-n2097964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/262/76873441-88f9-41fe-9610-e1963e5dab60.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Thanks to technological advances", "title": "So, I Guess We\u2019re Not Running Out Of Oil After All", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/29/so-i-guess-were-not-running-out-of-oil-after-all-n2097964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/262/76873441-88f9-41fe-9610-e1963e5dab60.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "So, I Guess We\u2019re Not Running Out Of Oil After All, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re not running out of oil.\n[\u2026] The folks at the Institute for Energy Research recently published a study showing three data points: first, the government's best estimate of how much oil we had in America 50 years ago.\nAnd we have already produced almost 10 times more oil than the government told us we had back then.\nIf you read Stephen Moore\u2019s column, he noted how the consensus over oil is wrong.\nThe second was how much U.S. oil has been drilled out of the ground since then."}
