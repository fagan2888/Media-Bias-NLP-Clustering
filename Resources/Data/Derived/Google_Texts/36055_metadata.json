Hourly workers can be restricted in the amount they work by employers who don't need or can't afford to pay overtime,\" the Gallup release noted. \"By contrast, salaried workers generally don't face this issue. And, perhaps as a result, salaried employees work five hours more per week, on average, than full-time hourly workers -- 49 verses 44, respectively.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the lengthening of the average American workweek may be at least partly a result of individuals who assume more than one job.\n\nAccording to previous Gallup polling, 86 percent of all full-time workers have just one job, while 12 percent carry two, and about 1 percent balance three jobs or more.\n\nRegardless, even when the study findings were limited to full-time workers claiming only one job, the average number of hours worked was still 46.\n\nThe overall amount of hours that all U.S. full-time employees say they usually work each week has remained relatively steady through the last 14 years -- except for a small drop to just under 45 hours in Gallup's 2004-2005 two-year average.\n\nIn the August 2014 survey, 43 percent of U.S. adults told Gallup they are employed full time, down from approximately 50 percent recorded in the Work and Education polls conducted each August before the 2007-2009 recession.\n\nThe percentage of those who work part time has stayed close to 9 percent through the same period.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "As Americans wrap up their Labor Day holiday by generally not laboring, a new survey by market analyst Gallup shows the average work week in the United States is no longer 40 but 47 hours.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "As Americans wrap up their Labor Day holiday by generally not laboring, a new survey by market analyst Gallup shows the average work week in the United States is no longer 40 but 47 hours.", "title": "Gallup Poll: Average U.S. Work Week Up to 47 Hours", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/20507/20140901/gallup-poll-average-u-s-work-week-up-to-47-hours.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/20327/a-new-survey-by-market-analyst-gallup-shows-the-average-work-week-in-the-united-states-is-no-longer-40-but-47-hours.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "As Americans wrap up their Labor Day holiday by generally not laboring, a new survey by market analyst Gallup shows the average work week in the United States is no longer 40 but 47 hours.", "title": "Gallup Poll: Average U.S. Work Week Up to 47 Hours", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/20507/20140901/gallup-poll-average-u-s-work-week-up-to-47-hours.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/20327/a-new-survey-by-market-analyst-gallup-shows-the-average-work-week-in-the-united-states-is-no-longer-40-but-47-hours.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/20507/20140901/gallup-poll-average-u-s-work-week-up-to-47-hours.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01"}, "news_keywords": "Gallup Poll: Average U.S. Work Week Up to 47 Hours", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0de\"", "article_summary": "A new survey by market analyst Gallup shows the average work week in the United States is no longer 40 but 47 hours.\nAnd, perhaps as a result, salaried employees work five hours more per week, on average, than full-time hourly workers -- 49 verses 44, respectively.\"\nAdults who identified themselves as full-time employees reported working an average of 47 hours per week, nearly a full workday longer than the five-day, 9-to-5 standard schedule.\nYet, barely four in 10 full-time workers in the nation say they work exactly 40 hours in a given week, the lion's share of the full-timers surveyed telling Gallup they typically notch more than 40 hours each week -- whereby pushing the average number of hours worked across the country up to 47.\nMore specifically, said a Gallup news release, \"half of all full-time workers indicate they typically work more than 40 hours, and nearly four in 10 say they work at least 50 hours.\""}
