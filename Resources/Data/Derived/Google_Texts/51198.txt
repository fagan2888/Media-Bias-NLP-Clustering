Sen. Dick Durbin Dick DurbinReid: 'Lay off' Sanders criticism Senators tout 4.5B defense spending bill that sticks to budget Lawmakers seek changes in TSA PreCheck program MORE (D-Ill.) is renewing his effort to boost funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at a time when he says declining research dollars is “threatening our standing as a leader” in scientific innovation.

The bill, the American Cures Act, would create a mandatory funding stream to support research by the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies.

Funding would be guaranteed to increase each year by at least 5 percent, an investment that Durbin said is necessary to competing globally.



He pointed out that the government spends two-thirds less on research than it did in 1965, while the NIH taking a brunt of the cuts. Funding for the NIH – which became a major issue during the sequestration cuts – was revived in Congress last fall as Ebola appeared a greater threat.

Durbin’s bill comes one day after Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a nearly 400-page to-do list for the medical industry in 2015. The massive document quickly drew fire from Democrats who said the bill ignored the NIH’s funding needs.

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) slammed the proposal for lacking “any real dollars to fund additional basic research at the National Institutes of Health” despite lengthy conversations from both parties last year.

A Democratic aide for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the wishlist was largely drafted without Democratic consent and NIH funding would be a major sticking point in future negotiations.
