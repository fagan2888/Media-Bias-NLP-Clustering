Day two of the 8th Annual Bay County Sheriff's Office Rodeo wrapping up Saturday night at the Bay County Fairgrounds.

Organizers say about 2,000 people came out the event to support the Bay County Sheriff's Mounted Posse.

The group is made up of volunteers who assist with search and rescues on horseback.

Bay County Sergeant Jim Jenkins says he's thrilled to have such a strong turn out this year.

"Eight years ago when we came up with this idea, we was told no a rodeo won't go in bay county. This is living proof that rodeo is alive and well in Bay County and everybody loves it," he said.

Sergeant Jenkins says this one event raises about 10,000 dollars.

100% of the proceeds raised will be used to support the Bay County Sheriff's Mounted Posse.
