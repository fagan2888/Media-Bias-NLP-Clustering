A little good and a little bad on Family Guy Sunday night. We start with the good. In an episode titled ‘An App a Day,’ it appears Peter and Lois’ son Chris decided to send a picture of his “member” to a girl in class. Which of course necessitates a sit-down with the principal:

Principal: Thank you for coming, Mr. And Mrs. Griffin. We've got a bit of a situation, which is why I've asked Officer Swanson to join us. It appears Chris sent an inappropriate photo of himself to one of his classmates. Officer Swanson: That's right. He texted a picture of his peenie. Lois: Oh, my God! Principal: And apparently the girl... Peter: Oh, thank God. Principal: ...He sent it to doesn't like him back, so she turned him in.

So how about that, huh? An expression of relief and joy that your son isn’t gay on major network television? Not necessarily something you see every day.

So that would be the good. The bad would come later.

After Stewie and Brian get done taking care of business on the tennis court, Brian uses an unfortunate analogy to describe his court dominance:

Stewie: My word, Brian, you're really improving. We might actually win this thing. Brian: Thanks. You know, I just pretend that tennis ball is Mitch Mcconnell trying to roll back subsidies on the Affordable Care Act, and I'm like, "Nope!" Stewie: Yeah, I-I don't... I don't need to hear your process.

No, we seriously didn’t need to hear that at all. Also odd that Family Guy would pick the GOP Senator who promised he will not seek a full Obamacare repeal for this joke. But hey, maybe Senator McConnell doesn’t mind being charged with trying to roll back some of the provisions of one of the most unpopular laws in the land?
