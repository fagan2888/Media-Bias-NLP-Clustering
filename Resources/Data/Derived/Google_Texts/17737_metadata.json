During its nearly six-year run, the restaurant was routinely lauded on best-of lists, and this year Osaka was a semi-finalist for a James Beard Award for Best Chef Southwest.\n\n\u201cI love this neighborhood,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly good to me. But while the restaurant has experienced tremendous growth, our restaurant has just 40 seats in the dining room and 10 seats at the bar, and we\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019re just not large enough to accommodate as many guests as we\u2019d like.\u201d\n\nOsaka said he intends to reopen Twelve elsewhere. But there\u2019s no solid timeline, and Osaka is already occupied with his next venture: Osaka Ramen, a Japanese noodle shop slated to open this winter at 2611 Walnut St.\n\nThe space at 2233 Larimer St. won\u2019t stay empty for long.\n\nRELATED: William Porter\u2019s take on the closing of Twelve\n\nTwelve will become Butcher\u2019s Bistro, a \u201crustic American\u201d restaurant and retail shop being launched in October by Scott Bauer, regional manager of Snooze, and Tyson Holzheimer, that restaurant\u2019s regional chef. Bauer\u2019s wife, Kristin, will act as business manager for the new restaurant. Bauer and Holzheimer will soon leave Snooze to concentrate on the new venture, where Holzheimer will serve as executive chef.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s business as usual at Twelve, known for its rotating monthly menus \u2014 hence the name \u2014 and focus on seasonal ingredients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m urging everyone to come in and celebrate,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cWhen I moved to Denver from Los Angeles, my intention was to be an integral part of a food scene that had amazing potential, and this restaurant has helped me build so many relationships and friendships.\u201d\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877, wporter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/williamporterdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Twelve, a popular Denver restaurant, to close Aug. 23", "title": "Twelve, a popular Denver restaurant, to close Aug. 23", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/twelve-a-popular-denver-restaurant-to-close-aug-23/", "image": {"width": 435, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807__Jeffosakaheadshotp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807__Jeffosakaheadshotp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T10:15:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:56:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e0d\"", "article_summary": "Twelve, the acclaimed restaurant in Denver\u2019s Ballpark neighborhood, is closing Aug. 23.\n\u201cI love this neighborhood,\u201d Osaka said.\nBauer and Holzheimer will soon leave Snooze to concentrate on the new venture, where Holzheimer will serve as executive chef.\nBut there\u2019s no solid timeline, and Osaka is already occupied with his next venture: Osaka Ramen, a Japanese noodle shop slated to open this winter at 2611 Walnut St.\nChef-owner Jeff Osaka announced the room\u2019s closing, which opened Nov. 4, 2008."}
