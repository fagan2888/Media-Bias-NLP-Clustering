The ABA has nearly 400,000 members.\n\nRealtors are a little more balanced. Since 1990, members and employees of the National Realtors Association have split PAC donations somewhat evenly between the two parties \u2014 nearly $25 million to Democrats, and more than $26 million to Republicans.\n\nThe 1.1 million member realtors group had 39 lobbyists on its payroll last year, spending about $50 million influencing legislation, according to Opensecrets.org.\n\nThe American Medical Association\u2019s contributing members sent 60 percent of their more than $30 million in PAC donations since 1990 to Republicans, and 40 percent to Democrats. The AMA casts its net wide, making it the top donor to hundreds of candidates and members of Congress through the years.\n\nAMA, armed with 46 lobbyists this year, spent more on lobbying in the second quarter of 2015 than any other organization except the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and more in a single quarter than any since 2008 \u2014 more than $12 million.\n\nLike physicians, accountants aligned with the roughly 400,000-member American Institute of Certified Public Accountants also lean right in their donations. The AICPA PAC has donated since 1990 $10.3 million to GOP candidates, compared to $6.7 million to Democrats.\n\nProfessional associations sometimes delve into polarizing issues that bear little or no connection to their members\u2019 interests.\n\nThe ABA, for instance, lobbied for California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s bill, the Respect for Marriage Act, which would have repealed the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nIt also consistently lobbies for tougher restrictions on background checks and ownership for guns, and has a Standing Committee on Gun Violence. The ABA has pushed bills requiring background checks for all gun sales, and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe AMA lobbied hard in favor of Obamacare, even though most physicians at the time disapproved of the legislation.\n\nFollow Kathryn on Twitter, or email her at [email protected]\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
