Our country holds dear the principle that everyone is entitled to his opinion and has a right to express that opinion.\n\nHowever, no one has a right to resort to blackmail to force others to capitulate to their opinion under threat of something dire happening. Sadly, this is exactly what the conservatives in Congress are doing. Either repeal Obamacare or we will shut down the government. Either defund Planned Parenthood or we will allow the country to default and damage our credit rating. The list could go on.\n\nThe individuals engaged in this blackmail must be punished, which in this case means get them out of office as soon as possible. In our legal system, someone who assists others in the commission of a crime is punished as an accessory. Perhaps those who condone legislators who believe blackmail is a legitimate strategy are accessories in the same way.\n\nPaul Smith\n\nLower Saucon Township", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "House Freedom Caucus uses 'blackmail' tactics", "date": "2015-10-17", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Under normal circumstances, blackmail is illegal and individuals who use blackmail to extort what they want are normally apprehended and severely punished.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus uses 'blackmail' tactics", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/opinion/letters/mc-blackmail-house-freedom-caucus-smith-20151017-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622b064/turbine/mc-blackmail-house-freedom-caucus-smith-20151017", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "House Freedom Caucus Obamacare Planned Parenthood", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/84738616", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "House Freedom Caucus Obamacare Planned Parenthood", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The House Freedom Caucus believes blackmail is an appropriate way to extort what its members can't pass otherwise."}, "article_summary": "However, the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus clearly believes that blackmail is an appropriate way to extort what its members can't pass through the democratic process.\nUnder normal circumstances, blackmail is illegal and individuals who use blackmail to extort what they want are normally apprehended and severely punished.\nOur country holds dear the principle that everyone is entitled to his opinion and has a right to express that opinion.\nPerhaps those who condone legislators who believe blackmail is a legitimate strategy are accessories in the same way.\nThe individuals engaged in this blackmail must be punished, which in this case means get them out of office as soon as possible."}
