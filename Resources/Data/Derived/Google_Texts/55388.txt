A traffic stop in Cherry Hill netted more than 250 pounds of marijuana after officers pulled over a Camden man, police said Monday.

Nelson Anderson, 57, faces a number of charges, including possession of marijuana over 50 grams. He was arrested Thursday evening after investigators saw him moving large boxes from a self-storage unit in Cherry Hill into a vehicle, police said. The unit was under surveillance because of reports of suspicious activity.

Anderson was stopped shortly after leaving the unit for driving with a suspended license.

Mika, the Cherry Hill police department's K-9, then sniffed the outside of the vehicle and indicated marijuana was inside. Police said they found 100 pounds of the drug in the vehicle, and a wooden crate with more than 150 pounds of the drug.
