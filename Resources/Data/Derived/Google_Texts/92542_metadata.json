The product, named the E-njoint Disposable, is what the company calls a \u201c100 percent legal electronic joint\u201d that contains \u201cno THC, tobacco or nicotine,\u201d making it \u201charmless and 100 percent legal.\u201d (Tetrahydrocannabinol is the active compound in marijuana.) The device is battery-powered and vaporizes a liquid comprising vegetable-glycerin and polypropylene-glycol, with added \u201cbiological\u201d flavors such as passion fruit and watermelon.\n\nThe company has been manufacturing 10,000 of these devices a day and is now preparing to double production because, it says, it has been receiving inquiries from distributors worldwide every three minutes.\n\nThe next version of the product, however, may fit the billing as an electronic joint. E-Njoint CEO Menno Contant says that the company is getting ready to launch a device that is both rechargeable and refillable, and can be filled with cannabis or a derivative. \u201cOnce the cartridges are empty, users are able to fill these cartridges with a liquid. Those liquids may be standard liquids bought at any store around the world or it could be an extract of a cannabis plant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t provide the cannabis extract or anything like that. We just provide the tools.\u201d\n\nThe company also plans to release an e-joint that can be used with \u201cdry herbs,\u201d including marijuana, in the near future.\n\nAmong those who dispute that the new product is groundbreaking is Pamela Ling, professor and director of the Tobacco Control Policy Fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Center for Tobacco Research and Education. \u201cWhile this company is the first, to my knowledge, to call its product an \u2018electronic joint,\u2019 the idea of using electronic vaporizers for THC or marijuana is not new, and this company is far from the first,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are several products in the U.S. that either overtly or euphemistically brand themselves as devices useful for marijuana.\u201d\n\nMike Van Dyke, chief of the Environmental Epidemiology, Occupational Health and Toxicology Section in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, agrees and expresses a larger concern. Like other public health experts, Van Dyke says he is anxious about the repercussions of the growing popularity of the vaporizing devices. \u201cYou worry about any type of alternative drug delivery method that somehow gets perceived as safe. You worry about people who wouldn\u2019t initially start smoking, starting to do drugs. You worry about this opening up marijuana use to a whole new population,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Dutch delivery device promises a good time without the tar and nicotine.
