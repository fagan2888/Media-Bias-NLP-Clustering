Battlefield allies usually share little but a common enemy.\n\nThe close relationship between Hitler\u2019s top generals and policy planners and the devout Muslim soldiers who fought in Nazi Germany\u2019s army was strange and unnatural. The two groups shared almost nothing \u2014 except common enemies. David Motadel\u2019s \u201cIslam and Nazi Germany\u2019s War\u201d tells how this unique relationship evolved and survived notwithstanding deep-rooted differences.\n\nHitler\u2019s army mounted a vigorous, methodically constructed and substantially successful campaign to use a religious group\u2019s rituals, festivals and observances for political and military gain. The fervor of Islam\u2019s followers and their passion for their faith \u2014 then and now \u2014 transcends national borders and the patriotic loyalty demanded by the nation-states in which they resided. The Nazis\u2019 campaign to make Muslims feel welcome in the fuhrer\u2019s army capitalized on this.\n\nIn the 1940s Mohammedanism was the majority religion in all of the countries on the Mediterranean\u2019s southern and eastern shores, in much of the Balkan Peninsula and in six of the Soviet Union\u2019s independent republics. Encouraging and promoting Islam\u2019s latent hatred of the English, French and Russians while making its leaders admirers of Nazism was part of Hitler\u2019s grand strategy. Much of the effort targeted the USSR\u2019s Muslims. They passionately hated the Stalinist-Bolshevism regime that outlawed all forms of religious worship and embraced the Marxist notion that religion was \u201cthe opiate of the masses.\u201d\n\nIn the USSR Muslims were forbidden to observe their holidays in groups or congregations, to pray in public and to celebrate births, marriages and deaths according to their tradition. Muslims were considered a \u201clesser breed\u201d by the white males from England and France who controlled most of the governments and economies on the Mediterranean\u2019s southern and eastern shores. For more than 1,000 years, followers of Islam and Jews saw each of them as enemies. By unique coincidence, all of Germany\u2019s enemies were also Islam\u2019s longtime foes.\n\nAlthough the Nazis used most of the well-established propaganda methods, like circulating pamphlets, postcards and posters, and broadcasts by organizations similar to the Voice of America and Radio Liberty, they understood that traditional methods would be only marginally successful. A large percentage of the Muslims were illiterate, and the few owned radios.\n\nThe Nazis\u2019 approach to Islam was creative and original. They organized \u2014 and aggressively publicized \u2014 the all-Muslim troop units within the German army. These units were given special privileges: Fridays off from duty, menus without pork and Ramadan fasting concessions. The fuhrer\u2019s propaganda machine made the worldwide Muslim community aware of how Hitler\u2019s army included all \u2014 Muslim troop units where their religion\u2019s rites and ceremonies were honored and treated with respect.\n\nAdditionally \u2014 and maybe more importantly \u2014 the Nazis established schools for the training of Islamic religious leaders (imams and mullahs) in occupied sections of the USSR. Two-and-a-half decades of rigid, doctrinaire communism had depleted the number of the mullahs and imams with theological and ritualistic training. Few, if any, were younger than 50. The army\u2019s \u201cchaplain schools\u201d were welcomed by the Muslims throughout the world. In addition to their military duties the German-trained mullahs advanced the Nazi cause within the sacred confines of mosques.\n\nHitler\u2019s well-publicized friendship with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem gave his program cachet throughout the Islamic world. The Grand Mufti (who lived in Berlin during much of World War II) was a revered figure. Before moving to Berlin, he was an anti-colonial political leader in the Middle East and a direct descendent of the Prophet, who had made an official pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nDuring Hitler\u2019s last days in his Berlin bunker, he confessed to Martin Bormann, the head of the Nazi chancellery and his personal secretary, that one of the great mistakes in Nazi strategy during the war was not making a greater effort to mobilize Muslim support, and promote local insurrections. Hitler told Bormann, \u201cAll Islam vibrated with news of our victories.\u201d He believed the Mohammedan world was ready to rise in revolt, and the Nazis\u2019 failure to capitalize on Islam\u2019s unrest was an important error. He attributed this to Germany\u2019s deferral to Italian, Spanish and Vichy French interests in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMr. Motadel's \u201cIslam and Nazi Germany\u2019s War\u201d is a superb analysis of little-known but important facts about World War II. Still, it is a tedious book. More than 50 Nazi generals, cabinet officers and policymakers are identified by name and title, but not a single one is described in more than two sentences. The only exception is the Mufti of Jerusalem. Mr. Motadel\u2019s book should be part of every major library with a World War II history section. But it is not a book for the casual war buff or recreational reader.\n\nIslam is a vital force \u2014 political as well as spiritual \u2014 that transcends the borders of nation-states and short-term alliances. Its potency is often underestimated. Mr. Motadel\u2019s book tells how Hitler failed to fully exploit Islam\u2019s power. It also implicitly warns that some future dictator may succeed.\n\n\u2022 Herman J.
