Rand Paul on Wednesday waded deeper into an issue that has proved perilous to some of his GOP colleagues, throwing his political weight behind an establishment lobby effort to get Congress to reform the country\u2019s immigration system this year.\n\nMr. Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky and possible 2016 presidential hopeful, participated in a telephone conference call with members of a pro-immigration reform group and reporters in an effort brokered by anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.\n\nPHOTOS: Conservatives in Hollywood: Celebrities who lean right\n\nThe business group that helped set up the call, the Partnership for a New American Economy, immediately blasted an email Wednesday evening to supporters crowing that Mr. Paul had formally joined its pro-reform effort.\n\nThe timing of the call only heightened the potential stakes for Mr. Paul just one day after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was shockingly ousted from office in the Virginia Republican primary in favor of a little-known college professor.\n\nTea party activists who whipped up a get-out-the-vote effort for Mr. Cantor\u2019s opponent said they were motivated by the incumbent\u2019s advocacy for immigration reform, actions on Obamacare and vote to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nPHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals\n\nMr. Cantor was the second high-profile Republican to suffer political damage by stepping forward on the immigration issue. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another potential presidential contender, lost the support of his tea party base when he advocated a plan for immigration that some argued created a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Mr. Paul\u2019s staff insisted the senator does not support amnesty.\n\n\u201cHe has never advocated for amnesty in any other forum,\u201d said spokesman Brian Darling. \u201cAs a matter of fact, Sen. Paul offered an amendment on the immigration bill last year to strengthen border security by forcing annual votes in Congress before any benefits from the bill were authorized.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul, a longtime favorite of the tea party movement, has made it clear that he believes Congress needs the courage to enact immigration reform. But his latest effort pushed him further into the middle of a strident battle between establishment Republicans like Mr. Norquist who see immigration reform as essential to economic growth, and tea party activists who fear the current efforts in Congress will only lead to de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nThose familiar with the efforts to enlist Mr. Paul in the call said if the senator from Kentucky can use his influence with the two factions to find common ground, he would create the base of an expansive coalition to aid his presidential ambitions.\n\nThe danger, others noted, is that he could be portrayed as an establishment sympathizer and have some his base turn against him.\n\nOne of his chief rivals for tea party affection \u2014 both inside the Senate and possibly in the 2016 GOP race \u2014 is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has made clear that he plans to make Republicans uncomfortable if they gravitate toward amnesty.\n\nMr. Cruz on Wednesday told TellDC, the video partner of The Washington Times, that the Virginia election was a wake-up call to any elected official who goes against their constituencies\u2019 wishes.\n\n\u201cThat election is a lesson to every elected official that if we don\u2019t listen to the people who elected us, our tenure here is limited,\u201d the freshman Republican said.\n\nMr. Paul, whose supporters style him as a \u201clive and let live\u201d conservative, can use the issue to try to coalesce behind his disparate GOP coalition elements, including tea party backers, traditionalist conservatives, business interests and establishment Republicans.\n\nA top Paul aide confirmed the alliance of Mr. Paul and Mr. Norquist on immigration reform, after The Times received a copy of an email sent to Republicans, Democrats, independents and others thought to be open to some kind of reform.\n\n\u201cRand made the calls on immigration reform with Grover this morning,\u201d Doug Stafford, who heads Mr. Paul\u2019s political action committee, told The Times.\n\nThe email from the group announcing Mr. Paul\u2019s participation opened with a subject line that stated that the senator \u201cadds voice to #CallForReform.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) joined Grover Norquist to talk about the importance of passing immigration reform this year on the second call in a series with conservative leaders,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Jeremy Robbins, wrote in the email.\n\nThe message went on to note that \u201cSenator Paul follows Sal Russo, co-founder of the Tea Party Express, who launched the series last month by calling for an overhaul of America\u2019s immigration laws this year.\u201d\n\nThe email concluded by noting that Mr. Paul and Mr. Russo \u201cjoin an increasingly large group of conservatives who understand that the future of our economy depends on fixing our outdated immigration reform system.\u201d\n\nMany Americans of all political stripes regard the phrase \u201cimmigration reform\u201d as code for granting amnesty to foreigners living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nTo some \u201crule of law\u201d conservatives, it is a swear word. To other conservatives, putting millions of illegal immigrants on the road to legal status and eventually to citizenship is realistic politically and fair for people who flee warlords, drug lords and dysfunctional economies abroad to find work in the U.S.\n\nThe Partnership for a New American Economy boasts such high-profile members as former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a common foe of gun rights advocates and many other conservatives, and the equally wealthy Rupert Murdoch, the conservative owner of major newspapers and the Fox television family of news and entertainment channels.\n\nThe organization\u2019s website claims it \u201cbrings together more than 500 Republican, Democratic, and independent mayors and business leaders united in making the economic case for streamlining, modernizing, and rationalizing our immigration system.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul has been calling for a reform of immigration laws that secures the borders first, provides for a robust guest-worker program and can, under certain conditions, lead to the legalization of those who entered the U.S. without authorization or who overstayed their visas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sen.
