This is how I see myself,\u201d she says, right before the image of Wilde in the mirror pans away to reveal the real-life Rubright standing in front of us, asking, \u201cHow do you see me?\u201d\n\nThe video is the latest in a what\u2019s become an annual series produced by Saatchi & Saatchi for CoorDown, an Italian charity and the country\u2019s national association for people with Down syndrome.\n\nThe campaigns, like the official recognition of World Down Syndrome Day by the United Nations, began in 2012. That inaugural effort featured actors from popular Italian commercials, advertisements, and even live TV shows being replaced by people with Down syndrome in order to show the need to integrate them more fully into society, particularly in the workplace. In 2014, the campaign real-life people with the syndrome addressed the future mother of a child like them, assuring her that her child could love, hug, and find happiness.\n\nIn that same vein, Rubright\u2019s message illustrates the similarities people who are differently abled share with everyone else. For AnnaRose in particular, her full time college career supplemented by a part time job at a physical therapy center wouldn\u2019t be distinguishable from that of any other 19-year-old\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, down, syndrome, day, 2016, olivia, wilde, teams, 19, year, old, deliver, powerful, message", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Olivia Wilde teams with 19-year-old AnnaRose Rubright to deliver an important lesson about people living with Down Syndrome.", "title": "Olivia Wilde Stars In Touching PSA To Raise Awareness For Down Syndrome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/olivia-wilde-world-down-syndrome-day-living-disability-378507", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/18/world-down-syndrome-day-2016-olivia-wilde-teams-19-year-old-deliver-powerful-message.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Olivia Wilde teams with 19-year-old AnnaRose Rubright to deliver an important lesson about people living with Down Syndrome.", "title": "Olivia Wilde Stars In Touching PSA To Raise Awareness For Down Syndrome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/olivia-wilde-world-down-syndrome-day-living-disability-378507", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/18/world-down-syndrome-day-2016-olivia-wilde-teams-19-year-old-deliver-powerful-message.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/18/world-down-syndrome-day-2016-olivia-wilde-teams-19-year-old-deliver-powerful-message.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-19T10:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-19T10:00:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Olivia Wilde teams with 19-year-old AnnaRose Rubright to deliver an important lesson about people living with Down Syndrome."}, "article_summary": "To commemorate the upcoming World Down Syndrome Day on March 21, actress Olivia Wilde has teamed up with 19-year-old AnnaRose Rubright to deliver a powerful message about the realities of living with Down syndrome.\nThe campaigns, like the official recognition of World Down Syndrome Day by the United Nations, began in 2012.\nIn that same vein, Rubright\u2019s message illustrates the similarities people who are differently abled share with everyone else.\nIn 2014, the campaign real-life people with the syndrome addressed the future mother of a child like them, assuring her that her child could love, hug, and find happiness.\n\u201cI see myself as an ordinary person, with an important, meaningful, beautiful life."}
