We just have to do physical therapy every day.\u201d\n\nRivera\u2019s parents were given a list of things to do with him to try to get him fully recovered.\n\nMarana Police Department officer Bryant Brewer told Tucson News Now the boy was bitten in the foot outside of the women's restroom.\n\nThe boy's mother flagged him down while he was checking on an unrelated call in the parking lot of Crossroads at Silverbell Park near Cortaro and Silverbell.\n\n\"It was approximately a 2-year-old diamondback rattlesnake,\" said Marana PD PIO Chris Warren. \"Younger snakes are known to be more poisonous, because they can't control the amount of venom they release.\"\n\nThe mom was adamant she wanted to drive her son to an urgent care down the road. Officer Brewer escorted her there. Doctors then asked Marana PD to locate the snake so they knew how to best treat the bite.\n\nAdditional officers came to the park and found the snake dead. We're told one of the Marana Parks and Recreation crew members killed it, cutting off its head.\n\nNW fire also responded, took the snake, and disposed of it.\n\nMarana PD urges parents to educate their kids about snakes, the danger of them, and what to do if they spot one.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
