Women physicians' suicide rates are reported to be up to 400% higher than women in other professions. Male physicians' rates are 50% to 70% higher.\n\nWhy are more physicians seeing suicide as their only option? The rising rate since the 2010 Affordable Care Act was passed points to the added regulatory and financial pressures from Obamacare as major factors:\n\nneed to see more patients per hour to make ends meet\n\nlower payments, longer delays in being paid, and declining patient visits due to higher co-pays and deductibles\n\nfinancial stress, a known trigger for suicide, intensified by a 40 % to 50% decline in practice revenues as overhead costs go, forcing many primary-care physicians to close up their practices\n\nincreasing administrative and paperwork burden, which takes time away from patient care, without the satisfactions of helping patients\n\nmore generalized \"one-size-fits-all\" protocols demanded by insurance and government \"guidelines\"\n\nmore forms, reports, and regulations that no one understands, but with huge financial penalties and even prison time for making mistakes\n\ndemonization of \"greedy doctors\" by insurance companies, government, and media.\n\nDoctors have always been at higher risk of suicide than other professions for several reasons:\n\npressures of responsibility for patients' lives\n\nfear of making mistakes that might cost a life or trigger a malpractice suit\n\nfear of losing one's medical license and livelihood\n\nlong hours, time away from families on nights and weekends\n\nhigh rates of unrecognized or untreated depression, alcohol or substance abuse, and divorce due to all of the above\n\nDoctors are human too, and have feelings. I think other critically overlooked factors in the rising suicide rates since 2010 include:\n\nthe increasing sense that doctors are just a \"cog in a wheel,\" interchangeable with those having less training and expertise\n\nfeeling unappreciated by patients, who toss them aside like an old toy when insurance plans change\n\nfrustration with patients who dismiss medical recommendations if \"it is not covered by my insurance\"\n\nloss of autonomy, control, and independence as faceless insurance clerks, bean-counters, licensing boards, and government agencies dictate how, where, and when medicine is to be practiced, with no knowledge of the patient in question.\n\nPhysicians are also often their own worst doctors and feel they can handle their own health issues and stress. There is the ever-present social stigma about seeking mental health treatment, but for physicians this is magnified by the fear of being penalized and having their medical license jeopardized if they seek treatment for depression or stress. We encourage others to seek mental health professionals if appropriate, but most physicians are afraid to do so themselves because such treatment must be reported on each medical license renewal application, increasing the risk of losing one's license and livelihood.\n\nPhysicians also fear losing hospital privileges if treatment for depression is disclosed. Hospital administrators increasingly use mandated psychiatric treatment as a bullying tactic to remove independent-thinking, patient-focused physicians from hospital staff.\n\nAll of these problems, especially the feelings of loss of control and loss of autonomy in one's medical decision-making, have escalated dramatically with the ever-increasing regulatory burdens under Obamacare.\n\nA death by suicide is devastating to families, leaving emotional scars that may never heal. Physicians' family members often have significant support to help with grief and shock, but very little attention is paid to the needs of patients, especially older patients who often have profound feelings of loss, and little support to help them through unexpected loss of a trusted physician upon whom they depended.\n\nMost doctors go into medicine truly committed to helping people who are ill and in pain. Today, doctors are under siege with outside forces preventing them from doing the very thing that means the most: taking care of patients. The sensitive and compassionate ones have an even harder time dealing with denials of care they know their patients need.\n\nThe toll on doctors\u2014and then patients\u2014is getting worse daily. Insurance and government bureaucrats had best remember: at some point, we ALL will be a patient\u2014that includes YOU.\n\nWARNING: dead doctors cannot save your life.\n\nElizabeth Lee Vliet, M.D. is a preventive and climacteric medicine specialist with medical practices in Tucson AZ and Dallas TX that take an integrated approach to evaluation and treatment of women and men with complex medical and hormonal problems.
