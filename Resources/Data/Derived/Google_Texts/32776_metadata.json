For some, premiums are higher than ever, which prompts many to stop and ask themselves if they really need to pay all of that money for dental insurance.\n\nThe answer to that question depends on the individual and their specific situation, but there are several good reasons that dental insurance won\u2019t be worth the cost after all.\n\nPremiums Are Too High\n\nIn most cases, the premiums for dental insurance will cost much more than the cost of most dental work. According to Bankrate, the average individual policy costs $360 per year plus copays or coinsurance for the remaining bill. The average cost for two exams and X-rays costs about $370, which will come out to be cheaper than the cost of the exams through your insurance. The amount will be considerably less if you only see the dentist once a year, like a large percentage of America chooses to do without negative repercussions.\n\nPreventative Care Can Be Handled At Home\n\nA majority of the preventative care from your dentist can be handled at home. Many believe that they can\u2019t get the all-around clean feeling by taking care of their teeth at home, but by flossing twice a day and using an electric toothbrush, you can mimic many of the results of professional dental cleanings.\n\nHalf of the magic of dental cleanings is the polish at the end, which is a result of the faster rotations of the toothbrush.\n\n\u201cWhile a normal manual toothbrush would yield around 300 rotations per minute, an electric toothbrush yields around 6,000 rotations per minute,\u201d says an article from Groom and Style.\n\nThat speed is about the same rotation as a dentist\u2019s toothbrush, and it helps to deliver that dental-fresh smile every day without paying hundreds of dollars to get it.\n\nAccidental Dental Care Is Covered By Most Health Insurances\n\nTake a closer look at your health insurance policy. Odds are, your policy has a proviso that covers dental care as the result of an accident. This means that if you fall and chip your two front teeth, your health insurance will cover it, and you won\u2019t need to fork out the extra money for dental insurance.\n\nOf course, for some, purchasing dental insurance is for peace of mind more than anything else. It\u2019s also a good idea for those who have extremely cavity-prone teeth, despite excellent hygiene habits. If you fit into that category, dental insurance might be for you.\n\nOtherwise, seriously consider your situation. You might find that you really don\u2019t need dental insurance after all.\n\n[Image via Albion Benefits]", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the window for getting new insurance approaches, it has everyone talking about the benefits of dental insurance, but don't waste you're time; there are", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "As the window for getting new insurance approaches, it has everyone talking about the benefits of dental insurance, but don\u2019t waste you\u2019re time; there are", "title": "Why You Don\u2019t Really Need Dental Insurance", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2290608/why-you-dont-really-need-dental-insurance/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dental-insurance-in-utah.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T10:25:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T11:32:19+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dental-insurance-in-utah.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-07-29T10:25:28+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "opinion", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dental-insurance-in-utah.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As the window for getting new insurance approaches, it has everyone talking about the benefits of dental insurance, but don\u2019t waste you\u2019re time; there are"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4e4\"", "article_summary": "As the window for getting new insurance approaches, it has everyone talking about the benefits of dental insurance, but don\u2019t waste you\u2019re time; there are actually several reasons why you don\u2019t really need dental insurance.\nYou might find that you really don\u2019t need dental insurance after all.\nPremiums Are Too HighIn most cases, the premiums for dental insurance will cost much more than the cost of most dental work.\nFor some, premiums are higher than ever, which prompts many to stop and ask themselves if they really need to pay all of that money for dental insurance.\nOf course, for some, purchasing dental insurance is for peace of mind more than anything else."}
