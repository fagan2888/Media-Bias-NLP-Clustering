Accordingly, managed care organizations\u2014like Humana (HUM), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH)\u2014operate in select markets to balance risk and earn sustainable profits.\n\nThe above graph shows the distribution of Centene\u2019s risk-based membership. In risk-based Medicaid services, Centene enters into Medicaid managed care contracts with state governments. It assumes responsibility for Medicaid enrollees\u2019 future claim obligations in exchange for payment from the state government.\n\nSince 2014, Centene also started offering non-risk Medicaid services. The company provides administrative support\u2014like claims administration and access to a health provider network\u2014in exchange for fees from the state. In this case, the state government assumes the financial risk of the Medicaid claims. A few of Centene\u2019s new contracts are mentioned below.\n\nLouisiana\n\nTo increase its Medicaid footprint in the state, the company completed a transaction in July 2014. CHS (Community Health Solutions of America) assigned its Medicaid contract to the Louisiana Healthcare Connections, or LHC\u2014Centene\u2019s subsidiary. In February 2015, Centene started operating in Louisiana under the new contract.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas added nursing coverage for its Medicaid Star+PLUS members\u2014also termed as \u201cdual eligibles.\u201d These people belong to the low-income category. They\u2019re disabled or above 65 years old. Increased coverage will also increase Centene\u2019s future opportunities and payments.\n\nMississippi\n\nAs one of the poorest states in the US, Mississippi is an attractive market for Centene. In 2014, Centene started offering services under the MississippiCAN program to TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) children. The company is expected to benefit from further enrollments in this program in 2015. In addition, effective January 2015, the company started offering services to CHIP (State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) beneficiaries in the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nCentene was contracted by Indiana to serve ABD (Aged, Blind and Disabled) beneficiaries under Indiana\u2019s new Hoosier Care Connect program. It\u2019s expected to benefit 84,000 beneficiaries in 2015. Effective in 2015, the state also adopted the expansion of the Medicaid program. As a result, it will add substantially to Centene\u2019s Medicaid enrollments.\n\nArizona\n\nCentene was contracted by Arizona to provide behavioral health services through a partnership between its subsidiary Cenpatico and the University of Arizona Health Plan.", "article_metadata": {"cXenseParse": {"mre-primary-ticker": "hum", "mre-content-type": "Company Overviews", "mre-author": "Manali Pradhan", "mre-industry": "Hospitals", "mre-value-driver": "Business Overview", "mre-page-type": "post", "mre-section": "Sector Analysis", "mre-sector": "Healthcare", "mre-secondary-ticker": "iyh"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "description": "The performance of players in the health insurance industry (IYH) depends largely on the demographic mix, social mix, and regulatory framework in the key markets."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda193\"", "article_summary": "Centene: A High Performer in the Health Insurance Industry PART 3 OF 13Centene: What Key Markets Does It Serve?\nIn risk-based Medicaid services, Centene enters into Medicaid managed care contracts with state governments.\nIn February 2015, Centene started operating in Louisiana under the new contract.\nArizonaCentene was contracted by Arizona to provide behavioral health services through a partnership between its subsidiary Cenpatico and the University of Arizona Health Plan.\nIn 2014, Centene started offering services under the MississippiCAN program to TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) children."}
