Muhlenberg Poll: Where PA Stands on Social Issues

Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor

Muhlenberg College has released their latest survey of Pennsylvanians on public health issues.

Obamacare

First off the bat they found that a slim plurality favor President Obamaâ€™s health care reform. By a 43/37 margin, residents have a favorable opinion of the law and in a 45/43 split approve of how the President has handled the issue of healthcare.

Abortion/Planned Parenthood

Pennsylvanians were then asked about their opinions on abortion.

52% identified as pro-choice while 41% said they were pro-life.

Furthermore, Planned Parenthood has a 49% favorable rating against just 15% who have an unfavorable view. A solid majority, 56%, also think Planned Parenthood should receive federal funds.

Marijuana

Respondents were much more divided on the question of legalizing marijuana.

By a razor thin 39/38 margin, they favor the complete legalization of the drug. Additionally, while Pennsylvanians are not enthusiastic about its health benefits, they believe it should be regulated the same as alcohol.

The Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion surveyed 403 Pennsylvanians from February 27th to March 7th. The margin of error is +/- 6%.
