Human resources director Pam Overcash said they had to do something in 2015 after finding out they would pay 10 percent more in October for the county employee health insurance plan.\n\n\u201cWe weren't looking at who should be on the health plan. We're looking at how are we going to mitigate our rising costs within the health plan,\u201d said Pam Overcash of Human Resources Director, Gaston County.\n\nThey settled on cutting coverage for employees' spouses who can get insurance through their own jobs.\n\nOvercash said it will save the meat of the benefits plan, an imporant recruiting and retention tool for the county and save them roughly $500,000.\n\n\u201cIt's not just about making sure people have insurance, but I will also say the Affordable Care Act is changing everything in the nature of the insurance industry,\u201d said Overcash.\n\nOther self-insured counties are cutting spouses entirely saying spousal claims make up the majority of their costs.\n\nThis isn't just a county government problem. It's a growing problem in the private sector as well.\n\n\u201cI've talked to several companies this week,\u201d said Cathy Graham, a benefit services director of The Employers Association.\n\nGraham said the employers association says more companies locally are cutting spousal coverage and it's all about the money.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot more taxes under the Affordable Care Act that plans are being required to pay, a lot more benefits that they're having to offer,\u201d said Graham.\n\nThe Non-Partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said this is a limited problem nationally and tends to show up in companies who offer lower wages.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "index, follow", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "og": {"site_name": "TWC News", "description": "Gaston County Government has a money problem.
