(Photo : Twitter Photo Section)\n\nWhen Donald Trump went to Texas, he addressed a packed auditorium of approximately 20,000 people for more than 90 minutes, and had the crowd roaring in approval.\n\n\"He's telling me everything I want to hear. I'm for change. I'm fed up with the 30 years of empty suits in Washington,\" said Brian Markum, an energy consultant who was at the rally with his wife, according to NPR.\n\n\"We've got a president who doesn't know what the hell he's doing!\" said Trump while mocking President Barack Obama for saying that \"no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change\" during his State of the Union Address, reported the Daily Mail.\n\nTrump then spoke about what is seen as his favorite agenda, illegal immigration in Texas, blasting the \"sanctuary cities\" that provide immigrants security, saving them from deportation. \"Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They're rough dudes,\" he said while adding that they would not remain in the country long if he were to be elected, reported the New York Times.\n\nTrump promised to improve America's standing in the world and to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When a supporter suggested the name Donaldcare, he replied, \"Thank you! We'll call it Donaldcare,\" reported the New York Times.\n\n\"You're going to say to your children and you're going to say to anybody else that we were part of a movement to take back our country. And we will make America great again,\" said Trump before signing off from what was the longest speech of any major party candidate in the 2016 presidential election.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Donald Trump spoke about his favorite agenda, illegal immigration, and other topics during a 90-minute speech in Texas.", "Copyright": "2016 Headlines & Global News", "Author": "Headlines & Global News", "og": {"site_name": "Headlines & Global News", "description": "Donald Trump spoke about his favorite agenda, illegal immigration, and other topics during a 90-minute speech in Texas.", "title": "Trump In Texas: Replace Obamacare With Donaldcare, Slams 'Sanctuary Cities Crap'", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130263/20150916/trump-in-texas-replace-obamacare-with-donaldcare-slams-sanctuary-cities-crap.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/134774/donald-trump.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "hngn.com", "description": "Donald Trump spoke about his favorite agenda, illegal immigration, and other topics during a 90-minute speech in Texas.", "title": "Trump In Texas: Replace Obamacare With Donaldcare, Slams 'Sanctuary Cities Crap'", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130263/20150916/trump-in-texas-replace-obamacare-with-donaldcare-slams-sanctuary-cities-crap.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/134774/donald-trump.png", "creator": "@HNGNcom", "site": "@HNGNcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130263/20150916/trump-in-texas-replace-obamacare-with-donaldcare-slams-sanctuary-cities-crap.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Headlines & Global News", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-16"}, "news_keywords": "trump, in, texas, replace, obamacare, with, donaldcare, slams, sanctuary, cities, crap", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0;", "Subject": "hngn.com"}, "article_summary": "Trump In Texas: Replace Obamacare With Donaldcare, Slams 'Sanctuary Cities Crap'Donald Trump spoke about his favorite agenda, illegal immigration, and other topics during a 90-minute speech in Texas.\nWe'll call it Donaldcare,\" reported the New York Times.\nTrump then spoke about what is seen as his favorite agenda, illegal immigration in Texas, blasting the \"sanctuary cities\" that provide immigrants security, saving them from deportation.\nTrump promised to improve America's standing in the world and to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\nSep 16, 2015 11:38 AM EDTDonald Trump addressed a crowd of about 20,000 people in Dallas."}
