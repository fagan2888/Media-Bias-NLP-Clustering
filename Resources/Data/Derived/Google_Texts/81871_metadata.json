People who are middle-aged and older tend to know more than young adults, by virtue of having been around longer, and score higher on vocabulary tests, crossword puzzles and other measures of crystallized intelligence.\n\nStill, young adults who consult their elders (mostly when desperate) don\u2019t do so just to gather facts, solve crosswords or borrow a credit card. Nor, generally, are they looking for help with short-term memory or puzzle solving. Those abilities, called fluid intelligence, peak in the 20s.\n\nNo, the older brain offers something more, according to a paper in the journal Psychological Science. Elements of social judgment and short-term memory, important pieces of the cognitive puzzle, may peak later in life than previously thought.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellows Joshua Hartshorne of MIT and Laura Germine of Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed a huge trove of scores on cognitive tests taken by people of all ages. The researchers found that the broad split in age-related cognition \u2014 fluid in the young, crystallized in the old \u2014 masked several important nuances.\n\n\u201cThis dichotomy between early peaks and later peaks is way too coarse,\u201d Hartshorne said. \u201cThere are a lot more patterns going on, and we need to take those into account to fully understand the effects of age on cognition.\u201d\n\nThe new paper is hardly the first challenge to the scientific literature on age-related decline, and it won\u2019t be the last. A year ago, German scientists argued that cognitive \u201cdeficits\u201d in aging were caused largely by the accumulation of knowledge \u2014 that is, the brain slows down because it has to search a larger mental library of facts. That idea has stirred some debate among scientists.\n\nExperts said the new analysis raised a different question: Are there distinct, independent elements of memory and cognition that peak at varying times of life?\n\n\u201cI think they have more work to do to demonstrate that that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Denise Park, a professor of behavior and brain science at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cBut this is a provocative paper, and it\u2019s going to have an impact on the field.\u201d\n\nThe strength of the new analysis is partly in its data. The study evaluated historic scores from the popular Wechsler intelligence test, and compared them with more recent results from tens of thousands of people who took short cognitive tests on the authors\u2019 websites, testmybrain.org and gameswithwords.org. The one drawback of this approach is that, because it didn\u2019t follow the same people over a lifetime, it might have missed the effect of different cultural experiences, said K. Warner Schaie, a researcher at Penn State University.\n\nBut most previous studies have not been nearly as large, or had such a range of ages. Participants on the websites were 10 to 89 years old, and they took a large battery of tests, measuring skills like memory for abstract symbols and strings of digits, problem solving, and facility reading emotions from strangers\u2019 eyes.\n\nAt least as important, the researchers looked at the effect of age on each type of test. Previous research had often grouped related tests together, on the assumption that they captured a single underlying attribute in the same way a coach might rate, say, athleticism based on a person\u2019s speed, strength and vertical leaping ability.\n\nThe result of the new approach?\n\n\u201cWe found different abilities really maturing or ripening at different ages,\u201d Germine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much richer picture of the life span than just calling it aging.\u201d\n\nProcessing speed \u2014 the quickness with which someone can manipulate digits, words or images, as if on a mental sketch board \u2014 generally peaks in the late teens, Germine and Hartshorne confirmed, and memory for some things, like names, does so in the early 20s. But the capacity of that sketch board, called working memory, peaks at least a decade later and is slow to decline.\n\nIn particular, the ability to recall faces and do some mental manipulation of numbers peaked about age 30, the study found, \u201ca fact difficult to assimilate into the fluid/ crystalized intelligence dichotomy.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also analyzed results from the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. The test involves looking at snapshots of strangers\u2019 eyes on a computer screen and determining their moods from a menu of options like \u201ctentative,\u201d \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cskeptical.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy test, and you\u2019re not sure afterward how well you did,\u201d Germine said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d done poorly but in fact did pretty well.\u201d\n\nYet people in their 40s or 50s consistently did the best, the study found, and the skill declined very slowly later in life.\n\nThe picture that emerges from these findings is of an older brain that moves more slowly than its younger self, but is just as accurate in many areas and more adept at reading others\u2019 moods \u2014 on top of being more knowledgeable.\n\n\u201cWe found different abilities really maturing or ripening at different ages,\u201d Germine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much richer picture of the life span than just calling it aging.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hfaging12.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb09a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis dichotomy between early peaks and later peaks is way too coarse,\u201d Hartshorne said.\nBut the capacity of that sketch board, called working memory, peaks at least a decade later and is slow to decline.\nNo, the older brain offers something more, according to a paper in the journal Psychological Science.\nElements of social judgment and short-term memory, important pieces of the cognitive puzzle, may peak later in life than previously thought.\n\u201cWe found different abilities really maturing or ripening at different ages,\u201d Germine said."}
