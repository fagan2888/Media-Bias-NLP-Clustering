The man shot this week by a security guard during what authorities called an attempted holdup of a Chase Bank branch in Franklin Square was arraigned in the hospital Saturday.

Lashawn Pierre, 20, of Elmont was ordered held without bail by Judge Valerie Alexander in a bedside arraignment at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola.

He did not enter a plea at his arraignment, during which he was seated in a chair beside his hospital bed with his left wrist handcuffed to the side of the bed.

Pierre’s attorney, Martha Leventhal of the Nassau Legal Aid Society, said her client lives with his family in Elmont and requested he be granted two phone calls and continued medical attention.

“I acknowledge the severity of the charges,” Leventhal said.

Brian Witthuhn of the Nassau County district attorney’s office said Pierre pointed a black handgun at a bank employee and demanded cash.

“At that point he was shot by one of the security guards in the bank,” Witthuhn said.

Court papers said the weapon was a Kel-Tec P-11 9 mm handgun.

The bank security guard shot Pierre four times Thursday in thwarting the holdup of the bank on Franklin Avenue, police said. Pierre has been hospitalized since.

The suspect announced the robbery at 5:35 p.m. and pointed a semi-automatic handgun at two security guards, Assistant Chief Neil Delargy had said at an 8 p.m. Thursday news conference at the scene.

Pierre was hit on his extremities and taken to a hospital to be treated. No information about his condition was available.

Delargy said the security guard is a retired member of law enforcement, but would not elaborate.

There were seven employees and eight customers present at the time of the attempted robbery, police said, but no other injuries were reported.

Pierre is due back in court Wednesday.
