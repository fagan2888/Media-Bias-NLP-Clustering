Troopers are investigating how a Georgia man crashed the Nissan Altima he was driving early Sunday morning in Duplin County.

The crash happened on Highway 111 near Jackson Store Road, just south of Beulaville and east of Chinquapin around 4 a.m.

Troopers say 28-year-old Terrence Jackson of Marietta, Georgia was returning to Jacksonville after attending his grandmother's funeral in Raleigh. He had with him a 3-month-old baby girl.

Troopers say Jacksonville is where Jackson's fianc√©, the infant's mother, lives.

The Nissan was going eastbound on Highway 111 when it went off the road to the left, struck a ditch, a tree, then overturned. Troopers say alcohol nor speed were a factor in the crash. The man and baby were properly buckled in. Troopers believe the best explanation is that Jackson was not familiar with the wide intersection.

Troopers say Jackson was pronounced dead at the scene while the infant was transported to Vidant in Duplin where she died.
