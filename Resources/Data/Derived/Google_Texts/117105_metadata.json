(Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP)\n\nAttention, fans of law and celebrity culture: It\u2019s that time of year when\u2014in keeping with the grand Truthdig tradition inaugurated last December\u2014we hand out our annual SCOTUS Awards to the men and women who staff our nation\u2019s most powerful judicial tribunal.\n\nBy the way, I think we\u2019re onto something big here\u2014OK, not Donald Trump big, but pathbreaking (tongue in bulging cheek) all the same. While I\u2019m not aware of any similar awards pageant, the idea of Supreme Court justices as celebrities is catching on, even as a subject of serious academic exegesis. Indeed, earlier this year, Richard Hasen\u2014a professor at the University of California, Irvine, Law School\u2014published \u201cCelebrity Justice: Supreme Court Edition.\u201d In the paper, Hasen reported that the number of extrajudicial speeches by sitting justices\u2014news interviews, TV appearances, book tours, lectures delivered at conventions and universities, and the like\u2014had increased by a factor of 850 percent from 1960-1969 to 2005-2014.\n\nAs you read through the dispensations below, keep the following point in mind:\n\nAlthough each Supreme Court term begins in October, these accolades are based on calendar-year performances; thus, court opinions released in December 2014 don\u2019t count, but any remarks made during this month\u2019s oral arguments\u2014even in cases as yet undecided\u2014are fair game.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nSo without further ado or apologies, I give you our 2015 winners (I use the word loosely) and the loot they have garnered. As in Little League, everyone gets a prize. But keep in mind, the awards given in this contest are anything but final. Please feel free to scream at your computer screen, throw a figurative (or real) shoe at my Twitter feed (@Blumslaw), curse me to the heavens, propose alternative awards or, if so inclined, applaud the results. Your choice.\n\nThe Platinum Chalice for Most Unhinged Justice\n\nThis prize (our highest honor) goes to the redoubtable, acerbic purveyor of original intent, a man in perpetual be-robed contact with the Founding Fathers, a legend in his own mind: Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia earned his stripes as the court\u2019s loosest jurisprudential cannon for his departures from reality last June in the court\u2019s rulings on Obamacare (King v. Burwell) and same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges).\n\nIn his dissent in the King case\u2014speaking for himself, Justice Samuel Alito and his mute wingman Justice Clarence Thomas\u2014Scalia sounded more like a character drawn from the pages of Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d than a member of the third branch of government. \u201cWords no longer have meaning,\u201d he thundered, if the language of the Affordable Care Act is construed as the majority of the court has read it. The decision to uphold the act\u2019s marketplace insurance exchanges was \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery\u201d and \u201cpure applesauce,\u201d he admonished.\n\nScalia\u2019s opinion in Obergefell\u2014which was again joined by Thomas\u2014was even more untethered. It began with the implausible assertion that the \u201csubstance of today\u2019s decree is not of immense personal importance to me.\u201d Coming from the pen of someone who in the past has compared homosexuality to murder, polygamy and animal abuse, and equated homosexuals with drug addicts and prostitutes, the claim not only seemed untrue but also could be taken as a clinical sign of dissociation.\n\nDemonstrating that the majority\u2019s opinion was in fact of the utmost personal significance to him, he branded the ruling \u201ca naked judicial claim to legislative\u2014indeed, super-legislative\u2014power.\u201d Lamenting the end of federalism and states\u2019 rights, Scalia charged that a \u201csystem of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\u201d\n\nAnd then, as if yielding to paranoid fantasy, he added: \u201cWho ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.\u201d In a boorish footnote, he obsessed, \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2015 in review, affirmative action, affordable care act, alice in wonderland, antonin scalia, applesauce, bill blum, black lives matter, clarence thomas, constitution, death penalty, donald trump, eighth amendment, fisher v. university of texas, gay marriage, glossip v. gross, gop, john marshall school of law, king v. burwell, lewis carroll, obamacare, oklahoma, prison, prisoners, public employee unions, republican, richard hasen, ruth bader ginsburg, same-sex marriage, samuel alito, scotus, stephen breyer, supreme court, through the looking glass", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Justice Antonin Scalia earned his stripes as the court\u2019s loosest cannon for his remarks on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, while Justice Clarence Thomas was honored for making it through his ninth year without asking a single question during oral arguments.\n - 2015/12/29", "title": "The 2015 SCOTUS Awards: A Look Back at the Highs, Lows and Yearly Shenanigans of the Supreme Court: Bill Blum", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_2015_scotus_awards_supreme_court_review_of_the_year_that_was_20151228", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/scalia_ap_360.jpg", "height": 257}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justice Antonin Scalia earned his stripes as the court\u2019s loosest cannon for his remarks on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, while Justice Clarence Thomas was honored for making it through his ninth year without asking a single question during oral arguments.", "title": "The 2015 SCOTUS Awards: A Look Back at the Highs, Lows and Yearly Shenanigans of the Supreme Court | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_2015_scotus_awards_supreme_court_review_of_the_year_that_was_20151228/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/scalia_ap_360.jpg", "height": 257}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, The 2015 SCOTUS Awards: A Look Back at the Highs, Lows and Yearly Shenanigans of the Supreme Court, 2015 in review, affirmative action, affordable care act, alice in wonderland, antonin scalia, applesauce, bill blum, black lives matter, clarence thomas, constitution, death penalty, donald trump, eighth amendment, fisher v. university of texas, gay marriage, glossip v. gross, gop, john marshall school of law, king v. burwell, lewis carroll, obamacare, oklahoma, prison, prisoners, public employee unions, republican, richard hasen, ruth bader ginsburg, same-sex marriage, samuel alito, scotus, stephen breyer, supreme court, through the looking glass", "article": {"tag": "2015 in review, affirmative action, affordable care act, alice in wonderland, antonin scalia, applesauce, bill blum, black lives matter, clarence thomas, constitution, death penalty, donald trump, eighth amendment, fisher v. university of texas, gay marriage, glossip v. gross, gop, john marshall school of law, king v. burwell, lewis carroll, obamacare, oklahoma, prison, prisoners, public employee unions, republican, richard hasen, ruth bader ginsburg, same-sex marriage, samuel alito, scotus, stephen breyer, supreme court, through the looking glass", "published_time": "2015-12-29T09:22:47-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-31T07:03:48-08:00"}, "description": "Justice Antonin Scalia earned his stripes as the court\u2019s loosest cannon for his remarks on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, while Justice Clarence Thomas was honored for making it through his ninth year without asking a single question during oral arguments.\n - 2015/12/29"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd348e\"", "article_summary": "While I\u2019m not aware of any similar awards pageant, the idea of Supreme Court justices as celebrities is catching on, even as a subject of serious academic exegesis.\nAnd if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage.\nBy Bill BlumSupreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia in Washington in 2010.\n\u201cWords no longer have meaning,\u201d he thundered, if the language of the Affordable Care Act is construed as the majority of the court has read it.\nAsk the nearest hippie.\u201d In a boorish footnote, he obsessed, \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie.\u201d"}
