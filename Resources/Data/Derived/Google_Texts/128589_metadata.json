Great! Be sure to include these great candidate-themed cocktails.\n\nThe Donald Trump:\n\nStart by taking someone else's glass, even if they're using it. You're going to use it better.\n\nThen add anything domestic. Imported spirits are not the best...they bring hangovers, blackouts, crime..some I assume are good drinks, but we want American.\n\nThen build a wall around it, top it off with a dead squirrel, and insult the next woman you see.\n\nThe Ben Carson:\n\nThis is an absinthe drink\u2013it messes with your head and is surprisingly strong given the lack of substance. Before long you'll be that guy at the party saying weird things about the holocaust and evolution and whatever else comes to mind. It starts with...\n\nOh look, the Trump cocktail has a hat now.
