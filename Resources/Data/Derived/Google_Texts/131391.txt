Ted Cruz sees similarities between the failing Obamacare websites and a widespread digital shakedown operation.

“You may have noticed that all the Nigerian e-mail scammers have become a lot less active lately,” the Texas senator told an audience in his hometown on Monday night, according to the Houston Chronicle. “They all have been hired to run the Obamacare website.”

During the King Street Patriots event, Cruz brushed off criticism from fellow lawmakers in Washington over his failed effort to defund Obamacare, saying, “Who cares?” ”At the end of the day, I don’t work for the party bosses in Washington,” he said. ”I work for each and every one of you.”
