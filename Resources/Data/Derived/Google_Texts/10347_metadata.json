We have the chief legal representatives of the eighth and 16th largest economies on Earth (California and New York) probing the biggest fossil fuel company on Earth (ExxonMobil), while both Democratic presidential candidates are demanding that the federal Department of Justice join the investigation of what may prove to be one of the biggest corporate scandals in American history. And that\u2019s just the beginning. As bad as Exxon has been in the past, what it\u2019s doing now \u2014 entirely legally \u2014 is helping push the planet over the edge and into the biggest crisis in the entire span of the human story.\n\nBack in the fall, you might have heard something about how Exxon had covered up what it knew early on about climate change. Maybe you even thought to yourself: that doesn\u2019t surprise me. But it should have. Even as someone who has spent his life engaged in the bottomless pit of greed that is global warming, the news and its meaning came as a shock: we could have avoided, it turns out, the last quarter century of pointless climate debate.\n\nAs a start, investigations by the Pulitzer-Prize winning Inside Climate News, the Los Angeles Times, and Columbia Journalism School revealed in extraordinary detail that Exxon\u2019s top officials had known everything there was to know about climate change back in the 1980s. Even earlier, actually. Here\u2019s what senior company scientist James Black told Exxon\u2019s management committee in 1977: \u201cIn the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels.\u201d To determine if this was so, the company outfitted an oil tanker with carbon dioxide sensors to measure concentrations of the gas over the ocean, and then funded elaborate computer models to help predict what temperatures would do in the future.\n\nThe results of all that work were unequivocal. By 1982, in an internal \u201ccorporate primer,\u201d Exxon\u2019s leaders were told that, despite lingering unknowns, dealing with climate change \u201cwould require major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.\u201d Unless that happened, the primer said, citing independent experts, \u201cthere are some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered\u2026 Once the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible.\u201d But that document, \u201cgiven wide circulation\u201d within Exxon, was also stamped \u201cNot to be distributed externally.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened. Exxon used its knowledge of climate change to plan its own future. The company, for instance, leased large tracts of the Arctic for oil exploration, territory where, as a company scientist pointed outin 1990, \u201cpotential global warming can only help lower exploration and development costs.\u201d Not only that but, \u201cfrom the North Sea to the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Exxon and its affiliates set about \u201craising the decks of offshore platforms, protecting pipelines from increasing coastal erosion, and designing helipads, pipelines, and roads in a warming and buckling Arctic.\u201d In other words, the company started climate-proofing its facilities to head off a future its own scientists knew was inevitable.\n\nBut in public? There, Exxon didn\u2019t own up to any of this. In fact, it did precisely the opposite. In the 1990s, it started to put money and muscle into obscuring the science around climate change. It funded think tanks that spread climate denial and even recruited lobbying talent from the tobacco industry. It also followed the tobacco playbook when it came to the defense of cigarettes by highlighting \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the science of global warming. And it spent lavishly to back political candidates who were ready to downplay global warming.\n\nIts CEO, Lee Raymond, even traveled to China in 1997 and urged government leaders there to go full steam ahead in developing a fossil fuel economy. The globe was cooling, not warming, he insisted, while his engineers were raising drilling platforms to compensate for rising seas. \u201cIt is highly unlikely,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the temperature in the middle of the next century will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or 20 years from now.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t just wrong, but completely and overwhelmingly wrong \u2014 as wrong as a man could be.\n\nSins of Omission\n\nIn fact, Exxon\u2019s deceit \u2014 its ability to discourage regulations for 20 years \u2014 may turn out to be absolutely crucial in the planet\u2019s geological history. It\u2019s in those two decades that greenhouse gas emissions soared, as did global temperatures until, in the twenty-first century, \u201chottest year ever recorded\u201d has become a tired clich\u00e9. And here\u2019s the bottom line: had Exxon told the truth about what it knew back in 1990, we might not have wasted a quarter of a century in a phony debate about the science of climate change, nor would anyone have accused Exxon of being \u201calarmist.\u201d We would simply have gotten to work.\n\nBut Exxon didn\u2019t tell the truth. A Yale study published last fall in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that money from Exxon and the Koch Brothers played a key role in polarizing the climate debate in this country.\n\nThe company\u2019s sins \u2014 of omission and commission \u2014 may even turn out to be criminal. Whether the company \u201clied to the public\u201d is the question that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman decided to investigate last fall in a case that could make him the great lawman of our era if his investigation doesn\u2019t languish. There are various consumer fraud statutes that Exxon might have violated and it might have failed to disclose relevant information to investors, which is the main kind of lying that\u2019s illegal in this country of ours. Now, Schneiderman\u2019s got backup from California Attorney General Kamala Harris, and maybe \u2014 if activists continue to apply pressure \u2014 from the Department of Justice as well, though its highly publicized unwillingness to go after the big banks does not inspire confidence.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: all that was bad back then, but Exxon and many of its Big Energy peers are behaving at least as badly now when the pace of warming is accelerating. And it\u2019s all legal \u2014 dangerous, stupid, and immoral, but legal.\n\nOn the face of things, Exxon has, in fact, changed a little in recent years.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s stopped denying climate change, at least in a modest way. Rex Tillerson, Raymond\u2019s successor as CEO, stopped telling world leaders that the planet was cooling. Speaking in 2012 at the Council on Foreign Relations, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not disputing that increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere is going to have an impact. It\u2019ll have a warming impact.\u201d\n\nOf course, he immediately went on to say that its impact was uncertain indeed, hard to estimate, and in any event entirely manageable. His language was striking. \u201cWe will adapt to this. Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around \u2014 we\u2019ll adapt to that. It\u2019s an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions.\u201d\n\nAdd to that gem of a comment this one: the real problem, he insisted, was that \u201cwe have a society that by and large is illiterate in these areas, science, math, and engineering, what we do is a mystery to them and they find it scary. And because of that, it creates easy opportunities for opponents of development, activist organizations, to manufacture fear.\u201d\n\nRight. This was in 2012, within months of floods across Asia that displaced tens of millions and during the hottest summer ever recorded in the United States, when much of our grain crop failed. Oh yeah, and just before Hurricane Sandy.\n\nHe\u2019s continued the same kind of belligerent rhetoric throughout his tenure. At last year\u2019s ExxonMobil shareholder meeting, for instance, he said that if the world had to deal with \u201cinclement weather,\u201d which \u201cmay or may not be induced by climate change,\u201d we should employ unspecified \u201cnew technologies.\u201d Mankind, he explained, \u201chas this enormous capacity to deal with adversity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re no longer talking about outright denial, just a denial that much really needs to be done. And even when the company has proposed doing something, its proposals have been strikingly ethereal. Exxon\u2019s PR team, for instance, has discussed supporting a price on carbon, which is only what economists left, right, and center have been recommending since the 1980s. But the minimal price they recommend \u2014 somewhere in the range of $40 to $60 a ton \u2014 wouldn\u2019t do much to slow down their business. After all, they insist that all their reserves are still recoverable in the context of such a price increase, which would serve mainly to make life harder for the already terminal coal industry.\n\nBut say you think it\u2019s a great idea to put a price on carbon \u2014 which, in fact, it is, since every signal helps sway investment decisions. In that case, Exxon\u2019s done its best to make sure that what they pretend to support in theory will never happen in practice.\n\nConsider, for instance, their political contributions. The website Dirty Energy Money, organized by Oil Change International, makes it easy to track who gave what to whom. If you look at all of Exxon\u2019s political contributions from 1999 to the present, a huge majority of their political harem of politicians have signed the famous Taxpayer Protection Pledge from Grover Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform that binds them to vote against any new taxes. Norquist himself wrote Congress in late January that \u201ca carbon tax is a VAT or Value Added Tax on training wheels. Any carbon tax would inevitably be spread out over wider and wider parts of the economy until we had a European Value Added Tax.\u201d As he told a reporter last year, \u201cI don\u2019t see the path to getting a lot of Republican votes\u201d for a carbon tax, and since he\u2019s been called \u201cthe most powerful man in American politics,\u201d that seems like a good bet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ExxonMobil's never-ending big dig is flooding the Earth with fossil fuels, Bill McKibben explains", "title": "The digging never ends: It\u2019s not just what ExxonMobil did, it\u2019s what it\u2019s doing", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "ExxonMobil's never-ending big dig is flooding the Earth with fossil fuels, Bill McKibben explains", "title": "The digging never ends: It\u2019s not just what ExxonMobil did, it\u2019s what it\u2019s doing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/its_not_just_what_exxon_did_its_what_its_doing_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/exxon_truck.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ExxonMobil's never-ending big dig is flooding the Earth with fossil fuels, Bill McKibben explains", "title": "The digging never ends: It\u2019s not just what ExxonMobil did, it\u2019s what it\u2019s doing", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/exxon_truck.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bill McKibben", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Big Oil, Environment, Exxon, Oil, Pollution, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Norquist himself wrote Congress in late January that \u201ca carbon tax is a VAT or Value Added Tax on training wheels.\nThe website Dirty Energy Money, organized by Oil Change International, makes it easy to track who gave what to whom.\nTopics: Big Oil, Environment, Exxon, Oil, Pollution, TomDispatch.com, Sustainability News, Social News, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatchHere\u2019s the story so far.\nIn the 1990s, it started to put money and muscle into obscuring the science around climate change.\nIt also followed the tobacco playbook when it came to the defense of cigarettes by highlighting \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the science of global warming."}
