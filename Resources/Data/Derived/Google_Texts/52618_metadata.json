There are dozens of counties without doctors, and the need for health care is only going to increase as more people buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo how do we convince recent medical school graduates to strap on their boots and take root in rural clinics?\n\nGive them a taste. Turns out, they often end up sticking around.\n\nKERA took a look at how rural Texas is ramping up for Obamacare:\n\nIn his green scrubs and sneakers, Will Griffin looks like a full-fledged doctor, but he\u2019s actually a third year medical student at the University of North Texas Health Science Center\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine. While most medical students head to a city like Dallas for experience, Griffin chose Eastland, a town of four thousand people, and one very famous horny toad named Old Rip.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I both grew up in very small towns,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we wanted to go back to.\u201d Plus, he says, family practice in a small town gives you the opportunity for a lifetime relationship with your patients.\n\nThe Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine offers a select group of students the opportunity to try on the lifestyle of a rural physician. During their third year, they work and live in a rural Texas community under the supervision of a local physician.\n\nWhile life in rural Texas might sound romantic, the stats on rural health care are anything but. The 3 million Texans who live in rural areas are more likely to be uninsured, older, poorer and have higher rates of hypertension and diabetes. Add to that a serious shortage of physicians, and you\u2019ve got a system of clinics desperate for relief.\n\nRead more at KERA\u2019s Breakthroughs blog.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "In rural Texas, finding a family practice doctor is no easy feat.
