Forget the White House, some critics would say: Sanders doesn\u2019t even have a shot at giving Hillary a strong primary challenge, should he choose to run as a Democrat, so why bother?\n\nThe answer is easy: 1988. That year, not one, but two long-shot outsider primary campaigns had profound impacts on American politics: Jesse Jackson on the left, and Pat Robertson on the right. As Sanders actively tests the waters, the question of just how to make the most of the opportunity is both timely and important.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that Senator Sanders would win the presidential election in 2016,\u201d said Darcy Burner, former executive director of the House Progressive Caucus. But, she added quickly, \u201cA Bernie Sanders run could make a big difference in terms of changing the national conversation if it\u2019s done right, and if the activists on the left focus on it.\n\n\u201cOne of the key tactics the political status quo uses to maintain the existing balance of power is to distract people with false binary choices about key problems facing the country. For instance: should we cut Social Security now or later?\u201d Burner said. \u201cPeople assume that because those are the choices they hear, then those must be the only choices. This tactic is used across every policy area.\u201d\n\nFor years, along these same lines, the Progressive Caucus has developed a People\u2019s Budget, solidly aligned with supermajority views of the American people \u2014 protecting Social Security and Medicare, for example \u2014 which the donor-class-dominated political media routinely ignores, even though those budgets have also done a better job of bringing budget deficits down than the various more prominent proposals. Sanders has been the one consistent voice in the Senate supporting the People\u2019s Budget \u2014 a strong indication of what Burner sees in his potential candidacy.\n\n\u201cIf we want to change the conversation, we have to stop being distracted by the false framing handed to us by those in power and instead start discussing the actual range of choices we face,\u201d Burner said. \u201cSenator Sanders has a long history of seeing past the false choices and presenting clearly what our real choices are. By default, the media will try to avoid covering him: he\u2019s unlikely to win and the things he says are outside of their comfort zone. So the key challenge to the left is to do whatever it takes to get people to actually hear what he\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\nAmplifying Sanders\u2019 voice, and demanding that others respond to it, will be key, Burner went on to say: \u201cIt means making a conscious decision to build a grassroots loudspeaker for the things he talks about. And it means deciding to ignore the defenders of the status quo calling us fringe and crazy, because when they can\u2019t attack our ideas, they switch to character assassination every time.\u201d\n\nReturning to the examples of 1988, on the Democratic side, Jesse Jackson\u2019s shoestring campaign nonetheless came in second, winning 29 percent of the primary votes, compared to 42 percent gained by the nominee, Michael Dukakis. He registered large numbers of low-income and minority voters, and reshaped delegate selections rules \u2014 both factors that helped Barack Obama win the nomination 20 years later.\n\nBut on the Republican side, a far less successful campaign had an even greater long-term impact. Pat Robertson came in a distant third, gaining just 9 percent of primary votes compared to 68 percent for the nominee, George H.W. Bush, yet Roberston used the mailing lists gathered by his campaign to establish the Christian Coalition, which proceeded to take over much of GOP\u2019s state-level infrastructure in the following decade.\n\nProgressive strategist Mike Lux has co-founded more groups than most folks are members of, while also playing a leadership role in five presidential campaigns and writing \u201cThe Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to Be.\u201d Lux has a much higher opinion of Warren\u2019s chances should she choose to run against Hillary \u2014\u201cIt would be a big fight for the nomination, and I think Elizabeth could win that,\u201d he said \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t see her getting in the race. Warren represents one end of the spectrum of possible challenges, Lux said. \u201cAt the other end of the spectrum there\u2019s a sort of Kucinich-style candidacies, which make no ripples, have a lasting impact, as far as I can tell, maybe other people have a different perspective.\u201d Sanders would fall in the middle. \u201cI love him dearly, but he\u2019s kind of got that grumpy old man kind of persona; he\u2019s sort of the John McCain of the left,\u201d Lux said.\n\nStill, Lux sees the opportunity for a Robertson-style impact as a real possibility. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to support Bernie Sanders you should be thinking how do we use this to build long-term, and I think building an organization out of it is something that\u2019s worth doing and would add to the progressive infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWe can all agree with Lux that Sanders isn\u2019t as charismatic as Jesse Jackson, but Robertson\u2019s example remains relevant \u2014 particularly given how out of touch our current broken political system has become, and how widely people feel it. Much has changed since 1988, so it\u2019s not about repeating old formulas. But it is about asking the right set of questions \u2014 questions of messaging, organizing, attitude, relationship to history and more \u2026 questions that ultimately add up to \u201cWhat does he need to run a campaign that could renew the promise of America?\u201d These are clearly worthwhile questions to be asked, not just by Sanders and his advisors, but by all those who might join in supporting him, to help change the trajectory of American politics.\n\nEven for those still hoping Elizabeth Warren will change her mind, the question of how to have a long-term impact should be crucial \u2014 in terms of institution-building, advancing ideas, altering the framing of debates, and focusing attention on key generational issues.\n\nWhen it comes to issues, Zephyr Teachout, who just ran a strong low-budget primary campaign against Wall Street-friendly New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, had no doubt what they should be \u2014 although she\u2019s still hoping more candidates will come forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trust-busting moment,\u201d Teachout said, \u201cIt is waiting to be grabbed on to. \u2026 When you get into a room, it\u2019s what people are experiencing.\u201d Massively outspent, with the Democratic Party establishment aligned against her, Teachout nonetheless won 34 percent of the vote and carried half of New York\u2019s 62 counties, a solid sign that she\u2019s onto something \u2014 and others have agreed.\n\n\u201cSanders will lay out an agenda that challenges the shibboleths of American politics on Wall Street, on trade, on taxes, on public investment,\u201d said Robert Borosage, founder and president of the Institute for America\u2019s Future and co-director of its sister organization, the Campaign for America\u2019s Future. \u201cA lot of that agenda is relatively new for the progressive movements of the last decade, most of which focused more on social issues and much less on economics.\u201d\n\nWithout actually committing to run, Sanders effectively confirmed this view in a recent Salon interview, when he laid out the high points of policy agenda to reverse America\u2019s growing inequality and rebuild the middle class. First, raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Second, put Americans back to work with a trillion dollar investment in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, which would create 13 million decent-paying jobs. Third, create \u201ca trade system that works for working people and not just corporate America.\u201d Those are the first three items, he said. Then add tax reform, so the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, and making college affordable, while relieving student debt. That won\u2019t solve everything, Sanders acknowledged, but it would go \u201ca good way\u201d toward rebuilding the middle class, and getting the wealthy to pay their fair share.\n\nAs a result, Borosage argued, a Sanders campaign could greatly benefit progressives by advancing a debate on these issues. \u201cOne of the big opportunities that debate offers is the ability to educate our own activists with an argument and an agenda that many are not comfortable with,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that what the right does better than we do is that they teach their activists the words of the songs, so they all know the scripture; they all know the verse they are supposed to be reciting,\u201d \u2014 something that\u2019s rarely true for progressives, \u201cparticularly on economic issues, were progressives are often confused and all over the place.\u201d\n\nAnother thing the right seems to do better is make their values seem patriotic, all-American; and Teachout sees a real opportunity here as well. \u201cTaking on trust-busting is one of the oldest traditions, American traditions. Jefferson wanted an anti-monopoly clause in the Constitution, and it was big part of our tradition until 1980, when Reagan eviscerated our antitrust division.\u201d Teddy Roosevelt and FDR were two other historical figures that she called on in her campaign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still powerful with people,\u201d Teachout said. \u201cA nation is like a person. We want to call on our better instincts, knowing that we\u2019ve been able to call them before, instead of disdaining our past. It\u2019s very powerful to people.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, it also helps that Sanders knows very well that he\u2019s representing supermajority positions on some of his most crucial issues, as he pointed out in his interview:\n\nI helped lead the fight to stop the cuts in Social Security, along with some others. I would say, 70-to-80 percent of the American people agree with me. I believe we should raise the minimum wage. I would say 70 percent of the American people agree with that. I\u2019ve been very active in the fight to overturn Citizens United. I would say, again, 70 percent of the people agree with that. I am active in the fight to address the crisis of climate change. I wouldn\u2019t say 70 percent of the people agree with that, but a pretty strong majority do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Warren sits 2016 out, an unelectable longshot may be liberals' only hope.
