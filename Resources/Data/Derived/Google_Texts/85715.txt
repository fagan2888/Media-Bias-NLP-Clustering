Will Paul Ryan Get a Concession Out of Trump on Entitlements?

There have been two defining moments in Paul Ryanâ€™s political career: The first was his leading the opposition to Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. (Can anyone forget the "Health Summit," or his short speech on the night of the Obamacare vote in the House?) The second was his getting essentially the entire Republican party to back his crucial, fiscally responsible Medicare reforms (thereby showing it's possible to hold the House and take back the Senate even after courageously touching the "third rail" of American politics).

Donald Trump, so far, has been weak on both issues. He says he wants to repeal Obamacare, but he also says he doesn't want to repeal its onerous preexisting-conditions mandate.
