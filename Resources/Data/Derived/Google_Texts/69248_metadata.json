The rule specifically bans the denial of coverage or health care itself on the basis of gender identity.\n\nThe rule, which comprises several regulations, was formed under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which includes first-of-its-kind civil rights protections in health care for several classes of people \u2014 including a ban on discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nICYMI: Here is the Obama Administration\u2019s Sweeping Transgender Guidance for Schools: READ IT\n\nThe new rule concludes that anti-transgender discrimination is sex-based discrimination. The rule also does not provide a \u2018religious freedom\u2019 exemption:\n\nDuring a comment period last fall, some groups requested that \u201cthe rule should exempt faith-based providers from providing particular services, such as services related to gender transition, that are inconsistent with their religious beliefs,\u201d the rule says.\n\nHowever, it continues, federal officials \u201cdecided against including a blanket religious exemption,\u201d instead noting that existing federal laws that protect religious freedom were already sufficient.\n\nAnd while the new rule does not explicitly ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, such a ban could be not far off:\n\nIn a press release Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services said its civil rights office will \u201cevaluate complaints that allege sex discrimination related to an individual\u2019s sexual orientation to determine if they involve the sorts of stereotyping that can be addressed under 1557. HHS supports prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination as a matter of policy and will continue to monitor legal developments on this issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.towleroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/President_Obama_delivers_the_State_of_the_Union_address_Jan._20_2015.jpg?fit=300%2C200", "title": "New Obamacare Rule Prohibits Discrimination Against Transgender Patients"}, "description": "The Obama administration on Friday issued a \"final rule\" under Obamacare that bans discrimination against transgender patients.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Towleroad", "description": "The Obama administration on Friday issued a \"final rule\" under Obamacare that bans discrimination against transgender patients.", "title": "New Obamacare Rule Prohibits Discrimination Against Transgender Patients - Towleroad", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.towleroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/President_Obama_delivers_the_State_of_the_Union_address_Jan._20_2015.jpg", "height": 436}, "updated_time": "2016-05-13T15:28:21-04:00", "url": "http://www.towleroad.com/2016/05/obamacare-transgender/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration on Friday issued a \"final rule\" under Obamacare that bans discrimination against transgender patients.", "creator": "@seanmandell", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.towleroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/President_Obama_delivers_the_State_of_the_Union_address_Jan._20_2015.jpg?fit=654%2C436", "title": "New Obamacare Rule Prohibits Discrimination Against Transgender Patients - Towleroad", "site": "@tlrd", "card": "summary"}, "alexaVerifyID": "RRUWOIxb9cZKaMEDdLln6zK8xdU", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-13T15:22:43-04:00", "fb": {"app_id": 180651805330333}, "bitly-verification": "fd057f9c2ad2", "google-site-verification": "oOM2K_DOqZ7CNZU6fqonByIjTNFk-JRv-rQlZgGBlaA", "msvalidate.01": "9D426546C559809C8860DDED269CEE3A", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/towleroad.page", "tag": "Transgender", "published_time": "2016-05-13T15:22:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-13T15:28:21-04:00"}, "verify-v1": "gXwx5P2qZhcu9i5SCsZOYaGHfhHW6xyiSAa2Mi1ZlpI=", "microid": "mailto+http:sha1:474f91e314f134328298a9e9989d8d2916e1deed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, lgbt rights, obamacare, transgender"}, "article_summary": "HHS supports prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination as a matter of policy and will continue to monitor legal developments on this issue.\u201d\nICYMI: Here is the Obama Administration\u2019s Sweeping Transgender Guidance for Schools: READ ITThe new rule concludes that anti-transgender discrimination is sex-based discrimination.\nThe rule specifically bans the denial of coverage or health care itself on the basis of gender identity.\nFollowing on the heels of an order late Thursday that declared transgender students across the nation must be allowed to use school bathrooms in accordance with their gender identity, the Obama administration on Friday issued a \u201cfinal rule\u201d under Obamacare that bans discrimination against transgender patients.\nBuzzFeed reports:Transgender people must be provided transition-related services and cannot be denied health care by providers or professionals who receive federal funding, according to a final rule announced Friday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."}
