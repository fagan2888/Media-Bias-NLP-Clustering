He (and his team, including the president himself) told them that the deal became possible when a new \u201cmoderate\u201d Iranian president reached out to Mr. Obama in 2013, when in fact, the groundwork for the deal had begun long before when the hard-liners were still in power.\n\nThe president\u2019s fanboys and fangirls in the media ate it up.\n\n\u201cThe average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cThey literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nMr. Rhodes also knows nothing about foreign policy, having been a novelist before joining the Obama speechwriting team in 2007. Of course, the ability to write fiction came in handy as he spun lies like circus plates.\n\n\u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he said, referring to the network of friendly journalists and other fellow travelers (\u201ccompadres,\u201d he called them) who unquestioningly conveyed their narrative. \u201cThey were saying things that we had validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\n\nNone of this is surprising, given the long history of left-wing bias in the media. But when that institutional bias was coupled with an outright worship of Mr. Obama, the press took their cheerleading to absurd levels.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, then-Newsweek editor Evan Thomas gushed, \u201cI mean in a way Obama\u2019s standing above the country, above \u2014 above the world, he\u2019s sort of God.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews spoke of an Obama-induced ecstasy: \u201cI have to tell you, you know, it\u2019s part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama\u2019s speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg.\u201d\n\nA particularly egregious example of the media\u2019s pro-Obama activism was the attempt by some of them to bury the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal. As tapes of Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime pastor spewing vicious anti-American rhetoric flooded the airwaves, the left-wing media tried to ignore the story until they no longer could, and then they mobilized.\n\nMembers of JournoList, a listserv made up of hundreds of left-wing journalists from major media organizations, were outraged that ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopolous had asked Mr. Obama why it had taken him so long to dissociate himself from Rev. Wright\u2019s comments. The left-wing journalists jumped into action, with Thomas Schaller of the Baltimore Sun suggesting, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we use the power of this list to do something about the debate\u201d and writing a \u201csmart statement expressing disgust\u201d at the questions Mr. Stephanopolous had asked Mr. Obama.\n\nNo wonder so many in the left-wing media sought to protect Mr. Obama. With religious fervor, they believed in the man and his mission and did whatever it took to make his presidency a reality.\n\nOnce he took office, he used the full force of the White House to create an Orwellian landscape, in which media organizations that didn\u2019t play the Obama propaganda game were intimidated and punished. During his hard-sell of Obamacare in August 2009, for example, the White House appointed health care \u201cczar\u201d Nancy deParle and former ABC News correspondent Linda Douglass to monitor the blogs and \u201ccasual conversations\u201d of Obamacare opponents and report them to the president.\n\nThe Obama team slammed The Boston Herald for having the audacity to run a front-page op-ed by former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The San Francisco Chronicle was punished because a print pool reporter recorded anti-Obama protesters at a Bay Area fundraiser. A local Texas reporter at WFAA-TV was criticized by the president himself for interrupting him. Then-CBS News investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson was \u201cscreamed at\u201d by White House flunky Eric Schultz for probing the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal.\n\nThe Obama 2012 re-election campaign also launched \u201cAttack Watch,\u201d which, as they put it, was \u201ca new way to track and respond to attacks against President Obama.\u201d And the White House orchestrated a war on an entire news network, Fox News.\n\nThe intensity with which these media organizations were called out, dressed down and punished was astonishing \u2014 and served as an effective deterrent to anyone else who might be inclined to probe the administration\u2019s actions. It was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 an outrageous abuse of power, submitted to willingly by much of the press.\n\nThroughout his interminable presidency, Mr. Obama has enjoyed the protection of this King\u2019s Guard. Mr. Rhodes simply exploited their shallow idolatry and professional lassitude. And the country has been damaged immeasurably because of it.\n\n\u2022 Monica Crowley is editor of online opinion at The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every once in a while, some liberal will drop the left-wing code of omerta and blurt out exactly what their organized deception syndicate is up to.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Every once in a while, some liberal will drop the left-wing code of omerta and blurt out exactly what their organized deception syndicate is up to.", "title": "MONICA CROWLEY: Obama\u2019s King\u2019s Guard", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/11/monica-crowley-obamas-kings-guard/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/11/5_112016_b1-crowley8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/11/5_112016_b1-crowley8201.jpg", "description": "Every once in a while, some liberal will drop the left-wing code of omerta and blurt out exactly what their organized deception syndicate is up to.", "card": "summary", "title": "MONICA CROWLEY: Obama\u2019s King\u2019s Guard"}, "Author": "Monica Crowley", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "Throughout his interminable presidency, Mr. Obama has enjoyed the protection of this King\u2019s Guard.\nSpewing contempt for \u201cjournalists\u201d whom he considered ridiculously easy marks, Mr. Rhodes was particularly proud of duping the press on Mr. Obama\u2019s dangerous Iran nuclear deal.\nBut when that institutional bias was coupled with an outright worship of Mr. Obama, the press took their cheerleading to absurd levels.\nMr. Rhodes simply exploited their shallow idolatry and professional lassitude.\nNo wonder so many in the left-wing media sought to protect Mr. Obama."}
