The remarkable rapidity with which Southern conservatives have called for removing the Confederate flag, in the wake of the vicious racist murders in Charleston, S.C., removes another potential problem.\n\nAs much as the party\u2019s base hates Obamacare, the court made clear that it is now a legal reality. Republican congressional leaders would be smart to work with the administration on addressing the law\u2019s imperfections, and get concessions in the process. The challenge on same-sex marriage is to prevent the right wing from keeping the issue front and center.\n\nWhen the question of removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds surfaced, the initial reaction of some conservatives, including Republican presidential candidates, was to say that it was up to the state.\n\nDespite this claim of \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d the flag, a symbol of racial hatred, is now coming down across the South.\n\nBut the question of states\u2019 rights is central to political conservatives.\n\nAppealing to the Constitution \u2014 the 10th Amendment says the federal government only has the powers specifically delegated to it \u2014 and to good policy, they argue that the government closest to the people is best able to decide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is undeniable that federal regulations and mandates can be too intrusive and that many public policy innovations occur at the state and local level. Yet the increasing mobility of American society, and issues such as communications and transportation, as well as the desire of major businesses for policy clarity, often require national prescriptions.\n\nMoreover, conservatives often forsake the principle of states\u2019 rights when it does not fit their ideological goals.\n\nA contemporary example is the decriminalization of marijuana in a number of states, and its acceptance for medicinal purposes in about two dozen.\n\nStarting with Colorado, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use.\n\nBut Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican candidate for president, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is exploring a possible bid for the Republican nomination, have vowed to brush aside local laws such as Colorado\u2019s if elected. \u201cI will crack down and not permit it,\u201d Mr. Christie declared.\n\nEven after the same-sex marriage decision on Friday, candidates such as Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin insisted this was a states\u2019 rights issue and called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the action.\n\nThe principle that local government knows best is often ignored by conservatives when it comes to the nation\u2019s capital, which was granted home rule 40 years ago with Congress retaining the veto right. Lawmakers, principally conservatives, have second-guessed the residents on gun control, on gay marriage and now on a law in the District of Columbia that prohibits discrimination against employees who seek contraception, family planning counsel or an abortion.\n\nWhen the Dodd-Frank bank overhaul legislation was debated, conservatives opposed provisions to give states more authority to ensure the financial protection of consumers and in regulating lending practices of national banks. \u201cWe won 90 percent, despite the unanimous opposition of House Republicans and the big banks,\u201d former Representative Barney Frank recalled.\n\nStates\u2019 rights were invoked during the South Carolina flag episode. The flag was not raised at the state capitol in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, to celebrate fallen veterans, but in 1962, almost 100 years later. It happened in the middle of the civil rights movement to seek basic rights such as voting and public accommodations that were denied many black Americans. The flag was put up to celebrate segregation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd it is worth remembering that the Confederacy invoked states\u2019 rights, as a cover for the defense of slavery, to justify taking up arms in the Civil War.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150628123742, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans often forsake the principle of states\u2019 rights when it does not fit with their ideological goals, Albert R.
