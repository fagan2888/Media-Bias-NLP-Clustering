After acquiring Ivera Medical, the company best known for the Post-it product line continues to build health care division

3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) has completed the $1 billion acquisition of Polypore International Inc.s (NYSE: PPO) separations media business.

The target makes membrane technology and ultrafiltration products that are used mainly for blood treatments in the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors. Ultrafiltration is a process that separates tiny particles from membranes. The acquired business has $210 million in annual sales and will become part of 3Ms industrial business group.

3M CEO Inge Thulin said at the time the deal was announced in February that the acquisition will give the company many growth opportunities across a number of sectors including life sciences, water treatment and industrial. Thulin added that there is a large consumer demand for membrane and filtration products.

St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, the maker of Post-it, announced plans to buy Ivera Medical Corp. for undisclosed terms. Ivera makes products that disinfect and protect medical devices that are used to access a patients blood stream.
