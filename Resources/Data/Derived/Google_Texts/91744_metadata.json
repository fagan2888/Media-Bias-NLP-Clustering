Senator Ted Cruz is the sponsor of an amendment \u201cto define marriage as limited to the union of one man and one woman.\u201d And like Mr. Rubio, he is the co-sponsor of amendments to limit congressional terms and balance the budget.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s aim to end citizenship by birth, presumably for children of immigrants living in the country illegally, would require a constitutional amendment. His calls to \u201copen up the libel laws\u201d to make it easier for public figures (like himself) to sue litigants and journalists would also require a constitutional amendment or a highly unlikely reversal of existing law by the Supreme Court, as explained in this recent article by Bill Blum at Truthdig.\n\nGov. John Kasich is a long-time supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which sounds nice but is pure foolishness. Forcing the government to balance its budget is like telling a family it must pay off its mortgage and car loans, now, no matter its income or creditworthiness. It is no way to run a government.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders both support constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision from 2010 that allowed for unlimited campaign donations by corporations and unions. Both of them also supported the Senate attempt in 2007 to revive the Equal Rights Amendment for women, which passed the House and Senate in 1972 but fell three states short of the 38 state legislatures needed for ratification.\n\nThere is a basic difference between the constitutional aims of Republicans and those of Democrats. Republicans generally want amendments that curb or eliminate legal rights \u2014 to health care, marriage or citizenship, for example. Democrats generally want to protect or expand rights \u2014 to fair elections or equal protection under the law, for example.\n\nAmending the Constitution is a real long shot. So when candidates talk about how they would amend the Constitution, they are giving their idealized view of the world. Which world would you rather live in?", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160316165425, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Cruz, Ted;Kasich, John R;Rubio, Marco;Sanders, Bernard;Trump, Donald J", "org": "Citizens United;Democratic Party;House of Representatives;Republican Party;Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Clinton Hillary Rodham,Cruz Ted,Kasich John R,Rubio Marco,Sanders Bernard,Trump Donald J,Balanced Budget Amendment (US),Campaign Finance,Children and Childhood,Citizens United v Federal Election Commission (Supreme Court Decision),Citizenship and Naturalization,Constitution (US),Constitutional Amendments,Presidential Election of 2016,Term Limits (Political Office),United States Politics and Government,Citizens United,Democratic Party,House of Representatives,Republican Party,Supreme Court (US),Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/The Candidates and the Constitution ( 20160316 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Teresa Tritch", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Teresa Tritch", "byl": "Teresa Tritch", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/the-candidates-and-the-constitution/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/16/opinion/16tritchWEB2/16tritchWEB2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "description": "You can tell a lot about the presidential contenders from the constitutional amendments they support.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Candidates and the Constitution"}, "blogpostid": 100000004275620, "description": "You can tell a lot about the presidential contenders from the constitutional amendments they support.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 16, 2016", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1458161665, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T20:54:25-04:00"}, "utime": 20160316205425, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160316, "pdate": 20160316, "des": "Balanced Budget Amendment (US);Campaign Finance;Children and Childhood;Citizens United v Federal Election Commission (Supreme Court Decision);Citizenship and Naturalization;Constitution (US);Constitutional Amendments;Presidential Election of 2016;Term Limits (Political Office);United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/16/opinion/16tritchWEB2/16tritchWEB2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "You can tell a lot about the presidential contenders from the constitutional amendments they support.", "title": "The Candidates and the Constitution", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/the-candidates-and-the-constitution/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/16/opinion/16tritchWEB2/16tritchWEB2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/the-candidates-and-the-constitution/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Candidates and the Constitution", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/16/opinion/16tritchWEB2/16tritchWEB2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 16, 2016"}, "article_summary": "So when candidates talk about how they would amend the Constitution, they are giving their idealized view of the world.\nDonald Trump\u2019s aim to end citizenship by birth, presumably for children of immigrants living in the country illegally, would require a constitutional amendment.\nJohn Kasich is a long-time supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which sounds nice but is pure foolishness.\nBut Mr. Rubio\u2019s departure doesn\u2019t mean the Constitution is safe.\nAmending the Constitution is a real long shot."}
