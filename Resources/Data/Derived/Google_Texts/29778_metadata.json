As this unlikely candidate bids for the presidency of the United States, it seems people love to hate this politician who makes no apologies about his anti-immigration stance, as well as his personal attacks toward the media or anyone else who would criticize him.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s many negative moments in the press, his poll numbers speak for themselves.\n\n\u201c@ben_techpro: Donald Trump opens up \u2018massive\u2019 lead in national poll https://t.co/yBfezuPX9a #makeamericagreatagain #wakeupamerica @GOP\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2015\n\nSuch performance appeals to an American right-wing disenfranchised by the dominance of liberal politics and the failure of the GOP to counter the general shift to the left that America has made over the last seven years, particularly concerning Obamacare, which Trump claimed was \u201coverseen by a Surgeon General who is obese, and financed by a country that is broke!!!!\u201d\n\nIt is this \u201cplain-talking\u201d that appeals to supporters of the Republican Party, which are against all Obama policies, especially those helping migrants, gays, and poor people. Trump is also known for making outrageous comments, most recently implying that families of terrorists should be targeted, as well as the terrorists themselves.\n\nDonald Trump: I would \u201cgo after the wives\u201d of terrorists https://t.co/4QqwGB1SIw pic.twitter.com/KOK9aXOBcZ \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) December 6, 2015\n\nCharm\n\nDonald Trump appeals to voters due to his charm. This charm comes across in self-affirmation tropes such as avoiding an apology.\n\n\u201cI fully think apologizing is a great thing,\u201d the famously self-assured Trump replied before winning the studio audience\u2019s applause by adding: \u201cBut you have to be WRONG. \u2026 I will absolutely apologize sometime in the hopefully distant future if I\u2019m ever wrong.\u201d\n\nOn this episode of The Tonight Show, Trump appears to resonate with the audience and it is this public appeal that has him rising in the polls despite the negative press he receives for his shocking political beliefs and tactless behavior, such as when Trump mocked a disabled news reporter.\n\nAnd so the charm of Trump is his outlandish, but secretly popular, views regarding not apologizing combined with his outright politically incorrect behavior, which would be taboo on any school playground let alone the political stage.\n\nCharisma\n\nDonald Trump is the subject of academic papers asking what makes a good business leader.\n\n\u201cSome of those are values, skills and cognitive abilities. Mr. Trump exhibits all of these traits. If this is what has made him as successful as he is, why are certain leaders not able to achieve his type of success?\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of this study is that charisma is Trump\u2019s proverbial and literal \u201ctrump card,\u201d which he employs in his approach to the world as someone speaking his mind genuinely.\n\nPerhaps this appeals to voters who are tired of forked tongue politicians telling them everything they want to hear instead of truth.\n\nCan you imagine Donald Trump doing this? pic.twitter.com/LE8vatY5uS \u2014 aaron blitzstein (@BlitznBeans) December 6, 2015\n\nChurlishness\n\nHow could churlishness be a positive trait? In the case of Donald Trump, it seems to be that no matter how churlish he is, his popularity wavers little.\n\nFor example, here are the top three churlish quotes by Trump. For all 25 quotes, head over to Inside Gov.\n\n\u201cYou know, it really doesn\u2019t matter what the media write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.\u201d\n\nAnd so, Trump continues to use his charm, charisma, and churlishness to win over voters who seem in a trance, mesmerized by this absurd man who reflects a pomposity not seen since the two terms of the last GOP president, George W. Bush.\n\n[Image by DonkeyHotey CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0), via Wikimedia Commons]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald trump continues to make headlines, and trend strongly in Internet searches.
