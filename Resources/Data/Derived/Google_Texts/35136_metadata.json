Eight percent of owners in the most recent period reported a decrease in premiums while 27 percent said their rates remained the same.\n\nIn a related matter, the study found that 16 percent of surveyed businesses with fewer than 50 workers currently reimburse employees for the cost of insurance or medical visits. That\u2019s troublesome, said Wade, because this year the IRS determined that reimbursing workers isn\u2019t in compliance with the ACA. Employers who violate the rule could face fines of up to $100 per day per employee, which potentially amounts to $36,500 per year. Even more worrisome, said Wade, is that another 20 percent of owners are actively considering a reimbursement benefit for their employees.\n\n\u201cMore than a third of small-business owners are in violation of the rule or may be in violation soon,\u201d said Wade. \u201cThat signals a big education gap in the employer community and it\u2019s a very serious threat to small businesses.\u201d\n\nOf about 2,800 Mississippi members of the NFIB, most have fewer than 50 employees, state director Ron Aldridge said in an August interview.\n\nAbout one in seven reimburse their employees for medical expenses, he said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has interpreted that as a de facto group policy that is in violation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne of the selling points of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 was that small employers would not have to provide coverage.\n\nBut the IRS imposed the $100 a day excise tax that went into effect July 1.\n\nThe Mississippi Insurance Department said in August that \u201cthe rule punishes small businesses for providing the only health insurance support many can afford \u2013 a contribution to help employees pay premiums for their individual or family policies or to help finance direct payments for medical services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nSixty-three percent of small-business owners reported higher health insurance ...", "title": "Small businesses report premiums rising, are unaware of stiff IRS fine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/irs-logo-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-25T15:10:06-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/11/small-businessstiff-irs-fine/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Govt/Politics", "tag": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-11-25T09:00:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T15:10:06-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 Sixty-three percent of small-business owners reported higher health insurance premiums between July 2014 and July 2015, according to a National Federation of Independent Business survey.
