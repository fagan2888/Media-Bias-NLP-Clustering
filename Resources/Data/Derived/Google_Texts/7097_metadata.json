(Photo: Jess Grimm/Gazette)Buy Photo\n\nA Jimmy John\u2019s restaurant along West Main Street, the latest business to come to the downtown, is set to open Tuesday.\n\nThe sub sandwich chain known for its \u201cfreaky fast\u201d delivery will be operated by Brian Pontius and his wife, Heather, who are excited for the store\u2019s opening at 22 W. Main St.\n\nInitially, the husband-and-wife team looked at locating a store on Bridge Street, but they eventually shifted gears and decided to settle on a downtown location.\n\nBrian Pontius said the existing store was a good fit for them, noting that the renovation of the Carlisle Building was a major factor. The store will employ 30 people.\n\nThe Pontiuses are expecting business to do well, especially after the $400,000-plus investment that has been made.\n\n\u201cEach positive seems to snowball after another positive,\u201d Heather Pontius said. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to be downtown. I grew up in Chillicothe, and I\u2019m excited to be in the area.\u201d\n\nThe Pontiuses got the idea to open up a Jimmy John\u2019s store when they were visiting their children at Ohio University in Athens. The store will be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., with a ribbon-cutting scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nHeather Pontius said what she enjoys most about Jimmy John\u2019s is the freshly baked bread, adding that the meat and produce are sliced each day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just simple, but it\u2019s good,\u201d she said, referring to the sandwiches.\n\nShe also said she thinks the store will be a good thing for downtown, noting that the pair has had a lot of feedback about the store and anticipates a good turnout.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s going to be crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nRandy Davies, president and CEO of the Chillicothe-Ross Chamber of Commerce, also said the store\u2019s presence in the downtown area will be a good thing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited that Jimmy John\u2019s chose to invest in downtown Chillicothe and to make a first appearance in our community and our revitalization efforts,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe wish them the best.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Jimmy John\u2019s, visit www.jimmyjohns.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1FmB0IU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Restaurant will employ 30 people, will be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.", "og": {"site_name": "Chillicothe Gazette", "description": "Restaurant will employ 30 people, will be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.", "title": "Jimmy John\u2019s set to open Tuesday", "url": "http://www.chillicothegazette.com/story/news/local/2015/05/17/jimmy-johns-set-open-tuesday/27504339/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/chillicothegazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Restaurant will employ 30 people, will be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.", "creator": "@chilligaz", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09cb3ba73b627fc5a5059550a95cbafacf12df9c/c=404-0-2131-1727&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/17/Chillicothe/B9317348587Z.1_20150517184550_000_GA4APLQNA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Jimmy John\u2019s set to open Tuesday", "site": "@chilligaz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=895152179", "fb": {"app_id": 185597654790970}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Jess Grimm/Gazette)Buy PhotoA Jimmy John\u2019s restaurant along West Main Street, the latest business to come to the downtown, is set to open Tuesday.\nBuy Photo Brian and Heather Pontius are opening a Jimmy John\u2019s on Tuesday in downtown Chillicothe.\n\u201cWe wish them the best.\u201dFor more information on Jimmy John\u2019s, visit www.jimmyjohns.com.\nHeather Pontius said what she enjoys most about Jimmy John\u2019s is the freshly baked bread, adding that the meat and produce are sliced each day.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited that Jimmy John\u2019s chose to invest in downtown Chillicothe and to make a first appearance in our community and our revitalization efforts,\u201d Davies said."}
