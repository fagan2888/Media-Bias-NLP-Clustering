It was a dreary day for most stocks, not just the health-care sector, but tiny Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. enjoyed a surge of nearly 30% in recent action Friday as rumors of a possible takeover from across the Atlantic boosted the company’s shares.

A report in London’s The Mail said Ariad /quotes/zigman/57221/delayed /quotes/nls/aria ARIA has been approached by three biopharmaceutical giants: Eli Lilly & Co. /quotes/zigman/232185/delayed /quotes/nls/lly LLY , GlaxoSmithKline /quotes/zigman/146635/delayed /quotes/nls/gsk GSK and Shire PLC. /quotes/zigman/66975/delayed /quotes/nls/shpg SHPG

Officials from Ariad, Lilly and Shire would not comment. GlaxoSmithKline had yet to respond to requests for comment.

The Mail said Lilly is ahead of the pack in a possible buyout of Ariad, while GlaxoSmithKline and Shire are “believed to be keeping a close eye” on the deal in case Lilly walks away.

The report said Lilly is prepared to pay $20 a share, roughly three times where Aviad shares traded prior to Thursday, when rumors started to circulate. Shares were up $2.21 to $9.73 in recent action on Friday, adding to the 12% gain on Thursday.

Based in Cambridge, Mass., Ariad shares plunged in October from around the $20 level after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to stop selling its Iclusig drug for leukemia patients.

Earlier this month, the FDA opened up sales of Iclusig to a narrower band of leukemia patients for which there is no treatment. That apparently has kicked off interest in a possible buyout of Ariad while shares remain at a discounted level.
