In fact, the administration \u2018shot itself in the foot.\u2019\n\nFrancesca appeared on the new TV network\u2019s America with Jorge Ramos on Tuesday evening, alongside John Della Volpe from the Harvard University Institute of Politics and New Hampshire state Rep. Marilinda Garcia (R). Fusion, owned jointly by Disney-ABC and Univision, is specifically targeted to young people and covers news, politics and popular culture.\n\nThe host asked his guests what political topics young people are most passionate about in the United States right now \u2014 because it often seems as if they\u2019re not passionate about anything. Francesca said that older generations are often bad at reaching out to Millennials, but noted that young people do care about healthcare and higher education.\n\n\n\n\u201cObamacare lets young people under the age of 26 stay on their parents\u2019 healthcare\u2026so that was one of the ways I think that the Obama administration shot themselves in the foot with getting young people to sign up for Obamacare,\u201d she told the host.\n\nRamos also asked his guests to break down the recent Rolling Stone article that advocated for socialism. Francesca pointed out that young people would love to do whatever they want and still be assured of a job, but that in reality a system like that doesn\u2019t actually work.\n\n\u201cThe author has basically created a Neverland here that couldn\u2019t possibly exist in a fully-functioning society,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cAnd in fact, the Soviet Union tried to do this in the \u201980s.\u201d\n\nShe added that even simple things, like nice designer jeans, had to be acquired on the black market in the Soviet Union.\n\nWatch the segment below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Letting young people stay on their parents' insurance until they're 26 was not a smart way for the Obama administration to build a healthcare system, Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers argued Tuesday night on Fusion.
