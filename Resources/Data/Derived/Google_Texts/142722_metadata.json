Oregon followed suit a few months ago, and six other states have either submitted plans to participate or intend to submit plans by the end of fiscal year 2014.\n\nIn California, officials are using the new financing authority to draw down increased federal matching funds for the In-Home Supportive Services program.\n\nDiane Justice, senior program director for the National Academy for State Health Policy, said CFCO was a natural fit for California because the state did not need to significantly modify IHSS to capture the enhanced federal match. She said IHSS \u201creally didn\u2019t have to make any major changes at all in the types of services they provided or the way that they provided them.\u201d\n\nLike California, Oregon had an existing long-term care infrastructure that facilitated the adoption of CFCO. Oregon previously used waivers as a primary financing vehicle for home- and community-based support services. To draw down the higher matching funds through CFCO, Oregon simply rolled over some of its existing waiver services to a new program.\n\nWith the federal government offering a higher Medicaid matching rate, why aren\u2019t more states taking advantage of CFCO?\n\nJustice said many states are concerned about the cost of such programs. However, she noted that disability advocates are hopeful that the data collected through CFCO will demonstrate that home- and community-based services are less costly in the long run than institutional care.\n\nIn addition, Justice noted that California and Oregon are unique in having such a robust infrastructure for attendant services and supports. For states without that infrastructure, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a heavy lift,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>California is one of two states currently participating in the Affordable Care Act's Community First Choice Option, which provides higher federal matching Medicaid funds for community-based, long-term care services.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "California is one of two states currently participating in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Community First Choice Option, which provides higher federal matching Medicaid funds for community-based, \u2026", "title": "California One of Two States Cashing In on New ACA Long-Term Care Funding", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/california-one-of-few-states-cashing-in-on-new-longterm-care-funding/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-10-18T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-18T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb16e\"", "article_summary": "California is one of two states taking advantage of a new financing option made available under the Affordable Care Act to support community-based, long-term care services.\nIn California, officials are using the new financing authority to draw down increased federal matching funds for the In-Home Supportive Services program.\nIn addition, Justice noted that California and Oregon are unique in having such a robust infrastructure for attendant services and supports.\nTo draw down the higher matching funds through CFCO, Oregon simply rolled over some of its existing waiver services to a new program.\nWith the federal government offering a higher Medicaid matching rate, why aren\u2019t more states taking advantage of CFCO?"}
