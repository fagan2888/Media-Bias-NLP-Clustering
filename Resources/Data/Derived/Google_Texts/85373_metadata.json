The new game plan is \u201cB2C\u201d \u2013 business to consumer marketing, particularly in the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act allows healthcare organizations to directly deal with consumers on a massive scale for the first time. However, this comes with some challenges, namely, how to effectively reach potential consumers and differentiate their organization from the competition.\n\nOrganizations must take notice that potential enrollees aren\u2019t just concerned about cost and coverage, but two less apparent concerns: privacy and security.\n\nConsumers want reassurance that their data is protected. They can\u2019t get all the data breach fiascos out of their mind. According to the TRUSTe 2014 U.S. Consumer Privacy Report, 92 percent of U.S. Internet users are worried about their online privacy. Of these, 47 percent are frequently worried.\n\nSo even though a potential enrollee may have complete faith in your service and reputation, they may be unnerved by the pathways of information exchange: the Internet, mobiles, wireless networks, computers. They know that their personal health data is out there in \u201cspace,\u201d up for grabs.\n\nIf you want strong enrollment numbers and loyal customers, you must put the consumer\u2019s concern for the protection of their personal health information at the top of the priority list. No way around this. If consumers don\u2019t get assurance from you, they won\u2019t stick around for it; they\u2019ll take their business elsewhere.\n\nSo what will you do to put consumers\u2019 apprehension at ease? One way to accomplish this is to facilitate a security and privacy program to ease consumer anxiety.\n\nAllClear ID provides the following guidelines for healthcare insurers and providers:\n\nContinue to use state-of-the-art IT techniques to secure cloud services, access points, databases and mobile devices; and to better monitor systems for breaches.\n\nImprove security of corporate devices and employees\u2019 personal mobile devices used for work.\n\nEnhance employee training at all levels to decrease errors, improve device security and ensure HIPAA compliance. Also train employees around how to comfortably talk to customers about how their data will be protected.\n\nInstitute an identity protection program for enrollees to make them feel safe signing up with you and reduce the pain if there is a breach.\n\nFollow Robert Siciliano on Twitter: www.twitter.com/RobertSiciliano", "article_metadata": {"description": "You\u2019ve surely heard of \u201cB2B\u201d or business-to-business marketing.
