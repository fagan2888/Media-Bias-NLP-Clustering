No successful cyberattacks have taken place, officials say.\n\nHowever, the issues detailed in documents and emails provided by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reveal broader concerns than the federal Health and Human Services department has previously acknowledged.\n\nThey show a frenzied behind-the-scenes juggling act by officials and contractors as the Oct. 1 deadline for new health insurance exchanges loomed. Instead of providing a showcase for President Barack Obama, the launch of his health care law became a case study in how big technology projects can go off the rails.\n\nIn order to connect to federal computers, state and other outside systems must undergo a security review and receive an \u201cauthority to connect.\u201d\n\nWith the health care law, states needed approval to connect to a new federal data hub, an electronic back room that pings Social Security, the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security to verify personal details about people applying for government-subsidized insurance. The hub handles sensitive information, including income, immigration status and Social Security numbers.\n\nThe documents showed a high-stakes decision-making process playing out against a backdrop of tension and uncertainty as the clock ran out. For example:\n\n- In one email from Sept. 29, a Sunday two days before the launch, Teresa Fryer, chief information security officer for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote of the state security approvals, \u201cThe front office is signing them whether or not they are a high risk.\u201d Her agency, known as CMS, also administers the health care law.\n\nTwo days earlier, in a separate document, CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner approved nine states to connect although the approval document noted that \u201cCMS views the October 1 connections to the nine states as a risk due to the fact that their documentation may not be submitted completely nor reviewed\u2026by Oct. 1.\u201d Approval was contingent on states submitting proper documentation. The states were Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.\n\n- A CMS PowerPoint presentation from Sept. 23 revealed huge differences in states\u2019 readiness. Some were already approved; others had security weaknesses that were well understood and being tackled. But there were also states where the federal government had little information on security preparations.\n\n\u201cCMS views these connections to states as a high risk due to the unknown nature of their systems,\u201d according to the presentation.\n\nCMS officials contemplated whether their agency would have to accept risk on behalf of other federal government entities, including Social Security and the IRS.\n\n-A federal contractor explicitly detailed the potential consequences of what he called an \u201celevated high risk.\u201d\n\nAllowing states to connect without the appropriate review \u201cintroduces an unknown amount of risk\u201d that could put the personal information of \u201cpotentially millions of users at risk of identity theft,\u201d not to mention exposing the program to fraud, contractor Ryan Brewer wrote to CMS security in a Sept. 18 email.\n\nBrewer had formerly been in government, as top CMS information security officer. He is currently with the cybersecurity firm GrayScout. The administration says he had no direct knowledge of the status of state security information.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 letter to the oversight panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the administration said many of the high-risk issues identified in the documents had a corrective action plan before states got approval to connect. Twelve states received temporary, 60-day permissions to connect before Oct. 1 because the administration had not completed full reviews.\n\nCurrently, 46 states and Washington, D.C., have full three-year permissions to connect, wrote HHS assistant secretary Jim Esquea.\n\n\u201cThe administration has not been forthcoming with the American people about the serious security risks,\u201d Issa said in a statement. \u201cDespite repeated assurances from HHS, the department appears to still be struggling with security concerns.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity consultant and author Theresa Payton, who reviewed the materials for the AP, said it\u2019s difficult to second-guess the administration\u2019s decisions. A phased rollout of the health care markets would have been a prudent way to keep risks manageable. But Payton, who was chief White House information officer for President George W. Bush, said federal agencies can face unique deadline pressures.\n\nThe administration should have found a way to let consumers know that the new online markets weren\u2019t quite ready for prime time, she said. \u201cA customer education campaign on how to avoid fraud would have gone a long way.\u201d\n\nEven top-performing states are not immune to problems. In a Jan. 10 email exchange, officials and contractors wondered whether they might have to disconnect California from federal computers after a website publicly disclosed that state\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThere are many security issues with the states\u2019 systems,\u201d a contractor wrote to CMS supervisors. \u201cI would expect many more of the `known\u2019 flaws to be posted in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe administration says officials quickly contacted California, and after learning that the state was addressing the issues, and dropped any consideration of disconnecting.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Obama administration raced to meet its self-imposed deadline for online health insurance markets, security experts working for the government worried that state computer systems could become a back door for hackers.
