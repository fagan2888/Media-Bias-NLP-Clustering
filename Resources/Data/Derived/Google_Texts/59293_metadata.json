As CMO Today recently reported, the Web video ad buying technology firm TubeMogul is one of them.\n\nNow the company\u2019s TV ambitions are coming into clearer view. TubeMogul, which went public earlier this year, is looking to position itself at the center of what the company sees as TV\u2019s impending move to automation. TubeMogul on Thursday is planning to announce a new software product, TubeMogul PTV, designed to help marketers buy TV ads more like the Web.\n\n\u201cThe methods for buying TV haven\u2019t fundamentally changed,\u201d said TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson. \u201cWe think its future is automated and data-driven, and we built software to enable that.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, TubeMogul says its new PTV software will help advertisers buy local broadcast, cable and satellite TV ads through a variety of sources. Those sources include several technology companies that aggregate local TV ad space, including AudienceXpress, WideOrbit (as CMO Today previously reported) clypd and FreeWheel.\n\nMr. Wilson acknowledged this new product\u2019s limitations, but said that advertisers might be surprised by how much TV ad inventory is currently available through its software. \u201cWhat\u2019s not available is inventory from networks yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it will be eventually. And there are definitely different levels of automation available depending upon what partners we are working with.\u201d\n\nHe contested the notion that TubeMogul will only have access to subpar inventory, noting that 35% of it is in prime-time programming.\n\nThat claim is counter to the general perception about the state of programmatic TV\u2013that what little inventory is available represents the leftovers. In fact, TubeMogul says that ad inventory from 80 different TV networks will be available via the software.\n\nThe brand 3M tested the new TubeMogul PTV software over four weeks in August and September. Chris Luna, 3M\u2019s digital media specialist, said he was able to execute a national TV buy using the new software, with 80% of the ad impressions running on top 10 TV networks, and nearly a third of the ads airing in prime time.\n\nMr. Luna said the test helped 3M enjoy some of the same data and targeting insights available in online ad campaigns. \u201cWe were able to uncover so many things about the quality of the audiences we are buying,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, we were able to more narrowly target, get greater efficiency, and compare this network versus that one, this media mix versus that one.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean 3M is about to blow up its overall media plan, pull all of its money out of TV and shift to digital? Hardly. Mr. Luna wouldn\u2019t even commit just yet to using the new TubeMogul software again. But he did say that tools like this will help more advertisers figure out where to spend marketing dollars on a macro level.\n\n\u201cI think we start to look at it more holistically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe digital agency DigitasLBi is also testing the new software. Adam Shlachter, the agency\u2019s chief investment officer, said that while right now, programmatic TV represents \u201cexperimentation,\u201d more marketers are interested in employing the same data for targeting consumers on the Web for TV campaigns.\n\n\u201cNow that we all have a better understanding of our audiences, you want to reach them across screens,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity here and it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "", "title": "Web Video Ad Tech Firm TubeMogul Takes Aim at TV", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/12/04/web-video-ad-tech-firm-tubemogul-takes-aim-at-tv/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FT214_TVsweb_P_20141126115848.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Web Video Ad Tech Firm TubeMogul Takes Aim at TV", "description": "", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-04T13:30:22-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/12/04/web-video-ad-tech-firm-tubemogul-takes-aim-at-tv/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-2209", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "", "title": "Web Video Ad Tech Firm TubeMogul Takes Aim at TV", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/12/04/web-video-ad-tech-firm-tubemogul-takes-aim-at-tv/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FT214_TVsweb_P_20141126115848.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-2209", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-05T19:38:38-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc6b\"", "article_summary": "As CMO Today recently reported, the Web video ad buying technology firm TubeMogul is one of them.\nTubeMogul on Thursday is planning to announce a new software product, TubeMogul PTV, designed to help marketers buy TV ads more like the Web.\nThose sources include several technology companies that aggregate local TV ad space, including AudienceXpress, WideOrbit (as CMO Today previously reported) clypd and FreeWheel.\nThe brand 3M tested the new TubeMogul PTV software over four weeks in August and September.\nIn fact, TubeMogul says that ad inventory from 80 different TV networks will be available via the software."}
