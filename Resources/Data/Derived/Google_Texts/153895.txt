Public relations queen Courtney Cohen is welcoming a new (adorable) family member ... her puggle named Wallis.

The happy union was nearly a year-and-a-half in the making. Cohen, who runs her eponymous Washington-based PR firm and previously worked as a production coordinator for George Stephanopoulos during ABC News’ 2008 election coverage, worked with the organization City Dogs Rescue to bring home her furry friend. The nine-week-old pup’s mom, who is half pug and half beagle, was pregnant with Wallis when she was rescued from a dog hoarder’s home in southern Virginia.

Cohen, a friend of ITK known for her quick wit, originally planned to name the four-pound puppy after “Borat” star Sacha Baron Cohen. But she nixed that name in favor of something more regal, opting instead for a nod to socialite Wallis Simpson, who got England’s King Edward VIII to abdicate the throne in 1936 so he could marry her. “They never had children, but they had pugs,” Cohen explained.

Asked if little Wallis will be dressing in typical Washington style, Cohen replied, “I vowed when I first got her that she wasn’t going to be all dolled up — then that all went out the window. I’m very tacky. I believe the bigger, the flashier, the better.” She added, “I would describe her current look, and this might be considered abuse by some, but she’s sort of like a ‘Real Housewife of New Jersey.’ Everything she has is pink and leopard and sequin.”
