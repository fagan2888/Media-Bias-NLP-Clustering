John Kasich can fundraise as fast as he\u2019s spending Obamacare money, he\u2019s a shoo-in for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAfter just 17 months, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost federal taxpayers $3.7 billion. That\u2019s over $1 billion more than the Kasich administration projected for the expansion\u2019s first 18 months.\n\nObamacare expansion benefits for working-age Ohioans who aren\u2019t disabled and don\u2019t have kids cost taxpayers more than $300 million every month from December to May, based on Ohio Department of Medicaid figures.\n\nAlthough enrollment \u2014 which Kasich said would reach 366,000 by next month \u2014 has leveled out at around 540,000, Obamacare expansion costs have increased each month for the past six months.\n\nODM reported spending $327 million on Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion in May, with all the costs covered by federal taxpayers.\n\nStarting in January 2017, Ohio taxpayers will be on the hook for 5 percent of the expansion\u2019s benefit costs. The state share alone will top $200 million in 2017.\n\nOhio\u2019s share of Medicaid expansion costs will ratchet up to 10 percent by 2020, sticking state taxpayers with a tab exceeding $30 million every month. With the federal government already $18 trillion in debt, more federal funding cuts are likely.\n\nAfter campaigning against Obamacare, Kasich unilaterally expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and turned to the pseudo-legislative Ohio Controlling Board with a request to spend $2.56 billion in Obamacare money.\n\nWhile his Obamacare expansion\u2019s costs and enrollment have careened out of control, Kasich has traveled the country promoting Obamacare expansion as a conservative, Christian policy.\n\nODM had burned through the spending approved for Medicaid expansion by February. Luckily for the governor, his administration wildly overestimated the number of traditional Medicaid recipients who would enroll starting in 2014.\n\nWith lower-than-budgeted enrollment from children, poor families, the disabled and the elderly, ODM has used spending authority meant to serve those Ohioans for Obamacare expansion, instead.\n\nRELATED: No money, no problem for Ohio Obamacare expansion\n\nRepublican supermajorities in both the Ohio House and Senate have approved budgets continuing Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, which will cost at least $7 billion over the next two years.\n\nAided by Kasich\u2019s rhetoric, Obamacare advocates are still pushing Medicaid expansion in Florida, Utah and elsewhere. Ohio\u2019s example is one of many suggesting taxpayers should be skeptical of expansion supporters\u2019 cost projections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Ohio Gov.
