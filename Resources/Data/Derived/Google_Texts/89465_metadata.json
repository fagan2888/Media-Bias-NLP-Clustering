In fact, a family of four spends up to an average of $1,300 a month on food at home, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That means families can shell out more than $15,000 a year on groceries.\n\nWith the right strategies, you can cut your grocery spending in half or more. Just ask Kyle Taylor, founder of personal finance blog ThePennyHoarder.com. When he was just a teenager, he was finding ways to whittle down his family\u2019s grocery bill to less than $20 a week. Since then, he\u2019s launched a career in helping people save more money.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to save money on groceries. The best way is to take advantage of multiple methods of cutting costs. \u201cWe all know about couponing, but saving money is way easier when you know how to stack discounts,\u201d Taylor said. Here\u2019s how he piles on the savings:\n\nStart with discounted gift cards: The first money-saving move Taylor makes is buying discounted gift cards for supermarkets and other stores that carry grocery items, such as Target. You can get gift cards for less than face value at sites such as Raise.com, Cardpool and Giftcard Zen. \u201cThese gift cards are sold for 1 percent to 25 percent below face value, meaning that I\u2019ve saved money before ever stepping into the grocery store,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAdd on coupons: Collecting coupons doesn\u2019t have to be as time consuming as it might seem, Taylor said. Even clipping coupons can be simple.\n\nTaylor gets the Sunday paper delivered to his doorstep and slips the grocery coupon inserts into a filing cabinet, organizing them by date. Then, before shopping each week, he uses the free Favado app to see sales in his area. Once he\u2019s found sale items he wants to buy, he finds coupons he needs to clip to get the items for less.\n\nBecause Favado lists coupons by date, he can quickly track down the inserts he needs in his filing cabinet. \u201cIt saves me tons of time every month because I don\u2019t have to clip coupons I\u2019ll never use,\u201d he said.\n\nDownload rebate apps: Taylor stacks his gift card and coupon savings with grocery rebates he gets with apps like Ibotta and Checkout 51.\n\nThe Ibotta app uses your smartphone\u2019s GPS to locate grocery stores around you. Choose your favorite and then browse rebates to find the ones you want to use. Before you shop, you\u2019ll have to \u201cunlock\u201d the rebates, which usually requires reading a quick fact or watching a 15-second ad about the product.\n\nWhen you get home from the store, click the \u201credeem\u201d button on the Ibotta app and use your smartphone\u2019s camera to take a picture of your receipt. Within 24 hours, Taylor said, you\u2019ll see cash in your Ibotta account, which you can withdraw anytime via Paypal or Venmo.\n\nThe Checkout 51 app works similarly.\n\n\u201cMy saving philosophy is that stacking all of these methods is the most effective way to save,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nCameron Huddleston,\n\nGOBankingRates.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the right strategies, you can cut your grocery spending in half or more.", "og": {"description": "With the right strategies, you can cut your grocery spending in half or more.", "title": "Just use coupons?
