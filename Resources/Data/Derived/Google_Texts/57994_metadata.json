Party officials realized that Republicans are sharply at odds with the American mainstream on the issue, and the sooner the party could move away from the issue, the better.\n\nSince the ruling effectively ended the debate, it created a convenient partisan opportunity. The New York Times reported that some Republican strategists privately characterized the high court decisions as \u201cnothing short of a gift from above.\u201d\n\nBut the gift only works if Republicans accept it and actually move past the issue. ThinkProgress noted yesterday that Republican National Committee members have quietly approved a resolution that endorses the far-right\u2019s preferred response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe RNC wants Congress to approve the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA). This bill, which the ACLU has called \u201ca Pandora\u2019s Box of taxpayer-funded discrimination against same-sex couples and their children,\u201d would prevent the federal government from acting against businesses and non-profits that discriminate against same-sex married couples. This would mean that government workers could refuse to perform their duties, and businesses and organizations \u2013 including those that operate with support of taxpayer money \u2013 would be free to discriminate. [\u2026] The RNC resolution specifically references multiple cases when private business owners have faced legal consequences for refusing to serve to same-sex couples in violation of nondiscrimination laws.\n\nThe Washington Blade added , \u201cThe resolution wasn\u2019t announced or reported anywhere in the press until last week after its passage when the Daily Signal, a conservative publication, published an article on the measure. A RNC official confirmed for the Washington Blade the report was accurate.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe RNC\u2019s quiet endorsement of the resolution may actually have a practical effect on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s not a binding resolution, but given the larger context, this matters.\n\nAs of this morning, the \u201c First Amendment Defense Act \u201d has 145 co-sponsors in the House \u2013 144 of whom are Republicans \u2013 which means it has the backing of well over half of all the Republicans in the chamber. There\u2019s a companion bill in the Senate, which has 36 GOP co-sponsors \u2013 that\u2019s two-thirds of all Senate Republicans.\n\nIndeed, note that of the four sitting GOP senators running for president \u2013 Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Lindsey Graham \u2013 all four have already put their names on this bill.\n\nThe question now is whether congressional Republican leaders are prepared to make FADA a priority and schedule time on the floor for a vote. So far, party leaders have been reluctant, looking at this as a losing issue. Besides, it would never overcome a filibuster in the Senate and stands even less of a chance of earning President Obama\u2019s signature.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Republican measure adds pressure to party leaders to act on the so-called \"First Amendment Defense Act.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rnc-backs-controversial-resolution-discrimination", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The Republican measure adds pressure to party leaders to act on the so-called \"First Amendment Defense Act.\"", "title": "RNC backs controversial resolution on discrimination", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rnc-backs-controversial-resolution-discrimination", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/464835421.jpg?itok=5WcncwWV", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rnc-backs-controversial-resolution-discrimination", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/464835421.jpg?itok=_VcEIzHG", "height": 553}, "title": "RNC backs controversial resolution on discrimination", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Republican measure adds pressure to party leaders to act on the so-called \"First Amendment Defense Act.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-19T10:04:54-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "civil-rights,culture-war,culture-wars,discrimination,equality,gay-rights,lgbt,marriage-equality,republicans,rnc,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "RNC backs controversial resolution on discrimination", "published": 1, "date": "08/19/2015 10:04:54 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rnc-backs-controversial-resolution-discrimination"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The Republican measure adds pressure to party leaders to act on the so-called \"First Amendment Defense Act.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Equality, LGBT, Republicans, Civil Rights, Culture War, Culture Wars, Discrimination, Gay Rights, Marriage Equality, RNC"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce12e\"", "article_summary": "[\u2026] The RNC resolution specifically references multiple cases when private business owners have faced legal consequences for refusing to serve to same-sex couples in violation of nondiscrimination laws.\nThere\u2019s a companion bill in the Senate, which has 36 GOP co-sponsors \u2013 that\u2019s two-thirds of all Senate Republicans.\nThis bill, which the ACLU has called \u201ca Pandora\u2019s Box of taxpayer-funded discrimination against same-sex couples and their children,\u201d would prevent the federal government from acting against businesses and non-profits that discriminate against same-sex married couples.\nA RNC official confirmed for the Washington Blade the report was accurate.\u201dThe RNC\u2019s quiet endorsement of the resolution may actually have a practical effect on Capitol Hill.\nThinkProgress noted yesterday that Republican National Committee members have quietly approved a resolution that endorses the far-right\u2019s preferred response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision."}
