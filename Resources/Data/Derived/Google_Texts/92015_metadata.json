The answer is yes,\" he told Reuters.\n\nMost of what will be passed in the Republican budget plan, including domestic spending cuts aimed at eliminating deficits within 10 years, will be cast aside.\n\nThe real action is just now getting underway as appropriations committees start to craft fiscal 2016 spending bills for government agencies and the military. Debate over these spending levels will come to a head this fall as a new government shutdown deadline looms on Oct. 1 with a federal debt limit increase needed perhaps a month later.\n\nAny tinkering with Medicare has long been seen as politically risky, especially for candidates in states with large senior citizen populations, such as Florida, Arizona, West Virginia, Maine, Pennsylvania and Iowa.\n\nRyan ignored such logic when he floated his Medicare plan as part of his first budget in 2011. It was a bombshell, prompting Democrats to claim it would gut Medicare's promise of guaranteed healthcare and \"voucherize\" the program.\n\nOne Democratic TV attack ad depicted a Ryan impersonator pushing a wheelchair-bound elderly woman over a cliff.\n\nNow, Ryan has moved to become chairman of the powerful House's tax-writing committee and has steered clear of budget policy.\n\nAsked by Reuters this week to comment on prospects for his Medicare plan surviving the budget negotiations, Ryan said he did not have time to talk.\n\nHis spokesman Brendan Buck said: \"The chairman is confident the budget will allow the House to continue to pursue the important kinds of reforms needed to save Medicare.\"\n\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Lawder", "Author": "David Lawder", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Aiming to acquire more budget powers and take a swipe at Obamacare, Republicans will likely scrap a proposal that stirred controversy and helped launch Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan on the national stage: privatizing the Medicare health program.", "title": "Republicans seen scrapping Ryan Medicare plan in U.S. budget push", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150424&t=2&i=1043102653&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB3N0VH", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
