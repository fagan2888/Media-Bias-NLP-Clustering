I want to see a Republican in the White House, and I want someone who\u2019s going to win. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, at this point, to be cannibalizing one another.\u201d\n\nHannity asked Hayes, \u201cWhere was National Review when in fact the Republicans were going back on their promise against repealing and replacing ObamaCare and using the power of the purse, or holding up the mantle of challenging a sitting president and stopping executive amnesty, which was the Republican promise in 2014?\u201d\n\nHayes answered, \u201cNational Review has been leading the fight in many ways, with the Weekly Standard and others, challenging the Washington establishment and the crony capitalists here in Washington. \u2026 It\u2019s interesting for me to see people cast National Review and these contributors as part of the Washington conservative establishment. It\u2019s preposterous. I mean, it includes authors like Erick Erickson, like Brent Bozell. I mean, nobody\u2019s calling these people establishment.\u201d\n\nMidway through, Hannity said that National Review didn\u2019t do a special edition for any of the things he\u2019d mentioned, to which Hayes countered that they thought Trump\u2019s ascendancy was worth the special edition.\n\nPirro said, \u201c[T]his smacks of the establishment pushing back on the Republican Party, Donald Trump is the favorite of Republicans, and for them to come out and say if he gets elected, he\u2019s going to trample conservative ideals on behalf of populism, as needless and crude as Donald. Are they saying that we\u2019re crude, that we don\u2019t know what we need? It\u2019s almost like Obama saying, I know what\u2019s good for you. Don\u2019t tell us what\u2019s good for us. We know what\u2019s good for us.\u201d\n\nHayes responded, \u201cIt\u2019s an opinion magazine. they have opinions. they back them up. i think they argued quite persuasively that Donald Trump isn\u2019t a conservative, hasn\u2019t been a conservative, and would do damage to the conservative movement. people are perfectly free to disagree with them and make arguments, but the implication that it is somehow improper for a magazine of opinion to make these arguments is preposterous.\u201d\n\nHannity also said that some of William F. Buckley Jr.\u2019s statements \u201cwere not exactly peace loving moments of civility.\n\nHayes said, \u201cPolitics can be a very tough sport, and people who enter this business, either as a candidate or on the opinion side should be well equipped to take arrows and slings and everything else. Having said that, I do think that Donald Trump is a little different. I do think that, if you look at the kinds of arguments he\u2019s made, whether mocking Carly Fiorina\u2019s face or denigrating John McCain for his war heroism, making fun of a disabled reporter, all of those \u2013.\u201d\n\nHannity then stated, \u201cTed Cruz hasn\u2019t done that, and the same people you mentioned, a lot of which hate Ted Cruz.\u201d Hayes responded, \u201cif people have questions or concerns about his character or temperament, whatever word you want to use, I think it\u2019s fine for people to have those, and to express those. I\u2019m a little surprised that more conservatives who support Trump don\u2019t share those concerns, honestly.\n\nPirro then said, \u201cThe establishment is scared. Donald Trump is beholden to no one. The American electorate knows it, the Republicans know it. and the fact that there aren\u2019t these attacks against Ted Cruz, pro-amnesty, now he\u2019s against it.\u201d\n\nGuilfoyle then argued, \u201cI just feel like the party should come together at a certain point. If they\u2019re going to do this, maybe do it some time early. This seems to me to be a little bit pro-Cruz in terms of doing this to maybe shave points off of Donald Trump going into Iowa with an opinion magazine.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Hannity' Panel Tackles Anti-Trump Issue --- 'Where Was National Review' on GOP Broken Promises of 2014?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "'Hannity' Panel Tackles Anti-Trump Issue --- 'Where Was National Review' on GOP Broken Promises of 2014?", "title": "'Hannity' Panel Tackles Anti-Trump Issue - 'Where Was National Review' on GOP Broken Promises of 2014? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Hannity-Panel-122-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/23/hannity-panel-tackles-anti-trump-issue-where-was-national-review-on-gop-broken-promises-of-2014/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Hannity' Panel Tackles Anti-Trump Issue --- 'Where Was National Review' on GOP Broken Promises of 2014?", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Hannity-Panel-122-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "'Hannity' Panel Tackles Anti-Trump Issue - 'Where Was National Review' on GOP Broken Promises of 2014? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Jeanine Pirro, Kimberly Guilfoyle, National Review, Sean Hannity, Stephen Hayes,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Stephen Hayes", "published_time": "2016-01-23T12:15:37-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u2026 It\u2019s interesting for me to see people cast National Review and these contributors as part of the Washington conservative establishment.\nI mean, nobody\u2019s calling these people establishment.\u201dMidway through, Hannity said that National Review didn\u2019t do a special edition for any of the things he\u2019d mentioned, to which Hayes countered that they thought Trump\u2019s ascendancy was worth the special edition.\nDonald Trump is beholden to no one.\ni think they argued quite persuasively that Donald Trump isn\u2019t a conservative, hasn\u2019t been a conservative, and would do damage to the conservative movement.\nHaving said that, I do think that Donald Trump is a little different."}
