The court has announced that audio recordings of the proceedings will be uploaded to its website by 2 p.m. EDT. C-SPAN has already announced that it will broadcast the arguments that day.\n\nOther radio and TV operations will be able to air excerpts from the arguments \u2013 and the justices\u2019 questions \u2013 on their evening newscasts. Some of the justices disparage these snippets as \u201csound bites\u201d and worry that they are sensationalized. But sometimes a few seconds can speak volumes about what\u2019s on a justice's mind.\n\nThat was the case with a notorious comment by Justice Antonin Scalia during oral arguments in 2012 over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Questioning the solicitor general about the law\u2019s requirement that individuals purchase health insurance, Scalia said: \"Could you define the market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli?\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the bad news: The same-day audio in the marriage cases \u2013 as in the original Obamacare arguments \u2013 is an exception to the rule that audio recordings aren\u2019t posted until Fridays during weeks in which the court sits. The arguments themselves take place on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which means that the \u201csound bites\u201d are pretty stale by the time anyone can use them.\n\nAnd while the court releases same-day audio in some high-profile cases, it refuses to do so in others. For example, audio of a March 4 argument in another case involving the Affordable Care Act wasn\u2019t posted until March 6. That argument involved a claim that federal subsidies shouldn\u2019t be available to people who purchase health insurance through exchanges established by the federal government rather than by a state.\n\nYesterday's news about the Supreme Court is just a stale as yesterday's news about anything else.\n\nThe consequences of the eventual decision in that case will be far-reaching, even if not as transformative as a potential decision in favor of marriage equality. Yet the court said no to same-day audio. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. But perhaps the court, knowing that it would be under pressure to release same-day audio in the marriage case, decided that it didn\u2019t want to give the public and the media too much of a good thing.\n\nThat\u2019s indefensible. Yesterday\u2019s news about the Supreme Court is just a stale as yesterday\u2019s news about anything else.\n\nWe get that the justices aren\u2019t about to welcome television cameras to their courtroom, but audio of arguments have been released for years with no negative consequences. Forcing journalists to wait until the end of the week to broadcast those arguments is petty. Audio of all arguments \u2013 high-profile or not \u2013 should be released the same day.\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Making us wait to listen to Supreme Court arguments", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "On April 28 the Supreme Court will hear lawyers debate two monumental questions: \u201cDoes the 14th Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?\u201d and \u201cDoes the 14 th Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out of state?\u201d", "title": "Making us wait to listen to Supreme Court arguments", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-ol-supreme-court-audio-gay-marriage-20150318-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5509eaf7/turbine/la-ol-supreme-court-audio-gay-marriage-20150318", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "supremecourt,gaymarriage,audio", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83091650", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-18", "Description": "On April 28 the Supreme Court will hear lawyers debate two monumental questions: \u201cDoes the 14th Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?\u201d and \u201cDoes the 14th Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "supremecourt,gaymarriage,audio"}, "article_summary": "Yesterday's news about the Supreme Court is just a stale as yesterday's news about anything else.\nYesterday\u2019s news about the Supreme Court is just a stale as yesterday\u2019s news about anything else.\nAnd while the court releases same-day audio in some high-profile cases, it refuses to do so in others.\nYet the court said no to same-day audio.\nThe court has announced that audio recordings of the proceedings will be uploaded to its website by 2 p.m. EDT."}
