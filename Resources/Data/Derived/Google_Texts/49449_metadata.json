Ray Pilon (R-Sarasota) presented the House floor with a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to use experimental medications as treatment. Pilon says the measure would also cover liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no liability for the doctors, their Medicaid certificates, manufacturers of the drug are covered\u2026 they may charge for it or they may not,\u201d says Pilon.\n\nThe drugs must be identified in at least the first phase of FDA testing. And Pilon says Florida would be the 12th state to approve the measure.\n\nBut things got tense when Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Shalimar) attempted to amend the bill to add medical cannabis as an option for terminally-ill patients.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re willing to say things that have gone through the first phase of clinical trials are okay, then why wouldn\u2019t we also say that a substance that has been legalized in at least 20 states in this country would also be available for this very small group of people,\u201d says Gaetz.\n\nRep. John Wood (R-Winter Haven) sponsored a bill at the start of session that sought to legalize certain kinds of medical marijuana for suffering patients. The measure was filed jointly with Representative Greg Steube who said patients could use marijuana only if it is not smoked.\n\nBut Wood says Gaetz\u2019 amendment is an overreach.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think an issue as important as this should be run through the committee process to vet all the implications of what you\u2019re trying to achieve here,\u201d says Wood.\n\nRep. Katie Edwards (D-Sunrise) says after fighting for medical cannabis legislation last session with no progress, it\u2019s hard to see the issue swept under the rug.\n\n\u201cWe have broken our promise and have delivered the most vulnerable patients, nothing,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even allowed bills to clarify some of the very serious issues raised by the department of health, administrative law judges and patients. Not one committee hearing, not one bill moving forward\u2026 nothing.\u201d\n\nThe amendment was voted down after the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Pilon, spoke out against it.\n\nAnd although Gaetz withdrew the medical cannabis clause, marijuana legislation could still see the light before the end of session. A bill to reform the state\u2019s low-THC cannabis law was temporarily postponed on the Senate floor Wednesday.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A heated debate in the Florida House concerning terminally-ill patient care ended unfavorably to medical marijuana proponents Wednesday, but the issue", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/medical-cannibus-sparks-heated-debate-florida-house", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201504/400074473.png", "type": "article", "description": "A heated debate in the Florida House concerning terminally-ill patient care ended unfavorably to medical marijuana proponents Wednesday, but the issue", "title": "Medical Cannabis Sparks Heated Debate In Florida House"}, "story_id": 399963446, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Keta Browning", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Medical Cannabis Sparks Heated Debate In Florida House"}, "nid": 10295, "datePublished": "2015-04-15", "keywords": "medical marijuana, Florida Legislature 2015", "wordCount": 518, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbde3\"", "article_summary": "A heated debate in the Florida House concerning terminally-ill patient care ended unfavorably to medical marijuana proponents Wednesday, but the issue continues to make waves in the legislature.\nAnd although Gaetz withdrew the medical cannabis clause, marijuana legislation could still see the light before the end of session.\nBut things got tense when Rep.
