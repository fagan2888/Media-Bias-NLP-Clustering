Associated Press In this Thursday, Dec. 15, 2011 photo, frac sand destined for the oil and gas fields piles up at the EOG Resources Inc. processing plant in Chippewa Falls, Wisc. Largely overlooked in the national debate over fracking is the emerging fight in the U.S. heartland over mining frac sand, which has grains of ideal size, shape, strength and purity. Mining companies say the work provides good jobs in rural areas, but some residents fear the increase in mining could harm human health and the environment. (AP Photo/Steve Karnowski) (Photo: Steve Karnowski / AP)\n\nNortheast Iowans should dig deeper than the Heartland Institute\u2019s promotion of frac-sand mining (April 30).\n\nHeartland\u2019s Isaac Orr mischaracterized the view of the state geologist, Bob Libra, suggesting fewer environmental affects from sand mining than other mining. Actually, Libra told Winneshiek County supervisors a single frac sand mine would pose no more threat than a gravel quarry or standard sand pit.\n\nBut this is not about just one mine. Orr advocates a \u201cboom\u201d in mines, and he ignored Libra\u2019s stated concerns about establishing dozens of mines in small areas, as in southwest Wisconsin. Orr correctly noted that Libra cited concerns with sand processing facilities, where large volumes of groundwater are used and impurities in the sand are washed away.\n\nIowa\u2019s best trout streams are in northeast Iowa, are groundwater-fed and could be on the receiving end of sand impurities. The sand eventually will be used in a fracking process that itself presents great risk to water quality and geologic stability.\n\nNortheast Iowa residents see the natural beauty of their region, promote it and see opportunity. Orr misses this, seeing only \u201cgenerally low-paying, seasonal jobs providing only part-time work for full-time residents.\u201d\n\nThree recent economic studies of mining activities in Wisconsin examine tradeoffs. Mining jobs pay more, but miners are more likely to be from outside the region, bring few family members and spend less locally \u2014 unlike full-time residents working tourism jobs. Thus, no boon to the community.\n\nWhen mining removes the bluffs from \u201cIowa\u2019s Bluff Country,\u201d and the temporary mining jobs with them, what is left?\n\nResidents of Allamakee and Winneshiek counties, and their county supervisors, are using restrictions on mining or processing of frac sand to protect their health, homes, communities, resources and beautiful landscapes. So far they are doing a good job for our state.\n\nDAVID OSTERBERG, former executive director of the nonpartisan Iowa Policy Project in Iowa City, co-authored a report, \u201cDigging Deeper on Frac Sand Mining,\u201d available at www.iowapolicyproject.org.
