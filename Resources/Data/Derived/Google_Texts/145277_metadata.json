That\u2019s $100 more than last year, based on 14 cost categories.\n\n\n\n\u201cFortunately for the cow-calf sector, cattle prices this fall are higher than a year ago. So, estimated cow-calf returns per cow will be up in 2013 compared to 2012\u2019s,\u201d LMIC analysts say. They estimate returns over cash costs plus pasture rent his year at $125/cow, compared to $32 last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, there is a major cautionary note, \u201cLMIC analysts add: \u201cDue to drought, many cow-calf operations had to sell off many cows. Even if per-cow returns are higher, their enterprise is providing limited net income because in 2013 they have fewer calves to sell than in prior years.\u201d\n\n\n\nLMIC analysts expect cow costs to decline slightly next year with lower feed prices. \u201cThat cost drop plus high cattle prices set the stage for much improved per-cow returns in 2014. In fact, those cash returns could substantially exceed 2004\u2019s record high,\u201d they say.\n\n\n\nStill, historically sky-high costs coupled with increasing uncertainty means herd expansion my by challenged even with abundant forage and water.\n\nSubscribe now to Cow-Calf Weekly to get the latest industry research and information in your inbox every Friday!\n\nGlynn Tonsor, Kansas State University livestock economist, notes in this week\u2019s In the Cattle Markets that the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index in September was higher than during the Black Monday period of 1987 when global financial markets crashed.\n\n\n\n\u201cAppreciating the economic implications of heightened uncertainty has a direct role in understanding current and likely behavior of cattle producers,\u201d Tonsor says, \u201cAs uncertainty is elevated, most economists argue larger expected returns are required to effectively trigger major investments such as those required to expand the breeding herd. The personal background of most cow-calf producers coupled with the ever-increasing environment of uncertainty on many economically important points that producers individually have no control of has led to limited moves to date in initiating aggregate herd expansion\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026When uncertainty on consumer demand strength, tax and regulatory policies, and global macroeconomic conditions are considered, one can gain an even deeper appreciation of how historically high projected returns for cow-calf producers may not be sufficient to trigger herd expansion volumes some industry leaders would like to see, and why simply yes-no answers rarely apply.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nPhoto Gallery: Cattle Death Toll Rises As Atlas Blizzard Recovery Continues\n\nCargill Closure Announcement, How Much Can The Industry Afford?\n\nOne Week Later: SD Rancher Provides A Post-Blizzard Follow-Up\n\n3 Most Important Goals For Bunk Breaking Calves\n\n70+ Photos Honor The Hardworking Cowboys On The Ranch\n\nFigure Your Best Strategy For Marketing 2013 Calves", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cash cow costs plus pasture jumped from about $550.00/cow five years ago to nearly $800 in 2013, according to the Livestock Marketing Information Center.
