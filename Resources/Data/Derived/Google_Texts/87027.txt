Belle Fourche, SD

Officials in Butte County have moved to terminate the contract of the attorney who serves as the public defender for the county.



Butte County Commission chairman Cal Geis says that the contract with public defender Staci Reindl is not being completely fulfilled. Geis did not provide further details.



Reindl did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment.



Defendants who cannot afford an attorney in Butte County are directed to Reindl, unless she has a conflict of interest. If Reindl cannot represent a defendant, he or she is then directed to one of three other contracted public defenders.



The newspaper reports that the commission hasn't scheduled a meeting to resolve Reindl's contractual issues.
