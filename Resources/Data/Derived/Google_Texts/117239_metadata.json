It\u2019s deadly. And it\u2019ll impact you and your family. Obamacare is coming (sooner than you may realize) and as pro-lifers, it\u2019s imperative we be prepared.\n\nThe implementation begins as early as October with the funding for insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage. I don\u2019t want you to be caught in the dark, which is why I felt it was necessary to re-visit this topic and provide you with important information relevant to your health insurance decisions.\n\nThe largest issue of contention is the abortion mandate. This is a secondary premium that\u2019ll be on the majority of insurance plans and its sole purpose is to fund abortions. The reason this separate premium exists is because under the Hyde amendment, the government cannot directly provide funding for elective abortion services. This abortion surcharge will be collected by the insurance company, not the government, which is how Obamacare dodges the restrictions of the Hyde amendment.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to realize is the law dictates that the abortion surcharge is not disclosed until the time of enrollment. And even then, it can only be mentioned in the \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s purposely hidden in the fine print. Your employer may not even know that their plan requires the abortion payment.\n\nThat leaves you as the employee without options; as you don\u2019t have the choice to be exempt from the abortion premium. Research shows that in the current insurance market, most health insurance plans do provide coverage for abortion because it\u2019s less costly than paying for prenatal care and delivery. Under Obamacare, insurance plans that participate in state exchanges will be eligible to receive federal subsidies. States exchange programs will be established to only sell those designed by the government. Therefore, insurance plans without the abortion surcharge may prove difficult to find and may not provide the desired level of overall medical coverage. Purchasing health insurance independently is cost prohibitive for most families. And because of the law\u2019s requirement to acquire health insurance, those who choose not to carry it will face fines. The federal government will offer at least one states exchange insurance plan that doesn\u2019t include elective abortion. Although pro-lifers will have to intentionally seek it out and it may not include other preferred health plan benefits.\n\nThere are 26 states that have \u201copted out\u201d of abortion coverage for their state. However, this doesn\u2019t provide pro-lifers with a complete safeguard. Even if you\u2019re covered by a plan that does not include abortion, as a taxpayer, you\u2019re still contributing to government subsidies that fund plans with abortion coverage.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s concern regarding the HHS \u201cpreventive services\u201d mandate requiring full coverage of abortion-causing drugs under the guise of contraception. This applies to almost all employers and insurance plans. For failure to comply, employers would be penalized with outrageous fines\u2014as much as $15,000 per employer per day and $2,000 per employee per year. It\u2019s been met with pushback by companies such as Hobby Lobby who\u2019ve filed suit in opposition of this mandate. It\u2019s likely this fight will continue to the Supreme Court with the objective of finding the HHS Mandate unconstitutional.\n\nThis all sets a precedence that\u2019s challenging for pro-life Americans to navigate. Yet, apparently the Obama administration already has a plan in place. When purchasing health insurance via exchanges, individuals will work with so-called \u201cnavigators\u201d to help them find the best suited plan. None other than Planned Parenthood has been selected and paid over one-million dollars to hire these individuals.

We outline them in our fact sheet, Why You Should Be Concerned About Obamacare. Essentially, this is a large entitlement program crafted to expand abortion coverage and eliminate any \u201cchoice\u201d you have in the matter. Once fully implemented, it\u2019s estimated that as many as 30-percent of employers are likely to stop offering insurance. Many have already begun to take action. This is an issue we must address now, before it\u2019s too late.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Bradley Mattes is the executive director of Life Issues Institute, a national pro-life educational group.
