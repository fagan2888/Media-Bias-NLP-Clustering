The times they are a-changin', so maybe we shouldn't be so surprised that critics' tweets are now being turned into advertising fodder in print publications: NY Times film critic and GoogaMooga aficionado A.O. Scott discovered just that this morning when a tweet he made about Inside Llewyn Davis showed up as a full-page print ad on page c7 of today's Times.\n\nwe have reached a strange new place in marketing when tweets become full-page print ads. \u2014 a. o. scott (@aoscott) January 4, 2014\n\nThis could be you, critics MT @CONELRAD6401240 Historic @aoscott full page NYT Tweet blurb for \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" pic.twitter.com/aD7iiXq5ui \u2014 Amanda Katz (@katzish) January 4, 2014\n\nHere's what Scott, who adored the acclaimed movie, originally tweeted:\n\nYou all keep fighting about Wolf of Wall St. and Am Hustle. I'm gonna listen to the Llewyn Davis album again. Fare thee well, my honeys. \u2014 a. o. scott (@aoscott) December 31, 2013\n\nYou might be wondering why CBS Films, which released the film, would choose a tweet about the soundtrack rather than one about the movie itself (which Scott has given plenty of praise in other tweets). A story in the Times this weekend points to the logic behind the ad campaign: the promoters \"have gone to extraordinary lengths in using the folk music at the movie\u2019s center to attract audiences, woo Oscar voters and sell its soundtrack album.\"\n\nSo while you debate whether a blurbed tweet is a bleat or a twerb, let's all contemplate the possibilities for future tweet-based advertising:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "description": "A tweet NY Times film critic A.O.
