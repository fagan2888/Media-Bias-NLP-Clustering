East Texas Baptist University is appealing to the Supreme Court to reverse a recent decision requiring the university to include emergency contraceptives in its insurance plan.

The private religious university, along with two other institutions involved in the suit, said providing the contraceptive coverage violates its religious beliefs and freedom.

“We are asking for relief from the regulatory mandate that would force our institution to provide certain life-ending drugs and devices to our employees through insurance coverage,” ETBU President Blair Blackburn said Wednesday in a statement.

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and former Solicitor General and leading Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement are filing the petition on behalf of ETBU, Houston Baptist University and Pennsylvania-based Westminster Theological Seminary.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans issued a ruling in June against ETBU and several other schools that had filed a lawsuit against the federal government's Affordable Care Act.

The schools were required under the act to provide insurance coverage that included emergency contraceptives, but they charged it violated their religious beliefs, citing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The three appeals court judges disagreed, saying there was no proven substantial burden to their religious beliefs.
