It truly is members sharing each other's health costs.\"\n\nHere's how it works\n\nAbout 60,000 Christian families of three or more are enrolled in this particular healthcare sharing ministry.\n\nThey pay around $400 a month locally to their church for health care.\n\nIf they're single, they pay about $180 a month.\n\n\n\n\"You're sending your check each month to a different person,\" said Cappadonna.\n\nThat money is then shared with families who need help paying for their medical expenses.\n\n\"From prenatal vitamins all the way to his first checkup after he was born, everything's been covered and we were only responsible for $300,\" said Cleghorn.\n\n\n\n\"Anything under $300 like routine care, members take care of on their own,\" said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan Ministries.\n\nAccording to Lansberry, these families and individuals are also exempt from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"We have a member systems fund with about $500K in it right now that we would use to offset any needs that would remain after discount,\" Lansberry said.\n\nLansberry also said in order to qualify, you must be a Christian, attend Church three out of the four Sundays a month, and not have any pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n\"We are called to bear one another's burdens, and so that's what we're doing. We are sharing the burdens,\" said Cappadonna.\n\nFor Cleghorn and her family, she said choosing Samaritan Ministries was the best decision she could've made in the long run both spiritually and financially.\n\n\"Knowing that I didn't have to worry about the financial obligation helped me enjoy being a mom on a whole different level, and that I will always cherish,\" Cleghorn said. \"If I would've known this existed, I would've jumped on the bandwagon long before my first child.\"\n\nNot all church communities have this option. News 4 spoke to other neighboring ecumenical faiths, and they tell us they think this is a good idea and are looking into it.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\nChristian-based health care ministries\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN ANTONIO - Some families are turning to their Christian faith to deal with the rising cost of health care.They're called Health Care Sharing Ministries, and News 4 learned they are making a difference in families day-to-day lives in San Antonio..When we", "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "og": {"site_name": "WOAI", "description": "SAN ANTONIO - Some families are turning to their Christian faith to deal with the rising cost of health care.They're called Health Care Sharing Ministries, and News 4 learned they are making a difference in families day-to-day lives in San Antonio..When we", "title": "Families turn to faith for health care", "url": "http://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/families-turn-to-faith-for-health-care", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e327c9dc-40e7-49cc-99fe-99ddcd9bef88-large16x9_healthcare.JPG?1462879402227", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e327c9dc-40e7-49cc-99fe-99ddcd9bef88-large16x9_healthcare.JPG?1462879402227", "title": "Families turn to faith for health care", "description": "SAN ANTONIO - Some families are turning to their Christian faith to deal with the rising cost of health care.They're called Health Care Sharing Ministries, and News 4 learned they are making a difference in families day-to-day lives in San Antonio..When we", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@news4sa"}, "title": "Families turn to faith for health care", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 935932893153593}, "keywords": "news,health,local,TX", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4sa", "published_time": "2016-05-09T18:39:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO - Some families are turning to their Christian faith to deal with the rising cost of health care.\n\"The more I learned about this health care sharing ministry, I learned we would be saving money, and it was kind of a paradigm shift to how health care works,\" said Cleghorn.\nLearn MoreChristian-based health care ministries\n\"Anything under $300 like routine care, members take care of on their own,\" said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan Ministries.\nThey pay around $400 a month locally to their church for health care."}
