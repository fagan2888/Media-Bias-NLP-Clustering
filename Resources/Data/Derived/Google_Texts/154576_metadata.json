Those are, technically, green houses, though they\u2019re not much like the greenhouses you\u2019d see at a garden nursery. Google Street View reveals they look like this:\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nThey\u2019re little more than plastic and metal piping. In 2000, an article in The Economist called them \u201cplastic awnings to intensify the sun's rays.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one zoom level higher. Notice the scale of those structures.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nThere are so many of them.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nZoom another layer out, there are still more.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nAnd more\u2026\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nAnd more\u2026\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nAnd still more\u2026\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nAnd they don\u2019t just cover that little nub of land, either. Zoom out further, and you\u2019ll see they branch into the surrounding countryside.\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nAnd switching to NASA\u2019s Blue Marble imagery, here are El Ejido\u2019s greenhouses against the tip of Spain and the northern coasts of Morocco and Algeria.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the entire Iberian peninsula, back in Google Earth. You can still see El Ejido\u2019s greenhouses.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the entire continent:\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nLook down and find that tiny nub on the southern coast of Spain: That patch, as white as the Alps, is a set of manmade structures. Those structures are made of plastic and metal piping, the kind of materials you could find at a local Home Depot. It\u2019s just thousands of these:\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nWhich, from the ground, look like this:\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nAnd\u2014accumulated by capital and climate change\u2014come together into something which can easily be seen in an image thousands of miles tall by thousands of miles wide.\n\nVia Charlie Loyd.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How lots of tiny acts can change how a continent looks from space", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "How lots of tiny acts can change how a continent looks from space", "title": "You Won't Believe What Humans Can Accomplish With Just Plastic Sheeting", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/continent_greenhouse/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/you-wont-believe-what-humans-can-accomplish-with-just-some-plastic-sheeting/281290/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Google MapsAnd more\u2026Google MapsAnd more\u2026Google MapsAnd still more\u2026Google EarthAnd they don\u2019t just cover that little nub of land, either.\nGoogle Street View reveals they look like this:Google Street ViewThey\u2019re little more than plastic and metal piping.\nIn 2000, an article in The Economist called them \u201cplastic awnings to intensify the sun's rays.\u201dHere\u2019s one zoom level higher.\nThose structures are made of plastic and metal piping, the kind of materials you could find at a local Home Depot.\nToday, with the help of Google Maps, we\u2019ll look at the city of El Ejido in Spain."}
