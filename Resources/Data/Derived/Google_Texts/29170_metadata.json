Tourism dropped in 2013 and 2014 during sporadic violence linked to the rivalry between Renamo, Mozambique\u2019s main opposition group, and its former adversary during the civil war, the ruling Frelimo party. The park is also in Sofala province, an opposition stronghold in central Mozambique.\n\nGorongosa became a national park under Portuguese colonizers in 1960. The decade that followed is considered the park\u2019s heyday; actors John Wayne and Gregory Peck and author James Michener went on safari there, according to the park\u2019s website.\n\nThe civil war began in 1977 after Portugal\u2019s exit from Mozambique. Fighters killed Gorongosa\u2019s elephants for their ivory and slaughtered other animals, emptying a once-teeming landscape. Widespread poaching continued after a peace deal.\n\nToday, there is a lot to see, thanks largely to a 2008 deal in which a non-profit group founded by American philanthropist Greg Carr pledged at least $1.2 million annually to the restoration of Gorongosa for 20 years. More funding came from European governments, the United States Agency for International Development and other donors.\n\nWorkers have built tourism facilities, planted trees and relocated buffalos, hippos and elephants from neighboring South Africa into Gorongosa; money has flowed to poor local communities whose support for the park is seen as indispensable.\n\n\u201cThings are really starting to go quite fast,\u201d said Marc Stalmans, director of scientific services at Gorongosa, which encompasses 1,570 square miles (4,070 square kilometers) and was expanded to include the mountain of the same name in 2010.\n\nThe numbers tell a remarkable story of recovery, particularly at a time when populations of threatened species are under pressure from poachers and human encroachment elsewhere in Mozambique and in much of the rest of Africa. Even so, the counts in Gorongosa are generally far below what they were before the war.\n\nThe estimated elephant population went from 2,500 in the early 1970s, to fewer than 200 in 2000, and more than 500 in 2014. Similarly, researchers have counted nearly 60 lions, double the number a few years ago, but below the estimated 200 in 1972.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "author": "Christopher Torchia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "title": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/mozambique_park_sees_wildlife_numbers_grow_in_wake_of_war/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/mozambique-wildlife-returns.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/mozambique-wildlife-returns.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mozambique park sees wildlife numbers grow in wake of war", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The civil war began in 1977 after Portugal\u2019s exit from Mozambique.\nGorongosa became a national park under Portuguese colonizers in 1960.\nTourism dropped in 2013 and 2014 during sporadic violence linked to the rivalry between Renamo, Mozambique\u2019s main opposition group, and its former adversary during the civil war, the ruling Frelimo party.\nThe 15-year conflict that killed up to 1 million people ended in 1992, and some former battlefield foes are now working together as rangers at Gorongosa National Park, where foreign donors and conservationists helped launch a turnaround on a continent accustomed to bad news about wildlife welfare.\nThe park is also in Sofala province, an opposition stronghold in central Mozambique."}
