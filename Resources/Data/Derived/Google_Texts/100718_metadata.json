Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nPresident Barack Obama's signature health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act, faces new scrutiny in the courts, raising additional questions about the future of Obamacare. In late July, two federal appeals court panels issued contradictory rulings within hours of each other on the legality of one of the law\u2019s key components: subsidies to help people pay for health insurance.\n\nAt issue in both lawsuits was whether the wording of the law authorizes the government to make tax credits available to subsidize the cost of health insurance premiums for millions of qualifying middle- and low-income Americans who purchase insurance using healthcare.gov, the federal exchange, or only for those who use state-run marketplaces. The reasoning behind the opposing rulings boiled down to whether the judges strictly interpreted the letter of the health care law or its spirit.\n\n[ READ: Courts Issue Conflicting Rulings on Obamacare Subsidies in Some States]\n\nHalbig v. Burwell was brought by a group of individuals and employers from states that did not establish their own exchanges and objected to the subsidies and the law\u2019s mandate that they buy insurance. A West Virginia man who joined the lawsuit, for example, admits to being at least partly motivated by opposition to \u201cgovernment handouts,\u201d and would rather avoid the choice of purchasing health insurance \u2013 even at a subsidized cost of less than $21 per year \u2013 or facing a tax penalty, according to court documents.\n\nIn a major blow to Obamacare, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that the health care law, as written, restricts tax credit subsidies to people who purchase health insurance through marketplaces that are \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d In his decision, Judge Thomas Griffith, appointed to the court by President George W. Bush, noted that the ruling \u201cwill likely have significant consequences\u201d for millions of Americans and health insurance markets. \u201cWe reach this conclusion, frankly, with reluctance,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe ruling does not immediately block subsidies to people who use healthcare.gov, pending the Obama administration's appeal. But if the ruling is upheld, it would mean the Internal Revenue Service lacked the authority to subsidize health insurance premiums through tax credits to nearly 5 million Americans in as many as 36 states \u2013 many with Republican governors or legislatures \u2013 where only the federal exchange operates. That could drastically alter or ultimately cripple Obamacare.\n\nSome 7.3 million people \u2013 or about 62 percent of the 11.8 million people expected to enroll in federally facilitated marketplaces by 2016 \u2013 could lose out on $36.1 billion in subsidies, according to a report by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThere would be a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow and an economist at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center. Without the subsidies, fewer people would have affordable insurance available, and so they would be exempted from the health care law\u2019s requirement to have coverage, she explains. In turn, healthy people might leave the insurance pool, while those with costly medical needs come in. As a result, \u201cthe average price of insurance goes up, up and up,\u201d she says. Moreover, insurers are likely to push for the repeal of patient protections, including those prohibiting discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Senior Judge Harry Edwards, the lone Democrat-appointed judge on the panel, described the lawsuit as a \u201cnot-so-veiled attempt to gut\u201d the health care law. The majority opinion \u201cdefies the will of Congress,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJust two hours later, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, reached the opposite conclusion in King v. Burwell, a similar lawsuit brought by Virginia residents. It upheld the health care law, ruling 3 to 0 that subsidies provided in both state- and federally run exchanges are permissible and clearly intended by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[ OPINION: Obamacare Subsidy Cases Leave the Health Care Law in Limbo]\n\nIn his published opinion, Judge Roger Gregory, originally nominated \u200bto the court by President Bill Clinton, wrote that the \u201cstatutory language is ambiguous\u201d but it is \u201cclear that widely available tax credits are essential to fulfilling the Act\u2019s primary goals\u201d and Congress was aware of their importance when drafting the bill. \u201cThe economic framework supporting the act would crumble if the credits were unavailable on federal exchanges,\u201d Gregory wrote. His ruling \u2013 joined by two Obama appointees \u2013 upheld the health care law, reasoning that the IRS' payment of premium subsidies as tax credits is \u201ca permissible exercise of the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe Obama administration will appeal the Halbig ruling by the three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit, which was the first to find that premium subsidies available through the federal exchange are invalid, a Justice Department official said on Aug. 1. Since seven of those judges were appointed by Democratic presidents \u2013 including four recently appointed by Obama \u2013 chances are better that if the full court decides to rehear the case, it will overturn the panel\u2019s decision. Of course, the outcome is uncertain, since court rulings don\u2019t necessarily follow party lines.\n\n\"I have learned not to predict legal outcomes but I sure hope they do,\u201d says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who was consulted on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThose who lost the King lawsuit in the 4th Circuit decision also could request that the full court rehear their case. But since most of those judges were nominated by Democrats, asking them to rehear the case \u201cwould probably be a waste of time,\u201d says Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow\u200b in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. \u201cIf I were counsel for King, I would go straight to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. The high court might agree to hear the case because of the split circuit court decisions, although it\u2019s hard to predict what the justices would decide.\n\nThe Supreme Court has saved Obamacare before, however. In 2012, the justices, in a 5 to 4 majority opinion, upheld the health care law\u2019s individual mandate, or the ability of the federal government to tax individuals who refuse to purchase insurance \u2013 a key portion of the legislation. But the court also allowed states to opt out of a provision that expanded Medicaid insurance to all low-income Americans. And just last month, in the Hobby Lobby case, it found that Obamacare could not force \"closely-held\" private companies to provide birth control coverage to their employees if doing so violates their religious beliefs. In response, the Obama administration is expected to issue new regulations next month that include a compromise arrangement.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Featured: Collections: Health", "title": "Can Obamacare Succeed Without Subsidies?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Split court decisions raise questions about health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.", "title": "Can Obamacare Succeed Without Subsidies?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/04/can-obamacare-succeed-without-subsidies", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7e/f1/e1d452494358931658cf6e40ccba/140804-aca-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Can Obamacare Succeed Without Subsidies?", "description": "Split court decisions raise questions about health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Doug Podolsky,Affordable Care Act,health insurance,health care,Pulse,courts,subsidies,Featured: Collections: Health", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Split court decisions raise questions about health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01c5\"", "article_summary": "The reasoning behind the opposing rulings boiled down to whether the judges strictly interpreted the letter of the health care law or its spirit.\nThe courts are conflicted about a controversial part of the health care law that that lowers the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans.\n[ READ: Courts Issue Conflicting Rulings on Obamacare Subsidies in Some States]Halbig v.
