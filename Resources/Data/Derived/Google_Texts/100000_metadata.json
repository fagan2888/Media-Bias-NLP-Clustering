Open enrollment on public exchanges runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.\n\nehirst@tribune.com\n\nTwitter @ellenjeanhirst", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Small business health exchange launches in Illinois", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act 's online health insurance marketplaces for small businesses launched Monday in Illinois and four other states, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.", "title": "Small business health exchange launches in Illinois", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-shop-exchange-launch-illinois-1027-biz-20141027-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-544ee125/turbine/ct-shop-exchange-launch-illinois-1027-biz-20141027", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "SHOP exchange, small business health insurance, small business insurance, Illinois small business", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81798790", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-28", "Description": "Online health insurance marketplaces for small businesses launched Monday in Illinois and four other states, but only in a limited capacity.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "SHOP exchange, small business health insurance, small business insurance, Illinois small business"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ca2\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act's online health insurance marketplaces for small businesses launched Monday in Illinois and four other states, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe SHOP exchange allows employers with 50 or fewer full-time employees to compare and buy commercial health insurance plans for workers.\nThe business owners, brokers and health insurance agents will give feedback before the site goes live to the public.\nSmall businesses in Illinois \u2014 as well as Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio \u2014 will get a chance to pre-enroll in the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, but won't be able to see or select plans until the Affordable Care Act begins open enrollment Nov. 15.\nOpen enrollment on public exchanges runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.ehirst@tribune.comTwitter @ellenjeanhirst"}
