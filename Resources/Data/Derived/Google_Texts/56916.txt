Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke Tuesday announced his endorsement of Donald Trump, saying that as a former Navy SEAL, he believes the presumptive GOP nominee will put the nation's troops and national security first."We need a commander in chief that will put the troops first and national security interests first before raising money for the Clinton Foundation or mishandling classified information or Benghazi; the list goes on," Zinke told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" program.Zinke said that Trump won over the numerous other candidates because he knew "America was upset and it's time to put American interests first."Further, he told the program, "the age of political correctness is over . . . We need to have a dialogue of critical thinking and not hide behind terminology and being so politically correct that nothing is getting done and that's what Washington is so great at â€” getting nothing done."Zinke also believes that as a businessman, Trump will put jobs at "center plate" and will not accept business as usual in Washington D.C."If we don't have a moving economy, then nothing else is going to matter," said Zinke. "We won't be able to afford a strong military nor will we be able to afford to keep the promises we've made."Having an economy that moves is absolutely critical and to have someone understands what drives the economic, you know, engine of this country, I think it's Donald Trump."
