This report, complied by AP staffers, shows that the 3.5 million cancellations have come from just 22 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe \u201cgrandfathered plan\u201d regulations written by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Department of Health and Human are very strict. Most people don\u2019t realize that the vast majority of insurance plans go through some sort of change over time. But virtually any change a pre-Obamacare plan, either by the insurer or consumer, means that the policy can no longer exist and the consumer would have purchase one compliant with law\u2019s mandates.\n\nEven plans with grandfathered status would eventually have to comply with at least some of the mandates. But despite President Obama and his subordinates blaming insurance companies for the cancellations, these rules \u2014 written by bureaucrats in his administration \u2014 are entirely responsible.\n\nThe AP reported California has seen the largest number of policy cancellations, at 900,000. Georgia and Florida have seen 400,000 and 300,000 cancellations. Three other states have seen more than 200,000 cancellations \u2014 Washington (290,000), Pennsylvania (215,000 to 250,000), and Michigan (225,000).\n\nSome of the states represented by vulnerable Democrats have reported cancellations, including North Carolina (160,000), Louisiana (10,000), and Alaska (5,300). Arkansas isn\u2019t tracking the numbers. Some of these Senate Democrats are worried about the political ramifications of these cancellations and are urging a legislative fix, despite already missing that opportunity.\n\nThough this may have changed in recent days, states with large populations \u2014 including Illinois, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia \u2014 either haven\u2019t reported numbers or were not tracking cancellations at the time, according to the AP.\n\nAgain, the 3.5 million number isn\u2019t a true reflection of the total number of canceled policies, nor will the flood of notices end anytime soon.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Associated Press,Barack Obama,california,cancellation letters,cancellation notices,Florida,Georgia,grandfathered plans,Health Insurance,insurance", "description": "Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle The Associated Press (AP) reported recently that 3.5 million health insurance policies had been canceled because of changes in the plans that resulted in the loss of their &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; status under", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "DC.Title": "3.5 million insurance policies canceled in just 22 states"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4355\"", "article_summary": "Again, the 3.5 million number isn\u2019t a true reflection of the total number of canceled policies, nor will the flood of notices end anytime soon.\nThis report, complied by AP staffers, shows that the 3.5 million cancellations have come from just 22 states and the District of Columbia.\nMost people don\u2019t realize that the vast majority of insurance plans go through some sort of change over time.\nSome of the states represented by vulnerable Democrats have reported cancellations, including North Carolina (160,000), Louisiana (10,000), and Alaska (5,300).\nThe Associated Press (AP) reported recently that 3.5 million health insurance policies had been canceled because of changes in the plans that resulted in the loss of their \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status under Obamacare regulations."}
