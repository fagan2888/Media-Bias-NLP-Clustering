As technology and healthcare advance, employers need professionals with a blend of complicated skills. The need is large and the talent pool is shallow.\n\nHow do you become the highly sought-after health IT candidate that employers want? General IT skills are a start, but complex skills are needed to gain the attention of recruiters.\n\nThe following skills are bound to be the most needed in 2015. Focus on these skills to land a new job this year:\n\nProgramming and Application Development Skills\n\nIn a survey of IT executives conducted by Computerworld, programming skills were the highest ranked skill needed by IT executives. In 2015, 48 percent of survey respondents plan to hire candidates who are strong in this area. These skills will be especially important in the health IT space.\n\nAs EHRs evolve, more IT professionals will be needed to develop complex systems. And EHRs are just the beginning. As more patients receive care under the Affordable Care Act, more data will need to be managed. Initiatives of Obamacare will also drive change, impacting the way care is delivered and health is managed. As these changes take hold, new sophisticated tools will be needed to maintain and analyze health data.\n\nImprove or expand your programming knowledge and gain as much experience as you can to maximize your chances of landing a new position in 2015.\n\nProject Management Expertise\n\nThe Computerworld survey found that 35 percent of IT executives are looking to hire employees with project management skills this year.\n\nThe key to project management in health IT is a strong understanding of business, technology, and healthcare. As more hospitals and health systems make the switch to EHRs, knowledgeable project managers will be needed to oversee large projects and to provide support during the transition to new systems.\n\nBrush up on your business skills to be considered for project management positions. Understand the current trends impacting healthcare and get to know the needs and concerns of hospitals, health systems, and healthcare professionals. Take additional classes or complete certifications in project management. Demonstrate your strong knowledge base to employers and show you\u2019re the candidate they\u2019ve been searching for.\n\nSecurity Intelligence\n\nSecurity is a hot button issue for IT right now. After large corporations such as Target, Home Depot, and eBay suffered data breaches in 2014, privacy concerns are heightened. Companies are spending more money to protect their data and prevent hefty fines, and hiring more tech talent to beef up security. In 2013, 2,500 job postings for information security analysts were open in New York City alone.\n\nSecurity is an even bigger concern in healthcare IT. Protecting patient information and following HIPPA regulations are a top priority. Specialize in security and acquire these sought-after skills from extra education and training.\n\nMobile and Cloud Management Know-How\n\nAlthough the healthcare industry has been slow to adopt cloud-based systems, the cloud is coming. To keep up with patient data and new ways of patient management, cloud-based\n\nSystems and mobile strategies will need to be developed and adopted, slowly but surely. IT professionals with a mix of EHR, cloud system, and mobile management knowledge will be in high demand.\n\nTo appeal to employers, hone your skills in managing these technologies and watch for emerging trends of their use in healthcare.\n\nProfessional Proficiency\n\nHealthcare IT professionals must straddle three areas of expertise: IT, healthcare, and customer service and support. Healthcare IT employers need workers with a healthy mix of tech and more traditional professional skills to interact with those in the healthcare field. Communication skills are key to interact with both tech teams and healthcare professionals to deliver services and troubleshoot problems.\n\nIn a constantly changing field, employers are also looking for professionals who look ahead. As technology continues to advance rapidly and healthcare transforms, firms will need employees who can easily adapt to new responsibilities and technology.\n\nAlthough tech skills are key, improve on basic professional skills to increase your value to recruiters.\n\nWhat skills do you think will the most important to health IT employers in 2015?\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recruiters are looking for highly skilled health IT professionals.
