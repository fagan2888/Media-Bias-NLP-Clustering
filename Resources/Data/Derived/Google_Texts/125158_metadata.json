Depending on your income, you can get a break on the cost of insurance.\n\nFor low-income people, next Tuesday, April 1, is the first day to enroll in a brand-new public plan \u2013 called the Healthy Michigan plan. It\u2019s a Medicaid program, but it\u2019s open to many people who couldn\u2019t get Medicaid before now. Signups will continue all year.\n\nDuring this crunch time for insurance enrollment, the University of Michigan Health System will offer free help to anyone who needs it \u2013 whether or not they get their health care at U-M hospitals or health centers.\n\nA trained team of UMHS counselors has been helping people understand their options under the Affordable Care Act since last September. They can help anyone figure out what plans they and their families might be eligible for, and actually enroll.\n\nBesides private plans sold on the national health insurance Marketplace, and the new Healthy Michigan plans, the counselors can help Michiganders enroll in other programs that they might be eligible for \u2013 including county plans for people who don\u2019t qualify for other types of insurance.\n\nComing to U-M for care once you have coverage\n\nU-M doctors and teams have already treated many patients who have bought private health insurance on the national Marketplace (including www.healthcare.gov) since last fall. UMHS accepts many of the private plans directly, and members of other plans may be able to receive care at U-M with a referral from their doctor.\n\nOnce Healthy Michigan plans begin offering coverage on April 1, UMHS will accept many of them for all types of care, and one plan for specialty care only. For people enrolled in other Healthy Michigan plans, it may still be possible to come to UMHS for specialty care if no hospital in their plan\u2019s network has the services they need.\n\nFor the full lists of plans UMHS accepts, see http://www.uofmhealth.org/ACAplans.\n\nAny patient, visitor or community member can get help in enrolling in a private or Medicaid plan from UMHS Patient Financial Counselors by calling (877) 326-9155 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday-Friday or emailing PFC-Counselors@med.umich.edu. Walk-in help is available at several locations around the U-M medical campus and health centers.\n\nThe UMHS Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools (RAHS) also has several trained counselors available to offer by-appointment help. Call 734-998-5795 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday-Friday, or email UMHS-RAHS@umich.edu .\n\nU-M students trained in talking with the public will continue to assist with outreach to people who have sought free care from U-M providers through the Hope Clinic and Student Run Free Clinic, as well as others. This outreach effort was organized through the Washtenaw Health Initiative, which is partly supported by UMHS. Those clinics and others will continue to care for uninsured people, including those not eligible for any Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nMore about Healthy Michigan Medicaid coverage\n\nStarting April 1, Michiganders between the ages of 19 and 64 can sign up for Healthy Michigan if their income is less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- about $15,000 for a single person and $34,000 for a family of four. Eligibility is based on \u201cmodified adjusted gross income\u201d \u2013 which for most people will be the same as what they report on their taxes.\n\nUnlike traditional Medicaid, Healthy Michigan is open to anyone whose income falls under the 133 percent figure \u2013 including childless adults \u2013 although currently pregnant women should apply for other programs specifically for them. Even people who were turned down for Medicaid in the past should apply if their income is low enough.\n\nPeople in Healthy Michigan plans whose incomes are more than 100 percent of the poverty level will need to set up a healthcare savings account to help them pay for their costs in future. Just as in regular Medicaid, there will be small co-pays for services \u2013 including for emergency department visits for non-emergencies, and for non-emergency hospital admissions\n\nMembers of Healthy Michigan plans will also have to complete a health assessment form, with the help of a health provider who they should see within the first few months of getting coverage.\n\nIn addition to Healthy Michigan plans, the state offers other insurance coverage programs. Many people don\u2019t know that they or their children are eligible for these, but U-M counselors can assist.\n\nKey Affordable Care Act dates and deadlines:\n\nMarch 31 \u2013 Open enrollment ends for private individual/family plans on the Marketplace; coverage will begin May 1. People who sign up between March 15 and 31 will have to file an exemption when they file their federal taxes next year. Note: On March 25, the federal government announced that people who had started an application by March 31 but had been unable to complete it will be able to do so by mid-April.\n\nApril 1 - Enrollment in Healthy Michigan (expanded Medicaid) plans begins. Coverage begins April 1, no matter when someone enrolls.\n\nMarch 31 is also the deadline for all Americans to meet the requirement of having health insurance for all or most of 2014. Most people who don\u2019t meet this deadline will have to pay a fee of $95 or 1 percent of their income, on top of their income taxes, in early 2015.\n\nAll year \u2013 Someone who has a qualifying life event (such as the birth of a baby or marriage) can enroll in a Marketplace plan, or change plans, even when open enrollment is closed.\n\nNovember 15 \u2013 Open enrollment begins for private plans for calendar year 2015\n\nFor more information about UMHS and the Affordable Care Act, visit http://www.uofmhealth.org/newoptions\n\n# # #", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you live in Michigan and you don\u2019t have health insurance, you don\u2019t have a moment to lose.
