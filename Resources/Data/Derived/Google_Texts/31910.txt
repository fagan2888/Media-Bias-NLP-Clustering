(Editor's note: Two fact errors related to water and sewer rates were corrected in this story. The original story stated water and sewer rates were proposed to rise.)

The house at 1241 3rd Ave. is old and the owners want the city to say so.

Susan Abenilla-Brown, her husband Brian Brown and her mother Elanore Abenilla are petitioning the city commission Tuesday to designate the house, built sometime between 1900 and 1920, as a local historic landmark.

The Historic Preservation commission has already recommended the house be given the designation, which would prevent anyone from altering the exterior of the home without prior permission from the commission.

"Everybody keeps saying to us 'You know you can't make changes to the house' and we say 'That's the point,'" Abenilla-Brown, 51, said. "We want it to say how it is. Why would we want it to change?"

The house, a bungalow-style structure with original glass in the windows, oil lamp sconces and a special shelf where the residents of yore would have stored their wall-mounted crank phone.

The house was inventoried in 1986 and included in the West Side Historic District, which is on the national register of historic places. The home is also listed in the Colorado HIstorical Society Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, but Abenilla-Brown said those distinctions don't adequately protect the home in the future.

"I don't want to see someone buy the house and tear it down and put up some piece of pre-fab garbage, not that all pre-fab homes are garbage," Abenilla-Brown said.

Water and sewer rates

During Tuesday's meeting, the city council will also consider a rise in water on a first reading.

On Dec. 9, city staff presented to the council on what Public Works and Natural Resources Manager Dale Rademacher said was a need to raise water rates to keep up with rising costs of providing water to the city.

After some debate on alternative rate structures, council chose to collapse the existing rate structure from five tiers of use to four, which many of the council members said they considered easier to navigate.

The ordinance before the council on Tuesday increases water rate by an average of 9 percent every year from 2015 to 2019.

While water rates are proposed to rise in March, sewer rates rose in January under an ordinance passed in 2012. Due to the completion of the Windy Gap debt payment and retiring utility infrastructure, system development fees for water and sewer are going down overall also.

Alcohol attorney

The council will also consider whether to allow Mayor Dennis Coombs to sign a contract for special counsel with attorneys Lyons Gaddis Kahn Hall Jeffers Dworak & Grant P.C., who have specialization in boozy legal matters.

City staff are recommending acquiring the special counsel because City Manager Harold Dominguez must apply for an arts liquor license on behalf of the Longmont Museum.

Museum staff has identified selling beer, wine, liquor or champagne during special events in the yet-to-be-completed Stewart Auditorium as something the community expects from a museum and the museum hopes to reap a profit from the venture.

The law firm began in Longmont and still has an office based here on Kimbark Street as well as an office in Louisville. The contract states that the price for Adele L. Reester as primary counsel is $235 an hour, while the prices for associate attorneys and paralegals range from $65 an hour to $270 an hour. The city will not pay for routine mileage and the city can terminate the agreement at any time with reasonable written notice.
