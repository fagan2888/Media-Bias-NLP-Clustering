This happens when students take the food offered at lunch, yet choose not to eat the meal.\n\nA January 2014 GAO report shows plate waste, \u201cparticularly for fruits and veggies,\u201d to have been reported in 48 states. The GAO observes that plate waste may be on the decline as students adjust to the new requirements.\n\n\u201cIn addition, when we asked students what they like about school lunch, students we spoke with in 13 of the 14 schools generally reported liking fruit and vegetable options,\u201d the 2015 report says.\n\nOther nutrition standards may take more adjustment time for students.\n\nAs of the 2014-2015 year, schools are required to have 100 percent (as opposed to a 2012 USDA requirement of 50 percent) of grain products offered contain at least 50 percent of whole grains.\n\nThe GAO was told \u201cstudents do not like certain whole grain-rich foods, so getting them to take and eat them continues to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nSodium limits also began to be phased in during the 2014-2015 school year. The new standards have caused some schools to remove popular menu items, like chili.\n\nSome students the GAO spoke with commented on the \u201clack of flavor in school meals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over a span of three school years, 1.4 million children dropped out of the National School Lunch Program, reports the Government Accountability Office.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Over a span of three school years, 1.4 million children dropped out of the National School Lunch Program, reports the Government Accountability Office.", "title": "As School Meals Have Gotten Healthier, 1.4 Million Students Drop Out of School Lunch Program", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151103_SchoolLunch_Jessen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MFKwMA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Over a span of three school years, 1.4 million children dropped out of the National School Lunch Program, reports the Government Accountability Office.", "title": "As School Meals Have Gotten Healthier, 1.4 Million Students Drop Out of School Lunch Program", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151103_SchoolLunch_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-11-06T18:21:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "School Lunch, Michelle Obama, National School Lunch Program"}, "article_summary": "Over a span of three school years, 1.4 million children dropped out of the National School Lunch Program, reports the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nThe changes behind the drop in school lunch participants has racked up an additional $1.2 billion that school districts have shelled out in fiscal year 2015.\n\u201cIn addition, when we asked students what they like about school lunch, students we spoke with in 13 of the 14 schools generally reported liking fruit and vegetable options,\u201d the 2015 report says.\nSome students the GAO spoke with commented on the \u201clack of flavor in school meals.\u201d\nA January 2014 GAO report shows plate waste, \u201cparticularly for fruits and veggies,\u201d to have been reported in 48 states."}
