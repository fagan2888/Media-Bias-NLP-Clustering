Employers with fewer than 50 workers don\u2019t face the mandate to provide coverage.\n\nThe chamber will follow it up this week by voting to define full-time work under Obamacare as 40 hours instead of 30. At least two Senate Democrats have backed an identical bill in the upper chamber, an early boon for Republicans who took control of both chambers Monday and have pledged themselves to sober and transparent leadership.\n\n\u201cI think you make the changes that you can, and you lay the groundwork and hopefully win the presidential election next time. Then I think we\u2019ll be in much better shape,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, looking ahead to the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nYet Mr. Cole said the GOP has made a mistake by failing to coalesce around an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nThe party is sitting on proposals from Rep. Tom Price, Georgia Republican, the Republican Study Committee and a blueprint forged last year by three GOP senators, but none of them have momentum, and the party hasn\u2019t put any of them up for a vote.\n\nSome Democrats say Republicans are unable to agree among themselves, so they\u2019ll never be able to reach across the aisle either.\n\nLining up votes to chip away at Obamacare \u201cis a lousy way to begin the Congress,\u201d said Rep. James P. McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat. \u201cIf you really want to begin on a note where we\u2019re going to try to develop consensus and work together, I would have begun with some less controversial items than the ones they\u2019ve lined up.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 2016 timetable could be upset by the Supreme Court, which is hearing a case later this year on whether the government can continue to pay subsidies to customers in states that rely on the federal health exchange. Without the subsidies, customers in roughly two-thirds of states could be unable to afford their plans.\n\n\u201cIf [Republicans] are able to build some bipartisan momentum for changes to the law now, it will help them make broader changes if the court ends up voiding broad swaths of the law with its decision,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution who advised 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney on health policy.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said there is a \u201cbetter than 50-50\u201d chance the justices strike down the subsidies and knock the law off-kilter, meaning the GOP needs to present an alternative. Asked if they\u2019ll be ready, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act continues to poll poorly. But the second go-around for enrollment on the exchanges has avoided major technical glitches.\n\nAnd Republicans will need to grapple with budget implications of their changes, since even modest tweaks would cost the government billions of dollars. That\u2019s true of the bill to define the work week at 40 hours.\n\n\u201cIt is an extremely expensive proposal,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the chamber\u2019s second-most-powerful Democrat.\n\n\u201cMany of us \u2014 I didn\u2019t say all of us \u2014 on the Democratic side are committed to the survival \u2026 of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important things I have voted for in my terms in the House and Senate.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who teamed with Republicans to back the 40-hour legislation and frequently breaks with the White House, said Monday he has no desire to scrap the health law but wants to make changes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for every repair I can,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2981 S.A.
