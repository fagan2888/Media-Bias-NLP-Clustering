When reporters write articles describing his colleagues\u2019 feelings about the Texas senator, the words \u201chate\u201d and loathe\u201d make frequent appearances. And now that Cruz is surging in the Republican presidential primary, his chief rival appears to be making Cruz\u2019s pariah status in D.C. a campaign issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the way he\u2019s dealt with the Senate, where he goes in there, frankly, like a little bit of a maniac,\u201d Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview on Sunday. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk into the Senate and scream and call people liars and not be able to cajole and get along with people. He\u2019ll never get anything done, and that\u2019s the problem with Ted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump to Cruz \u2013 Nobody Likes You\n\nIt sounds like a pretty reasonable knock against a guy who wants to run the country. If the members of legislative branch can\u2019t stand him, how could it possibly make sense to put him in the White House?\n\nBut consider this: In the recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll of voters in the key early voting state of Iowa, Republican voters were asked who, among the top GOP candidates, would work most effectively with Congress. At the top of the heap, with 31 percent of the vote, was Cruz.\n\nHow is this possible? Sure, members of Congress don\u2019t like Cruz. But it\u2019s important to remember, the general public loathes Congress. What we\u2019ve got here is a \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d situation.\n\n\u201cCongress is held in contempt by the voters, and the members of Congress hold Cruz in contempt,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cSounds like a made-for-TV ad: \u2018They hate me because I've blown the whistle on them. I didn't go to Washington to become a member of the club, but to get things done and represent you. The special interests don't own me. I'm nobody's man but yours.\u2019 The scripts write themselves.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Ted Cruz Could Win the GOP Nomination\n\nPositioning himself as the mortal enemy of a body with disapproval ratings that regularly spike to above 80 percent might not, in the end, be a terrible strategy for Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Cruz is disliked by Washington is seen as a positive,\u201d agreed Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell. \u201cThere\u2019s also this idea that if he\u2019s in Congress, he knows how to change Congress.\u201d\n\nTrump, he said, might decide that helping Cruz paint himself as the anti-Washington candidate is actually a poor choice.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why Trump said that this weekend is that he likes to send up trial balloons. He likes to see what sticks when another candidate starts nipping at his heels.\u2026 He just hasn\u2019t figured out what\u2019s going to take down Cruz yet.\u201d\n\nPainting him as unpopular in Washington might not be the way to do it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress hates Ted Cruz, but a lot of voters think he\u2019s just the man to deal with lawmakers in Washington.
