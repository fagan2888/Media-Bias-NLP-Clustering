Last election the GOP championed Mitt Romney\u2019s corporate experience as a meaningful indicator of his political acumen. Romney himself argued that we should have a provision in the Constitution that says the \u201cpresident has to spend at least three years working in business before he could become president.\u201d\n\nThis year we have Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina, both of whom have no relevant experience in government. Trump is a bit of a unique case, as his appeal to the nativist elements of the GOP has little to do with his business background. But Fiorina is different. More measured and prudent than Trump, Fiorina calmly argues that her successful tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard is proof of her political potential \u2013 it\u2019s her primary justification for seeking the presidency. And Republican voters are buying it. According to the latest CNN/ORC poll, Fiorina now sits at second place following last week\u2019s presidential debate.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with Fiorina\u2019s argument. First, it\u2019s a false trope that businessmen succeed in presidential politics. To begin with, a country isn\u2019t a business, and overseeing a corporation and deciding national economic policy are not the same. Paul Krugman, among many others, has already explained why this distinction matters.\n\nIf you reject the claim that countries and corporations are fundamentally different, history offers other reasons to be weary of businessmen in politics. Two of the worst presidents in modern history, Herbert Hoover and George W. Bush, were former businessmen; their legacies are the Great Depression and the Iraq War, respectively. In 2009, historians ranked America\u2019s presidents, and the results were unsurprising: Only one of the top 10 presidents, Harry Truman, had any business experience at all. Alternatively, many of the worst presidents \u2013 Warren Harding, Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce, and John Tyler \u2013 all had a successful background in business before seeking the presidency.\n\nThe other glaring problem with Fiorina\u2019s story is that it\u2019s totally false. Even if you accept that success in the business world translates to success in politics (and you shouldn\u2019t), the fact remains: Fiorina was a terrible businesswoman. In the last presidential debate, Donald Trump referenced a study by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale\u2019s School of Management, which refuted Fiorina\u2019s revisionist history of her time at HP. Fiorina, predictably, dismissed Sonnenfeld, saying he \u201chad it out for me from the moment I arrived at Hewlett-Packard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A party that denies empirical facts & clings to cherished myths turns to a serial distorter.
