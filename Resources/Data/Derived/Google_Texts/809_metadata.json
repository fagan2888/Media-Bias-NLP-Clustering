Both were journalists for the local station.\n\n\u201cHer life was news. She loved doing this,\u201d Parker\u2019s WDBJ co-worker Heather Butterworth said.\n\nButterworth met Parker in 2012 when the two interned for WDBJ together. Both attended the nearby college, James Madison University, and worked alongside each other on the student newspaper, The Breeze.\n\nParker graduated in December 2012, moving to Jacksonville, N.C., to work at the local station, WCTI-TV. She and Butterworth reconnected when they were both hired by WDBJ in May 2014.\n\nParker, Butterworth, and Ward worked during the morning shift, beginning their days at 3:30 a.m. with a \u201ctight-knit\u201d group Butterworth described as \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were together all the time, she always had a smile on her face,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were always joking around and laughing about stupid stuff and stuffing our faces with food. The newsroom is a very stressful place so you need somebody like that.\u201d\n\nParker had just moved in with her boyfriend of nine months, Chris Hurst, who also works at WDBJ as an anchor, on Aug. 1. Butterworth said they were on the path to getting married and had talked about kids.\n\nShe had ambitions of becoming a national news reporter and had just finished a special about childhood abuse.\n\n\u201cShe was hoping for an Emmy with that special, and I truly believe she could get it because it\u2019s an amazing piece,\u201d Butterworth said.\n\nIvana J. Chan\u2014known to Parker as \u201cIJ\u201d\u2014looked to her as a mentor when she joined The Breeze\u2019s staff her freshman year of college in 2012.\n\n\u201cI was really shy and quiet when I first started at The Breeze, I didn\u2019t have that many friends and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d Chan said. \u201cAlison took me under her wing and helped me out. The Breeze became my little family and it was largely because of her.\u201d\n\nChan remembers Parker as a \u201ctough,\u201d \u201cprecise\u201d news editor who \u201cknew exactly what she wanted and how to get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlison was very driven. That\u2019s the perfect word to describe her,\u201d Chan said. \u201cShe would never accept a \u2026 poorly written story. She set those really high expectations for me, even when I was a new writer.\u201d\n\nParker was a leader who \u201cput 100 percent into everything she did,\u201d but she was also compassionate and accessible.\n\n\u201cPeople were attracted to her, they just wanted to talk to her and wanted her to talk to them. It was only natural that she was a journalist,\u201d Chan said.\n\nDylan Garner, who worked with Parker at The Breeze in 2012, described her as JMU\u2019s media arts and design \u201csuperstar.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was just so universally thought of as being a great, great journalist,\u201d Garner said. \u201cNothing was going to get in her way because she was too good for that. She was a fighter in every sense. If there was news to uncover, she was going to do it. She wasn\u2019t going to back out of anything. She wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. She was truly driven to get the job done to the best of her ability and her ability was obviously very high.\u201d\n\nChan said she knew Parker would \u201crise to the top\u201d in her profession, a sentiment echoed by her professors at JMU, who described her as \u201cone of the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so sad in a weird and ironic, horrible way that she\u2019s making national and international headlines now, but in the worst way possible,\u201d Chan said. \u201cShe had everything going for her, and she had all these hopes. All of these people were confident, so sure that she was going to get there. But she didn\u2019t have that chance.\u201d\n\nThe gunman, Vester L. Flanagan II, known on air as Bryce Williams, previously worked for WDBJ. He shot himself on a nearby highway about five hours after the attack and later died at Fairfax Hospital.\n\nChan said she hopes Parker is remembered as a \u201cpassionate, vivacious, beautiful soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what she was,\u201d Chan said.\n\nNatalie Johnson is a 2015 graduate from JMU in the School of Media Arts and Design.
