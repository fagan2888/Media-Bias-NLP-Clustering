Despite sparse data on the extent of misdiagnosis in the healthcare industry, best estimates indicate that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences, according to the long-awaited Institute of Medicine report, "Improving Diagnosis in Health Care," released today.

The 369-page report--the follow-up to the groundbreaking 1999 report, "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System"--calls correct diagnosis a critical aspect of healthcare, yet notes that diagnostic errors receive little attention because of scant data, few reliable measures and the fact that clinicians often don't know a mistake occurred or find about it in retrospect.

"This latest report improving diagnosis and healthcare is a serious second wake-up call in my mind that we still have a long way to go," Victor J. Dzau, president of the National Academy of Medicine, said during a press conference announcing the findings. "Diagnostic errors are a significant contributor to patient harm and have received too little attention until now... Errors in diagnosis ... can persist throughout all segments of care and continue to harm, in my mind, an unacceptable number of patients."

There are no reliable numbers on how many diagnostic errors occur, but recent research concludes that doctors make 12 million outpatient diagnostic errors each year--roughly one in every 20 diagnosis. The report calls for greater measurement of these errors by all healthcare organizations.

In order to reduce diagnostic errors, researchers said the industry must improve diagnosis in healthcare. This will involve more effective teamwork among clinicians and patients; improved training and education for healthcare professionals; a payment and care delivery environment that supports the diagnostic process and a dedicated focus on new research.
