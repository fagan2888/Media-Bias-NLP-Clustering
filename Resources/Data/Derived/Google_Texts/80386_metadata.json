Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, some of those same business leaders attended a press conference in which Finance Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo outlined a proposed law to raise productivity and competitiveness, an initiative that calls for longer-term planning and greater cooperation between the private and public sectors.\n\nThe proposal by no means implies a return to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s, where the state controlled means of production or substituted the private sector through economic activism, Mr. Videgaray said.\n\nIt seeks a \u201cmodern economic development policy\u201d where the private sector provides jobs, generates capital and creates value. \u201cBut the private sector can do that better when it teams up with the public sector, particularly the government,\u201d he said.\n\nIt does, however, mark a departure from the idea that the best industrial policy is to have no industrial policy, he added.\n\nLoss of productivity in recent decades has been one of the main reasons for Mexico\u2019s meager economic growth, which has averaged just 2.4% a year since 1980, and the cause lies partly in the country\u2019s large informal economy.\n\nThe proposed law, officials said, aims among other things to bring a host of small- and medium-sized businesses into large productive chains, creating incentives for growth and for joining the \u201cformal economy,\u201d bolstering the domestic market. The economy grew just 1.1% in 2013, and the government is projecting 2.7% growth this year.\n\nCooperation on the Buen Fin sales event, now in its fourth year, is a good example of how the government can contribute to enhancing economic activity, says Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief Mexico economist Alexis Milo. \u201cBig retailers always had their special offers, but it was necessary to concentrate those efforts into one weekend and expand it.\u201d\n\nThe number of participating companies will rise to 60,000 this year from 40,000 in 2013, officials said, and the Finance Ministry is doubling the amount of money-back prizes it will offer to people who buy with credit or debit cards to 500 million pesos from 250 million.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source":
