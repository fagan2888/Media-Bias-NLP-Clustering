Calvin Harris became the iHeartRadio Music Festival's first EDM headliner in its fourth year on Saturday night (Sept. 20), and the Scottish producer gave the audience at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena a special treat to send them home: the live debut of new single "Blame," with singer John Newman on-hand to perform the vocals live.

Newman, a U.K. soul singer whose debut album Tribute was released in the U.S. last January, was seen dancing to Harris' "Summer" waiting in the wings for his introduction, and then strolled onstage to take his place in front of the DJ's towering console. "Blame" sounded right at home amongst Harris' other roof-rattlers, and Newman took the instrumental breaks as an occasion to spastically groove onstage.







Harris' short set was composed of extra-stuffed versions of his radio bangers, starting with "Feel So Close" and snaking through "I Need Your Love," "Sweet Nothing" and recent hit "Summer." An expected finale of "We Found Love," his No. 1 collaboration with Rihanna, did not materialize.

Prior to Harris' performance, Lil Jon appeared onstage for a surprise rendition of his own recent Top 10 hit, "Turn Down For What," which he performed earlier on Saturday at the iHeartRadio village. Ryan Seacrest introduced Harris -- whose stage setup included laser lights, giants bursts of smoke and multi-colored fireworks -- by calling him the "biggest DJ in the world."
