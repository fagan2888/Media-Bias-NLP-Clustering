The bank was required to pay $1,131 per month over a period of 58 months, which included the cost of insurance.\n\nThe audit doesn\u2019t describe what kind of vehicle Ex-Im leased. According to the watchdog, Ex-Im\u2019s Office of Contracting Services provided the inspector general with justification for why the vehicle was leased. However, the agency watchdog said the office\u2019s reasoning \u201cdid not address why this particular vehicle was \u2018essential\u2019 to the bank\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nThe bank did not return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cEx-Im\u2019s chairman is famous for hitting the road, so I\u2019m not surprised by what is in the inspector general\u2019s audit,\u201d House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling said in a statement to The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret I\u2019m disappointed Congress reauthorized Ex-Im, a flawed agency that clearly needs intense congressional oversight.\u201d\n\nHensarling, R-Texas, and his committee have jurisdiction over Ex-Im, and he has been one of the bank\u2019s leading critics.\n\nIn the report, Ex-Im\u2019s inspector general also questioned why the bank leased a vehicle through a private vendor instead of the General Services Administration and why it paid a contractor for private insurance, since the federal government is self-insured. The audit called on the bank to further explain the costs associated with both the vehicle and insurance.\n\nThe inspector general said it will produce a report in the future exploring the bank\u2019s lease of the car.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s watchdog conducted the audit to determine if the bank was adhering to the federal regulations and guidance that govern its contracting processes.\n\nIn addition to questions surrounding Ex-Im\u2019s lease of a luxury vehicle, the audit also found that the bank lacked the adequate internal controls needed to ensure the bank was adhering to federal contracting regulations.\n\nBecause of these issues, the bank made two duplicate payments totaling $304,462, which the bank recovered. It also spent $115,295, described as \u201cunnecessary costs,\u201d to train four contracted employees. The employees attended 14 Cisco training classes, which didn\u2019t cover programs unique to the bank and instead provided them with skills \u201cacquired in the general market place.\u201d\n\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nHochberg and other bank officials faced scrutiny in the past for their spending. In 2014, documents obtained by the House Financial Services Committee showed that Ex-Im officials exceeded their travel budget by $3 million from 2012 to 2014.\n\nIn 2012, the bank budgeted $1.7 million for travel expenses and ended up spending $2.7 million. In 2013, Ex-Im budgeted $1.2 million for travel and spent $2.2 million, and in 2014, the bank budgeted $1.3 million and expected its spending on travel to reach $2.3 million.\n\nIn response to the disclosure to the Financial Services Committee, Hochberg said travel was needed for both business development and to monitor \u201cefforts associated with a particular transition.\u201d\n\nThough for the majority of the bank\u2019s 81-year history it has existed largely without controversy, conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate have slowly begun to question its existence.\n\nArguing that Ex-Im is an engine of cronyism and corporate welfare, lawmakers like Hensarling who opposed the agency successfully mounted a campaign to allow its charter to expire. After a short-term reauthorization extended Ex-Im\u2019s lifespan from October 2014 to July 2015, the bank\u2019s charter lapsed for nearly five months this summer.\n\nCongress reauthorized the bank in December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An audit from the Ex-Im inspector general questioned whether the car was \"essential\" to the bank's mission.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An audit from the Ex-Im inspector general questioned whether the car was \"essential\" to the bank's mission.", "title": "Watchdog Questions Ex-Im Bank's $75K Luxury Vehicle Lease", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160413_ExImAudit_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T23:07:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1V220pQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An audit from the Ex-Im inspector general questioned whether the car was \"essential\" to the bank's mission.", "title": "Watchdog Questions Ex-Im Bank's $75K Luxury Vehicle Lease", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160413_ExImAudit_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2016-04-13T16:36:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T23:07:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Export-Import Bank Inspector General, General Services Administration, Fred Hochberg, House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0600\"", "article_summary": "The inspector general said it will produce a report in the future exploring the bank\u2019s lease of the car.\nAccording to the watchdog, Ex-Im\u2019s Office of Contracting Services provided the inspector general with justification for why the vehicle was leased.\nA new report from the Export-Import Bank\u2019s independent watchdog questions whether a five-year lease of a \u201cluxury vehicle\u201d that cost the agency more than $75,000 qualifies as \u201cessential\u201d to the bank\u2019s mission.\nThe audit doesn\u2019t describe what kind of vehicle Ex-Im leased.\nAccording to an audit conducted by the Export-Import Bank inspector general and released last month, the agency entered into a $75,622 five-year lease of a luxury vehicle intended to transport bank Chairman Fred Hochberg and staff."}
