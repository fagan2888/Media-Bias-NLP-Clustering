On Monday, she says, \u201cThe system will acknowledge for the first time that I exist.\u201d\n\nThe reason: New York City will unveil a new municipal ID program that could bring big changes for the city\u2019s large undocumented population. Though all residents will be eligible to apply for the new ID, called IDNYC, undocumented New Yorkers are expected to benefit most.\n\nThere are an estimated 500,000 undocumented immigrants in New York City, an underserved and, at times, exploited population that lives in the shadows of the city\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers.\n\nIn addition to a free one-year membership to the city\u2019s leading cultural institutions, the IDNYC card will provide undocumented immigrants with the ability to access state buildings and open bank accounts with a number of participating financial institutions. Those participating banks and credit unions will also be announced as early as Monday, according to city officials.\n\nAn ID card could be life changing for Lupe. She and her husband, both undocumented, have lived in Brooklyn\u2019s Bay Ridge neighborhood for more than a decade without the financial security of even a bank account.\n\n\n\nBanks, which require an ID for proof of residency, have turned away Lupe\u2019s Mexican passport as insufficient proof that she is a city resident. She says the isolation, in addition to the insecurity of living without an identity in a city that she and her family call home, has been trying.\n\nFor now, Lupe says the city\u2019s ID will provide her an immediate lifeline: \u201cThe ID will list my home address for those who question my status as a resident in this city.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically invisible in this city without proper identification,\u201d said Lupe, who refused to provide her surname due to her immigration status. \u201cMy husband and I work hard every day, we have children and the security that something as simple as an ID card will give us cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nWhen he ran for office, Mayor Bill De Blasio promised an overhaul to the city\u2019s immigration policies as part of his \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d campaign. The ID clearly represents a first step, says Betsy Plum, director of special projects at the New York Immigrant Coalition, a city-based advocacy group.\n\n\u201cSomething as simple as a form of identification could be a quality-of-life improvement for these New Yorkers,\u201d said Plum. \u201cFor example, if your employer unlawfully fires you and you want to contest it in court, you can\u2019t even get into a public building without an ID. There are real tangible benefits here.\u201d\n\nOne of those tangible benefits is legal protection from law enforcement in the case of an arrest, says Muzzaffar Chishti, an expert on US immigration policy who heads the office for the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based independent, non-partisan, nonprofit think tank, at New York University\u2019s School of Law.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re arrested by police, police want to know who you are. The card makes it easier for the police to release you,\u201d said Chishti.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Immigrant rights are a major issue in New York, as illustrated by this activist carrying a sign in Spanish reading \u2018We aren\u2019t criminals, we are workers\u2019.

The card will not grant city, state or federal benefits and, most importantly, will not be considered a work authorization permit, says Chishti.\n\nWhile he credits the ID as a symbolic gesture by the mayor that he intends to see through reforms to city immigration policy, he says the challenge ultimately remains to bring this underground workforce into the formal economy.\n\nOne solution could be President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, announced last November, which would grant temporary legal status to as many as five million undocumented immigrants across the country. In New York City alone, 155,000 residents will be eligible, city officials confirmed to the Guardian.\n\nAs US residents for over a decade and parents to two children born in the country and a third that qualifies for permanent residency under the Dream Act, Lupe and her husband would be eligible for the government\u2019s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, known as Dapa.\n\nThere are, however, both major legal and congressional obstacles to the reforms becoming law anytime soon. Governors in 24 states have sued Obama over his executive actions. If other states follow New York\u2019s lead, it could give both Obama and undocumented immigrants a reprieve from the hostility directed towards them. It is, however, a long shot.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "New IDNYC card, introduced in New York on Monday, will give undocumented immigrants an ID card to open bank accounts and enter federal buildings", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Daniel A Medina", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "New IDNYC card, introduced in New York on Monday, will give undocumented immigrants an ID card to open bank accounts and enter federal buildings", "title": "Undocumented immigrants in New York get ID cards to open bank accounts", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/12/undocumented-immigrants-id-cards-new-york", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/12/1421068253606/53590604-6de0-4cbf-bb84-f8b20e379318-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6aaf216e187b2e023a82069a78b1a674", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/12/undocumented-immigrants-id-cards-new-york?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/12/undocumented-immigrants-id-cards-new-york", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/12/undocumented-immigrants-id-cards-new-york?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/12/1421068253606/53590604-6de0-4cbf-bb84-f8b20e379318-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/12/undocumented-immigrants-id-cards-new-york?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US personal finance,Banking,New York,US news,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-01-12T13:47:56.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-medina", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T15:55:09.000Z", "tag": "US personal finance,Banking,New York,US news,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/12/1421068253606/53590604-6de0-4cbf-bb84-f8b20e379318-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=f51b6f40fb469cdf3f2f4b66a814483f", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "US personal finance,Banking,New York,US news,World news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca11e\"", "article_summary": "There are an estimated 500,000 undocumented immigrants in New York City, an underserved and, at times, exploited population that lives in the shadows of the city\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers.\nIn New York City alone, 155,000 residents will be eligible, city officials confirmed to the Guardian.\nIn addition to a free one-year membership to the city\u2019s leading cultural institutions, the IDNYC card will provide undocumented immigrants with the ability to access state buildings and open bank accounts with a number of participating financial institutions.\nThough all residents will be eligible to apply for the new ID, called IDNYC, undocumented New Yorkers are expected to benefit most.\nAn ID card could be life changing for Lupe."}
