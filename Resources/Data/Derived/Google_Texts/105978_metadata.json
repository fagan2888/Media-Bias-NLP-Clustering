Whatever the case, Team Bernie seems to be working from some long-expired premises about the nature of the Southern electorate, which today is neither white nor conservative.\n\nFirst, the argument goes, the senator has momentum. \u201cAnd having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people, and doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we\u2019re going to win this nomination,\u201d said Sanders near the conclusion of Thursday\u2019s debate in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSecond, this is why \u201csuperdelegates\u201d\u2014uncommitted delegates who can support either candidate\u2014should back the senator if Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t win the nomination outright. \u201cNobody is going to arrive in Philadelphia with enough delegates to win the nomination,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Jeff Weaver in an interview with NPR. \u201c[I]t looks like the Democrats are going into an open convention as well.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a problem. Even if Clinton doesn\u2019t reach the delegate threshold, she\u2019ll likely still have more votes and delegates than Sanders. To throw the nomination to the runner-up using superdelegates would be to play the same undemocratic game he decried earlier in the process.\n\nBut Team Sanders has a response. \u201cHer grasp now on the nomination is almost entirely on the basis of victories where Bernie Sanders did not compete,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine in a March conference call with reporters, listing eight states in the South: Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas. Clinton, Devine continued, \u201chas emerged as a weak frontrunner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know,\u201d said Bernie Sanders on Wednesday, responding to Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore, who asked if he thought the process was \u201crigged,\u201d \u201cpeople say, \u2018Why does Iowa go first, why does New Hampshire go first?\u2019 but I think that having so many Southern states go first kind of distorts reality as well.\u201d He continued, pivoting to superdelegates, \u201cWhen a lot of these so-called superdelegates begin to see which candidate is the strongest candidate \u2026 I think some of these guys are going to be coming our way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSanders took this line again at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cLook, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That\u2019s the fact.\u201d\n\nBetween the three statements, the Sanders argument is clear: Yes, Hillary Clinton has more votes and more delegates, and will likely have more votes and more delegates when voting ends. But she won those votes and those delegates in conservative states where Sanders was weak and didn\u2019t compete. If you ignore them\u2014or at least, if you give them an asterisk\u2014then she\u2019s weaker than she looks. So far, so good, right?\n\nNot at all.\n\nThe typical Southern Democrat of 2016 is black; the typical Southern Democratic voter is a black woman in middle age.\n\nTo start, this is a bit hypocritical. Sanders has won seven of the past eight contests, but four of those wins came in states so Republican that they\u2019ve backed a Democrat only once in the past 60 years: Idaho, Utah, Alaska, and Wyoming. If the South\u2019s conservatism is reason to discount Clinton\u2019s success there, then the same is true for Sanders vis a vis his wins in the Mountain West and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the simple fact that the primary calendar did not begin with the Deep South, which usually includes Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and adjacent parts in other states, like the Florida panhandle, East Texas, and parts of Tennessee. The only Deep South states that voted in the first few weeks were Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. Other Southern states, like Virginia, Arkansas, and Tennessee, were a little more hospitable to Sanders.\n\nIf the argument is that Sanders would have done better under a different calendar, that doesn\u2019t hold up, either. The most diverse states with representative populations and general-election significance\u2014Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, Illinois\u2014are also friendly to Clinton. And broadly, a primary scheme that starts with large states is also one that disadvantages insurgent candidates like Sanders, who don\u2019t begin the process with the same resources and support. That the Democratic primaries began with Iowa and New Hampshire was a great stroke of luck for Sanders, given his coalition and early challenges.\n\nWhich gets to the largest\u2014and most troubling\u2014problem with the \u201cDeep South\u201d arguments from Bernie Sanders and his campaign. In the popular imagination, Southern Democrats are still \u201cgood \u2019ol boys\u201d and wealthy elites\u2014the Bill Clintons and (for a fictional version) the Frank Underwoods of the world. In reality, those Democrats have long since died or left the party. The typical Southern Democrat of 2016\u2014and of 2008, and even of 2004\u2014is black; the typical Southern Democratic voter is a black woman in middle age; and the Democratic electorate in the Deep South is largely black.\n\nThe primaries bear this out. In South Carolina, blacks were 61 percent of all voters. In Alabama, they were 54 percent; in Georgia, 51 percent; in Mississippi, 71 percent. We don\u2019t have exit polls for Louisiana, but given its large black population and racially polarized politics, it\u2019s a reasonable guess that most of the Democratic voters in that primary were black as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAt the same time that the Democratic Party of the South has become, for the most part, a black party, the ideological distance between congressional Democrats in the North and South has also shrunk, with little difference between the two. The reason is straightforward. Across racial and economic issues, black Americans are more liberal, as a group, than their white counterparts, and this is reflected in their choice of representatives, who stand on the left side of the House Democratic Caucus. Blacks are more conservative on social issues\u2014a function of high religiosity\u2014but those are less salient than economic and civil rights concerns. Black voters are far from a monolith\u2014as evidenced by Sanders\u2019 significant support among young black voters and slightly higher support among blacks outside the South\u2014but dismissing the South is dismissing where they hold the most significance.\n\nAgain, the primary results give a glimpse into the ideological composition of the Democratic South. In the states with the largest black voting populations\u2014South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi\u2014an average of 54 percent of voters identify as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d liberal. For the four of the whitest primary states\u2014Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont and Washington\u2014that number is 67 percent. Sanders\u2019 geographic base is more liberal than Clinton\u2019s, but it\u2019s a difference of degree, not of kind. It is also true, as Phillip Bump demonstrates for the Washington Post, that on questions of government and its role in society, Democrats agree regardless of region. On the issue where Sanders is most liberal, Southern Democrats are no less likely to agree than any of their peers.\n\nAs long as you grasp that Southern Democrats are black ones, this is easy to understand, albeit inconvenient for Team Sanders\u2019 claim that he is the actual choice of the Democratic base.\n\nIt is too much to say that Sanders is deliberately dismissing black voters. But that\u2019s the effect of his argument, and the impact goes beyond the Democratic primary. The rise of the black Southern Democrat is also the decline of the white one. There was a time when black politicians in the South could govern with white ones to reach common goals. It\u2019s gone. Now, in Republican-dominated Southern states, blacks are almost shut out of power. It\u2019s how we get voter-suppression laws North Carolina. It\u2019s why the Medicaid expansion\u2014funded under the Affordable Care Act\u2014is still absent from most of the states of the former Confederacy.\n\nWorse, because they live in red states, most black Southern Democrats are ignored in the general presidential election, and get little attention in off-year races. The Democratic presidential primary is the one time, once every four years, when they have a voice, and it\u2019s a powerful one. To dismiss it is to disrespect the most loyal and perhaps most vital part of the Democratic coalition\u2014a group that sustains progressive politics in some of the most reactionary parts of the country.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The typical Southern Democratic voter is neither white nor conservative.", "fb-share": "The typical Southern Democratic voter is neither white nor conservative.", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "As the Democratic primary turns into its final stretch, Bernie Sanders, his advisers, and his surrogates are making a three-step argument to remaining  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "As the Democratic primary turns into its final stretch, Bernie Sanders, his advisers, and his surrogates are making a three-step argument to remaining  ...", "title": "Why Bernie Sanders Is Wrong About the Deep South", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_deep_south_excuse_doesn_t_hold_up.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/160415_POL_bernie-deep-south.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the Democratic primary turns into its final stretch, Bernie Sanders, his advisers, and his surrogates are making a three-step argument to remaining  ...", "title": "Why Bernie Sanders Is Wrong About the Deep South", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_deep_south_excuse_doesn_t_hold_up.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/160415_POL_bernie-deep-south.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@jbouie", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-18T17:22:49Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why Bernie Sanders Is Wrong About the Deep South", "sailthru.headline": "Why Bernie Sanders Is Wrong About the Deep South", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why Bernie Sanders Is Wrong About the Deep South\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/bernie_sanders_deep_south_excuse_doesn_t_hold_up.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/160415_POL_bernie-deep-south.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100160418014\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2016-04-18T17:22:49Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Jamelle Bouie\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"2016 campaign\",\n    \"dem primary 2016\",\n    \"bernie sanders\",\n    \"race\",\n    \"hillary clinton\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Why Bernie Sanders is wrong about the Deep South:", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "bernie sanders, bernie sanders deep south, bernie sanders black voters, bernie sanders race", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "bernie sanders, bernie sanders deep south, bernie sanders black voters, bernie sanders race", "sailthru.description": "As the Democratic primary turns into its final stretch, Bernie Sanders, his advisers, and his surrogates are making a three-step argument to remaining  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/160415_POL_bernie-deep-south.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b08\"", "article_summary": "The only Deep South states that voted in the first few weeks were Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana.\nWhich gets to the largest\u2014and most troubling\u2014problem with the \u201cDeep South\u201d arguments from Bernie Sanders and his campaign.\nThe typical Southern Democrat of 2016 is black; the typical Southern Democratic voter is a black woman in middle age.\nOn the issue where Sanders is most liberal, Southern Democrats are no less likely to agree than any of their peers.\nWorse, because they live in red states, most black Southern Democrats are ignored in the general presidential election, and get little attention in off-year races."}
