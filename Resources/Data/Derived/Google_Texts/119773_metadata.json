Ted Cruz, said on Thursday they\u2019re still looking for answers.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, chaired by Cruz, on Wednesday questioned IRS Commissioner John Koskinen about the agency\u2019s cooperation with investigations, and rehashed accusations of a White House conspiracy to target conservative groups.\n\n\u201cThe American people have a right to be angry when an instrument of the american government is used a partisan cudgel,\u201d said Cruz, a 2016 presidential candidate running on abolishing the IRS. \u201cI have to say, Richard Nixon\u2019s ghost must have been smiling.\u201d\n\nA 2014 Inspector General report found that the IRS used inappropriate criteria to scrutinize conservative 501(c)4 non-profit groups, and several Congressional and executive investigations are still ongoing.\n\nCruz has convened similar hearings on issues he\u2019s fought as a senator and emphasizes as a candidate, like the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings to preserve Obamacare and establish nationwide same-sex marriage.\n\nBut this hearing comes as House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, called for Koskinen\u2019s firing. Chaffetz claims Koskinen lied to Congress about and failed to hand over emails exchanged by Lois Lerner\u2013IRS\u2019 former head of exempt organizations\u2013during the targeting.\n\nKoskinen said Thursday the initial targeting was \u201ctotally inappropriate, it shouldn\u2019t have happened, and it shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nKoskinen insisted he\u2019s has done his best to comply with Congressional investigations and told the truth as he knew it during Congressional testimony. He also said the IRS has turned over 1.3 million documents, and that staff had testified before Congress around 30 times and sat for 52 interviews.\n\nKoskinen also said the agency audits 1 million people each year, none of which for political reasons.\n\n\u201cSome will be Democrats. Some will be Republicans. Some will go to church. Some won\u2019t, and none of it makes any difference,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on Cruz\u2019s accusation of a White House conspiracy .\n\n\u201cThese are very serious allegations. There are also unfounded allegations,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the subcommittee\u2019s chief Democrat.\n\nWhile some Democrats said the initial IRS targeting was wrong, they claimed they problem was born from the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. FEC, which unleashed a flood of outside money.\n\nNon-profit 501(c)4 groups earn tax-exempt status by advocating for social good\u2013however they define it\u2013but are barred from participating in elections. Even so, the IRS allows 501(c)4 groups to spend money less than 50 percent of their money on political causes.\n\nCitizens United left the \u201cIRS to stand in the place of the Federal Election Commission,\u201d said Coons.\n\nCoons and his Democratic colleagues also called on the IRS to establish clearer, more easily enforceable rules to regulate 501(c)4 groups.\n\nAfter nearly two hours of questioning Koskinen, the subcommittee heard from conservative activists who said they were targeted by the IRS.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, president and co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said countless attendees at rallies came up to her with \u201ctears in their eyes, fear in their voice and an envelope from the IRS in their hands.\u201d\n\nThe IRS \u201cran roughshod over the fundamental rights of speech and association enshrined in the Constitution,\u201d said Martin. \u201cFree speech in America should never be silenced, no matter what the dollar amount.\u201d\n\nOther panelists called on the IRS to crackdown on political cash flowing through non-profits.\n\n\u201cThe IRS should hold political groups on the right and the left accountable if they misappropriate the privileges of the social welfare organization\u2019s structure,\u201d said Stephen Spaulding, policy council for Common Cause\u2013a liberal non-profit devoted to government transparency\u2013according to prepared remarks. \u201cIt continues to be wrong for the IRS to look the other way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy90ZWQtY3J1ei1wcmVzc2VzLWlycy1jb21taXNzaW9uZXItb24tbm9uLXByb2ZpdC10YXJnZXRpbmcuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--It's been two years since the IRS targeting scandal broke, but Senate Republicans, led by Sen.
