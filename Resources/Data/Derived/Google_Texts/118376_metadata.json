Instead he was wearing a navy blue and red National League all-star jersey \u2014 and with a \u201cC\u201d on the chest.\n\nTulowitzki was named captain of the NL team for the Home Run Derby, scheduled for July 14th at Target Field in Minneapolis, one day before the All-Star Game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you dream of as a kid, to participate in it,\u201d Tulowitzki said. As captain \u2014 he is joined by Toronto\u2019s Jose Bautista \u2014 Tulowitzki is charged with picking a team of five hitters, including himself, for the derby.\n\n\u201cTo be the captain, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something I\u2019m looking forward to because of how tough the decisions are going to be,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put everybody that wants to participate on your team.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki said he will start by considering Miami\u2019s Giancarlo Stanton, the Dodgers\u2019 Yasiel Puig and Colorado teammate Justin Morneau, a former long-time player for the Twins.\n\n\u201cI have to talk to Justin and see if he\u2019s interested in doing that,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cFor him to be in Minnesota, that would be great for him, for what he\u2019s done for that town.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki\u2019s 18 home runs ranks second in the NL behind Stanton\u2019s 20. Cincinnati\u2019s Todd Frazier is third with 17.\n\nTulowitzki said he\u2019s not considering bowing out of the contest to rest.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an excuse for players at times who have a bad second half, to say, \u2018Oh, I had a bad Home Run Derby,'\u201d he said. \u201d You take a look during BP, sometimes I\u2019ll go out there and try to hit a home run on every single pitch, so it\u2019s no different from being in Home Run Derby.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki, Jose Bautista named captains for MLB Home Run Derby", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki, Jose Bautista named captains for MLB Home Run Derby", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/23/troy-tulowitzki-jose-bautista-named-captains-for-mlb-home-run-derby/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140503__troy-tulowitzkip1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140503__troy-tulowitzkip1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T17:30:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:19:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Tulowitzki"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36b7\"", "article_summary": "\u201d You take a look during BP, sometimes I\u2019ll go out there and try to hit a home run on every single pitch, so it\u2019s no different from being in Home Run Derby.\u201d\nTulowitzki was named captain of the NL team for the Home Run Derby, scheduled for July 14th at Target Field in Minneapolis, one day before the All-Star Game.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an excuse for players at times who have a bad second half, to say, \u2018Oh, I had a bad Home Run Derby,'\u201d he said.\nAs captain \u2014 he is joined by Toronto\u2019s Jose Bautista \u2014 Tulowitzki is charged with picking a team of five hitters, including himself, for the derby.\nTroy Tulowitzki walked around Rockies batting practice Monday at Coors Field, but not in a Rockies jersey."}
