The the organization says it did nothing wrong, and a post-Thanksgiving tragedy is recasting the debate.\n\nA gunman killed two civilians and a responding police officer at a Colorado branch of Planned Parenthood on Friday. The shooter reportedly mentioned \u201cbaby parts\u201d after his arrest, kicking off a round of political finger-pointing over GOP rhetoric against the organization.\n\nSEE ALSO: New law facilitates military dogs\u2019 return to U.S., adoption by battlefield handlers\n\n\u201cWe as leaders must be mindful of our words and our actions,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat. \u201cWhipping people into a frenzy of hate and anger while providing them with easy access to firearms has proven disastrous in this country.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Mr. McCarthy downplayed the idea of using must-pass spending legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, instead highlighting a select committee that is investigating how the organization and abortion providers harvest and transfer fetal issue. He also pointed to the alleged gunman\u2019s mental state.\n\n\u201cThe thing that drove him the most was he was a very evil, crazy man,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a weeklong Thanksgiving vacation, lawmakers were back at work Monday with an eye on Dec. 18, which is when the House is slated to finish up for the year. Even before than, they must meet a Dec. 11 deadline when current government funding expires.\n\nAlso on the three-week schedule are votes to override Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules, an effort to repeal major parts of Obamacare and to strip funding from Planned Parenthood using a fast-track budget tool that can avoid a Democratic filibuster, and votes on the final education and highway deals.\n\nThe education agreement keeps federal math and reading standards in place, but leaves it up to states to decide how to measure students\u2019 performance in working toward those standards.\n\n\u201cThese represent significant accomplishments for the new Congress and significant wins for the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said. \u201cSome pundits said Washington could never take these issues on at all, but we did.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell was walking his troops late Monday through the fast-track process, known as budget reconciliation, they hope will get a repeal of parts of Obamacare to the president\u2019s desk. Mr. Obama would still use his veto to kill it, but it would be the first time a major repeal has at least cleared Congress.\n\nBut the fast-track legislation also includes provisions to defund Planned Parenthood, which doesn\u2019t sit well with a few moderate GOP senators. Some conservatives, meanwhile, complain that the bill doesn\u2019t fully repeal Obamacare, meaning the Senate GOP may struggle to get the necessary votes from its conference.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said the package will be \u201cbigger and better\u201d than what the House sent over.\n\nLawmakers offered few details ahead of the formal release of a plan by Mr. McConnell but said the latest iteration would retain the Planned Parenthood defunding provision. It includes language to phase out Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion over the next two years so that beneficiaries aren\u2019t left out in the cold when Republicans try to replace the law with a new president in 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged,\u201d said Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican who had pledged to vote \u201cno\u201d unless the package went further than the House bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday he expects Congress to navigate a thorny debate over national security and abortion politics and strike a deal to keep federal operations moving past Dec. 11.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday he expects Congress to navigate a thorny debate over national security and abortion politics and strike a deal to keep federal operations moving past Dec. 11.", "title": "Kevin McCarthy: Congress will avoid shutdown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/30/kevin-mccarthy-congress-will-avoid-shutdown/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/KevinMcCarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/KevinMcCarthy.jpg", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday he expects Congress to navigate a thorny debate over national security and abortion politics and strike a deal to keep federal operations moving past D", "card": "summary", "title": "Kevin McCarthy: Congress will avoid shutdown"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "A gunman killed two civilians and a responding police officer at a Colorado branch of Planned Parenthood on Friday.\nBut the fast-track legislation also includes provisions to defund Planned Parenthood, which doesn\u2019t sit well with a few moderate GOP senators.\nLawmakers offered few details ahead of the formal release of a plan by Mr. McConnell but said the latest iteration would retain the Planned Parenthood defunding provision.\n\u201cI do not see a shutdown happening,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, told reporters \u2014 though he declined to say how he and his fellow leaders would handle calls from rank-and-file Republicans for fights over the thorny issues.\n\u201cThese represent significant accomplishments for the new Congress and significant wins for the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said."}
