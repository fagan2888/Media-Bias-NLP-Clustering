Anthony Sykes (R), stipulates that \u201cthe State Board of Health shall require a blood test for the discovery of syphilis and other communicable or infectious diseases prior to the issuance of a marriage license.\u201d In order to obtain the license, the couple would need to submit a certificate or affidavit from a licensed physician that confirms neither of them are infected with a disease that \u201cmay be communicable to the marriage partner.\u201d\n\nAs the bill is currently written, if either partner tests positive, they may not be permitted to get married.\n\nSome of Sykes\u2019 colleagues support the legislation because they believe it will help ensure that people know their STD status. \u201cWe have to look at that as a society whether we want people who have communicable diseases, they need to know if they have it, and I think this is a mechanism to provide them to do that,\u201d Sen. Kyle Loveless (R), who acknowledged the legislation likely needs some tweaks, told NEWS 9.\n\nLegal experts in the state are concerned that the legislation would go too far to infringe on Americans\u2019 private medical information, which is supposed to be protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If people are required to file these documents with the court clerk before getting married, the results of their STD test would become public information.\n\nAccording to federal health officials, the United States does face an ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted infections. The rates of STDs in this country are higher than in any other industrialized country in the world, something that incurs an estimated $16 billion in direct medical costs annually.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear how requiring STD tests before a marriage ceremony would address the issue. The vast majority of Americans have sex before marriage, a trend that\u2019s remained constant for decades. Even most evangelical Christians aren\u2019t waiting. Plus, the average marriage ages for Americans are rising \u2014 to about 27 for women and 29 for men \u2014 at the same time as new STD infections are disproportionately concentrated among young people between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nMedical experts have other ideas about how to effectively address STD rates. Researchers and doctors recommend starting comprehensive sex ed classes at an earlier age and providing free condoms in high schools. Nonetheless, Senate Bill 733 has been referred to Oklahoma\u2019s Judiciary Committee for further review.\n\nMany states used to require blood tests to check both partners for venereal disease or measles before they wed, but the practice has largely been eliminated. Just a small handful of states still ask for blood work as part of the marriage license application.\n\nOklahoma lawmakers are currently trying to regulate marriage in other ways, too. This week, a legislative committee approved a bill that would punish local or state employees for issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as well as prohibit taxpayer dollars from going toward any activities that support marriage equality.\n\nThe state has also recently sparked considerable controversy over a proposed measure that would ban Advanced Placement U.S. History classes and instead require students to focus on a list of \u201cfoundational documents\u201d \u2014 including the Ten Commandments, two sermons, and three speeches delivered by Ronald Reagan.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If either partner tests positive, they may not be allowed to say \"I do.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "If either partner tests positive, they may not be allowed to say \"I do.\"", "title": "Oklahoma Bill Would Make Couples Prove They Don\u2019t Have STDs Before Getting Married", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/20/3625080/oklahoma-std-marriage-bill/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_119177737.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If either partner tests positive, they may not be allowed to say \"I do.\"", "title": "Oklahoma Bill Would Make Couples Prove They Don\u2019t Have STDs Before Getting Married", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_119177737-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_119177737.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_119177737.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-20T09:07:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s unclear how requiring STD tests before a marriage ceremony would address the issue.\nIf people are required to file these documents with the court clerk before getting married, the results of their STD test would become public information.\nSome of Sykes\u2019 colleagues support the legislation because they believe it will help ensure that people know their STD status.\nAccording to federal health officials, the United States does face an ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted infections.\nJust a small handful of states still ask for blood work as part of the marriage license application."}
