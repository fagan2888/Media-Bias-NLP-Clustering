This is one of the main avenues of getting to the beach,\" said Lieutenant Warden.\n\nAlthough the FHP conducts these check points routinely, Lieutenant Warden says spring break is an important time to raise awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.\n\n\"We're getting a good cross reference of everyone that comes to this part of the state and the specific purpose is to have a party and so with that being said drinking is part of that and we try to encourage safety and responsible drinking,\" said Lieutenant Warden.\n\nThE FHP has also brought 15 additional troopers onto the beach and local law enforcement is also beefing up its staff.\n\nPanama City Beach Police is getting additional help from the Bay County Sheriff's Office, Panama City Police, and Washington County.\n\n\"We go from a population of 14,000 people during a normal year with some visitors coming and going to we'll have anywhere from 100 to 200 thousand kids here the next few weeks, so, I have to increase it to make sure my community is safe, my residents are safe, and the visitors are safe,\" said Panama City Beach Police Chief, Drew Whitman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spring break attracts thousands of people to our beaches every year, but more visitors also mean more people on the roads, that's why the Florida Highway Patrol is making it's presence known in Panama City Beach.", "language": "english", "author": "Kelly Baumgarten", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Florida-Highway-Patrol-is-Cracking-Down-on-Drinking--Driving-295451491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/checkpoint11.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Spring break attracts thousands of people to our beaches every year, but more visitors also mean more people on the roads, that's why the Florida Highway Patrol is making it's presence known in Panama City Beach.", "title": "Florida Highway Patrol is Cracking Down on Drinking & Driving"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spring break attracts thousands of people to our beaches every year, but more visitors also mean more people on the roads, that's why the Florida Highway Patrol is making it's presence known in Panama City Beach.", "title": "Florida Highway Patrol is Cracking Down on Drinking & Driving", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Florida-Highway-Patrol-is-Cracking-Down-on-Drinking--Driving-295451491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/checkpoint11.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Florida Highway Patrol is Cracking Down on Drinking & Driving", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Florida Highway Patrol is Cracking, Down on Drinking  Driving"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca05e\"", "article_summary": "Panama City Beach Police is getting additional help from the Bay County Sheriff's Office, Panama City Police, and Washington County.\nSpring break attracts thousands of people to our beaches every year, but more visitors also mean more people on the roads, that's why the Florida Highway Patrol is making it's presence known in Panama City Beach.\nAlthough the FHP conducts these check points routinely, Lieutenant Warden says spring break is an important time to raise awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.\nThis is one of the main avenues of getting to the beach,\" said Lieutenant Warden.\nMaking the decision to get behind the wheel after a night of partying could cost you your life, or someone else's."}
