Their workouts become the sporting equivalent of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Every movement is scrutinized. Every wrinkle examined, every mood analyzed.\n\nJameis Winston and Marcus Mariota delivered in their performances at Lucas Oil Stadium. Winston provided energy and leadership in drills and threw exceptionally well, displaying touch and accuracy. Mariota showed elite athleticism and better footwork on drops than expected.\n\nThey headlined the event. John Elway did not when he was the top player in the country.\n\nFunny story about that.\n\nBack in 1983, regional combines provided platforms for players, not a single centralized event. Elway had no plans to attend. That\u2019s when things became weird. He flew to Seattle for an award ceremony. Turns out the banquet and combine hotel were one in the same. Elway picks up the story from here.\n\n\u201cI was going to a Gold Helmet award deal in Seattle, and they were checking all the guys into the combine at the same time. I was checking in for the event, and they grabbed me and checked me into the combine,\u201d Elway said last week. \u201cThen I called my dad and said, \u2018Dad there\u2019s a combine up here. I didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u2019 He told me to go the banquet that night and get up early the next morning and get a cab and get a cab to the airport. I was up at 5:30, and left.\u201d\n\nSo let history show that Elway checked in, but did not attend. He joked that he didn\u2019t want the evaluators to see his bad knee, admitting he would be \u201ckilled now\u201d by the media if he skipped the combine as the draft\u2019s top player. Elway understands the newfound attention for the combine, but defends quarterbacks who do limited work at the event.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have a Pro Day,\u201d Elway said. \u201cYou can see them there just as easily.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jameis Winston,John Elway,Marcus Mariota,NFL combine", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "John Elway almost attended a regional NFL combine when he was the top player in the 1983 draft.
