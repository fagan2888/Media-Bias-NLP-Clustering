It is a timely choice because many readers across the country have just completed my 21-day financial fast, which required them to give up using credit and cut their consumer spending to only the things they really needed.\n\nNow that they\u2019ve finished, many participants have asked, what\u2019s next? You would be advised to follow Soaries\u2019 program, which he calls \u201cdfree.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumer debt grips millions of people with plastic shackles every bit as powerful as the iron chains that once bound slaves,\u201d he writes. \u201cA bold, even audacious, statement, I know, particularly considering the historical atrocities of slavery in our country. As a descendant of some of those slaves, I do not make this analogy without recognizing the gravity of its implications.\u201d\n\nAs a lifelong loather of all debt, I like Soaries\u2019 boldness to call out a situation that we\u2019ve tolerated as normal for far too long.\n\nLast summer, the Pew Charitable Trusts issued a report titled \u201cThe Complex Story of American Debt\u201d that explored household debt.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest shifts in American families\u2019 balance sheets over the past 30 years has been the growing use of credit and households\u2019 subsequent indebtedness,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn the years leading up to the Great Recession, the average household at the middle of the wealth ladder more than doubled its mortgage debt. Although Americans\u2019 debt has decreased since then, housing \u2014 which still is the largest liability for most households \u2014 and other debt remain higher than they were in the 1990s, and student loan obligations have continued to grow.\u201d\n\nThe jump in the use of debt has not kept pace with household income, according to Pew.\n\nConsider the following statement from the report: \u201cDebt is particularly problematic for low-income households, whose liabilities grew far faster than their income in the aftermath of the recession: Their debt was equal to just one-fifth of their income in 2007, but that proportion had ballooned to half by 2013.\u201d\n\nBut despite the many drawbacks of debt, the report concluded that, for younger Americans in particular, \u201csustainable debt can be a positive force for ... economic mobility and financial security.\u201d\n\nHow about the unsustainable debt that many are accumulating?\n\nIt\u2019s time for emancipation, says Soaries, who admits he too was \u201censlaved.\u201d He fell into a 15-year cycle of interest and late-payment penalties. It once took him eight years of minimum credit card payments to pay off a $400 sofa. \u201cI was preaching about going to heaven but was heading deeper and deeper into financial hell.\u201d\n\nTo get to a place where debt isn\u2019t ruling your life, you have to have a plan. \u201cFinancial freedom does not happen accidentally or overnight; it happens as the cumulative effect of consistent, deliberate decisions we make each day,\u201d Soaries writes.\n\nThe dfree plan consists of four levels:\n\nGet started. You can\u2019t change what you don\u2019t acknowledge. Don\u2019t deny there\u2019s a debt problem. \u201cTo be free of deficit living means we live within our means and eliminate the need to close our spending gaps by using high-interest credit cards or, even worse, alternative financial services such as payday loans, pawnshops and rent-to-own schemes,\u201d Soaries writes.\n\nGet control. Would you build a home without a blueprint? To pay off your debts, you\u2019ll need a budget. You have to pull together your financial documents so that you can see where you truly stand. Most important, you need to figure out what emotional triggers contributed to your amassing debt.\n\nGet ahead. On this level, you\u2019ll be moving from being behind to saving, investing and estate planning.\n\nGive back. Once you\u2019re free, help deliver someone else to freedom.\n\nIn addition to the book, you can find more information at mydfree.org. \u201cMy hope is that this book can become your personal emancipation proclamation from financial slavery,\u201d Soaries writes.\n\nI\u2019ll be hosting a live online discussion about Say Yes to No Debt at 11 a.m. on Feb. 25 at washingtonpost.com/discussions. Soaries will be joining me and taking your questions.\n\nSome debt might be necessary, but don\u2019t resign yourself to a lifetime of bondage.
