And a typical woman who works full-time loses half a million dollars over her lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe survey, which included responses from both union and non-union members, also found that 59 percent of women reported being the primary breadwinner, earning between 51 and 100 percent of the household income.\n\nThe AFL-CIO hopes the survey results will push the presidential candidates to put forth agendas focused on working women that include strategies to close the pay gap.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not talking about equal pay, you\u2019re just not relevant to working women,\u201d Shuler said.\n\nThough she did not name specifically name Democratic front-runner, Rep.
