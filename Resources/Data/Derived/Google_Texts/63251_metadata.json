He had been a police officer since 2007.\n\nBarrister Andrew Hoare said his client had a difficult childhood marred by violence, family separation and the foster care system.\n\nHe said despite that, McFarlane built a career in the police service and was an otherwise upstanding member of the community.\n\nMr Hoare said McFarlane\u2019s relationship had broken down since his arrest and his career was in tatters.\n\nHe said his client was deliberately put in a suicide smock in the city watchhouse to intimidate him, and was subjected to taunts by other police, but the claims were refuted by Ms Wooldridge.\n\nMr Hoare said McFarlane\u2019s original bail conditions, which included a curfew, were overly onerous.\n\nJudge Botting was critical that police opted to arrest McFarlane rather than issue him with a Notice to Appear date for his first court appearance.\n\n\u201cI have expressed some disquiet in the course of submissions as to why that should have been done instead of him being given a Notice to Appear. I still express that disquiet,\u201d he said in sentencing.\n\nHe said a psychological report revealed McFarlane had depression, anxiety and was a low risk of reoffending.\n\nJudge Botting said denunciation and deterrence was crucial.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "A FORMER police officer has been jailed for sexually assaulting two women in bizarre separate incidents that shook their trust in Queensland police and left them psychologically traumatised.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/offduty-cop-traumatised-female-neighbours-with-sexual-assaults/news-story/9d8f3de3a377cba9e64060a99d5f3ff6", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cf86899a584e390f81e3e1503c002c75", "type": "article", "description": "A FORMER police officer has been jailed for sexually assaulting two women in bizarre separate incidents that shook their trust in Queensland police and left them psychologically traumatised.", "title": "Cop traumatised female neighbours"}, "twitter": {"site": "@couriermail", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cf86899a584e390f81e3e1503c002c75", "description": "A FORMER police officer has been jailed for sexually assaulting two women in bizarre separate incidents that shook their trust in Queensland police and left them psychologically traumatised.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cop traumatised female neighbours"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/9d8f3de3a377cba9e64060a99d5f3ff6?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "9d8f3de3a377cba9e64060a99d5f3ff6", "keywords": "female neighbours, off-duty cop, police service, police officer, outside court, sexual assaults, told police stories, foster care system, court appearance, bail conditions, lounge room, Crown prosecutor, family separation, city watchhouse, suicide smock, Queensland, Australia, Logan Traffic Branch, Jodie Wooldridge, David Edward McFarlane, Andrew Hoare, Judge Hugh Botting", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T07:41:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T07:52:15.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6ce3\"", "article_summary": "She said the woman told McFarlane numerous times to \u201cf--- off\u201d but he persisted until she could wrangle herself free.\nBut Ms Wooldridge said the woman asked McFarlane to remove the binds when he instead reached into her clothing and touched her.\nDavid Edward McFarlane, 38, pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court today to sexually assaulting two female neighbours in their homes while he was off-duty in March 2012 and May 2013.\nMr Hoare said McFarlane\u2019s relationship had broken down since his arrest and his career was in tatters.\nMs Wooldridge said the sexual assault lasted for around 15 minutes and only stopped when it was interrupted by a ringing phone."}
