Authorities say a University of Oklahoma student from China is dead and another was injured after a car went off a 200-foot cliff on an Arizona highway.

The state Department of Public Safety says the man driving the car was killed and a male passenger survived the plunge but was injured.

Their identities were not released.

According to CBS 5 News in Phoenix, Arizona, the students were following another vehicle, and when the first car made a curve in the road, the other did not.

CBS 5 News reported that the people in the first car hiked down to the victims and called authorities.

DPS spokesman Bart Graves says the car may have been going too fast to make a curve on State Route 88.

Graves says the accident occurred on a drive to gaze at stars, and that the students were visiting a friend at Arizona State University.
