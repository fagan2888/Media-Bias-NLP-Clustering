Inexperience and injuries along the offensive line and in the backfield stagnated the offense in the first two games as it generated just seven points.\n\nIn the last two games, the Tigers have posted 24 points and 35 points with Nethercot finding his rhythm in the passing game.\n\nAgainst Central, he completed 23 of 24 passes for 311 yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\"I'm just sticking to my guns, reading the defense, trusting my coaches,\" Nethercot said. \"Our offensive line is always working their butts off.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgainst the Wildcats, Nethercot hooked up with senior receiver Zach Manchester 10 times for 140 yards and three touchdowns. Manchester was being defended all night in press coverage by Central's standout Michael Ranson.\n\n\"It was nice to see them pressing,\" Nethercot said. \"Zach gets off the line so quick; he's got a great release.\"\n\nJunior Brandon Farnsworth hauled in five passes for 65 yards and two touchdowns. Junior Dacian Sullivan caught five passes for 73 yards, while senior Lucas Bufmack snagged two passes for 24 yards.\n\nIn the running department, Kadin Porter returned from an injury and gained 49 yards on nine carries.\n\nIn addition to his teammates, Nethercot credits his offensive coordinator Chris Coppa and his older brother, Logan, for helping his cause.\n\n\"Coach Coppa is always giving me opportunities to be successful,\" Nethercot said. \"He's a great offensive coordinator. Logan always tells me I'm a great quarterback and just to do what I know how to do.\"\n\nLogan played quarterback for the Tigers and wore the No. 16 jersey, the same one as Luke.\n\nDespite having an 0-4 record, Nethercot is confident is team can turn things around and make a run at the playoffs.\n\n\"Everyone will continue to work hard, and if we win out, we should make the playoffs,\" he said.\n\nThe Tigers wrap up nonleague play Friday with a game at Air Academy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28887463/tigers-quarterback-luke-nethercot-learned-how-be-leader", "modificationDate": "2015-09-27T20:26:41-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0905/20140905_112334_Luke Nethercot mug_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Troy Schwindt \n \n  Special to the Daily Record", "description": "Last summer, Tigers' junior quarterback Luke Nethercot attended the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, La.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28887463:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-27T20:23:04-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28887463/tigers-quarterback-luke-nethercot-learned-how-be-leader", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0905/20140905_112334_Luke Nethercot mug.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Last summer, Tigers' junior quarterback Luke Nethercot attended the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, La.", "title": "Tigers' quarterback Luke Nethercot learned how to be a leader at Manning Passing Academy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Last summer, Tigers' junior quarterback Luke Nethercot attended the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, La.", "title": "Tigers' quarterback Luke Nethercot learned how to be a leader at Manning Passing Academy", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28887463/tigers-quarterback-luke-nethercot-learned-how-be-leader", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0905/20140905_112334_Luke Nethercot mug.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-27T20:23:04-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-09-27T19:54:54-0600", "sailthru.title": "Tigers' quarterback Luke Nethercot learned how to be a leader at Manning Passing Academy", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Troy SchwindtSpecial", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0905/20140905_112334_Luke Nethercot mug.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-27T20:28:39-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20ac\"", "article_summary": "Luke Nethercot (-)Last summer, Tigers' junior quarterback Luke Nethercot attended the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, La.\nLogan always tells me I'm a great quarterback and just to do what I know how to do.\"\nJunior Dacian Sullivan caught five passes for 73 yards, while senior Lucas Bufmack snagged two passes for 24 yards.\nIn the last two games, the Tigers have posted 24 points and 35 points with Nethercot finding his rhythm in the passing game.\n\"Our offensive line is always working their butts off.\""}
