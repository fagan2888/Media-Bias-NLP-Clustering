In an Independence Day eve speech at the DC-based tech firm 1776, President Barack Obama \u2014 the worst president since World War II \u2014 suggested that Republicans don\u2019t have enough \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d to work with him to get the economy moving again:\n\n\u201c[W]e can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside, at least occasionally, which I know is what the American people are urgently looking for,\u201d Obama said Thursday at 1776. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of economic patriotism where you say to yourself, how is it that we can start rebuilding this country to make sure that all of the young people who are here but their kids and their grandkids are going to be able to enjoy the same incredible opportunities that this country offers as we have. That\u2019s our job. That\u2019s what we should be focused on. And it\u2019s worth remembering as we go into Independence Day.\u201d\n\nWhat. The. Actual. Fuck.\n\nSorry, but this is ridiculous. President Barack Obama\u2019s idea of working with Republicans is for them to do what he wants without asking questions. He doesn\u2019t view Congress as a coequal branch of government, but rather a minor inconvenience that he can go around pretty much whenever he wants.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if President Obama wants to start throwing around the term \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d so loosely, then his own record should be open for discussion. The most recent recession, for example, officially ended six years ago, in June 2008.\n\nSince then, the economy has been stuck in a rut. We\u2019ve seen lackluster growth, evidenced by the recent GDP report, which showed a nearly 3 percent contraction. Job growth has been mixed.\n\nRecent monthly jobs reports have been positive, though the details show that things aren\u2019t as good as the topline data suggest. For example, the labor force participation rate \u2014 the percentage of Americans working or looking for work \u2014 was unchanged at 62.8 percent, maintaining a 35-year low. Compare that to the pre-recession rate, which hovered above 66 percent.\n\nWhile the recession was deeper than most realized at the time, the seemingly endless stream of environmental, healthcare, and financial regulations as well as new Obamacare taxes and fees and income tax increases haven\u2019t exactly helped the get economy moving.\n\nThe United States hasn\u2019t experienced the sort of growth that it has seen in previous recoveries. And it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t lessons from the past to tell us that a mountain of new regulations, tax hikes, and stimulus measures prolong tough economic times.\n\nBack in 2004, two UCLA economists \u2014 Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian \u2014 scrutinized Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal policies. While his administration believed that these economic policies would spur the economy and put people back to work, the pair of economists noted that they actually prolonged the Great Depression by seven years.\n\nRather than stopping to realize that his shitty economic policies haven\u2019t worked, no matter how well-intentioned he and his administration say they are, and they are creating less economic opportunity for young people as well as pretty much everyone else, President Obama wants to double down on them.\n\nPresident Obama wants to remake the economy more in the mold of a European welfare state, and all the burdens that it brings. Think about that for a moment. The day before Americans will celebrate the spirit of 1776 \u2014 independence from an oppressive monarch \u2014 this president wants create a state of dependence. That\u2019s not \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d as much as it is economic stupidity.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Barack Obama,economic,economic growth,GDP,ObamaCare,recession,recovery,Regulation,Tax Hikes,Taxes,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "This is pretty douchetastic.
