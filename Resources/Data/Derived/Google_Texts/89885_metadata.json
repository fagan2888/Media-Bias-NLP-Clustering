A recent Associated Press-GfK poll, demonstrates the challenge nicely:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Just when the government\u2019s insurance website is starting to run more smoothly, an Associated Press-GfK poll finds a potentially bigger problem for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. Americans who already have coverage and aren\u2019t looking for any more government help are blaming the law for their rising premiums and deductibles. Those are the 85 percent of Americans that the White House says don\u2019t have to be worried about the president\u2019s historic push to expand coverage for the uninsured. Overall 3 in 4 say the rollout of coverage for the uninsured has gone poorly as health care remains a politically charged issue going into next year\u2019s midterm congressional elections.\n\nSome of these problem are, of course, to do with Obamacare. Some of them, though, really are not. And yet the public does not appear to be discriminating.\n\nThere is a joke on Twitter. Someone will see something negative that has literally nothing to do with the president and they will append to the problem, \u201cThanks, Obama\u201d or \u201cObama\u2019s America.\u201d It\u2019s mildly funny. But here\u2019s the thing: people are now doing this in real life.\n\nThis seems somewhat par for the course. Almost all governments reach a certain point at which this tendency becomes irreversible; a certain point at which no reason, no charts, no evidence will shake the impression; a certain point at which people start to say, \u201cYes, I hear what you\u2019re saying, but I still think the opposite . . .\u201d I am not suggesting that Obamacare has yet reached this point. Certainly, it is possible that a quick turnaround could reverse its fortunes. But I am saying that looking too much at the data and not the latent impression might be a mistake.
