“No one made you go to college and companies shouldn't suffer because of it.” That may be the oddest conversation I’ve ever had. When I walked into the office from lunch Tuesday, a caller rang me up at my desk. She had read Clarice’s article about the possibility of a strike at Kroger and was mad. Furious in fact. Her basic argument was that if people wanted to get paid more, they should quit and find a job that offers more money. That’s easier said than done.

It’s a situation I keep running into. When there’s talk of a strike or protest about working conditions, the argument comes out that they should be thankful for the job and just be quiet. It’s hard to be quiet, however, when your job doesn’t pay enough to cover your bills. Even so, that’s not the complaint these Kroger employees are using. For the most part, they understand the job they were hired for. But, they argue if the company improves, then they should get an equal benefit of that success with management. After all, they’re the ones on the ground floor, making things work. That’s not to say people on all levels of a company don’t contribute, but each needs to be treated fairly. These workers are not ungrateful for a 25 cent raise. They just have questions. Why should they get 25 cents on the hourly rate, when the CEO pulled in a 17 percent raise, up from $9.6 million to $11.2 million? Did he do that much more to contribute to success? Why is it that his bonus increased each of the last three years and yet Kroger workers don’t even get one paid personal day, to take when they get sick? If the argument is, as I’ve heard before, ‘well he just did a good job negotiating,’ then why do we get upset when workers band together and do the same thing?
