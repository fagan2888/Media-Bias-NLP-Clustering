Burwell is notable in many respects. It is a significant legal victory for the Obama Administration, a victory for purposivist statutory interpretation, a loss for textualism, and a loss for an expansive Chevron doctrine. In these latter respects, the decision is something of a double-loss for Justice Scalia (which may explain the last line of his opinion). King also means that, in many respects, the PPACA is now the law that Chief Justice Roberts wrote as here, as in NFIB v. Sebelius, the Chief Justice has decided it is the Court\u2019s job to determine what the statute means \u2014 even if this requires ignoring or rewriting text \u2014 if such is necessary in order to save it. The umpire has decided it\u2019s okay to pinch hit to ensure the right team wins.\n\nThe primary basis for the Chief Justice\u2019s decision is that a \u201cfair construction\u201d of the statute requires more than giving meaning to discrete phrases, so \u201cestablished by the State\u201d need not mean \u201cestablished by the State\u201d insofar as such an interpretation \u2014 given the intervening decision of several dozen states not to establish their own exchanges \u2014 would produce untoward effects that Congress would not have intended or wanted when it enacted the PPACA. Specifically, the Chief Justice argued, insfoar as an interpretation of the PPACA would undermine the statute\u2019s goals \u2014 such as by creating a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of increasing costs and declining coverage \u2014 it is the Court\u2019s job to avoid it. That the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d was added to multiple places in the relevant statutory provision (Section 1401) at multiple times is immaterial. \u201cEstablished by the State\u201d need not exclude an exchange established by the federal government. The majority opinion shows no sympathy for the Solicitor General\u2019s silly argument that \u201cestablished by the State\u201d was an undefined \u201cstatutory term of art.\u201d No matter, for the government wins anyway.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act. Here's what it means for millions of Americans. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe Chief Justice concluded that the tension between the statutory text and the the statute\u2019s structure and purpose rendered the statute ambiguous. Under normal circumstances, this would mean the government wins under step two of the Chevron doctrine, which provides that when a statute is ambiguous, courts should defer to the interpretation of the implementing agency. Not here. Instead, the Chief Justice explained, resolving the ambiguity was the job of the Court. Here\u2019s the relevant passage:\n\nWhen analyzing an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, we often apply the two-step framework announced in Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Under that framework, we ask whether the statute is ambiguous and, if so, whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. Id., at 842\u2013843. This approach \u201cis premised on the theory that a statute\u2019s ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps.\u201d FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159 (2000). \u201cIn extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation.\u201d Ibid. This is one of those cases. The tax credits are among the Act\u2019s key reforms, involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people. Whether those credits are available on Federal Exchanges is thus a question of deep \u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d that is central to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly. Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 19) (quoting Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 160). It is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the IRS, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort. See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 266\u2013267 (2006). This is not a case for the IRS. It is instead our task to determine the correct reading of Section 36B. If the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms. Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U. S. 242, 251 (2010). But oftentimes the \u201cmeaning \u2014 or ambiguity \u2014 of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 132. So when deciding whether the language is plain, we must read the words \u201cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d Id., at 133 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our duty, after all, is \u201cto construe statutes, not isolated provisions.\u201d Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280, 290 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nSo the Court resolves the ambiguity in favor of the federal government, but without applying Chevron deference. Further, it resolves the ambiguity not by choosing one permissible interpretation of the permissible text over another, but by deciding that some portions of the text \u2014 the repeated invocation of \u201cestablished by the State\u201d has no meaning whatsoever.\n\nIf there\u2019s any consolation in the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion, it is that it seems to try to revive the Chief Justice\u2019s dissent in City of Arlington v. FCC, which sought to constrain the application of Chevron deference. Constraining Chevron to cases in which it would be reasonable to believe that Congress meant to delegate interpretive authority to the agency would be a good idea, but I am not sure there is enough in this decision to establish that principle, let alone to overturn Justice Scalia\u2019s City of Arlington opinion, but we\u2019ll have to see whether lower courts see it that way. For more on King and Chevron, see Chris Walker\u2019s post here.\n\nAt a practical level, the decision provides the Administration with substantial flexibility in implementing the statute. Although (as noted above) the decision cuts back on the scope of Chevron deference, lower courts will undoubtedly read this decision as a green light for further administrative jiggering of the statutory text (of which there has been quite a bit).\n\nAnother practical impact of the decision may be the erosion of the state-based exchange model. As many states discovered to their chagrin, creating and operating exchanges is not easy. It\u2019s a costly administrative headache. Yet if there is no downside to refusing to create an exchange, many states will happily turn over exchange responsibilities to Healthcare.gov. So, even though PPACA supporters promised that the law would not result in a \u201cfederal takeover\u201d of health insurance regulation because \u201call the health insurance exchanges . . . are run by states,\u201d the Administration\u2019s victory in King is likely to result in even fewer state exchanges.\n\nJust as the Chief Justice rewrote the individual mandate into a tax, and rewrote the Medicaid expansion to sever it from traditional Medicaid, the Chief Justice has rewritten Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code to excise the repeated reference to exchanges \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d Justice Scalia, in dissent, said Obamacare should now be known SCOTUSCare. Whatever we call it, the PPACA is now, in many respects, the law that Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.\n\nThese are my initial thoughts on the case. Prior posts on King v. Burwell can be found here. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have more to say later.\n\nUPDATE: Here is audio of a podcast on the decision I recorded with Josh Blackman and David Rivkin for the Federalist Society this afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In King v.
