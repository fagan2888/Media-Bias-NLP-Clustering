Those price differences even exist for routine procedures, like MRIs and ultrasounds, which should not be much different in theory.\n\n\u201cAs we think about policy responses to try and rein in increases to healthcare prices, the responses are going to have to be nuanced,\u201d said David Newman, executive director of the Health Care Cost Institute, who led the study.\n\nParts of the Affordable Care Act were conceived to control health spending through value-based arrangements between payers and providers. The goal is to reward hospitals and doctors who have both low costs and great outcomes for their patients. The ACA has implemented some of these reforms through Medicare, but the commercial market has relied on providers and insurers to reform on their own.\n\nThe Health Care Cost Institute's study analyzed 3 billion medical claims from Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare during 2012 and 2013, constituting about 25% of the commercially insured market. The data also represent prices actually paid to hospitals and doctors\u2014which generally are more important than the prices that are charged\u2014but are difficult or sometimes impossible to obtain due to gag clauses in contracts.\n\nResearchers found the national average price for 242 common services\u2014everything from lab tests and X-rays to more extensive procedures like hip replacements and angioplasties\u2014varied extensively across states as well as within metropolitan areas. For example, the average price for a knee replacement in South Carolina paid by one of the three large for-profit insurers was almost $47,000; yet the average price of the same bundled procedure in New Jersey totaled only half as much\u2014$24,000.\n\nIn Cleveland, the average price paid for a pregnancy ultrasound was $522. But just 60 miles away in Canton, Ohio, the average price was $183, according to the study.\n\nStates with the highest average prices, compared with a national benchmark, included Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Wisconsin while Arizona, Florida, Maryland and Tennessee had medical services that were priced much lower than the national average.\n\n(This story first appeared on the website of Crain's sister publication Modern Healthcare.)", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Bob Herman", "timeCrawled": "20160527_04:29:16", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2016-4-28", "title": "Why do health care costs vary so much from coast to coast?", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/160429807", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why do health care costs vary so much from coast to coast?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Price and utilization are the two essential elements of the nation's medical spending tab, and seemingly wild differences in prices for common procedures appear to be driving that bill up a lot.", "title": "Why do health care costs vary so much from coast to coast?", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160428/NEWS03/160429807/why-do-health-care-costs-vary-so-much-from-coast-to-coast", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Price and utilization are the two essential elements of the nation's medical spending tab, and seemingly wild differences in prices for common procedures appear to be driving that bill up a lot.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "In Cleveland, the average price paid for a pregnancy ultrasound was $522.\nBut just 60 miles away in Canton, Ohio, the average price was $183, according to the study.\nParts of the Affordable Care Act were conceived to control health spending through value-based arrangements between payers and providers.\nThose price differences even exist for routine procedures, like MRIs and ultrasounds, which should not be much different in theory.\n\u201cAs we think about policy responses to try and rein in increases to healthcare prices, the responses are going to have to be nuanced,\u201d said David Newman, executive director of the Health Care Cost Institute, who led the study."}
