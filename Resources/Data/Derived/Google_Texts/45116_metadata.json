But the most controversial angle here is the religion hook. That is essential. We need the details.\n\nGetReligion readers will not be shocked to learn that the Military Times team does a good job with the political material. Religion? Not so much.\n\nConsider these political bullet points:\n\n* During the 2012 election season, his display of several anti-Obama bumper stickers on his personal vehicle. Defense Department regulations specifically permit such political speech.\n\nStickers included the phrases: \u201cNobama,\u201d \u201cPolitical dissent is not racism,\u201d Nope 2012,\u201d and \u201cThe Road to Bankruptcy is paved with Ass-Fault\u201d (showing a Democrat donkey). Another read \u201cPray for Obama -- Ecclesiastes 10:2.\u201d This bible passage states: \u201cA wise man\u2019s heart tends toward his right, but a fool\u2019s heart tends toward his left.\u201d ...\n\n* His reading of books by conservative authors such as Sean Hannity and Mark Levin while in uniform, something he claims he was ordered to stop doing by a command sergeant major.\n\nSo far, so good -- including the use of the specific quote from Ecclesiastes.\n\nIt is clear that this man is no fan of the Commander in Chief. I would have, of course, appreciated some kind of quote from the relevant military documents on what personnel are allowed to do, and not do, linked to political speech. Once again, there are facts out there.\n\nBut the loaded charge here is religious discrimination. Thus, it is absolutely crucial that this news report include some specifics there. And what do readers get? Well, there is this:\n\n* His tweet in September of that year announcing he\u2019d be serving Chick-fil-A at his promotion party \u201c[i]n honor of the repeal of DADT.\u201d The fast-food chain was making headlines at the time for its stance against same-sex marriage.\n\nThe story also notes that Sommers talked to Fox News about his religious discrimination claims, which appears to have led to reactions against him. But, again, what was the content of his religious claims?\n\nReaders know that the Times has the details, because the story says so:\n\nThe lawsuit states that the Article 15 \u201cwas taken in reprisal for Plaintiff\u2019s protected expression of his religious beliefs.\u201d It\u2019s one of many allegations leveled in the document, which was provided by Wells to Army Times, including the assertion that the ... process should\u2019ve been delayed or postponed because the evaluation that triggered it was under appeal and remained so until Sommers\u2019 last day of service -- July 31, the day before the 25-page complaint was filed.\n\nSo, let's start with a basic question: Is this man a Christian, a Jew or what? Is he an evangelical, a Pentecostal believer or a Roman Catholic? What church does he attend?\n\nNote that he symbolically -- a tweet, and in actions -- opposed liberalized military policies linked to gay rights. Well, that stance has religious content as well as political. That might have as much to do with the Bible and religious tradition as it does with fried chicken.\n\nIn other words, while the heart of this lawsuit is the Sommers claim of religious discrimination, yet this is precisely the part of the Military Times report that is on the thin side, to say the least.
