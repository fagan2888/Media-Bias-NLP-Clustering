ARVADA — An Arvada husband and wife have been found shot to death in what police suspect was a murder-suicide.

A female family member concerned about the couple’s welfare went to the home at 10756 W. 68th Place at about 12:30 p.m. Friday, police spokeswoman Jill McGranahan said Saturday afternoon. The relative found the 71-year-old husband and the 65-year-old wife dead from gunshot wounds. They appeared to have been deceased for some time, McGranahan said.

Police would not speculate on which of the two had fired the gun. The Jefferson County coroner will conduct autopsies to determine the cause and manner of death.
