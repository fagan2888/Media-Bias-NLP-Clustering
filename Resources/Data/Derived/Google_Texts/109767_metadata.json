But the story gets weirder from there.\n\nAccording to the Denver Post:\n\n\u201cAfter receiving only $2 million of the $16.2 million it expected in \u2018risk-corridor\u2019 payments from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, Colorado HealthOP no longer meets the state\u2019s minimum capital and surplus requirements, state regulators said Friday.\u201d\n\nThe health care co-op then began taunting Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican who was critical of the Obamacare-created entity.\n\nThis is unbelievable disingenuous from someone who is part of the Republican-led, engineered dismantling of CO-OPs. https://t.co/HUapBaLm5y \u2014 Colorado HealthOP (@COHealthOP) October 16, 2015\n\nBut while the co-op was squandering finances and seemingly unable to secure a fraction of its expected \u201crisk-corridor\u201d payments, they were having a blast goofing off at their offices.\n\nThe Colorado Health Co-op\u2019s Instagram account paints a picture of quite a relaxed atmosphere amid dwindling finances:\n\nThey went bowling:\n\nCO-OPy time at the bowling alley! Now this is what we call getting unplugged. #office #fun A photo posted by Colorado HealthOP (@colorado_healthop) on Aug 6, 2014 at 4:33pm PDT\n\nThey dressed up dogs:\n\nBoxaroo needed some backup for open enrollment, so we brought in reinforcements! #getcoveredCO A photo posted by Colorado HealthOP (@colorado_healthop) on Nov 18, 2014 at 8:35am PST\n\nHere, they are tossing paper into the air:\n\nLauren getting her therapy on after much stress for the CO-OP health plan cause!
