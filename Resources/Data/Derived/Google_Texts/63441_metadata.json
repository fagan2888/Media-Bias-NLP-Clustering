Daniel Casara was golfing at the George W. Bush Institute\u2019s Warrior Open golf tournament in Irving last fall when the former president himself walked up to him.\n\nGeorge W. Bush asked Casara if he would apply to ride mountain bikes with him in the spring at the Warrior 100K, a bike ride to honor service members injured in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nCasara, recovering from 24 surgeries for numerous leg injuries he suffered when his vehicle rolled over an anti-tank mine in 2005 in Iraq, gave his word he would.\n\nHe said Saturday at the conclusion of the three-day event he was glad he went.\n\n\u201cIt was phenomenal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to apply again next year and now that I have a bike to work with I\u2019m going to work a little harder and do what I have to do to get back here.\u201d\n\nThe fifth annual Warrior 100K mountain bike ride, which is part of the George W. Bush Institute\u2019s military service initiative, was a year of both firsts and nostalgia.\n\nCasara, who is the first person to compete in both events, just finished his first semester at the Golf Academy of America in San Diego.\n\nThis was also the first year that 14 veterans from previous years\u2019 rides rode alongside the president and 17 wounded veterans and their families.\n\nRetired Army Sgt. Bryce Cole, who was medically retired in 2009, was one of the alumni who volunteered this weekend and rode on Saturday.\n\nHe participated as a warrior rider in 2011 and 2012 and has volunteered every year since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to grow that team and that fraternity bond,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThis is a really, really amazing opportunity for a lot of other people and I just remember how awesome it was when I did it. Anything I could do to help and give back to that, has just been my main goal.\u201d\n\nAfter the 20-mile ride, Bush took photos, signed rider numbers and had lunch with the veterans, their families and volunteers.\n\nHe called the vets and their families \u201cinspiring\u201d and said he always looks forward to this event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s neat to see the ones I rode with in the past, but I think it is very important for the riders to realize that they are part of a team of people,\u201d Bush said.\n\nHe noted it was important for the ride to have a lasting effect for the veterans, which is why the alumni are key.\n\nRetired Army Staff Sgt. Spencer Milo, who rode last year, said what made this year special was that his wife Sarah was able to attend.\n\n\u201cWe as veterans look for that camaraderie and we get that at events like this, but so many times the spouses are kind of on the outskirts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have the other spouses here because they kind of form their own camaraderie.\u201d\n\nBut Spencer said he was looking forward to getting back to Colorado to see his 2-year-old daughter Zoey.\n\nSpencer Milo was injured in 2008 and again in January 2011 when a suicide bomber detonated mere feet away from him. He had shrapnel in the left side of his face, three fractured disks in his back, lost full hearing in his right ear and partial hearing in his left ear.\n\nSarah Milo said their daughter has given him \u201creason to live again.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since she has been born, he has been a completely different person,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has helped him tremendously, and she has no idea that she is doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is the reason I am still here,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hug her.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L3Bhc3QteWVhcnMtcGFydGljaXBhbnRzLWpvaW4tZmluYWwtZGF5LW9mLWdlb3JnZS13LWJ1c2hzLWJpa2UtcmlkZS1mb3Itd291bmRlZC12ZXRzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "CRAWFORD-Retired Army Sgt.
