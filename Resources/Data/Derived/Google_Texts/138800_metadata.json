(Photo: Courtesy Greg Cosgrove)\n\nMany deserve thanks\n\nThe recent rattlesnake bites I experienced while hiking on Mount Eisenhower on Mother\u2019s Day made me realize how important our valley\u2019s first responders are, and how our community can make a difference in the life and recovery of someone like myself.\n\nWithout the efforts of Cal Fire, California Highway Patrol, Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Aviation Air Rescue Unit, the Desert Sheriff\u2019s Search and Rescue team and our good friends and staff at Eldorado Country Club, my story may not have had such a happy ending.\n\nI would also like to thank the ER staff at Desert Regional Medical Center for my initial care and the Pediatric ICU staff at Loma Linda Children\u2019s Hospital for the amazing treatment they provided me throughout the week following my accident, as well as the love and outpouring of support from my classmates and staff at Palm Desert High School.\n\nMy family and I are grateful for all the thoughts, prayers, and well wishes that we have received, and I look forward to running into some of you on one of our valley hiking trails in the not too distant future!\n\nMackenzie Cosgrove, Palm Desert\n\nCV Link check-in\n\nWhere is the voice of Palm Springs on the subject of the CV Link?\n\nThe city councils of both Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells have expressed concern about the future maintenance, operation and security costs of the valley-long pathway. Palm Springs is scheduled to have one-third of the CV Link miles and will be responsible for the largest portion of the ongoing costs. Yet, we haven\u2019t heard a word of official protest or concern from our City Council, even though the future expense of the CV Link could eventually reach into the pocket of every Palm Springs resident and business.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Palm Springs City Council to actively protect its citizens by limiting the future burden of the CV Link on our city.\n\nDonald Richroath, Palm Springs\n\nPaying their way\n\nI pay a lot of taxes.\n\nIn addition:\n\nI pay to use a golf course.\n\nI pay to use work out facilities.\n\nI pay to use a swimming pool.\n\nI do not bike.\n\nShouldn\u2019t those who use the CV Link pay for it?\n\nRon Marinella, Rancho Mirage\n\nNo longer fighting solo\n\nI am glad to see another city looking into the real cost of the CV Link.\n\nMayor Dana Hobart is a very bright man, he and our City Council have done an excellent job in our city.\n\nAnn Brown, Rancho Mirage\n\nHands off senior coverage\n\nAs senior citizens, we have had a Medicare Advantage health plan for several years. Unfortunately, the Advantage program was hit hard with more than $200 billion in cuts under the Affordable Care Act. As a result of these cuts, our co-pays went up last year and our prescription costs increased as well.\n\nWe are afraid that if the funding cuts to our Advantage plan continue it may cause us and other seniors to lose Advantage coverage and force us to find new health insurance.\n\nBeing retired and on a fixed income we really feel all of these little increases. Social Security just does not keep up with our out-of-pocket increases. This is a real tragedy because so many senior citizens have to rely on it as their only source of income in retirement. Yet they need good quality health insurance that fits into their budgets, and it will not remain affordable if Congress keeps making cuts to MA.\n\nCongress is stealing money from senior citizens when cuts are made to Medicare and Medicare Advantage. We paid for these programs and we expect Congress to preserve their funding.\n\nDuane and Stella Dier, La Quinta\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1Ht9M0b", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 26, 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "Desert Sun", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 26, 2015.", "title": "Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 26, 2015", "url": "http://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/05/25/desert-sun-letters-editor/27815399/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desertsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 26, 2015.", "title": "Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 26, 2015", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e225a49ee65a7d05e869db6c751f8a5292ca64ff/c=204-0-1428-1224&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/22/PalmSprings/B9317462322Z.1_20150522201333_000_GHEASE6FI.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mydesert", "site": "@mydesert", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600074187", "fb": {"app_id": 116853348383382}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Mackenzie Cosgrove, Palm DesertCV Link check-inWhere is the voice of Palm Springs on the subject of the CV Link?\nShouldn\u2019t those who use the CV Link pay for it?\nIt\u2019s time for the Palm Springs City Council to actively protect its citizens by limiting the future burden of the CV Link on our city.\nPalm Springs is scheduled to have one-third of the CV Link miles and will be responsible for the largest portion of the ongoing costs.\nRon Marinella, Rancho MirageNo longer fighting soloI am glad to see another city looking into the real cost of the CV Link."}
