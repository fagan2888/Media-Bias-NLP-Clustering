Insurers and some employers have long tried to sidestep paying for maternity care, which includes prenatal, delivery and postpartum services. Individual plans typically refused to pay for pregnancy-related services until the health law established that maternity and newborn care together are a so-called \u201cessential health benefit\u201d that must be included in their individual and small group coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, large employers that provide health insurance are required to cover maternity care for employees and their spouses under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. But that protection doesn\u2019t extend to dependent children, even though under the health law, adult children can now stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26.\n\n\u201cI suspect that a lot of this goes back to dependents being kids,\u201d says Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and education organization. \u201cThat perspective is just outdated, and was never entirely correct in terms of need for care anyway.\u201d\n\nIn May, the federal government clarified that dependent children are covered by the health law requirement that preventive services, including preconception and prenatal care, be covered without cost sharing in all plans, except those that were grandfathered under the law.\n\nTypically, prenatal care for a young woman for a first pregnancy would include visits to her health care provider every four weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, every two weeks until 36 weeks and weekly thereafter, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In addition, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends pregnancy-related services, including screening for gestational diabetes, anemia and Hepatitis B.\n\nBut prenatal care is a small portion of the cost of having a baby, and families that have to pay for an adult child\u2019s labor and delivery charges, including the hospital bill, could be on the hook for thousands of dollars.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Insurance,Insuring Your Health,Syndicate", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Coverage for labor and delivery for young women who are on their parents\u2019 health plan is not guaranteed under key health laws.", "title": "Even As Obamacare Seeks To Expand Women\u2019s Coverage, Some Still Face Key Gap", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20150616/even-as-obamacare-seeks-to-expand-womens-coverage-some-still-face-key-gap", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Coverage for labor and delivery for young women who are on their parents\u2019 health plan is not guaranteed under key health laws.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "In addition, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends pregnancy-related services, including screening for gestational diabetes, anemia and Hepatitis B.\nInsurers and some employers have long tried to sidestep paying for maternity care, which includes prenatal, delivery and postpartum services.\nHaving a baby is a common women\u2019s health event, yet insurance coverage isn\u2019t always assured.\nBut that protection doesn\u2019t extend to dependent children, even though under the health law, adult children can now stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26.\nMeanwhile, large employers that provide health insurance are required to cover maternity care for employees and their spouses under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978."}
