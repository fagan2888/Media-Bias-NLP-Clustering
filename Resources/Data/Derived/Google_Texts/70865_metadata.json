Kill Bill, vol. 1 had come out only a few weeks before Halloween 2003. I\u2019d already seen it more times than could be counted on one hand. I\u2019d sneak off to the theater between my college classes and my part-time jobs. So, when one group of pals decided that we\u2019d all go to some campus Spooktacular as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, I immediately called dibs on the Bride. Then, of course, a comment from the peanut gallery, an acquaintance of my good friend\u2019s roommate: \u201cDo you really think you can pull off a yellow tracksuit?\u201d\n\nHer question, snide enough to contain its own answer, was the record scratch that brutally stilled the images I\u2019d had of moving through the party with Uma Thurman\u2019s leonine strut, pointing my plastic sword at fellow revelers and dramatically intoning, \u201cThose of you lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the limbs you\u2019ve lost. They belong to me now.\u201d I saw myself as she saw me: as round and garish as a plastic lemon. Never mind that this girl had often defined her day\u2019s eating\u2014and, by extension, herself\u2014as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d that she approached life the way she took her salad dressing, always on the side and never really touched. In that moment, she\u2019d said something irrevocably, elementally true about me.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201c\u2018I Don\u2019t Want to Be a Girl'\u201d\n\nAnd so, on Halloween night, the night when everyone has carte blanche to reveal their secret selves in grease paint and Lycra, I eschewed the me I wanted to be and went as a zombie, loud and lurching in ripped, filthy clothes. Time has thickened my hide, and in time, I\u2019ve become more at ease inside my stretch-marked, cellulite-pocked, size-24 skin. And yet, years later, I still think of those two images of my fat body\u2014the chic, wisecracking assassin and the grunting, lumbering monster\u2014whenever I settle down in the dark to watch Melissa McCarthy, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Plus-Size Sweetheart,\u201d take pratfall after pratfall, belch and curse, hit on every dude in a room with a toxic obliviousness that would make even the greenest pick-up artist cringe and, in the same breath, threaten to shove a man\u2019s balls \u201cright back up his scrotum.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d wanted to embrace McCarthy before I ever attended a screening of Bridesmaids (my first exposure to her work); I\u2019d needed to see a body like mine belong to anyone other than the sad-sack best friend or the mother of the bride, to see my own arm flab and heavy belly alongside the wasp-waists and toned shoulders of the leading ladies. When samurai badasses must possess the leggy grandeur of Uma Thurman and love interests can only be played by Natalie Portman; when \u201cugly ducklings\u201d are just Anne Hathaway in a frizzy wig and an oversized sweater and when my thinner friends (rightly) rail against seeing women with their body types flattened into sex objects and tied to so many railroad tracks, all I hoped for was visibility.\n\nAnd then I watched McCarthy\u2019s character, Megan\u2014clad in orthopedic sandals and a boxy, shape-obscuring pant-and-Guy Fieri bowling-shirt combo\u2014look at a random man at a party and loudly announce that she was \u201cgoing to climb that like a tree.\u201d The audience erupted in laughter but I pursed my mouth. This still wasn\u2019t as painful as the moment later in the film when the titular characters are on a flight to Vegas and Megan flirts with her cringing male seatmate by slapping her stomach and offering him access to her undercarriage. This gag shares an unspoken punchline with that misogynist old chestnut about rolling a fat woman in flour and seeking out the wet spot: that fat women\u2019s bodies are inherently disgusting, especially when displaying sexual desire, and courting desire in turn. Visibility alone was no longer enough. I\u2019m left longing for stories about fat women that don\u2019t tumble off the wrong side of that thin tightrope between laughing with and laughing at.\n\nBridesmaids, and the woman-centric bawdy comedies it was supposed to inspire, became a cinematic cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, and McCarthy was championed as the architect of the masterful vulgarity that would supposedly build a new wing on the boys\u2019 club. And she was supposedly the avatar of a more radical kind of body acceptance, one that wasn\u2019t limited to girls with Lena Dunham\u2019s Raphaelite build, Christina Hendricks\u2019 immaculately overripe Old Hollywood curves, or J. Lo\u2019s booty, but included women who shopped in the higher end of Lane Bryant\u2019s size spectrum. Women like me.\n\nIn interviews, McCarthy speaks candidly about the \u201cstrange epidemic of body image and body dysmorphia\u201d and how she serves as a buffer against it for her two young daughters; she dismisses a particularly vicious critic who turned his review of Identity Thief into a schoolyard diatribe about her \u201ctractor-size\u201d body by describing him as \u201cswimming in hate\u201d and flouting a home life rich in love and a professional success larger than a full fleet of tractor trailers. She bristles when that success is qualified with epithets like \u201cplus-size sweetheart:\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m managing to achieve all this success in spite of my affliction \u2026 would you ever do that to a male comedian considered overweight?\u201d\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cIs Melissa McCarthy a Big Sellout?\u201d\n\nShe calls out the fashion elite for failing to court her and clothe her the way they would any other Emmy-award-winning and Oscar-nominated actress. And, in a recent People magazine cover spread to promote her latest film Tammy, she calls out the fashion industry as a whole for failing to court and clothe the legions of women who look just like her: \u201c Just because I\u2019m a different size doesn\u2019t mean I \u2026 turned off a desire for anything current or modern, or a desire to look good and feel good \u2026 I was like \u2018Where is a cool T-shirt? Where is a great sweater that\u2019s not built like a tent?\u201d That same spread is refreshingly void of any diet or exercise talk, any attempts to position herself as \u201ca good fatty\u201d (a term coined by Dances With Fat blogger Ragen Chastain to describe \u201ca fat person who is viewed \u2026 as taking \u2018appropriate steps\u2019 to lose weight, or, at the very least, \u2018struggling\u2019 with their weight, thereby earning a modicum of very contingent respect from someone who would otherwise be a fat hater). Indeed, she decapitates the \u201cgood fatty\u201d narrative with the roundhouse kick and katana strike of a rhetorical question and four blunt words: \u201cMy weight? It is what it is.\u201d\n\nBut in McCarthy\u2019s film roles, especially in Tammy, hardly take such a revolutionarily blas\u00e9 approach to her weight. McCarthy\u2019s size is always implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, the brunt of the joke. Tammy follows its heroine\u2019s cross-country road trip with her alcoholic grandmother, Pearl, who is portrayed by Susan Sarandon as a sex kitten gone to seed. In one early scene, Tammy and Pearl get blitzed in a cow pasture; Tammy rides the hood of Pearl\u2019s powder blue Cadillac, her broad body splayed against the windshield, as Pearl spins donuts into the grass and the cows loudly moo. \u201cSorry, cows! You taste so good!\u201d Tammy bellows. As soon as Tammy is bucked from the hood, the camera pans to a single cow snorting and chewing. The correlation, and the (supposed) joke nested inside it, is clear: Fat women are just dumb animals.\n\nThe film, which was co-written by McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone (who also directed it), imprisons its titular character in a petting zoo with bars of fast food wrappers, dirty T-shirts and busted Crocs, and badly bleached hair. From her cage, she \u201centertains\u201d with displays of bovine obliviousness\u2014Tammy doesn\u2019t know who Mark Twain is, or how to pronounce his name (\u201cMark Twon? He was a good guy\u201d); she\u2019s enthralled by a garish wood carving of a giant bald eagle carrying an American flag in its talons; and she fumes \u201cThanks Obamacare!\u201d while setting the Cadillac, which she\u2019s used to rob a fast-food joint for some quick cash, on fire (proving that McCarthy\u2019s humor is arguably as classist as it is sizeist)\u2014and an unquenchable zest for food.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actress has been an impassioned advocate for body acceptance.
