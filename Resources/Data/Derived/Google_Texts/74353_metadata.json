Such methods are now being adopted across the country and incentivized by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThen her mother, a nonagenarian with frailty and advanced dementia, injured herself in a fall. Gabow realized she didn\u2019t want her mother to receive standard care. She successfully advocated for care better suited to their situation, and her mother was soon released from her surgeon\u2019s care and lived the remaining two months of her life in relative comfort.\n\nSince the vast majority of Americans lack Gabow\u2019s training, clout, and connections, the only way to ensure all older Americans get similar high quality care is to create standards and policies that acknowledge what we all already know: older adults differ from younger adults in ways that matter.\n\nPrecedents In Medicine And Health Policy\n\nI began medical school in 1988. At that time, we learned to care for a single patient: the 70-kilogram man. He was healthy until given the diseases we had to diagnose and treat, and it went without saying that he was neither young nor old, and Caucasian. This educational scenario paralleled clinical research where subjects were also male, white, and middle-aged. The reasoning behind this approach was that women were obviously different than men, and blacks different than whites, so adding in these complications polluted the science.\n\nWhile clean study samples worked well in laboratory settings, they proved counterproductive in medical education, research, and care. Excluding large segments of the population from standards because of their differences, and then applying those standards to them despite their differences, often resulted in poor care and outcomes. The civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s led to investigations of the impact of this approach on care and outcomes in the 1980s and brought new educational strategies and federal research policies in the 1990s.\n\nInterestingly, this was not the first time medicine acknowledged that differences matter. In the 1800s, hospitals\u2014first in Europe and then in the United States\u2014were founded for the exclusive care of children. We still have pediatric hospitals and clinicians today. We understand that children differ from adults: they require different doses of medications, respond differently to some treatments, have conditions unique to their age group, and have additional developmental, social, and family needs that significantly impact their care and outcomes.\n\nThe same is true of older adults. Now it\u2019s time to apply the same logic to their care as we already apply to the care of children, women, and minorities.\n\nAn Action Plan for Health Policy\n\nTransforming health care to better serve older patients must begin with the development and application of standards of care that consider age-related changes in physiology and risk, patients\u2019 health status\u2014based on co-morbidities, functional abilities or disability, and overall prognosis\u2014as well as life priorities. In this approach, age is necessary but not sufficient to determine good care; the care that will benefit an 82-year-old who exercises daily, travels, and volunteers may not help, and might harm, a 73-year-old with significant heart disease who is wheelchair bound and dependent from a stroke.\n\nPolicy makers can take three key steps to move American medicine away from its failed one-size-fits-all approach for adult care. First, they must require care pathways and outcome metrics \u201cof, by, and for\u201d older adults when certifying health systems and hospitals. Second, medical education oversight bodies such as the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education must begin requiring training in the care of older adults analogous to the training these bodies already require in the care of children and women. Third, the National Institutes of Health and other funders must add older adults to the categories of subjects to be included in trials, or justify their exclusion, just as they have done for women, children, and minorities.\n\nStandards For Life\u2019s Third Act\n\nPatricia Gabow\u2019s experience with her mother gives us clues into some of what these new standards might look like:\n\nThey would focus more on the person and their health, and less on the affected organ or disease process. Gabow\u2019s mother\u2019s dementia meant that a c-spine collar and IV would have caused agitation that would have led to distress and possibly more harm to her body than that already sustained in the fall. They would skip tests that would not change the treatment plan. Gabow explains that her mother\u2019s head trauma notwithstanding, there was no head CT finding on which their family would act. They would prioritize care that maximized wellbeing and independence. While Gabow\u2019s mother initially balked at having the cut on her forearm sutured, a local anesthetic enabled the wound to be closed so it would be more comfortable and easier to care for going forward. They would base all diagnostic and treatment decisions on the patient\u2019s goals of care and support the family in doing the same. Gabow had to advocate against the system and many of its providers for care in keeping with her mother\u2019s wishes and happiness, a situation that added to Gabow\u2019s stress and anxiety. They would consider not only the pros and cons of acute management but the downstream risks and benefits of treatments. When a \u201csimple fix\u201d of her mother\u2019s hip fracture was recommended, Gabow alone seems to have imagined the future in which the hip was repaired but her mother was terrified in a foreign setting, strapped down, and subject to invasive attentions she didn\u2019t want, all of which would \u201cseem like torture to her.\u201d\n\nBy creating a care pathway appropriate to her mother\u2019s frailty, dementia, goals, and values, Patricia Gabow not only saved her mother\u2019s life (perhaps literally, and certainly figuratively), she also saved our health system approximately $156,000. It was a win-win, but older adults shouldn\u2019t need to have raised a physician-CEO to get that standard of care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/05/29/developing-standards-of-by-and-for-older-adults-reflections-on-patricia-gabows-narrative-matters-essay/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_NM_Gabow.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Developing Standards \u2018Of, By, And For\u2019 Older Adults: Reflections On Patricia Gabow\u2019s Narrative Matters Essay"}, "description": "Developing Standards \u2018Of, By, And For\u2019 Older Adults: Reflections On Patricia Gabow\u2019s Narrative Matters Essay | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa77\"", "article_summary": "It was a win-win, but older adults shouldn\u2019t need to have raised a physician-CEO to get that standard of care.\nFirst, they must require care pathways and outcome metrics \u201cof, by, and for\u201d older adults when certifying health systems and hospitals.\nThe same is true of older adults.\nGabow\u2019s mother\u2019s dementia meant that a c-spine collar and IV would have caused agitation that would have led to distress and possibly more harm to her body than that already sustained in the fall.\nGabow explains that her mother\u2019s head trauma notwithstanding, there was no head CT finding on which their family would act."}
