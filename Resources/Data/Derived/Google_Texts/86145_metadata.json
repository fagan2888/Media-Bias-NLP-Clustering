In an interview with CNN, he hurled all sorts of abuse right back at Bush, calling him \u201csad and pathetic,\u201d \u201can embarrassment to his family,\u201d and a \u201cnervous wreck.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, in appearances in New Hampshire and in television interviews, was reliving his all-out assault on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio from the Saturday evening debate in New Hampshire.\n\nChristie\u2019s attacks on Rubio plainly rattled the Floridian, who has been surging in the polls. But Christie spent most of Sunday and Monday essentially arguing that demonstrating his ability to use bluster and bombast to make another candidate stumble somehow proves that he is the most qualified candidate for the Oval Office.\n\nRelated: 25 Facts You Should Know About Michael Bloomberg\n\nThe same Christie, less than 24 hours later, tried to turn back questions about his state\u2019s economic performance under his leadership by characterizing them as \u201cinsulting\u201d to his constituents.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s interview came only days after the two remaining Democratic candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, spent an inordinate amount of time during one of their (relatively infrequent) debates in a largely pointless semantic argument about which of them is truly a \u201cprogressive\u201d candidate.\n\nIf he were to enter the race, Bloomberg would share some odd parallels with Trump \u2013 not least of which would be his status as the second New York billionaire who has had presidential ambitions for years deciding that 2016 is the year for him.\n\nHe would also face extraordinary opposition from core Republican voters because of his adamant support for gun control and abortion rights and because of the paternalistic policies he attempted to impose while mayor of New York, including a ban on the sale of large soft drinks.\n\nRelated: If Michael Bloomberg Enters the Race, He Could Help Trump\n\nIn fact, if Bloomberg were to enter the race, there is a real likelihood that he would contribute to the problem he\u2019s complaining about. After all, this is the man whose policies inspired former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to show up at a rally with a Big Gulp in hand as a political \u201cstatement.\u201d\n\nBloomberg offers something for everyone in the field to hate. A former Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 2001 because he saw no possibility of winning the Democratic nomination in New York City. He then switched his affiliation to independent partway through his second mayoral term.\n\nBloomberg might believe he can raise the tone of the campaign if he enters the race. But there\u2019s good reason to think that a man who would no doubt be characterized variously as a gun-grabbing, party-switching, big government, moralistic, opportunist plutocrat might not actually help matters by throwing his hat in the ring.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Billionaire publisher and three-time mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg confirmed on Monday that he is considering an independent run for the presidency, saying he believes the American people deserve \u201ca lot better\u201d than the campaigns currently being run.
