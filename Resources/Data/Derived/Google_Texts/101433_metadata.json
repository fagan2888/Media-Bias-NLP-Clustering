The board \u2013 chaired since February by serial boardroom director, Allan Leighton \u2013 provides a supportive statement from Fairtrade.\n\nThe motion is one of a number contained in ballot papers sent this weekend to the more than 2.5 million people eligible to vote at the annual meeting under a new one-member-one-vote system being introduced as part of the overhaul of the business following the scandal in its banking arm in 2013.\n\nA leading Co-op activist is making a call for a protest vote against Leighton and other directors at the meeting \u2013 the first being held since last year\u2019s governance reforms were voted through to replace a system where 100 or so delegates went to the AGM. Instead a national members\u2019 council has been created to meet regularly while members can attend the AGM. About 2.7 million are thought to be meet the criteria \u2013 which includes a threshold of expenditure \u2013 out of an estimated 6 million members.\n\nThe members\u2019 council has withdrawn one motion it had drawn up for the meeting on 16 May asking the Co-op to reconsider its description of the group\u2019s purpose in society as \u201cchampioning a better way of doing business, for you and your communities\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut other divisions remain between the board and the members council including the future of up to \u00a31m of donations to the Co-op party \u2013 a motion brought by the board is being contested by the members council. In explanatory notes published alongside, the council asks for the motion on political donations to be withdrawn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Co-operative Group chief executive Richard Pennycook (left) and chair Allan Leighton.

Leighton \u2013 who chaired Royal Mail and is credited with turning around Asda \u2013 and two other directors could face a protest vote unless all six names shortlisted by the national members council were put forward.\n\nThe call not to support the election of Leighton, the chief executive, Richard Pennycook, and the senior independent director, Sir Christopher Kelly, was made by a leading Co-op activist.\n\nRelated: Co-op chairman Allan Leighton urged to reverse boardroom plan\n\nPeter Hunt, managing partner of Mutuo, has already accused the board of adopting totalitarian practices over the selection process. Hunt is now planning not to back Leighton, Pennycook and Kelly\u2019s election to the board and urging other members, to do the same. \u201cI urge the members not to support their appointment to the board unless they withdraw the three member nominated directors,\u201d said Hunt, who is standing for election to the members\u2019 council and a former general secretary of the Co-operative party, which is allied with the Labour party.\n\nThe Co-op said Leighton, Pennycook and Kelly were backed by the board and the members\u2019 council. \u201cWe are in the process of building a board made up of directors who are individually and collectively qualified to oversee an organisation of the scale and complexity of the Co-operative. This will ensure we maintain our focus and momentum, whilst ensuring the catastrophic events of the recent past cannot happen again,\u201d the Co-op said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Board chairman, Allan Leighton, blames financial position and \u2018austere market climate\u2019 of other stores, but activist calls for vote against board members", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jill Treanor", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Board chairman, Allan Leighton, blames financial position and \u2018austere market climate\u2019 of other stores, but activist calls for vote against board members", "title": "Co-op Group: competition means we cannot fully commit to Fairtrade", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/19/co-op-group-competition-means-we-cannot-fully-commit-to-fairtrade", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429462687264/094fe3e0-9a41-4819-be69-9ecb3842565c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=1843fca7f86d8e38121bb52b1dfd6b0d", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://business/2015/apr/19/co-op-group-competition-means-we-cannot-fully-commit-to-fairtrade?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/19/co-op-group-competition-means-we-cannot-fully-commit-to-fairtrade", "iphone": "gnmguardian://business/2015/apr/19/co-op-group-competition-means-we-cannot-fully-commit-to-fairtrade?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429462687264/094fe3e0-9a41-4819-be69-9ecb3842565c-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://business/2015/apr/19/co-op-group-competition-means-we-cannot-fully-commit-to-fairtrade?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Co-operative Group,Fair trade,Supermarkets,Retail industry,Banking,Business,UK news,Global development", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-04-19T17:12:35.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jilltreanor", "section": "Business", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T00:33:17.000Z", "tag": "Co-operative Group,Fair trade,Supermarkets,Retail industry,Banking,Business,UK news,Global development"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429462687264/094fe3e0-9a41-4819-be69-9ecb3842565c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=7de061115d8b40045e759780eec6c992", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Co-operative Group,Fair trade,Supermarkets,Retail industry,Banking,Business,UK news,Global development"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5865\"", "article_summary": "Instead a national members\u2019 council has been created to meet regularly while members can attend the AGM.\nThe Co-op said Leighton, Pennycook and Kelly were backed by the board and the members\u2019 council.\nHunt is now planning not to back Leighton, Pennycook and Kelly\u2019s election to the board and urging other members, to do the same.\nThe board \u2013 chaired since February by serial boardroom director, Allan Leighton \u2013 provides a supportive statement from Fairtrade.\nThe Co-operative Group has told its members that it cannot make an enhanced commitment to stock Fairtrade products because of tough competition among supermarkets and its shift towards convenience stores."}
