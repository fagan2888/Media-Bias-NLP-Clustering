After all, a criminal assaulting an officer would only have to take the gun, then hold it close to the bracelet in order to fire at the officer.\n\nOr he could just take the gun and the bracelet and use the gun at will, just like a traditional firearm.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
