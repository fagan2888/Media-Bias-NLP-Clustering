They stay for the culture and atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great cultural festival,\u201d visitor Safford Black said as Denver\u2019s 28th annual Cinco de Mayo festival kicked into gear Saturday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we get to do every weekend. We come every year.\u201d\n\nThe action began at 10 a.m., when the annual parade carved a route through downtown.\n\nAround the same time, crowds began making their way through Civic Center park, where hundreds of vendors offer everything from authentic Mexican food and funnel cakes to sombreros and children\u2019s toys.\n\n\u201cI do a lot of these events, and I tend to do really well,\u201d said Latasha Bell, owner of handmade soap company Ashae. \u201c(I like) the culture, the food, the energy. Not only is this good business for me, but I also get to have a good time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the vendors, the two-day festival features a full lineup of Latin dancers and musicians, plus a variety of competitions and performances throughout the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday morning, an instructor led the crowd through a Zumba dance sequence. At 3 p.m., contestants squared off to see who could consume 10 tacos the fastest.\n\nMark \u201cToothless Shark\u201d Sutherburg won the first round after finishing in 3 minutes, 10 seconds \u2014 his 20th career eating contest victory.\n\nMidafternoon, festivalgoers grew wary when dark clouds rolled in and a few raindrops fell. The unfavorable weather passed quickly, but not before several gusts of wind did some damage.\n\nAbout 4 p.m., a large metal structure toppled when the wind caught flags attached to it. Two men received \u201cserious head injuries,\u201d according to Police Cmdr. Tony Lopez, and were transported to a hospital.\n\n\u201cI was right there, and all of a sudden, it started coming down,\u201d Melinda Thomas said. \u201cI let out this bloodcurdling scream. \u2026 I was in shock. It all happened so fast.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, the structure was dismantled. Production manager Renee Ortiz said there are no similar structures remaining in the park.\n\nThe festival continues Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Highlights will include the Mariachi Mass at 10 a.m. and the highly anticipated Chihuahua races at 3 p.m.\n\nEvent organizers said the festival is \u201cmuy caliente\u201d this year and urged people to come \u201cexperience Mexico in the heart of downtown Denver.\u201d\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cinco de Mayo festivities take over Denver\u2019s Civic Center park", "title": "Cinco de Mayo festivities take over Denver\u2019s Civic Center park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/02/cinco-de-mayo-festivities-take-over-denvers-civic-center-park/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__cincodemayop1.jpg", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150502__cincodemayop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T09:38:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T13:13:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fc0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a great cultural festival,\u201d visitor Safford Black said as Denver\u2019s 28th annual Cinco de Mayo festival kicked into gear Saturday morning.\nWe come every year.\u201dThe action began at 10 a.m., when the annual parade carved a route through downtown.\nAround the same time, crowds began making their way through Civic Center park, where hundreds of vendors offer everything from authentic Mexican food and funnel cakes to sombreros and children\u2019s toys.\nThey come for the food, music and vendors.\nHighlights will include the Mariachi Mass at 10 a.m. and the highly anticipated Chihuahua races at 3 p.m."}
