Brazil was one of the last major polluters to announce its reduction targets in the lead-up to this December\u2019s climate conference.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrazil\u2019s 43 percent goal is over 2005 levels, and the country will rely on anti-deforestation work it\u2019s already done to meet the mark. Deforestation accounts for 15 percent of greenhouses gasses that enter the atmosphere annually.\n\nThe country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have already fallen 33 percent between 2005 and 2013 due to its work on deforestation, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Brazil is one of a few developing countries to commit to an absolute emissions reduction target,\" Rousseff said in her speech. \"We have one of the world's largest populations and GDP, and our targets are as ambitious or more ambitious than those of developed countries.\u201d\n\nRousseff had initially pledged to curb illegal deforestation during a meeting with President Obama in June, though the country will, notably, continue to allow legal deforestation.\n\nBrazil has lost almost 20 percent of its forest cover since the 1960s, due largely to its increasing agriculture space. In June, the country agreed to restore 12 million hectares of forest, roughly the the size of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Sunday, Rousseff also pledged to increase the country\u2019s share of renewable power to 23 percent by 2030 from 15 percent today.\n\nBrazil is the world\u2019s seventh largest greenhouse gas emitter, and one of the last major polluters to announce a reduction goal before this December\u2019s climate conference. The United States has pledged to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent between 2005 and 2025.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The country will pursue a 43 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.", "description": "The country will pursue a 43 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The country will pursue a 43 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.", "title": "Brazil announces greenhouse gas emissions goals", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255144-brazil-announces-greenhouse-gas-emissions-goals", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/deforestation_myanmar_022414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-28T11:38:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-09-28T11:38-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255144-brazil-announces-greenhouse-gas-emissions-goals", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-28T11:38-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Paris climate talks, Climate change, Deforestation,Dilma Rousseff,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-28T11:38:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T11:38:08-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255144-brazil-announces-greenhouse-gas-emissions-goals", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The country will pursue a 43 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Brazil announces greenhouse gas emissions goals"}, "dcterms.title": "Brazil announces greenhouse gas emissions goals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae3d\"", "article_summary": "The country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have already fallen 33 percent between 2005 and 2013 due to its work on deforestation, according to Reuters.\n\"Brazil is one of a few developing countries to commit to an absolute emissions reduction target,\" Rousseff said in her speech.\nBrazil is the world\u2019s seventh largest greenhouse gas emitter, and one of the last major polluters to announce a reduction goal before this December\u2019s climate conference.\nBrazil officials will pursue a 43 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as part of a United Nations climate agreement, though it will rely on its past work to curb deforestation to meet the goal.\nThe United States has pledged to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent between 2005 and 2025."}
