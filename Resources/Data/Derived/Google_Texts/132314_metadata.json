Sellers should all play by the same rules, and I\u2019m not opposed to there being one less avenue for crazy people, convicted felons and terrorists-in-waiting to be able to purchase military-grade weapons.\n\nThe problem is the process. Congress has not voted to accomplish what Obama wants to accomplish. More concerning, executive orders are becoming a habit of his, the most obvious example being his attempt to completely bypass Congress on immigration policy. That effort is now being tied up in court, where it should be. And I write that despite the fact that, as with the gun show issue, I agree with Obama in principle that the United States should focus on deporting dangerous illegal immigrants while finding a path to legalization for those who have been here awhile and are otherwise obeying the law.\n\nBut that\u2019s another column. This is about misusing the presidency\u2019s powers.\n\nI guess this is the part where I\u2019m supposed to write about Obama in hysterical, apocalyptic terms. Let\u2019s instead have a calm, rational discussion, shall we? President Obama is exceeding his constitutional authority. He should stop doing that.\n\nActually, Obama is doing exactly what the Founding Fathers anticipated a chief executive would do, which is try to exercise power. They knew that was a bad thing, even if the president\u2019s goals were agreeable.\n\nSo they included in the Constitution a system of checks and balances to keep that from happening. Congress makes the law; the president enforces the law; the judiciary interprets the law.\n\nUnfortunately, Congress is failing to check and balance the president, and it\u2019s time for congressional Democrats to step up.\n\nMembers of Congress are supposed to place their branch above their political parties \u2014 which, by the way, are not even mentioned in the Constitution. Throughout American history, senators and representatives have stood up to presidents who have tried to usurp their role. Instead, with exceptions, congressional Democrats today too often are behaving as if this is a British parliamentary system, where a prime minister leads the government and most everybody falls in line most of the time.\n\nBecause I\u2019m determined to offend everyone in this column, congressional Republicans share blame as well. The system is supposed to work through a system of checks and balances, not unending dysfunction. Republicans made a political decision from the beginning of Obama\u2019s presidency to make him fail, no matter what. It\u2019s worked for them \u2014 politically. They\u2019ve made huge gains in Congress, in governor\u2019s offices, and in state legislatures. But a more constructive approach would have been better for the country.\n\nNow we\u2019ve had yet another vote to repeal Obamacare \u2014 one that actually will make its way to Obama\u2019s desk, where he will veto it.\n\nThis is happening because Republicans believe it will help them in November prove once again that President Obama supports Obamacare, along with Democrats, as if there were any doubt about all that. Meanwhile, Republicans still haven\u2019t coalesced behind a plan to replace the system they would repeal. The bill they sent to his desk would give policymakers a couple of years to create an alternative, but if they don\u2019t, or can\u2019t, would we all go back to the days when insurance companies denied coverage to people because of pre-existing conditions, or cut them off when they became too expensive to cover? At the moment, I guess we would.\n\nNo one\u2019s the hero, and no one is the villain. What\u2019s happening is that a lot of officeholders are caught up in the big game up there, which is one reason why Obama\u2019s approval ratings are only 45 percent, according to Gallup, while Congress\u2019 are at 13.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s 2016, and time for us regular folks to vote. If we do our jobs better, maybe they will too.\n\nSteve Brawner is an independent journalist in Arkansas. Email him at brawnersteve@mac.com.
