Oliver claimed that in Sauk City \"the ID office\" that provides identification for voting \"is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month\" -- a total of four days in 2016.\n\nWe rated the statement Mostly True.\n\nThe office is only open on those four days in 2016. However, that\u2019s not the only place where Sauk City residents can go to get a state ID that they can use for voting. Several other locations within a relatively short drive of are open much more often.\n\n2. Milwaukee mayoral candidate Bob Donovan posted a photo of a dilapidated house on Facebook with a caption that claimed: \"This is the true picture of \u2018Milwaukee\u2019s Renaissance\u2019 after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership.\"\n\nBut the house had been used repeatedly for training, including controlled fires, by the city\u2019s Fire Department. We rated Donovan\u2019s claim, well, Pants on Fire.\n\n3. Author A.J. Jacobs claimed President John F. Kennedy released a star Green Bay Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game.\n\nIn a pre-Super Bowl interview on National Public Radio, Jacobs said Kennedy answered Packers coach Vince Lombardi\u2019s call to release Paul Hornung from military reserve duty so the star halfback could play in the game, which the Packers won. Indeed, Kennedy did intervene.\n\nWe rated the statement True.\n\n4. U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, a Green Bay area Republican, claimed GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump \"wants to replace\" Obamacare \"with a single-payer system.\"\n\nRibble made the claim in September 2015. In our fact check at the time, we noted Trump continued to praise single payer -- a health care system in which the government pays for care for all citizens -- at least as it used in other countries. Yet he had also spoken a number of times about a private system\n\nWe rated Ribble\u2019s claim Half True.\n\n5. Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg said her rival in the primary race for state Supreme Court, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, twice \"supported\" incumbent Justice Rebecca Bradley.\n\nWe rated the claim Mostly True.\n\nDonald had endorsed Bradley in a 2013 election for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. And Donald was listed as a reference for Bradley for a vacant seat on the state appeals court in 2015 -- though he also recommended that the governor choose a different applicant for the post.\n\nDonald ultimately lost the primary. Kloppenburg and Bradley will face off in the April 5, 2016 general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What attracted the most interest (and clicks) from PolitiFact Wisconsin readers in February?
