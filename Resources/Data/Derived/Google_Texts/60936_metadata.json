Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd.\n\nIn another scathing opinion against the Sherlock Holmes estate, Judge Richard A. Posner ordered the estate to pay attorneys\u2019 fees for bringing \u201cnonexistent copyright claims\u201d as a \u201cform of extortion\u201d against its competitor. Judge Posner applauded the competitor, author Leslie Klinger, for \u201cperforming a public service\u201d by \u201cexposing the estate\u2019s unlawful business strategy.\u201d Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd., Appeal No. 14-1128 (7th Cir., Aug. 4, 2014) (Posner, J.).\n\nIn a previous opinion penned by Judge Posner, the 7th Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment of non-infringement. (IP Update, Vol. 17, No. 5). The 7th Circuit concluded that the original character of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, published before 1923, was no longer subject to copyright protection. \u201cOnce the copyright on a work expires, the work becomes a part of the public domain and can be copied and sold without a license from the holder of the expired copyright.\u201d\n\nKlinger had compiled an anthology of Sherlock Holmes stories, entitled In the Company of Sherlock Holmes. Doyle\u2019s estate demanded a $5,000 license from Klinger. The estate also suggested that if Klinger\u2019s anthology was published without a license, the estate would prevent retailers, such as Amazon, from selling the book. As a result, publishers Random House and Pegasus Books refused to publish Klinger\u2019s anthology until Klinger paid for a license.\n\nKlinger then sued Doyle\u2019s estate in the district court for declaratory judgment of non-infringement. Klinger prevailed in the district court and on the estate\u2019s appeal to the 7th Circuit. He then moved for approximately $30,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal.\n\nUnder 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 of the Copyright Act, the prevailing party is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. In determining whether to award such fees, the 7th Circuit considers the strength of the prevailing party\u2019s case and relief obtained. There is a \u201cvery strong\u201d presumption in favor of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees where a litigant, like Klinger, has lodged a successful defense to a claim of copyright infringement.\n\nIn granting Klinger an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the Seventh Circuit suggested that the Doyle estate engaged in anti-competitive behavior. \u201cThe Doyle estate\u2019s business strategy is plain: charge a modest license fee for which there is no legal basis, in the hope that the \u2018rational\u2019 writer or publisher asked for the fee will pay it rather than incur a greater cost, in legal expenses, in challenging the legality of the demand.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he estate was playing with fire in asking Amazon and other booksellers to cooperate with it in enforcing its nonexistent copyright claims against Klinger. For it was enlisting those sellers in a boycott of a competitor of the estate, and boycotts of competitors violate the antitrust laws.\u201d\n\nThe circuit court applauded Klinger for acting, in effect, as \u201ca private attorney general, combating a disreputable business practice\u2014a form of extortion.\u201d Judge Posner admonished the Doyle estate: \u201cIt\u2019s time the estate, in its own self-interest, changed its business model.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Sherlock Holmes estate, Judge Richard A.
