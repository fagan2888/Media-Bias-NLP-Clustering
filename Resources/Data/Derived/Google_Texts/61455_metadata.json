Additionally, TriCore has entered into a Center of Excellence agreement with COPAN which creates a mutually beneficial partnership allowing for input into future enhancements of this key investment,\" stated Bill Remillard, TriCore's Chief Technical Officer.\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of digital Microbiology and the advancement of point of care technologies, Microbiology is changing at a fast speed. WASPLab\u2122 is a sophisticated system that automatically processes Microbiology specimens and uses sample barcodes to guide the specimen through the system, determining how to process it and when to image cultures. WASPLab\u2122 connects WASP\u00aeDT Walk-Away Specimen Processor to the smart incubators using a conveyor track. In the incubators, the plates are imaged so they can be read digitally and when they are ready to be read. This moves the Microbiology laboratory from a batch process to a continuous workflow, reducing turnaround times for increased targeted intervention. TriCore Reference Laboratories considers this investment important for improving accessibility of diagnostic data to continue to increase the clinical significance of the laboratory for better population health management.\n\n\n\n\"With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the changes to healthcare, TriCore Reference Laboratories is pioneering change in the way laboratories think about patient care and is moving from a volume-based system to a value-based system, which is in line with COPAN's vision for the future,\" stated COPAN Diagnostics' CEO, Norman Sharples. \"We are really excited about TriCore selecting COPAN as its partner for full laboratory automation in Microbiology, as our companies share similar visions of reshaping the way healthcare is delivered, taking advantage of informatics and digital imaging,\" concluded Sharples.\n\nAbout COPAN Group\n\nWith a reputation for innovation, Copan is the leading manufacturer of collection and transport systems in the world. Copan's collaborative approach to preanalytics has resulted in Flocked Swabs, ESwab\u2122, Universal Transport Medium\n\nand laboratory automation, WASP\u00ae and WASPLab. Copan carries a range of microbial sampling products, inoculation loops, and pipettes.
