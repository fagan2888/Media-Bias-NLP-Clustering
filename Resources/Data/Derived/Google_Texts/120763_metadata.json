The vehicle is a mix of an RV and a doctor's office.\n\nHighmark plans to target at-risk members who often forgo medical care, Gray told reporters on the North Shore from one of the mobile clinic's two patient exam rooms.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is bringing those members in, delivering the care, making sure it's convenient and connecting them with providers and the health plan,\u201d she said.\n\nHighmark refurbished the truck, which had been used as a pop-up wellness center, for about $350,000. Gray, a registered nurse, said it will cost about $500,000 annually to keep it on the road.\n\nMobile clinics are going through a renaissance, said Caterina Hill, a Harvard Medical School research associate and co-investigator of the national Mobile Health Map project. The project evaluates the impact of mobile clinics.\n\n\u201cBecause of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are now responsible for a lot of people they were not responsible for before,\u201d Hill said. \u201cCreative investments like mobile clinics focus on prevention.\u201d\n\nShe said there are 2,000 such clinics across the country, yielding about 6 million annual visits.\n\nHighmark's wheelchair-accessible mobile office is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and contains refrigeration to store laboratory specimens and medicine. Services available include annual checkups and immunizations; colorectal cancer screenings; smoking and tobacco-use cessation counseling; blood draws; osteoporosis testing for women; and postpartum care.\n\nBesides two exam rooms, the clinic has a waiting area and a laboratory.\n\nThe clinic will open in June at an undetermined location in West Virginia to serve regional patients.\n\nGray estimated the clinic could serve 20 to 30 patients a day.\n\nHighmark has said that providing medical care for people who buy insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act's marketplace is costing more than the insurer anticipated, as people across the country who have purchased those plans have been sicker than expected.\n\nGray said the aim of the mobile unit is to emphasize preventative health that can help keep health care costs down.\n\n\u201cThis is a longer-term play,\u201d she said. \u201cFrankly, from the business side, we want to see what the value is and uptake is from our members. That is why we are initially launching small with one mobile clinic. Then we will determine where to take the program next.\u201d\n\nHill called mobile clinics a \u201cwin-win\u201d for insurers and patients.\n\n\u201cIt's really important for insurance companies to find ways to encourage customers to stay healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cHighmark will be able to save lives and money in the long run.\u201d\n\nHighmark plans to contact members it identifies as having certain medical needs and invite them to the clinic.\n\n\u201cTo have the opportunity to bring the provider and payer together in a very different way will hopefully provide models that will solve the health care crisis in the country,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAside from world peace and world hunger, there's nothing more important than fixing the health care issues we have in our country. To be able to bring this mobile clinic out to our underserved populations is almost a dream come true.\u201d\n\nBen Schmitt is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
