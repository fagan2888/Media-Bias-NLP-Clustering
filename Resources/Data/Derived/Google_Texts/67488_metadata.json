Imagine going through labor in hand-cuffs or leg restraints. The Patrick administration is taking steps to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen in any jails or prisons in this state.\n\nMassachusetts is moving closer to joining 18 states that prohibit putting restraints on prisoners while they\u2019re in labor. That\u2019s thanks to a regulation that Governor Deval Patrick announced yesterday.\n\n\u201cRegulation is good, but here, law is better. The legislature is considering a bill that would make this ban law. I want to be clear that I support this bill and I urge the legislature to send it to my desk for signature this session,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nState undersecretary of criminal justice Sandra McCroom says the practice was already prohibited at state-run prisons, but the new rule also applies to county houses of corrections operated by sheriffs.\n\n\u201cSheriffs are all independent elected officials, and their policies aren\u2019t regulated by us in any way. So now the Governor has insisted that the Department of Corrections create immediate regulations that resolve that issue,\u201d she said.\n\nThe executive director of the Massachusetts Sheriffs\u2019 Association says he knows of no sheriffs who permit women to be shackled during labor, but activists, including the group NARAL Pro-Choice, say they\u2019ve heard otherwise. Megan Amundson, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice, says, \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from facilities across the state that the practice is still happening. We are hearing from doctors and from women that they are being shackled during labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey Would Not Remove The Cuffs\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in active labor the jail medical staff had denied that I was in the late stages of labor that I was,\u201d said Kenzie, a woman who asked that WBUR only use her first name because she doesn\u2019t want any more problems with the criminal justice system.\n\nKenzie says she was restrained by correctional officers from the Western Massachusetts Regional Women\u2019s Correctional facility.\n\n\u201cThis being my sixth child, I kept telling them that it was time. They just kept denying me, saying I wasn\u2019t really that far into labor because I was not hysterically screaming. It wasn\u2019t until I had said that I had the urge to push that they decided to take me seriously,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn the car ride there, I asked if they could remove my cuffs because I needed to be able to hang on, and, not only, so I didn\u2019t fly around the hard plastic seats but also just to brace myself and be able to not push, and they would not remove the cuffs.\u201d\n\nAnd she says the restraints stayed on once she got to the hospital, driven there by two correctional officers \u2014 one male and one female. The female correctional officer stayed with her during delivery.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Right immediately after delivery, they immediately shackled my leg to the bed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, no woman should ever have to go through that. If you ever delivered and had a child you would understand.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kenzie\n\n\u201cI was in the emergency room, and it took a lot of convincing but the CO finally had taken the cuffs off of me so I could take my pants off and be able to get checked and get onto the bed safely,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Kenzie says she was back in cuffs pretty quickly.\n\n\u201cWe left the jail at 9:50 a.m. and my son was born at 10:01 a.m. and right immediately after delivery, they immediately shackled my leg to the bed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, no woman should ever have to go through that. If you ever delivered and had a child you would understand.\n\nWe asked a representative of Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe for comment. Patricia Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of the Western Regional Correctional Center, says the facility has had a policy for some twenty years not to shackle during labor. She admits the restraints are allowed during transport from the correctional facility to a hospital. She says that even under the Governor\u2019s new policy, restraints during transport are allowed.\n\nKenzie is out of jail now after serving 15 months of an 18-month sentence.\n\nBefore her release, her son was diagnosed with leukemia. He\u2019s in remission now, but she says she spends a lot of time traveling with him from Western Massachusetts to Boston for medical treatment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post was expanded on 2/25 with additional material, including the response from Patricia Murphy of the Western Regional Correctional Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine being a prisoner and going through labor in handcuffs or leg restraints.
