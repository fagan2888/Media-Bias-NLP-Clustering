That morning their pastor handed them $500 checks.\n\nThe Rev. Laura Truax, pastor of the evangelical church in Chicago's Near North neighborhood, told worshippers that the money came with no strings attached, only encouragement to do good works and an early December deadline to either spend, cash or deposit the checks.\n\nThe money, totaling $160,000, came from a windfall of more than $1.6 million \u2014 proceeds from the sale of Atrium Village, a racially integrated housing development that was the collaboration of four neighborhood churches: Fourth Presbyterian, St. Matthew United Methodist, Holy Family Lutheran and LaSalle.\n\nWhile each church has managed the income differently, LaSalle began by setting aside the traditional tithe \u2014 10 percent of its share \u2014 for about 320 of its worshippers.\n\nSince handing out the checks, Truax has witnessed the sort of extraordinary generosity that Christmas is all about.\n\n\"The birth of Jesus was the most generous act of humankind,\" Truax said. \"The fact that God generously offers his son to the world, being willing to let Christ's life unfold as it was meant to unfold, being willing to trust that Joseph is going to be a father to Jesus, that Mary is going to be a fit mother, that Jesus, the human Jesus, is going to choose God, seems to be the most gracious, open-handed gift of generosity we could ever conceive of.\"\n\nHow a 'reverse tithe' is inspiring good Pastor Laura Truax of LaSalle Street Church gave 10 percent back to her congregants in the form of $500 checks. Truax hoped the reverse tithe would inspire some good in the world.

A few endorsed their checks right back to the church. Truax shared her check with her son, a college student in Minnesota, so he could buy winter coats for disadvantaged students he tutors there.\n\nTruax hopes the variety of causes will help shape the congregation's discussion about where the rest of the $1.6 million should go. Many congregants have joined one of about 15 prayer schools in people's homes and via conference calls to discern the answer. Multicolored ink on a dry erase board in the church's basement spells out dozens of ideas.\n\nTruax said her No. 1 concern is the tension that could emerge in the congregation as it begins to winnow down the possibilities for the remainder of the treasure. After all, the New Testament says money is the root of \"all sorts of sin.\"\n\n\"It can change institutions and how you view the other person and understand motivations,\" she said. \"That's why I felt this tithe was so important and giving it to people and letting them do whatever they wanted with it and letting them hear all these amazing ways other people are being led. It might open space in each one of us to recognize there are many wonderful ideas, not one of them is any better than the other idea.\"\n\n\"There will hopefully be a blessed blend of advocacy and open-handedness with each other,\" she said. \"We'll be able to be generous both in our spirit and the way we talk about these things with each other.\"\n\nHere's a look at how some of the parishioners spent \u2014 and didn't spend \u2014 their $500.\n\n'Keeping people comfortable'\n\nFaith Bonecutter has been a member of LaSalle Street Church since 1975 and remembers the spirit of the Atrium Village project \u2014 to bring together people from the Gold Coast, Cabrini-Green and Near North neighborhoods along with nearby students.\n\nAtrium also housed the church's offices and ministries, including a counseling center and the Sunday school her daughter attended. She wanted to invest her money in an organization similarly devoted to housing.\n\n\"The purpose of our involvement from those days, as I understood it, was really about social and racial and economic justice \u2014 to bring those divergent communities together,\" she said.\n\nBut Bonecutter, 61, a social work educator at the University of Illinois at Chicago, became overwhelmed every time she considered the level of need facing any organization or individual, always coming to the conclusion that $500 just wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\"I was really struggling and praying about it and not coming up with too much,\" she said.\n\nOn the third anniversary of her father's death in November, Bonecutter heard Truax preach a sermon encouraging members to choose a cause that's personally important. Bonecutter thought about how important it was to her father, who was 96 when he died, to live independently until the end. She remembered that a good friend who had been a pastor at LaSalle when it helped develop Atrium Village now led an agency called HOME \u2014 Housing Opportunities and Maintenance for the Elderly. The solution had been right under her nose.\n\n\"All of those things came together for me,\" she said. \"It was honoring, in a sense, the original intention of Atrium Village: housing and keeping people comfortable in their communities and with each other.\"\n\nBruce Otto, executive director of HOME and a former pastor of LaSalle for 23 years, said Bonecutter's contribution arrived on Giving Tuesday, when another foundation agreed to match donations \u2014 doubling Bonecutter's gift. That gift will finance upkeep programs, affordable housing and handicapped-accessible grocery shopping for senior citizens.\n\n'He speaks life'\n\nWhen Chris Ford suffered a heart attack last year, he began to rethink his priorities. A former high school and college football player, Ford, 53, stepped back from his real estate career in July and volunteered as the linebackers coach at North Lawndale College Prep, a charter school on Chicago's West Side.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Church gives congregants $500 each to do good", "date": "2014-12-25", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Christmas came early for people in the pews of LaSalle Street Church the first Sunday in September.
