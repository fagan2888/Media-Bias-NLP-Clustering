So far, it looks a lot like the life she had before, with four to six hours of training each day starting at 5:30 a.m., and a packed slate of upcoming races.\n\nThis time, though, she will get to cash in.\n\n\u201cI would have given anything to swim another two years in college,\u201d she said Monday in Denver at a luncheon for the Association for Women in Sports Media. \u201cBut I truly feel this is going to be the best thing, to set me up financially and get my career going.\u201d\n\nWith 22 medals from the Olympics, world championships and Pan Pacific championships, multiple records, and four individual and one team NCAA title, it\u2019s hard to imagine there could still be a \u201cfirst\u201d for Franklin. But in June, the Regis Jesuit High School graduate will make her pro debut at the Arena Pro Swim Series in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nFranklin said she will stay here through the summer and train with her longtime coach, Todd Schmitz, and the Colorado Stars. After the world championships in Kazan, Russia, in August, she will re-evaluate her options regarding her training schedule as she prepares for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhavala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Life as pro \u201cthe best thing\u201d for Missy Franklin", "title": "Life as pro \u201cthe best thing\u201d for Missy Franklin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/25/life-as-pro-the-best-thing-for-missy-franklin/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__missy-franklinp1.jpg", "height": 497}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__missy-franklinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-25T19:28:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:50:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Missy Franklin"}, "article_summary": "But while many of her friends embark on summer vacations, Franklin, 20, is transitioning to life as a professional.\nThe life of Missy Franklin seems to have changed more on paper than in reality.\nAfter the world championships in Kazan, Russia, in August, she will re-evaluate her options regarding her training schedule as she prepares for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\u201cI would have given anything to swim another two years in college,\u201d she said Monday in Denver at a luncheon for the Association for Women in Sports Media.\nBut in June, the Regis Jesuit High School graduate will make her pro debut at the Arena Pro Swim Series in Santa Clara, Calif.Franklin said she will stay here through the summer and train with her longtime coach, Todd Schmitz, and the Colorado Stars."}
