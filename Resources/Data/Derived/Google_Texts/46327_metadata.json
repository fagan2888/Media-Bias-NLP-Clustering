Yeah, that\u2019s not Peter Thiel\u2019s style. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nEntrepreneur Peter Thiel has been making the media rounds lately as he promotes his book, Zero to One. The PayPal co-founder and first outside investor in Facebook is notoriously blunt and provocative. In the past week, he\u2019s said of Twitter \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a horribly mismanaged company \u2014 probably a lot of pot-smoking going on there.\u201d He\u2019s also shared eye-catching tidbits, such as that four of the six PayPal founders \u2014 a distinguished group renown for its later successes \u2014 built bombs in high school.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Thiel, who is a libertarian, found himself at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. Just a stone\u2019s throw from the White House, he didn\u2019t hold back his views of America\u2019s government during an entertaining hour-long talk with AEI\u2019s James K. Glassman. From the NSA to the FDA, Thiel had stern words.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when our government actually was able to plan things better, we were able to get a Manhattan Project and in three and a half years you could build a nuclear bomb. Or in the 1960s, you could do Apollo and get to the moon within a decade,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cToday we\u2019re sort of living in a time when you sort of get a sense that a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost in the mailroom.\u201d\n\nHe said this of HealthCare.gov: \u201cEven as a hard-core libertarian, I would not have thought that the Obamacare Web site wouldn\u2019t work. That is not something I predicted. Because building a Web site that works is much easier than building a functioning nuclear bomb.\u201d\n\nThiel also touched on the NSA and Edward Snowden.\n\n\u201cThe first thing a spy agency is supposed to do is it\u2019s supposed to figure out, is there anyone inside who\u2019s spying on them and if you have someone in the IT department downloading all the files, that normally gets people\u2019s attention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would never happen even in a Facebook, Google. Even in a Silicon Valley company, that would never happen. And once somebody had downloaded all the files, you say \u2018Okay they ran away to Russia,\u2019 you\u2019d be able to figure that out.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out how the world of atoms \u2014 which is heavily regulated \u2014 has had far less innovation than the world of bits, which is lightly regulated.\n\n\u201cIf the FDA decided it was going to start looking at video games and seeing whether it did damage to people\u2019s brains, whether they\u2019re addictive, what sort of effect did they have on your brain, you\u2019d have far less innovation in video game technology than you\u2019ve had before,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile admitting there could be a place for regulation regarding telecommunications powers Comcast and Verizon, Thiel saw flaws in most regulation of technologies.\n\n\u201cThe history of government involvement with technology has been quite bad. I think the whole anti-trust thing against IBM with 20-20 hindsight feels like it was completely unnecessary because things were shifting to software and away from IBM already in the 70\u2019s and definitely by the early 80\u2019s,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cThe Microsoft antitrust thing, I suspect Microsoft would have lost ground in the age of the Internet with or without the government doing it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Bitcoin, Thiel cautioned that government could ruin its potential by shutting it down.\n\n\u201cI think we have a very poorly functioning government, so it\u2019s quite possible they will decide slowly over the next 10 or 15 years to do something,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment wasn\u2019t the only area to draw Thiel\u2019s ire \u2014 he also touched on education.\n\n\u201cWe have an education bubble today that is as distorted and crazy as the housing bubble the of last decade,\u201d Thiel said.\n\nAs a graduate of a private college where the tuition and fees have gone up 86 percent since I enrolled 13 years ago, I think he\u2019s onto something.
