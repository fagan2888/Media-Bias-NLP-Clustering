(WCBI/MSU Athletics) \u2013 Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott was named the winner of the 19th annual C Spire Conerly Trophy, the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum announced Tuesday night. Prescott is the first MSU quarterback and the sixth Bulldog overall to win the award, which is presented to the best college football player in the state of Mississippi.\n\n\u201cI am grateful and honored to be named the recipient of this year\u2019s Conerly Trophy,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWhen you think of the great players to have played the game I love in this state, it is a very humbling experience.\u201d\n\nPrescott, also a Maxwell Award and Davey O\u2019Brien finalist, earned the honor after finishing the regular season ranked fifth in the FBS with 228 points responsible for and sixth with 327.9 yards of total offense per game. Thanks to shattering 10 single-season school records, the Haughton, La., native led the Maroon and White to its first 10-win regular season in school history, as well as its first No. 1 ranking in school history.\n\nAlong with 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, Prescott is the only FBS player in the last seven seasons to average at least 240 yards passing and 75 yards rushing per game. With his success and leadership, State has been ranked in the top-10 for a program-best nine-consecutive weeks.\n\nPrescott won the fan vote, which accounted for 10 percent of the final vote. The other 90 percent was made up of votes from a statewide panel of media. With current Oakland Raiders\u2019 rookie Gabe Jackson capturing the award last fall, Tuesday marked the second time in history one school won the trophy in consecutive years (Mississippi State, 2009-10). Prescott is the fourth Bulldog in the past six years to win the honor, which debuted in 1996.\n\nBulldog fans can leave Prescott a congratulatory message at his official Facebook page, Facebook.com/DakPrescott.\n\nMississippi State Conerly Trophy Winners\n\n2014 \u2013 Dak Prescott, Quarterback\n\n2013 \u2013 Gabe Jackson, Offensive Lineman\n\n2010 \u2013 Chris White, Linebacker\n\n2009 \u2013 Anthony Dixon, Running Back\n\n2005 \u2013 Jerious Norwood, Running Back\n\n1998 \u2013 J.J.
