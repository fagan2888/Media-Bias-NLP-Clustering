The rich are different from you and me. They got a real recovery. Or one at all.

According to the latest figures from economist Emmanuel Saez, the top 1 percent received 95 percent of all real income gains between 2009 and 2012. In 2011, when real real income fell for the bottom 99 percent, the top percentile accounted for 121 percent of the year's income gains.

In 2012, inflation-adjusted incomes rose for the rest of us, but only barely. Meanwhile, the richest percentile got a 19 percent raise. They now account for 22.5 percent of total U.S. income. That's the fourth-highest share in at least 100 years (as far back as Saez keeps track). The only years with greater income inequality were the two years before the Great Recession, 2006 and 2007, and the year before the Great Depression, 1928.

Why was 2012 such a boom year for the top 1 percent? Stocks, taxes, and ... something else. See, the story of the rise and rise of the super-rich the past 30 years has been the story of the return of the rentiers. The Reagan revolution freed the top 1 percent, and particularly the top 0.1 percent, to once again tie themselves to deregulated, and buoyant (if not frothy), markets. And they have. Their incomes have recently tracked the S&P 500 pretty well -- and 2012 was a good year for the stock index, as it finished up more than 11.6 percent.
