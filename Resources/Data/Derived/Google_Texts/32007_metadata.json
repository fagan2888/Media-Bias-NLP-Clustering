Unfortunately we don\u2019t have an estimated time of re-opening the highway during the commute,\u201d Trooper Josh Lewis said. \u201cWe need special equipment to clear the semi.\u201d\n\nLewis said the accident happened around 8 a.m. after the semi and a car collided. No one was injured in the accident, he said.\n\nRichard Gorman, who lives about 50 feet from that stretch highway, heard the crash and was the first on scene, he said.\n\n\u201cI heard dragging and scraping, then saw a cloud of dust moving down the highway,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nLumber from the semi crushed the car driven by a man and a woman, Gorman said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look in the window, but then I saw they were both standing outside the car,\u201d he said. \u201cI was surprised they were alive.\u201d\n\nOther than some minor scapes, both of the car\u2019s occupants were uninjured, Gorman said.\n\n\u201cThey said they were from out of town and were immediately on the phone with family and with insurance company,\u201d he said.\n\nThe semi spilled the load of lumber across both sides of the highway for about a quarter of a mile, Gorman said.\n\nThe semi truck driver did not sustain any serious injures, it appeared, Gorman said.\n\nGorman has lived at the location for three years and said accidents in the area are common, but Friday\u2019s was one of the worst he had witnessed.\n\nLewis recommended that commuters find an alternative route to Denver.\n\nTravelers can take Colorado Highway 9 North to U.S. Highway 40 or Colorado Highway 9 South to U.S. Highway 285.\n\nAbout 3 p.m. the Colorado Department of Transportation reported that the clean-up was continuing, although the left lane of eastbound I-70 opened about 10:30 a.m. Exit 228 remained closed, as well as the right lane.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eastbound I-70 jammed near Georgetown following semi roll-over", "title": "Eastbound I-70 jammed near Georgetown following semi roll-over", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/06/eastbound-i-70-jammed-near-georgetown-following-semi-roll-over/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__georgetown_truck_accidentp1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__georgetown_truck_accidentp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-06T08:47:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:56:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbada\"", "article_summary": "Travelers can take Colorado Highway 9 North to U.S. Highway 40 or Colorado Highway 9 South to U.S. Highway 285.\n\u201cI heard dragging and scraping, then saw a cloud of dust moving down the highway,\u201d Gorman said.\nThe semi truck driver did not sustain any serious injures, it appeared, Gorman said.\n\u201cWe need special equipment to clear the semi.\u201dLewis said the accident happened around 8 a.m. after the semi and a car collided.\nThe semi spilled the load of lumber across both sides of the highway for about a quarter of a mile, Gorman said."}
