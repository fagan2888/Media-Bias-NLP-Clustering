We\u2019re just a big exchange,\u201d he said. \u201cLong before the words \u2018health insurance\u2019 and \u2018exchange\u2019 were in the same sentence, we\u2019ve been doing this. We\u2019re like the Amazon.com of health insurers.\u201d\n\nThe executive told O\u2019Reilly that he\u2019d backed Obamacare from the very beginning. \u201cI\u2019ve been a supporter of this bill long before it became legislation,\u201d he said, \u201cand I feel strongly about it. There\u2019s some things I like. I happen to be a cancer survivor, so I\u2019m a beneficiary of this legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve really just broken with this,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhen I heard the president say that it\u2019s fixed.\u201d He noted that his company\u2019s position between the private and public sector means they\u2019re \u201cright in the middle of it. We see a lot of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been arguing with people in government for years now to include the private sector \u2014 let us be a partner, let us help make this thing work,\u201d he claimed. \u201cBut today, you still got a lot of ideology, a lot of ideologues who believe the way to make this work is through government and government alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the federal government exchange, Healthcare.gov, is probably working somewhat better \u2014 although we\u2019re working close to it, it\u2019s got a lot of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got 14 states that have built exchanges. There\u2019s one that works OK \u2014 that\u2019s my home state of California \u2014 but there are others that are just a mess!\u201d\n\nLauer noted that Sebelius did give a slight \u201cwaiver\u201d to his company to allow them to assist subsidized senior citizens on Healthcare.gov. But he also said that all 14 state exchanges have resisted his company\u2019s offer of assistance.\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
