The health care giants that own Ocala Regional Medical Center, West Marion Community Hospital and lease Munroe Regional Medical Center are no exceptions.\n\nDriving an increase in stock value are the Affordable Care Act and expanded Medicaid in many states (although not Florida). This provides more people with health insurance and thus more access to hospitals.\n\nHCA shares reached $74.65 on Friday, up from $48.77 a year ago. HCA owns Ocala Health System, the parent company of Ocala Regional and West Marion.\n\nCommunity Health Systems, now the largest chain by hospital count since absorbing Health Management Associates in January, saw its stock climb to $55.10 on Friday, up from $41.35 a year ago.\n\nHCA reported third-quarter 2014 revenues of $9.22 billion, a 9 percent increase over the same quarter in 2013.\n\nNet income for HCA Holdings Inc. totaled $518 million during the third quarter, according to company earnings reports.\n\nCHS saw third-quarter revenues of $4.8 billion, a 51.1 percent increase compared with $3.2 billion for the same period in 2013. The increase in revenue also reflects revenues from newly acquired HMA.\n\nCHS' adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the three months ending Sept. 30 was $663 million, compared with $382 million for the same period in 2013, according to company reports.\n\nAt first glance, the positive stock performance might seem out of line with the recent trend in health care spending. Year-over-year increases in overall health spending have been modest in the past five years, with a high annual increase of 3.4 percent (2012 compared to 2011) and a low of 2.9 percent (2013 compared to 2012), according to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, which uses federal data.\n\n\"The share of gross domestic product devoted to health care spending has remained at 17.4 percent since 2009,\" the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported last month.\n\nBut spending \"is projected to pick up again as the economy improves, as more people are covered under the Affordable Care Act, and as the population ages,\" Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted in a recent op-ed piece.\n\n\"By 2020 growth in per capita health spending is projected to be almost twice the current rate,\" Altman wrote.\n\nThe ACA factor can't be overstated. HCA \"has reported its self-pay and charity-care adjusted admissions decreased to 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014, compared with 8.1 percent the previous year,\" according to Becker's Hospital Review, which cited Moody's Investment Services information.\n\nAs for CHS: It \"anticipates its self-pay adjusted admissions will drop from 8 percent to 4 percent during the next three years because of the shrinking uninsured population,\" according to Becker's review of the Moody's research.\n\nCHS continues to get positive attention from analysts because of its busy 2014.\n\n\"The company announced agreements to sell Riverview Regional Medical Center and Dallas Regional Medical Center to Prime Healthcare Services. Further, it announced the sale of Harris Hospital to White County Medical Center of Searcy, Arkansas. All these divestitures are expected to complete early 2015,\" Zacks Investment Research reported earlier this month.\n\nZacks also noted CHS' big acquisitions during 2014: the $3.9 billion takeover of HMA and the takeovers of Sharon Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania, Natchez Regional Medical Center in Mississippi and Gaffney Medical Center in South Carolina.\n\n\"The acquisitions are expected to add up to $40 million in annual revenues for the company,\" Zacks reported. \"We feel that the company's strategy to divest its small hospital assets will help it to focus on large hospitals in growing non-urban areas. On the other hand, strategic acquisitions will improve (the) company's penetration, which will improve its competitive position against\" competitors.\n\nOf 18 brokers surveyed at the beginning of the year by Zacks, 10 listed the CHS stock as a \"strong buy,\" three had it at \"buy\" and five had it at \"hold.\"\n\nMarket Realist considers HCA \"one of the top-performing stocks in the health care industry,\" according to a Dec. 31 report. Analysts surveyed by Thompson/First Call have the stock at \"strong buy\" or \"buy.\"\n\nHealth care companies in general saw about a 23 percent stock value increase during the past year, which placed the sector third in the S&P 500 sector race behind utilities and technology.\n\nPart of that increase is attributable to more people getting health insurance, according to a Health Affairs/USA Today/Kaiser Health News report. CHS, HCA and Tenet Healthcare said the number of uninsured patients dropped by one-third during the first quarter of 2014 at hospitals in states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nAaron Liberman, professor emeritus from the University of Central Florida's Department of Health Management & Informatics, said the increase in hospital stock values is to be expected. Before the implementation of ACA and expanded Medicaid, about 18 percent of American adults were uninsured. That has fallen to 13.4 percent, according to recent polls.\n\n\"Now hospitals have a new crop of paying customers coming to them,\" said Allan Baumgarten of Allan Baumgarten's Health Market Reviews and Consulting. \"The changes in insurance and Medicaid have been very beneficial to hospitals.\"\n\nBut it may not be all smooth sailing for hospital companies.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will consider another challenge to the ACA, specifically addressing the constitutionality of subsidies for insurance bought on the federal marketplace.\n\nA vote against the ACA could shake confidence in hospital stocks. The loss of such subsidies could cost hospital chains about 3.5 percent of estimated 2016 earnings, said A.J. Rice, an analyst at UBS, in a note to clients.\n\nManaging editor Jim Ross contributed to this report.
