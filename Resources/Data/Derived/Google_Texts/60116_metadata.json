And I like to think I keep up with the latest in word news.\n\nMost of these are British or Australian coinages, and haven't made it to the U.S. yet. I plan to do my part for al desko and mahoosive at the very least.\n\n1. AL DESKO\n\nA play on al fresco, which means \"dining outside,\" this word is perfect for the way we live now, wolfing down food at our desks while messing around on the computer.\n\n2. MAHOOSIVE\n\nEven bigger than massive. And it sounds that way doesn't it? The new ginormous.\n\n3. MAMIL\n\nStands for \"middle aged man in Lycra\" and has to do with the current cycling craze. Observe the MAMIL in his natural habitat. His bike is expensive and his outfit is way more professional than it has to be.\n\n4. MARMITE\n\nIt's yeasty. It's salty. You love it or you hate it. And now it's \"used in reference to something that tends to arouse strongly positive or negative reactions rather than indifference.\"\n\n5. SHINY BUM\n\nAn Australian term for a bureaucrat or office worker. Not sure what the imagery is here. They sit so much their bums get shiny? They spend their time polishing their bums for kissing?\n\n6. SILVERTAIL\n\nAustralian for \"person who is socially prominent or displays social aspirations.\"\n\n7. SIMPLES\n\nBritish word \"used to convey that something is very straightforward.\"\n\n8. STICKER LICKER\n\nHow Australians refer to the person who issues parking fines.\n\n9. THE ANT'S PANTS\n\nThis Australian version of \"the bee's knees\" is the cat's pajamas.\n\n10. TIKI-TAKA\n\nTerm for a style of soccer play \"involving highly accurate short passing and an emphasis on retaining possession of the ball.\"\n\n11.
