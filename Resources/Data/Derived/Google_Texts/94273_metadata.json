On the surface, it seems that few of the interviewees want the same things.\n\nSome of the young people, the job seekers, simply want employment when they graduate college, and they hope their (often expensive) education provides them the tools to be competitive. Others, the innovators, crave an economy free of regulations so they can pursue their dreams unimpeded.\n\nAnd still others, the world weary, just hope to be safe, to feel protected and to see their country use its power to overcome threats.\n\nBut though the college students see the world differently, they really want the same thing.\n\nThey want a leader who can carry out their vision for America, and they came here to find that person.\n\nCreate and Innovate\n\nBurns is clear about what he would like in an ideal world.\n\n\u201cI like free enterprise,\u201d said Burns, listing Donald Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as potential Republican presidential candidates who impressed him at CPAC.\n\n\u201cI like innovation. I like straight-forward, to-the-point guys. I don\u2019t care about age. I just want someone who can get the job done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want someone who can get the job done,\u201d says Zachary Burns, 19.\n\nMike Battey, a 21-year-old conference attendee, argues that Republicans should avoid talking about things that \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily matter.\u201d\n\nNamely, Battey says, that means leaving alone the sensitive issue of same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be out of marriage because it\u2019s not a legislative function of government,\u201d Battey said. \u201cWhoever someone else decides to marry doesn\u2019t impact my life.\u201d\n\nConcerns: Home and Abroad:\n\nBriana Jamshid, a 20-year-old student at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, is ready to fight for what she believes America\u2019s role in the world should be.\n\nJamshid is enlisted in the Army National Guard. She\u2019s honored to serve her country, but she hopes to do so in the right places.\n\n\u201cISIS needs to be eliminated,\u201d says Jamshid, who claims to be open-minded about which politician she would support in that mission. \u201cWe definitely should be boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria. But we should stay out of the Ukraine conflict.\u201d\n\nAaron Hass, a 22-year-old student at State University of New York at Oneonta, is similarly concerned about the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe Middle East is vital to our trade,\u201d says Hass, who is a fan of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \u201cIt is vital to defend the nation of Israel. They are a minority in the world and they need to know they have a friend. America is the big dog in the world. If you pet the big dog it will be your friend. If not, it will bite.\u201d\n\nBefore Audrey Rusnak, 21, can fret about taking on the world, she has a more top-of-mind concern.\n\n\u201cCollege is too expensive,\u201d says Rusnak, who admirers Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s rags-to-riches story. \u201cI just hope it pays off in landing me a job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In interviews with The Daily Signal, college students attending the largest conservative conference of the year explain the issues that matter to them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In interviews with The Daily Signal, college students attending the largest conservative conference of the year explain the issues that matter to them.", "title": "The Issues That Will Win Over College Kids in 2016", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150302_YouthVote_Feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-27T14:05:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GortSE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In interviews with The Daily Signal, college students attending the largest conservative conference of the year explain the issues that matter to them.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150302_YouthVote_Feature.jpg"}, "title": "The Issues That Will Win Over College Kids in 2016", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-03-05T17:17:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:05:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, Rand Paul, CPAC, Marco Rubio, Net Neutrality, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Chris Christie, Federal Reserve, ISIS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf82f\"", "article_summary": "But though the college students see the world differently, they really want the same thing.\nIn a totally unscientific method, The Daily Signal interviewed multiple college students at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, outside Washington D.C. to find out what issues they care about going into the 2016 presidential race.\n\u201cCollege is too expensive,\u201d says Rusnak, who admirers Florida Sen.
