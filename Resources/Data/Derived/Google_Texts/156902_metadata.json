He\u2019d be much bet\u00adter served drop\u00adping out and hold\u00ading on to his seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we hope he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Dems have a good can\u00addid\u00adate, [Paul\u2019s] seat is win\u00adnable for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe bet\u00adter, be\u00adcause he is go\u00ading nowhere in the pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial race, and he could in\u00adduce a real op\u00adpon\u00adent to jump in.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on his cam\u00adpaign live-streams, Rand not only needs to lower his sights; he also needs a hug.\u201d\n\nNo\n\n\u201cWould be awe\u00adsome if he lost both elec\u00adtions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly be\u00adcause I think Dems could win that seat if he con\u00adtin\u00adues to ig\u00adnore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet, still could catch light\u00adning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that field, any\u00adthing still seems pos\u00adsible\u2014but he should re\u00adfo\u00adcus on me\u00addia train\u00ading to make him\u00adself less stiff and more likable.\u201d\n\nQ: Should Sen.

The pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial thing didn\u2019t work out and he\u2019s not even con\u00adtrib\u00adut\u00ading a dif\u00adfer\u00adent per\u00adspect\u00adive on the race. No point in go\u00ading for\u00adward.\u201d\n\n\u201cUn\u00adless he has the Ru\u00adbio dis\u00adease and just hates the Sen\u00adate, he needs to face facts. He is young enough that he can try this again an\u00adoth\u00ader time. Out of of\u00adfice he will simply fade out of sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe V.P.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sen\u00adate is a fine place and worth fight\u00ading for.\u201d\n\nNo\n\n\u201cRand Paul doesn\u2019t de\u00adserve to be [in] the Sen\u00adate any more than he does the White House.
