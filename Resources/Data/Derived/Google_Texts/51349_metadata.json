And then, of course, there\u2019s the 17 major singles championships.\n\n\u201cWhen we were starting the match and they were talking about all her Grand Slam titles, it was quite impressive,\u201d Ivanovic said, recalling the pre-match introductions. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think much about the occasion and who I was playing, because it can get overwhelming.\u201d\n\nTrue to her word, Ivanovic, who had never won a set against Williams in four previous meetings, took on the biggest serve in women\u2019s tennis without fear. And she hit pinpoint forehands \u2014 20 of 33 winners were on that side \u2014 to all areas of the court. Williams, who later revealed she was carrying a back injury, didn\u2019t even bother trying to chase some of them down.\n\nJust under two hours later, it was game, set and match: 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and an upset victory to put Ivanovic into the quarterfinals of the Australian Open for the first time since her run to the final in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy playing such a champion \u2026 but she is also just a human,\u201d said Ivanovic. \u201cI just went out there swinging.\u201d\n\nWilliams never got into the swing of things, at least not to way Ivanovic expected. She noticed from the outset that Williams\u2018 serve seemed to lack its usual zip. Williams also made some very uncharacteristic errors on her backhand, a telltale sign of back pain.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best,\u201d Williams admitted later, sounding surprised when asked about the back injury. Her coach had let it slip after the players walked off the court that Williams had been experiencing back pain for days.\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t want to blame anything. I feel like Ana deserves all the credit,\u201d Williams added. \u201cI feel she played unbelievable today. I think she went for her shots. It\u2019s not like I gave her the match.\u201d\n\nIvanovic will next play 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who had a 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-0 win over local hope Casey Dellacqua.\n\nThe other quarterfinal in Ivanovic\u2019s half will feature two-time finalist Li Na, who beat No. 22 Ekaterina Makarova 6-2, 6-0, and No. 28 Flavia Pennetta, who defeated No. 9 Angelique Kerber 6-1, 4-6, 7-5.\n\nThe men\u2019s draw progressed more according to rankings when three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic and No. 3 David Ferrer advanced to the quarterfinals, along with No. 7 Tomas Berdych and No. 8 Stanislas Wawrinka.\n\nDjokovic continued his bid for a fourth straight Australian title with a 6-3, 6-0, 6-2 win over Fabio Fognini. Ferrer beat Florian Mayer 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 and will next play Berdych, the 2010 Wimbledon finalist.\n\nDjokovic will play Wawrinka, who finished off the Sunday night program at Rod Laver with a 6-3, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (5) win over Tommy Robredo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been elevating my game as the tournament is going on,\u201d said Djokovic, who later entertained the crowd with an impersonation of his new coach, Boris Becker. \u201cThe general feeling on the court, all the shots, using the court position really well, being aggressive, playing my style of the game.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Djokovic\u2019s major threats to the title \u2014 top-seeded Rafael Nadal, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and 17-time Grand Slam singles winner Roger Federer \u2014 will play their fourth-round matches. Two-time defending champion Victoria Azarenka and No. 3 Maria Sharapova are in action on the women\u2019s side.\n\nIvanovic will have the day off \u2014 she\u2019s planning a celebratory dinner with some of her Serbian relatives who live in Melbourne.\n\nAsked if having Williams out of any Grand Slam makes a difference, Ivanovic said it \u201cdefinitely\u201d did, then explained why in effusive terms.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s done so much for the sport, and she\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Ivanovic said. \u201cShe\u2019s such a great athlete and a great person to have on tour. We want her, because it pushes us.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge met on Sunday, Ivanovic, at the urging of several fans, attempted to throw a souvenir towel into the stands. The breeze blew it back at her.\n\nShe was plainly off the mark, perhaps for the only time all day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The No. 14-seeded Ana Ivanovic ended Williams' bid for a sixth Australian and 18th Grand Slam title with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory that took the hottest of favorites out of contention at Melbourne Park and opened up one side of the women's draw.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The No. 14-seeded Ana Ivanovic ended Williams\u2019 bid for a sixth Australian and 18th Grand Slam title with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory that took the hottest of favorites out of contention at Melbourne Park and opened up one side of the women\u2019s draw.", "title": "Australian Open 2014: Serena Williams stunned in first loss since August", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/australian-open-2014-serena-williams-stunned-first/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/australian-open-tennisjpeg-0146d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/australian-open-tennisjpeg-0146d.jpg", "description": "The No. 14-seeded Ana Ivanovic ended Williams' bid for a sixth Australian and 18th Grand Slam title with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory that took the hottest of favorites out of contention at Melbourne Park", "card": "summary", "title": "Australian Open 2014: Serena Williams stunned in first loss since Augu"}, "Author": "Dennis Passa", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ana Ivanovi\u0107, Serena Williams, UN Court, Grand Slam"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0cd\"", "article_summary": "It was her 70th match at the Australian Open, a record in the Open Era.\nWilliams, who later revealed she was carrying a back injury, didn\u2019t even bother trying to chase some of them down.\nHer coach had let it slip after the players walked off the court that Williams had been experiencing back pain for days.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best,\u201d Williams admitted later, sounding surprised when asked about the back injury.\nMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Moments before she started pounding the first of her many winners past Serena Williams at the Australian Open, Ana Ivanovic listened intently to the announcer on Rod Laver Arena outlining the extraordinary accomplishments of the woman soon to be across the net from her."}
