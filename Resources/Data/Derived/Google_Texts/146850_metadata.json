The fast-track process ensures Democrats in the Senate can\u2019t filibuster the legislation and foil yet another attempt to gut the law.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut three conservative members of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s conference \u2014 Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 have already vowed to vote against the current reconciliation package that repeals major parts of Obamacare, arguing it doesn\u2019t go far enough. If those votes don\u2019t budge, McConnell can\u2019t afford to lose any more votes from his 54-member ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, a provision in the reconciliation bill that defunds Planned Parenthood for one year could cause some heartburn for moderates who don\u2019t support stripping money from the women\u2019s health group. The group has come under significant Capitol Hill scrutiny, particularly from Republicans, over whether the organization profited from sales of fetal tissue.\n\n\u201cIt is a mistake to do anything less than a full Obamacare repeal on reconciliation,\u201d Cruz, who is vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, told Politico in a brief interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what Republicans promised the voters we would do, and that\u2019s exactly what we should do.\u201d\n\nFrom the other ideological end of the GOP spectrum, Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she was concerned that the reconciliation bill defunded Planned Parenthood. Still, she said: \u201cI would look at the whole bill.\u201d\n\nAnother moderate Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, has voted against measures to defund the women\u2019s health group, and would likely come under criticism in his uphill reelection bid in the blue state if he switched course on Planned Parenthood on reconciliation. He referred a reporter to a spokeswoman, who declined to comment.\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is a third Senate Republican who has voiced objections in the past to broadly defunding Planned Parenthood. A Murkowski spokeswoman said it was premature to comment on the reconciliation package.\n\nWith a 240-189 vote on Friday, the House passed the reconciliation bill repealing key elements of Obamacare, including the individual and employer mandates as well as two taxes in the health care law \u2013 the Cadillac tax on pricey benefit plans and a tax on medical devices. The bill now goes to the Senate, where leaders have not indicated when senators will take up the legislation.\n\nBut Senate conservatives, as well as activist groups off the Hill, are prodding Republican lawmakers to do more to rip apart Obamacare. Lee said significant portions of the health care law could be addressed through reconciliation, but those provisions are not included in the current version. For example, Lee would like the measure to roll back provisions such as Medicaid expansion and subsidies provided to millions of consumers who purchase health care coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be using reconciliation at all, we ought to use it to repeal as much of Obamacare, as much as we can,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to do that \u2026 we ought not to use it.\u201d\n\nThe Utah senator joined Cruz and Rubio \u2014 who like Cruz is a 2016 presidential contender \u2014 to issue a statement last week that said the trio of conservatives would vote against the reconciliation bill unless it\u2019s changed to repeal as much of Obamacare that is allowed under Senate rules.\n\nThat group didn\u2019t include Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also running for the GOP presidential nomination and would likely feel pressure to align with Cruz and Rubio in making more conservative demands on gutting the health care law.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s repealing Obamacare, I\u2019ll be a yes,\u201d Paul told Politico. When asked whether the partial repeal in the House package is problematic for him, Paul responded: \u201cI\u2019m for repealing the whole thing. I don\u2019t know exactly what will come forward yet.\u201d\n\nPaul, along with Cruz, voted against the Senate Republican budget earlier this year that helped set up the fast-track procedures.\n\nThe reconciliation push is largely a political exercise, since Obama will veto any legislation that shreds key elements of his signature domestic policy achievement. But Republicans want to put the president in a position that forces him to take out his veto pen on an Obamacare repeal \u2014 a position that unifies the GOP, more than five years after the controversial law was enacted.\n\nThe Senate is working with a narrower margin of error than in the House, where just seven House GOP lawmakers opposed the reconciliation package on Friday. And some of those Republicans are moderate members who have previously opposed their party\u2019s attempts to strip funding from Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe limited dissension from House Republicans, some aides said, also showed some waning influence of the feisty outside group Heritage Action, which lobbied GOP lawmakers to oppose the package because it didn\u2019t go far enough to dismantle the health care law.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed since the budget debate is that the House ignored Heritage Action\u2019s attempt to get members to vote against Obamacare repeal and for Planned Parenthood funding,\u201d one senior Republican aide said. \u201cEven the Freedom Caucus thought that was a ridiculous demand.\u201d\n\nHeritage Action, like the three conservative Senate Republicans who have vowed to oppose the reconciliation bill as written, are pushing GOP lawmakers to go much bigger and more fully repeal Obamacare under the fast-track budget procedure.\n\nBut the Senate is limited by special procedural rules that precisely define what can actually be done under reconciliation. The chamber\u2019s parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, would have the final word on what would be allowed under the so-called Byrd rule, named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).\n\nEarlier this year, MacDonough privately hinted to Senate Republican aides that a full repeal of the health care law would not be allowed under the Byrd rule. But, when asked about the parliamentarian\u2019s role in the reconciliation fight, Cruz said last week that \u201cat the end of the day, the Senate parliamentarian is an employee of the Senate\u201d and stressed that all Republicans campaigned on Obamacare repeal.\n\nBut McConnell will allow amendments to the House reconciliation package, and conservatives are sure to offer changes to shape the Obamacare measure more to their liking. There has also been speculation on the Hill that the Planned Parenthood provisions might be subject to the Byrd rule.\n\nRegardless, Democrats are likely to use the health care package \u2014 particularly its measures stripping funding from Planned Parenthood \u2014 as a political cudgel against Senate Republicans up for reelection in blue and purple states in 2016.\n\n\u201cVulnerable Republican senators who have already voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood are desperate to erase their records of reducing access to women\u2019s health care,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cBut voters in 2016 will know without a doubt that these senators are more interested in scoring political points than in supporting women\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "McConnell is having a hard time getting a simple-majority bill through the Senate.", "title": "Obamacare repeal hits resistance from conservatives", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obamacare-repeal-senate-mcconnell-215147", "image": "http://static.politico.com/bd/c2/4985f0464ac3bce03f03cd50233c/mitch-mcconnell-gty-629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "McConnell is having a hard time getting a simple-majority bill through the Senate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senate Republicans\u2019 carefully-laid plans to use a powerful fast-track tool to send an Obamacare repeal to President Barack Obama is running into fresh resistance, with new opposition from high-profile conservatives and bubbling concerns from moderates.\nThere has also been speculation on the Hill that the Planned Parenthood provisions might be subject to the Byrd rule.\n\u201cIt is a mistake to do anything less than a full Obamacare repeal on reconciliation,\u201d Cruz, who is vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, told Politico in a brief interview.\nFor months, the GOP-led Congress has planned to use the procedural maneuver known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to finally shepherd a major Obamacare repeal bill to the president\u2019s desk.\nAlaska Sen.
