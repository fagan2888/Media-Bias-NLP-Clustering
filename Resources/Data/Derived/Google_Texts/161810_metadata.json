But adding a 3% itemized surcharge to customers\u2019 tabs for employee health insurance, as increasing numbers of Los Angeles-area restaurants have been doing over the past year, is one tone-deaf way to go about it.\n\nThough the surcharge may not be intended this way, there\u2019s a \u201cHate Obamacare\u201d element to a line on the bill adding the 3% for restaurant workers\u2019 health insurance. \u201cSee? All this government interference is costing you more money.\u201d\n\nEven taken the reverse way, that customer and employer are colluding for the good of the worker, the times when we treat ourselves to a meal out aren't when we most want or need a social message on our restaurant tabs. \u201cSee? I am a good restaurant owner who covers employees with health insurance, and you are a good patron for participating, even though I didn\u2019t give you a choice.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next? An electricity surcharge because the restaurant placed solar on its roof? Will there be so many add-on charges that customers decide they don\u2019t need to add a tip? It's better to wrap all costs into the basic tab without the extra messages -- especially so that customers know what the tab will look like at the end of the meal, instead of getting the 3% surprise.\n\nBut there\u2019s one more reason to look on the surcharge with suspicion: How do you know it all goes toward employee healthcare? Last year, the San Francisco city attorney settled with several dozen restaurants after an investigation by the city found that not all of the surcharge money was going toward employee healthcare. Restaurant owners said it had been unclear that they had to devote the whole sum toward that.\n\nWhat's next? An electricity surcharge because the restaurant placed solar on its roof?\n\nIn San Francisco, the discrepancies were discovered because the surcharge was imposed in response to a city rule on employee healthcare, giving the city\u2019s Office of Labor Standards Enforcement the opportunity to look at the books. In Los Angeles and other areas where the surcharge is a private-sector initiative, how would customers know whether they\u2019re paying more to make sure everyone can go to a doctor, or paying even more to provide the restaurant with some additional cash? Restaurants might say it\u2019s for one thing, and certainly the employees would be saying something if they weren\u2019t receiving coverage. But if the surcharge more than covers the health expenses, who\u2019s to know?\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The curse of the 3% healthcare surcharge in restaurants", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Most of us, as regular or infrequent restaurant patrons, might be willing to pay a fair price for our meals so that the people who provide service to us can enjoy the far more basic service of healthcare.
