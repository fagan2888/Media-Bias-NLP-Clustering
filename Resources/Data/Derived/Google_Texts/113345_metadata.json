You just missed it.\n\nSmall businesses (fewer than 50 full-time equivalent workers) are generally off the hook. Larger businesses (those with more than 100 full-time equivalents) have already been swept up in the law, though there will be some major changes for them, too.\n\nBut it will be the approximately 1,000 New Hampshire firms that employ 50 to 100 full-time equivalents \u2013 a total of about 70,000 employees \u2013 that will be feeling the ACA\u2019s full effect for the first time.\n\nThat might be a big surprise to many, since the ACA has gotten very little publicity in its third year, leading many to think that the most onerous provisions would be delayed again, perhaps forever.\n\nWrong. They start on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cFolks should not put this off,\u201d said Steve Gerlach, an attorney with Bernstein Shur and national expert on the ACA. \u201cI know I say this every year, but the last postponement is over, and I don\u2019t anticipate another one. This is complicated stuff. A lot is at stake and there is a lot companies need to do.\u201d\n\nHere are just a few of the major changes that directly affect the New Hampshire group market that will go into effect next year:\n\nA new complicated tax form that every business with more than 50 FTEs has to fill out.\n\nThose who have between 50 and 100 FTEs have to provide coverage, or pay a penalty \u2013 more than doubling the number of companies under the employer mandate.\n\nCoverage requirements and penalties for not meeting them have increased for all firms over 50 FTEs.\n\nThose mid-sized firms \u2013 unless they renewed their policy early \u2013 will also be subject to many large group coverage requirements for the first time, including list billing.\n\nEmployers with 50 to 100 FTEs can now join the Small Business Health Options Program insurance exchange, which should offer employee choice next year, but most of the subsidies for smaller employers will run out.\n\nA major new player in the group market and a rollout of \u201cUber medicine\u201d by the state\u2019s largest insurer.\n\nNew stiff penalties for companies who contribute to their workers\u2019 coverage on the individual exchange.\n\nThere are also some major changes in store for the individual market, which will be examined in the next issue of NH Business Review, just in time for the start of open enrollment, which begins on Nov. 1.\n\nNew tax forms\n\nWhen employees first see the new 1094-c and 1095-c forms \u2013 just released in their final form in mid-September \u2013 the response, said Gerlach \u201cis like a deer in the headlights.\u201d\n\nThe ACA requires that all large employers \u2013 and starting in 2016 that means those with more than 50 full-time employees \u2013 have to document to the Internal Revenue Service that they provide affordable coverage for both employers and employees, in order to avoid penalties.\n\nWhen filling out the forms, you can\u2019t just attest to offering health coverage. You have to provide a code labeling the minimum coverage you are offering for each employee, for each month and provide information that the employee was working full-time that month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in pretty granular fashion,\u201d said Gerlach.\n\nThe requirements are even greater for companies that self-insure, who have to provide information on each dependent.\n\n\u201cThey are ridiculous,\u201d said Josh Robinson, president of Checkmate Workforce Management Solutions in Concord. \u201cYou have to show the least expensive of single coverage for every single employee. But the most onerous part is you have to do this every month.\u201d\n\nAnd at the end of the year, you have to give the information to employees. Think of it as a kind of complicated W-2, multiplied by 12, because you have to break it down by month.\n\nIf you don\u2019t, you could owe the IRS a penalty of $250 per return. To figure out whether you are subject to this new rule (and several more to follow) you have to figure out whether you have 50 full-time equivalent employees.\n\nThe law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week \u2013 or 130 hours a month. Then, for part-timers, an employer has to add up all of the hours they work in a month, divided by 120, and add that number to your FTE. But don\u2019t try to do this yourself, because you have to work with averages, a look-back period and something called a control group, in which you have to add up the FTEs at a group of sites.\n\nThe employer mandate\n\nThose with more than 50 full-time equivalents now have to deal with the employer mandate, which was going to go into effect in 2014, but was delayed for 2015, and then limited in that year to businesses with over 100 employees. That threshold drops to 50 on Jan. 1.\n\nThere were at least 927 private firms in New Hampshire with between 50 and 100 employees, employing about 63,000 people, according to the state Department of Employment Security. Some 35,000 businesses with fewer than 50 employees will not be subject to the mandate.\n\nYet, thus far, the reaction has more muted then in 2014, when the law was still challenged both in the courts and Congress.\n\n\u201cEverybody accepts that it is here to stay,\u201d said Ray White, president of Cornerstone Benefit and Retirement Group Inc. in Bedford.\n\n\u201cThere is less bitching and moaning,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThey got over the tantrum and focus on the new reality. \u2018This is what we\u2019ll have to do.\u2018 Either that or ignore it.\u201d\n\nBut ignore it at your peril. More has changed than just the threshold. In 2015, employers were required to offer affordable coverage to 70 percent of their workforce. Next year, the requirement will be 95 percent.\n\nThe penalties are the same: $3,000 for every employee who gets a subsidy on the health insurance exchange, or $2,000 per FTE. But in 2015 \u2013 when the law applied to larger employers \u2013 the first 80 employees were excluded from the calculation. In 2016, only 30 are excluded. That\u2019s a big difference for the over-100 FTEs set, though it\u2019s still a substantial break for those with closer to 50 employees.\n\nList billing\n\nBut the greatest impact for those 50-to-100-employee firms might not be that they offer coverage, but the coverage they will be required to offer.\n\nThose that renewed their policy by Oct. 1 may have delayed these requirements. But the rest will now be considered large businesses, and must offer ACA-compliant plans starting in January.\n\nThose plans have to fit in one of the \u201cmetal\u201d categories, as on the individual exchange. And insurers can only rate based on age, group size and whether an employee is a smoker. This could mean savings for some firms, but steep increases for those with an older workforce with smokers.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference will be the advent of list billing for mid-sized firms. Previously, most insurers just issued a flat rate, whatever it cost to actually insure them. In 2016, insurers will now bill those firms for each employee separately, leaving it up to the company to pass that differential on to their workforce, or for the employer to offer different subsidies so every worker will pay the same.\n\nThere is a possibility that the ACA coverage requirements \u2013 not the mandate \u2013 might be postponed, even for those that missed the Oct. 1 deadline, if some fast-tracked legislation in Congress passes.\n\nThe SHOP\n\nOn the plus side, those employers with more than 50 employees can now join smaller businesses in buying group coverage on the exchange through the SHOP.\n\nThat may not have mattered much in the past because the generous tax breaks \u2013 up to 50 percent of the business\u2019s premium contribution \u2013 that come with the SHOP are only for firms with less than 25 or fewer employees with average wages less than $50,000. The smaller the company and the lower the average pay, the bigger the subsidy.\n\nAnd employers can only take the SHOP tax credit once, for two consecutive years. Indeed, the big news in 2016 for many that are enjoying that tax break, will now have to decide whether to continue the coverage without the subsidy.\n\nThat \u2013 and the fact that SHOP was never heavily promoted \u2013 meant that it was rarely used. In September, for instance, 414 groups enrolled on the SHOP in New Hampshire, with a total of 3,000 members, though that is more than a tenfold increase from January.\n\nAbout half of those firms belong to Maine Community Health Cooperative, which is bullish on the program.\n\n\u201cIt continues to build momentum,\u201d said the co-op\u2019s CEO, Ken Lewis.\n\nThere is even more interest in the SHOP now that a long-awaited feature \u2013 employee choice \u2013 may finally go online during the exchange\u2019s open enrollment period, starting Nov. 1.\n\nWith employee choice, each employee can pick a policy via the exchange \u2013 and there will be a lot plans to pick from.\n\nIt could be funded like a 401(k) plan, with an employer-defined contribution, giving the employee the freedom and angst about what network to go with, what level of coverage, and how much he or she is willing to pay in premiums versus deductible.\n\n\u201cThat could be pretty powerful, if it works,\u201d said White, alluding to the disastrous computer glitches during the rollout of individual choice. \u201cYou want to be careful. You don\u2019t want to be the lab rat.\u201d\n\nOf all the changes in the New Hampshire group market, perhaps the most significant is that it is shrinking, as employers consider getting out of the health care business altogether. But the decrease is not as dramatic as you might think.\n\nWhite too heard a lot of grumblings last year about people \u201cwho are sick of doing health care and want to get out of it.\u201d\n\nAt first, he thought about a quarter of his clients would go that route. Now it looks like 10 percent or less. That\u2019s partly because the economy improved and the labor market is more competitive, so employers can\u2019t afford to not offer health insurance, he said.\n\nBesides, there is a new regulatory barrier. If you contribute to your employee\u2019s individual exchange policy with pretax dollars, you could face a penalty of $100 per day per employee (or potentially $36,500 per employee).\n\nSo if you want an employee to buy an individual policy on the exchange, give him or her a raise.\n\nBob Sanders can be reached at bsanders@nhbr.com.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "For 2016, the requirements bar is lowered", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bf3\"", "article_summary": "The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week \u2013 or 130 hours a month.\nThat\u2019s a big difference for the over-100 FTEs set, though it\u2019s still a substantial break for those with closer to 50 employees.\nSmall businesses (fewer than 50 full-time equivalent workers) are generally off the hook.\nWhen filling out the forms, you can\u2019t just attest to offering health coverage.\nSome 35,000 businesses with fewer than 50 employees will not be subject to the mandate."}
