Mergers & Acquisitions Highlights Women Dealmakers

Mergers & Acquisitions joins a SourceMedia tradition of honoring female leaders in financial services, such as JPMorgan Chases Marianne Lake, one of The Most Powerful Women in Banking

The Sept. 8 deadline to nominate candidates for The 25 Most Influential Women of Mid-Market M&A is fast approaching. We’ve been excited to receive nominations over the summer in our quest to discover female leaders in the industry. We’re proud to join SourceMedia, the B2B publishing company that owns Mergers & Acquisitions, in its long tradition of focusing on powerful women.

SourceMedia’s American Banker profiles each year The Most Powerful Women in Banking. Among recent honorees were: Beth Mooney, CEO of KeyCorp., who made history as the first female CEO of a top 20 U.S. banking company: Karen Peetz, the president of BNY Mellon; and Marianne Lake (pictured), the chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase.

PaymentsSource highlights The Most Influential Women in Payments. Among those who made the recent list were: Reetika Grewal, head of payments strategy and solutions, Silicon Valley Bank; Rathi Murthy, CIO of enterprise growth for American Express; and Jennifer Miles, president of Americas for Verifone.

For The 25 Most Influential Women of Mid-Market M&A, we’re seeking women who have made a big impact on the middle market. Two dealmakers who serve as great examples are: Huron Capital Partners’ Gretchen Perkins, who won our 2014 M&A Mid-Market Award for Dealmaker of the Year, for her prowess in deal sourcing; and Pam Hendrickson, the chief operating officer of the Riverside Co., who has served as chair of the Association for Corporate Growth and testified on Capitol Hill about the impact of the middle market on the U.S. economy.

Help us select the best and the brightest female transaction pros, including: corporate dealmakers, private equity investors, investment bankers, lenders, attorneys and other advisers. We’re looking for experienced veterans, as well as rising stars. Self-nominations are fine. And you may nominate as many candidates as you want. Selections will be determined solely by the editorial staff of Mergers & Acquisitions. Respond today to our online Call for Nominations at www.TheMiddleMarket.com/women.
