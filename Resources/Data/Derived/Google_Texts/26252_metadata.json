That hurts incumbents like Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who could once count on the projects and federal money they brought home to their states for political points.\n\nThe newly built communities where these new residents live \u2014 Parker and Martin point to DeSoto County, Miss., and Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties, Va. \u2014 are proving political minefields for members like Cochran and Cantor. They each lost those areas in primary elections this month. As residents migrate from one region to another, especially in their older years and especially from Rust Belt states to Sun Belt states, politics is increasingly national, and decreasingly local.\n\nNaturally, that got us thinking: How can we map the Chick-fil-A belt? Here\u2019s where the company has outposts, according to its Web site:\n\n\n\nSource: chick-fil-a.com\n\nThe new residents \u201cdon\u2019t know who the heck Thad is,\u201d Karl Rove told Parker and Martin. \u201cThere is no 40-year history with him, knowing that this is the guy who built up the state\u2019s modern Republican Party. The same with Eric, people who have just gotten to Richmond don\u2019t even know what the House of Delegates is, let alone that he served there.\u201d\n\nThe lesson for Republicans running in primary elections: No matter how long you\u2019ve served, your accomplishments for constituents back home matter little. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve done about the Affordable Care Act, or some other way to oppose the Obama administration, that counts to primary voters. Especially if you hope to represent a district with a Chick-fil-A.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A migratory population means all politics isn't local -- especially in a Republican primary.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A migratory population means all politics isn't local -- especially in a Republican primary.", "title": "Mapping Chick-fil-A Nation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/16/mapping-chick-fil-a-nation/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/06/chickfila.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/16/mapping-chick-fil-a-nation/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "states, campaigns and elections, chick-fil-a,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "states, campaigns and elections, chick-fil-a,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb23f\"", "article_summary": "Naturally, that got us thinking: How can we map the Chick-fil-A belt?\nAs residents migrate from one region to another, especially in their older years and especially from Rust Belt states to Sun Belt states, politics is increasingly national, and decreasingly local.\nEspecially if you hope to represent a district with a Chick-fil-A.\nIt\u2019s what you\u2019ve done about the Affordable Care Act, or some other way to oppose the Obama administration, that counts to primary voters.\n\u201cThere is no 40-year history with him, knowing that this is the guy who built up the state\u2019s modern Republican Party."}
