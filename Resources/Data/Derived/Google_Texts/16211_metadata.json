It was clear from how the White House enthusiastically promoted the plan that it saw the Wilson Building as the route to achieve political objectives it couldn\u2019t win in the Capitol. But what\u2019s most insulting about using the District as a petri dish for a leave plan unprecedented in its expansiveness is that it comes after seven years of this administration doing virtually nothing to advance D.C. interests.\n\nConflicting conclusions about the costs of establishing a program of universal paid leave for almost every part-time and full-time employee who wants time off to take care of a new baby, sick parent or themselves were aired last week before the D.C. Council. The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, which received a grant from the federal Labor Department, said a proposed 1 percent salary tax on employers would be sufficient to pay for the program while a study commissioned by a Washington-area business group concluded there would be a shortfall of about $380 million.\n\nA think tank that does gender-focused analysis and companies facing the prospect of yet another tax are likely to start out with certain predispositions. So we hope lawmakers were paying attention when D.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Dewitt warned about \u201ca disparity of revenues collected and benefits paid\u201d and the substantial costs that would be involved in administering the program. Or when Norton Francis, a top researcher with the Urban Institute, said program costs were underestimated not only by the federally financed study but also by the D.C. business owners group. And we would recommend that the council study the thoughtful essay by two public policy experts that appeared Jan. 17 in The Post\u2019s Local Opinions pages on how to provide paid leave in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nNo one can dispute that the United States is behind other advanced countries in helping workers get the time off they need to tend to critical family matters. But it\u2019s concerning that seven of the 13 council members jumped on the bandwagon for this preposterous plan. It\u2019s important they proceed more cautiously and thoughtfully. And if the president wants to get involved in D.C. matters and is looking for things to do in his final year in office, we suggest he take up the cause of D.C. residents, who are denied voting representation in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "paid family leave dc, paid family leave district, obama paid leave, jeffrey dewitt, norton francis, urban institute, center for women's policy research", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The paid family leave effort is asking too much of the District \u2014 and offering too little.", "title": "Not your federal petri dish", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/not-your-federal-petri-dish/2016/01/17/36fdaff6-bbc3-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/06/Others/Images/2015-10-06/Botsford_familyleave_15_10_04_41891444156632.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "description": "The paid family leave effort is asking too much of the District \u2014 and offering too little.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/not-your-federal-petri-dish/2016/01/17/36fdaff6-bbc3-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "paid family leave dc, paid family leave district, obama paid leave, jeffrey dewitt, norton francis, urban institute, center for women's policy research", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "36fdaff6-bbc3-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d"}, "article_summary": "But what\u2019s most insulting about using the District as a petri dish for a leave plan unprecedented in its expansiveness is that it comes after seven years of this administration doing virtually nothing to advance D.C. interests.\nBut it\u2019s concerning that seven of the 13 council members jumped on the bandwagon for this preposterous plan.\nAnd we would recommend that the council study the thoughtful essay by two public policy experts that appeared Jan. 17 in The Post\u2019s Local Opinions pages on how to provide paid leave in a fiscally responsible way.\nOr when Norton Francis, a top researcher with the Urban Institute, said program costs were underestimated not only by the federally financed study but also by the D.C. business owners group.\nA think tank that does gender-focused analysis and companies facing the prospect of yet another tax are likely to start out with certain predispositions."}
