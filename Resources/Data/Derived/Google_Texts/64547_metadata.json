All 181 voting Democrats in addition to 178 Republicans supported the bill, including Rep. Lynn Jenkins.\n\n\u201cThis long-term transportation bill, the first since 2005, includes increased funds for infrastructure construction, including local highways and bridges,\u201d Jenkins said in a statement. \u201cNow, states will have the flexibility they need to address improvements to roads, highways and bridges to ensure the safety of all drivers and strengthen our local economy.\u201d\n\nReps. Tim Huelskamp, Kevin Yoder and Mike Pompeo of Kansas were among the 65 Republicans voting against the bill.\n\n\u201cThe FAST Act throws fiscal responsibility and smart policy-making out the window,\u201d Pompeo said in an email Friday. \u201cThis bill funds non-highway-related projects with dwindling gas tax revenues and increases spending through unrealistic funding gimmicks that will ultimately never be realized.\u201d\n\nPompeo and Yoder said they are in favor of a long-term highway bill but the FAST Act fell short of their expectations.\n\n\u201cThe bill is paid for by a series of complicated budget gimmicks instead of simply using gas tax revenue to pay for our highways and continues the policy of paying for programs like ferries, trolleys, mass transit systems, and historical preservation programs,\u201d Yoder said in an email Friday.\n\nHighway spending has been complicated in recent years by the insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund. The federal government generally allocates about $50 billion annually for transportation but the nation\u2019s 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax only brings in roughly $34 billion. As a result, the FAST Act includes $70 billion in offsetting cuts from other portions of the federal budget.\n\nLater in the day Thursday, the legislation passed through the Senate by a wide 83-16 margin. Both senators from Kansas, Republicans Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, voted in favor.\n\n\u201cThis bill finally ends the cycle of short-term extensions and threats of devastating shutdowns to transportation programs that have hurt the nation\u2019s ability to complete highway projects for the past 10 years,\u201d Moran said in a statement. \u201cBy cutting red tape and accelerating project delivery, the FAST Act will help address deteriorating infrastructure \u2014 like Topeka\u2019s Willard Bridge \u2014 and Kansas\u2019 other failing roads and bridges.\u201d\n\nThe legislation was staunchly opposed by some conservative groups, such as FreedomWorks, due to its cost and renewal of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter. FreedomWorks has aired ads supporting Huelskamp\u2019s re-election and named him one of its FreedomFighter Award winners.\n\n\u201cThere are already serious problems with the highway bill, but its reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank makes this already bad deal for taxpayers even worse,\u201d said Noah Wall, the group\u2019s grassroots director. \u201cThis is blatant pandering to special interests on K Street and another knife in the back of the conservative grassroots.\u201d\n\nThe all-Republican Kansas delegation has been split on the Export-Import Bank issue for years. Roberts and Moran have tepidly supported the bank while Huelskamp and Pompeo have been outspoken critics of it. On Friday, Pompeo called the bank \u201ccorrupt\u201d and said it \u201cmust be drastically reformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the bill had some merits, I couldn\u2019t support 1,300 pages of budget gimmicks, union earmarks, and the revival of Obama\u2019s Ex-Im Bank,\" Huelskamp said Friday.\n\nA long-term transportation bill has eluded Congress in recent years, forcing federal representatives to pass a series of unsatisfying short-term fixes. Thursday\u2019s bill, which Obama signed Friday, is the longest-ranging transportation bill passed by Congress in 17 years.\n\n\u201cI look forward to signing this bill right away, so that we can put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems,\u201d the president said in a statement.\n\nJenkins was the target of a two-week radio advertising campaign this summer urging her to vote for a long-term transportation bill. The 30-second ads, which aired in Topeka, claimed that 50 percent of Kansas\u2019 annual capital investments in highways and bridges depend on federal funding.\n\nIn addition to providing money for road and rail projects, reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank and funding mass transit systems, the legislation will restore a $3 billion crop insurance subsidy that was cut as part of a Republican budget agreement. Roberts has been a defender of the subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen the cuts to crop insurance were announced earlier this year, the message from farm country could not have been clearer: do not target crop insurance,\u201d the senator said in a statement Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A largely bipartisan bill to fund the nation's transportation projects for the next five years garnered the support of half of Kansas' six-member congressional delegation Thursday as Congress sent the measure to President Barack Obama, who signed it.", "title": "Three U.S. House members from Kansas join minority opposing transportation bill", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-12-04/three-us-house-members-kansas-join-minority-opposing-transportation-bill", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14944550.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A largely bipartisan bill to fund the nation\u2019s transportation projects for the next five years garnered the support of half of Kansas\u2019 six-member congressional delegation Thursday as Congress sent the measure to President Barack Obama, who signed it.The $305 billion legislation, commonly called the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act, cleared the U.S. House 359-65.
