Al Saad noted that there are also more than 60 suspected cases.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations airlifted supplies and vaccines for more than 538,000 children in northeastern Syria. \u201cThe medicines delivered to Al Hassakeh are intended to cover the gaps in Syria\u2019s northeast including in hard-to-reach areas of Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Al Hassakeh governorates,\u201d UNHCR representative Tarik Kurdi said in a U.N. release. \u201cThese vaccines against polio will be used in the second round of vaccinations, which will start on December 8th.\u201d\n\nPolio is an infectious disease that can cause paralysis, and if not treated, death. It has been eradicated in most of the world except for a handful of countries, and has reappeared in Syria since its civil war. Polio remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It mainly affects children under the age of 5.\n\nThe children who are particularly at risk are those under the age of 2, who were born in Syria after the war had already begun and did not have access to proper immunization. Furthermore, the war continues to stall these vaccination attempts, as the U.N. is having trouble handing out vaccines. The U.N. can only operate in sovereign states, meaning it must work through the central government in Damascus; NPR reports that just last month, the Syrian government blocked a U.N. Security Council statement that urged cross-border aid.\n\n\u201cIn the past couple of years, we were not able to reach more than half a million children because of access restrictions,\u201d UNICEF spokeswoman Juliette Touma told NPR. \u201cAnd this could explain why we have polio inside Syria.\u201d Doctors who are with the Polio Task Force on the side of the opposition, argue that the vaccination program being pushed through Damascus is not reaching children in rebel areas, where conditions are most dire and unsanitary.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that the people in Dier ez-Sor [and] some villages don\u2019t know about the polio, actually,\u201d Dr. Khaled Almilaji told NPR. \u201cDo they know they have to take the vaccines?\u201d He continued, \u201cThis is a disease. This is not politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "polio outbreak, syria, damascus, vaccination", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite the Syrian government\u2019s promises to immunize all children under the age of 5, vaccination efforts have stalled due to the war crisis.", "title": "Polio Spreads In Syria, But Political Turmoil Slows Vaccination Efforts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/polio-spreads-syria-political-turmoil-prevents-vaccination-efforts-moving-264291", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/10/children-syria.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the Syrian government\u2019s promises to immunize all children under the age of 5, vaccination efforts have stalled due to the war crisis.", "title": "Polio Spreads In Syria, But Political Turmoil Slows Vaccination Efforts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/polio-spreads-syria-political-turmoil-prevents-vaccination-efforts-moving-264291", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/10/children-syria.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/10/children-syria.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-03T20:13:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-10T10:32:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite the Syrian government\u2019s promises to immunize all children under the age of 5, vaccination efforts have stalled due to the war crisis."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6c1\"", "article_summary": "The polio outbreak in Syria continues to spread, and though the government promised to immunize all Syrian children under the age of 5, political turmoil is preventing vaccination efforts from moving forward.\n\u201cWe are sure that the people in Dier ez-Sor [and] some villages don\u2019t know about the polio, actually,\u201d Dr. Khaled Almilaji told NPR.\nOn Monday, the United Nations airlifted supplies and vaccines for more than 538,000 children in northeastern Syria.\nFurthermore, the war continues to stall these vaccination attempts, as the U.N. is having trouble handing out vaccines.\n\u201cIn the past couple of years, we were not able to reach more than half a million children because of access restrictions,\u201d UNICEF spokeswoman Juliette Touma told NPR."}
