And for most of the decade that followed, ignorance, fear, and stigma abetted its spread. First, people didn\u2019t even know about the disease. Once they did, they singled out and ostracized the groups that were most obviously affected\u2014gay and bisexual men, intravenous drug users, and members of some immigrant groups. In that environment, it was difficult to get the White House to even talk about the epidemic, let alone secure the resources necessary for research and outreach efforts.\n\nAs Michael Hobbes documented in these pages earlier this year, the slow response to the disease was one reason the mortality rate in the U.S. was so much higher than in other countries. But once science found a way to treat the disease, the mortality rate fell. The number of people living with HIV as a chronic condition rose, while the rate of new infections stabilized. Today, the public has a much better grasp of the disease\u2014what it does, how it\u2019s transmitted, what can be done to prevent it. Three consecutive administrations, one of them Republican, have made fighting HIV here and abroad a priority.\n\nBut the disease is still around, and it is spreading. About 50,000 people a year get it. And not all of them have easy access to life-sustaining drugs. Officials have proven strategies for slowing the epidemic\u2019s spread and treating those who have it\u2014everything from more widespread testing to establishing a well-structured \u201ccare continuum\u201d of drugs and therapy. But for the strategies to work, public health workers must know where to deploy them. That\u2019s why, in 2010, the Obama Administration embraced a new National HIV Strategy. Under this plan, public health officials are supposed to move away from broad, national prevention and treatment efforts\u2014and focus instead on targeting efforts to the communities and people who most need it.\n\nA few years ago, researchers at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, working with Gilead Sciences, devised a way to assist this effort. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control, they developed online, interactive maps depicting where AIDS infections were most prevalent\u2014and where new cases were cropping up most frequently. They called the project AIDSVu. Its principal researcher is Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist who worked at the CDC before coming to Emory. The main audience for the maps consists of the people on the front lines\u2014elected officials, public health department leaders, and outreach workers who must make decisions about where to deploy resources and when. \u201cThis is powerful,\u201d says Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of Global Health and HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cMaps like those from AIDSVu are a policy tool\u2014something that can help policymakers at all levels understand what is happening in their communities, where they are doing a good job, where they need to do more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Maps are the newest weapon for fighting the epidemic", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Targeted treatment is the future of care.
