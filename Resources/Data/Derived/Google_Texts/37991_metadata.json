Haslam\u2019s \u201cTennessee Promise for two years of \u201cfree\u201d community college or technical training for high school graduates.\n\nGood old-fashion Maury County common sense tells us that when you add 50 million people without health care to the 260 million people who have some form of health care and then redistribute the total aggregate costs to all those paying health care premiums, then those who were paying for their health care coverage will undoubtedly have their premiums and deductibles increased to make up for the increased costs of those who didn\u2019t have health care, and thus make it \u201caffordable\u201d to the people who didn\u2019t have it.\n\nThe same common sense can be applied to the governor\u2019s \u201cTennessee Promise\u201d that proposes to move $300 million from the state lottery fund reserve to provide two years of \u201cfree\u201d community college. U.S. Congressman Steve Cohen of Memphis, who sponsored the 2002 change to the state constitution to allow lotteries in Tennessee, makes a good point on the matter. The congressman objects to the governor\u2019s election year idea, saying the \u201cTennessee Promise\u201d would cost $34 million a year and would reduce the Hope Scholarship grants to college freshmen and sophomores at Tennessee\u2019s four-year universities from $4,000 per year to $3,000 per year.\n\nThese are the same freshman and sophomores who worked hard to get at least a 21 on their ACT scores or maintained a \u201cB\u201d average on their grades to qualify for the grant money. The governor\u2019s proposal would allow \u201call\u201d students to obtain the \u201cfree\u201d tuition, regardless of grades, as long as they graduated from high school. This approach not only redistributes the lottery revenue, it lowers the academic bar.\n\nWhere does the Hope Scholarship revenue come from? Study upon study tells us that about 80 percent of it comes from people who are below the poverty line in income and buy lottery tickets. In reality, it\u2019s a tax on the poor, and the majority of these funds are distributed to the children of the parents who have incomes above the poverty line.\n\nThe governor\u2019s Planning and Research Director Anne Buckle pointed out that college entry students who have to go into remedial college courses have only a 5 percent chance of graduating from college. So the dropout rate of these students we know will be very high.\n\nWill that number change with \u201cfree\u201d community college programs? Will the \u201cTennessee Promise\u201d help Maury County increase its high school graduation rate in college-bound students? According to the Daily Herald article of Feb. 5, \u201cState aims to grow student base,\u201d 60 percent of Maury County\u2019s high school graduates are attending college already. However, it\u2019s not clear how many of these students finish college, nor is it clear how many of them, out of those who do graduate from college, come back home and find work in Maury County. They would help raise the number of workers in our workforce who have a college degree toward the attainment of the state goal of 55 percent from Maury County\u2019s current 16.6 percent rate of the workforce with college degrees.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Education website says that 72 percent of Williamson County High School graduates were eligible for Hope Scholarship grants in 2013. Among the other counties in the greater Nashville region, Sumner and Wilson counties had 44 per cent; Rutherford had 41 percent; Montgomery had 40 percent; Dickson had 39 percent; Cheatham had 34 percent and Maury County was in eighth place with only 33 percent.\n\nAccording the article, the Maury County average high school graduation rate is 83.1 percent, with Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, Marshall and Williamson all ranking higher high school graduation rates than Maury County.\n\nExcluding unit schools in Maury County, the state Department of Education lists Spring Hill with a graduation rate of nearly 94 percent, Columbia Central at 77 percent and Mt. Pleasant at 74 percent. This same state website, excluding unit schools, lists the top-performing elementary schools from 2013 in math as J.E. Woodard (Sunnyside area), Spring Hill elementary and Marvin Wright, with an outstanding average of nearly 66 percent of their students performing at or above proficiency, with the state average being 51 percent of the students at or above proficiency.\n\nThe three lowest-performing elementary schools in math in Maury County were Baker, Highland Park and Randolph Howell, with an average of 34 percent of students scored as proficient or above.\n\nWhy is the rate in the Columbia inner city schools nearly one-half the rate of the Spring Hill and Sunnyside schools? Study upon study tells us that if we swapped the teachers of the high-performing schools with those of the low-performing schools the percentages wouldn\u2019t change that much at all. This is a system and school board problem, not a teacher problem, and we need a plan to fix it.\n\nThis year is an election year for 22 commissioners and six school board members, and we need to ask them what they will do to correct this problem. Beyond that we need to hold all of them accountable for our schools\u2019 educational performance and progress.\n\n\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\n\nMike Bennett is a retired autoworker who resides in Spring Hill.
