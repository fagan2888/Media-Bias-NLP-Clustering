The company so far has pushed back and on Thursday won three extra days to respond to the order.\n\nAnother senior Apple executive said Congress is the right place for a debate over encryption, not a courtroom.\n\nThe executive said Apple was stunned that such a legal request had come from the U.S. government rather than a country with weaker traditions of protecting privacy and civil liberties.\n\nThe motion to compel Apple to comply did not carry specific penalties for the company, and the Justice Department declined to comment on what recourse it was willing to seek.\n\nIn the order, prosecutors acknowledged that the latest filing was \"not legally necessary\" since Apple had not yet responded to the initial order.\n\nThe clash between Apple and the Justice Department has driven straight to the heart of a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.\n\nA federal court hearing in California has been scheduled for March 22 in the case, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.\n\nThe Justice Department said its Friday motion was a response to Apple CEO Tim Cook's public statement Wednesday, which included a refusal to \"hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.\"\n\n\"Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ... Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order,\" prosecutors wrote in the Friday filing.\n\n\"Apple\u2019s current refusal to comply with the court\u2019s order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nID CHANGE POSES HURDLE\n\nThe two senior Apple executives said the company had worked hard to help investigators and tried multiple avenues including sending engineers with FBI agents to a WiFi network that would recognize the phone and begin an automatic backup if that had been enabled.\n\nThey criticized government officials who reset the Apple identification associated with the phone, which closed off the possibility of recovering information from it through that automatic cloud backup.\n\nSan Bernardino County reset the password on the iCloud account at the request of the FBI, said county spokesman David Wert.\n\nThe government first disclosed the identification change in a footnote to its filing Friday. The Apple executives said that the reset occurred before Apple was consulted. The Justice Department declined to comment on that contention.\n\nThe two sides have been on a collision course since Apple said it would offer strong encryption by default on its devices in 2014, a move prompted in part by the surveillance revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nBut the Justice Department struggled to find a compelling case where encryption proved to be an insurmountable hurdle for its investigators until the Dec. 2 shooting rampage by Farook and his wife in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14. Authorities believe the couple was inspired by the Islamic State.\n\nSome technology experts and privacy advocates backing Apple suggest Farook's work phone likely contains little data of value. They have accused the Justice Department of choreographing the case to achieve a broader goal of gaining support for legislation or a legal precedent that would force companies to crack their encryption for investigators.\n\nThe case has quickly become a topic in the U.S. presidential race. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on Friday called for a \"boycott\" against Apple until the company complied with the court order.\n\nThe two Apple executives said they felt in good company, noting that Trump has faulted many other groups and individuals.\n\nThe debate will also play out on Capitol Hill. Bipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee late Friday invited Apple's Cook and FBI Director James Comey to testify at an upcoming hearing on encryption, though a date was not set.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also planning an encryption hearing for March and has invited Apple to attend, according to a congressional source.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards and Dustin Volz; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, David Ingram in Washington, Dan Levine, Julia Love and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby, Cynthia Osterman and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.", "title": "U.S., Apple ratchet up rhetoric in fight over encryption", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/22/US-Apple-ratchet-rhetoric-fight-over-encryption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/apple-results_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/22/US-Apple-ratchet-rhetoric-fight-over-encryption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/apple-results_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Another senior Apple executive said Congress is the right place for a debate over encryption, not a courtroom.\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also planning an encryption hearing for March and has invited Apple to attend, according to a congressional source.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on that contention.\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump on Friday called for a \"boycott\" against Apple until the company complied with the court order.\nThe two Apple executives said they felt in good company, noting that Trump has faulted many other groups and individuals."}
