He claimed it wasn\u2019t him but Pacquiao\u2019s promoter, Bob Arum, who has been the main obstacle for not making the fight in the last five years.\n\n\u201cFloyd Mayweather is not ducking or dodging any opponent,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cBob Arum is stopping the fight. We have been trying to make this fight happen for many years behind the scene.\u201d\n\nPacquiao turned the pressure up on Mayweather to make the fight last month, saying the time had come to put on the much anticipated bout. Arum said he had also been in talks with CBS Corp. chairman Les Moonves about the fight.\n\nCBS operates Showtime, which has Mayweather under contract for two more fights in May and September.\n\nMayweather repeated his old charges about Pacquiao not wanting to do blood tests prior to the fight for it not happening five years ago. He also said he offered Pacquiao $40 million for a bout, but he refused.\n\nMayweather, who hasn\u2019t lost in 47 fights, said he was confident he could beat Pacquiao and eager to star in an extremely lucrative fight.\n\n\u201cI know that he\u2019s not on my level,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cThe fan would love to see the fight. And, of course, I want to go out with a bang.\u201d\n\nNo one knows how rich a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight would be, coming so late after it first should have happened in 2009. There are some who think both fighters have slipped some with advancing age, but there\u2019s no doubt that the fight still holds tremendous appeal.\n\nIt would likely gross at least $250 million, and Mayweather\u2019s purse alone would be more than $100 million.\n\nMayweather was not asked in the ringside interview about the murder-suicide of rapper Earl Warren Hayes and his wife in Los Angeles on Monday. Police spoke to Mayweather after the killings following media reports that he may have spoken to Hayes before he shot Stephanie Elyse Moseley and then took his own life in their apartment.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Floyd Mayweather: Let\u2019s make the Manny Pacquiao fight May 2", "title": "Floyd Mayweather: Let\u2019s make the Manny Pacquiao fight May 2", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/13/floyd-mayweather-lets-make-the-manny-pacquiao-fight-may-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213_101617_manny-pacquiao.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213_101617_manny-pacquiao.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T10:14:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:33:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. says he\u2019s ready to fight Manny Pacquiao next May in a long anticipated bout that would be the richest ever in boxing.\n\u201cYou lost twice and now you\u2019re coming back begging for the same money?\u201d Mayweather asked.\nMayweather, who hasn\u2019t lost in 47 fights, said he was confident he could beat Pacquiao and eager to star in an extremely lucrative fight.\nMayweather repeated his old charges about Pacquiao not wanting to do blood tests prior to the fight for it not happening five years ago.\nHe also said he offered Pacquiao $40 million for a bout, but he refused."}
