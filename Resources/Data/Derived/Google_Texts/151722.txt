SOCHI — America’s Olympic-season year of the rookie is emerging as a curse in Russia.

The U.S. Olympic qualifying season this winter mashed several contests into an intense few weeks and many up-and-comers — like 15-year-old slopestyle skier Maggie Voisin, 16-year-old snowboarder Ty Walker and 21-year-old bump skier Heidi Kloser — rose to the occasion. They found podiums and shone under pressure, earning their first-ever tickets to their sports’ biggest show.

Call it pressure or tough courses or just plain bad luck, but the newcomers are falling quickly. The latest was the Sochi Winter Olympics’ youngest athlete, Voisin, whose impressive switch 1080 at the Aspen X Games earned her bronze and proved U.S. Freeskiing’s coaches right in their decision to nominate her for the U.S. Olympic Ski Team. Voisin broke her right ankle while practicing on the rail features of the burly slopestyle course early Saturday.

Walker bruised her heel on the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park slopestyle course’s final rail feature a few days earlier while practicing. Kloser took a seemingly innocuous tumble while practicing on the moguls course late Thursday.
