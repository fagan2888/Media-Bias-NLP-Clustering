Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Barack Obama hits the road again this week, continuing what could be called the Blue POTUS/Red State tour. This time, the destination is Florida, where Obama will deliver an Earth Day speech on \u201cthe threat that climate change poses to our economy and to the world.\u201d\n\nKind of an interesting choice for the president, and a possible political two-fer.\n\n[READ: Three-Minute Briefing: After 2016 GOPers Hit Hillary in N.H., CNN Poll Shows She\u2019s Barely Scratched ]\n\nFlorida\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Scott, is beefing with the White House over Obamacare \u2013 he rejected federal money for health insurance exchanges, argued the law wasn\u2019t working and is now suing to get federal money for health insurance exchanges under a differently named program. The sight of Air Force One touching down at Miami International Airport is likely to revive what\u2019s an embarrassment for Scott; no word on whether he\u2019ll greet Obama at the airport with a summons in one hand and a collection plate in the other.\n\nDelivering an Earth Day speech in the Everglades, meanwhile, could dial up a bit of pressure on the Sunshine State\u2019s own Sen. Marco Rubio, a 2016 Republican presidential aspirant who\u2019s apparently done a 180 on climate change since hitting the national political spotlight. Back when he was speaker of the Florida legislature a scant eight years ago, Rubio seemed to think climate change was a real thing, CO2 emissions were to blame, and his state\u2019s entrepreneurs could fill a fleet of Priuses with the money they\u2019d make from clean energy:\n\nRecent polls show Rubio\u2019s the GOPer who comes closest to catching Hillary Clinton so far; he\u2019s only 14 points behind her in the latest CNN poll. But with climate change heavyweights like Tom Steyer ready to spend a few millions on climate-change issue ads, that flip-flop could turn into a cudgel for the left \u2013 assuming Rubio makes it out of the GOP\u2019s demolition-derby primary.\n\n[ALSO: Three-Minute Briefing: Marco Rubio Throws Shade On His Elders, Rand Focuses on Clinton]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Putting Heat on Rubio (and Scott), Obama to Give Global Warming Speech in Florida", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Everglades trip underscores Rubio\u2019s Climate Flip and Scott\u2019s\r\nObamacare Flop.", "title": "Putting Heat on Rubio (and Scott), Obama to Give Global Warming Speech in Florida", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/04/20/putting-heat-on-rubio-and-scott-obama-to-give-global-warming-speech-in-florida", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/30/ca/7ab21ae440db94fa417472d1e6bb/150420-whispers-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Putting Heat on Rubio (and Scott), Obama to Give Global Warming Speech in Florida", "description": "Everglades trip underscores Rubio\u2019s Climate Flip and Scott\u2019s\r\nObamacare Flop.<br><br>", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "April 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
