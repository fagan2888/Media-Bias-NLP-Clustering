Mary Fallin, a Republican, signed a bill into law allowing school districts across the state to train faculty and staff to carry a firearm.\n\nThe entire Okay district is in one place, with an elementary school, a junior high, a high school, and the superintendent\u2019s office building side by side. About 400 students make up the district\u2019s population.\n\nIn December 2014, the town\u2019s police department dissolved, leaving the closest police agency at the time seven miles away, McMahan said. Although Wagoner County has since taken over policing, he said, only one patrol unit covers the town, and the response time to a shooting could take five to 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cMost of these [shootings] are over in a short amount of time, and we felt like we needed to do something more for the safety of our students,\u201d the superintendent said.\n\nOkay is among the earliest districts in the state to adopt the policy. It requires any faculty or staff member who want to arm himself to receive school board approval, undergo thorough training, and pass a series of tests each year.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just have teachers sitting around with guns on their hips,\u201d McMahan said.\n\nThe district caught national attention after a photograph of the \u201cbeware\u201d signs went viral.\n\nNearby school districts have yet to follow Okay\u2019s lead. Curtis Curry, superintendent of the Porum public school system, told a local newspaper he didn\u2019t think the policy was safe.\n\nBut McMahan said the reaction from his district, and nationwide, has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what I feel is right for the safety of my students, and I have always felt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be ahead of the ball game [on] everything for the safety of our students. I don\u2019t want to second-guess myself after something happens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This rural school district makes it clear that faculty or staff could be packing heat under a state policy providing for firearms training.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This rural school district makes it clear that faculty or staff could be packing heat under a state policy providing for firearms training.", "title": "Beware: Teachers May Be Armed and Trained", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160205_SchoolGuns_Johnson2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T18:58:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NUPf7g"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This rural school district makes it clear that faculty or staff could be packing heat under a state policy providing for firearms training.", "title": "Beware: Teachers May Be Armed and Trained", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160205_SchoolGuns_Johnson2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2016-02-08T16:22:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T18:58:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Okay, Oklahoma, Charles McMahan, gun free zone, gun rights, gun control, firearms, students, public school, Okay School District"}, "article_summary": "Officials in Okay, Okla., erected the four signs last week to make clear the school district would enforce a statewide policy enabling certain trained staff to carry guns on school grounds.\nMary Fallin, a Republican, signed a bill into law allowing school districts across the state to train faculty and staff to carry a firearm.\nNearby school districts have yet to follow Okay\u2019s lead.\nThe entire Okay district is in one place, with an elementary school, a junior high, a high school, and the superintendent\u2019s office building side by side.\n\u201cAttention: Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,\u201d the signs read."}
