We encourage Congress and FDA to prioritize review of generic drugs with two or fewer manufacturers, or where a price spike has already occurred, particularly in the generic injectable market.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a bill was introduced in the Senate that would create a priority review voucher program. It essentially would reward companies for developing a generic with just one competing product on the market, or one that's on the FDA's drug shortage list.\n\nThe FDA said last week that submissions that do not receive expedited review will be examined in the order in which they are received.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-supply-chain-association-lauds-fda-prioritization-sole-source-generic-drug", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/pills-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Healthcare Supply Chain Association President and CEO Todd Ebert has praised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to prioritize abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs with only one manufacturer, sometimes known as \"sole source\" products.", "title": "Healthcare Supply Chain Association lauds FDA prioritization of 'sole source' generic drug applications"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/pills-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "title": "Healthcare Supply Chain Association lauds FDA prioritization of 'sole source' generic drug applications", "description": "Healthcare Supply Chain Association President and CEO Todd Ebert has praised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to prioritize abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs with only one manufacturer, sometimes known as \"sole source\" products.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Healthcare Supply Chain Association President and CEO Todd Ebert has praised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to prioritize abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs with only one manufacturer, sometimes known as \"sole source\" products.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The change came in the form of an updated Manual of Policies and Procedures on the prioritization of ANDAs by the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs.\nHealthcare Supply Chain Association President and CEO Todd Ebert has praised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to prioritize abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs with only one manufacturer, sometimes known as \"sole source\" products.\n\"We have worked with Congress, FDA, and industry stakeholders to adopt practical solutions, including review prioritization, to help address generic price spikes.\"\nWe encourage Congress and FDA to prioritize review of generic drugs with two or fewer manufacturers, or where a price spike has already occurred, particularly in the generic injectable market.\"\nWhile noting that competition in the generic drug market may increase, Ebert said that there is more to be done \"to ensure generic medications are accessible and affordable to healthcare providers and patients who rely on them."}
