The petition reads:\n\n\u201cThe House GOP leadership\u2019s use of the Hastert Rule and H. Res 368 to shut down the government and threaten the U.S. economy with default is an attempt to extort the United States government into altering or abolishing the Affordable Care Act, and thus, is self-evidently a seditious conspiracy. Arrest the perpetrators in Congress immediately and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nAfter MoveOn\u2019s sedition petition hit the 15,000 signature goal, a new goal of 40,000 signatures was set \u2014 and more than 38,000 people have advocated arresting House GOP members for sedition in the wake of the shutdown.\n\nEvidence of alleged sedition is presented in a video that went viral this week, in which a House rule-change (H. Res 368) is explained in House proceedings. Titled \u201cthe GOP\u2019s little rule change they hoped you wouldn\u2019t notice,\u201d the clip has drawn more than three million views and a description reads:\n\n\u201cLate in the evening on September 30, 2013, the House Rules Committee Republicans changed the Rules of the House so that the ONLY Member allowed to call up the Senate\u2019s clean CR for a vote was Majority Leader Eric Cantor or his designee \u2014 all but guaranteeing the government would shut down a few hours later and would stay shut down. Previously, any Member would have had the right to bring the CR up for a vote. Democracy has been suspended in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip that inspired MoveOn\u2019s sedition petition, above.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Progressive group MoveOn.org has a \"sedition petition\" that is sure to ruffle partisan feathers -- demanding that authorities \"Arrest and Try House GOP", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Progressive group MoveOn.org has a \u201csedition petition\u201d that is sure to ruffle partisan feathers \u2014 demanding that authorities \u201cArrest and Try House GOP", "title": "MoveOn.com Sedition Petition Demands GOP Arrests After Shutdown", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/997951/moveon-com-sedition-petition-demands-gop-arrests-after-shutdown/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GOP-sedition-petition.jpeg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-18T12:34:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-18T12:37:07+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GOP-sedition-petition.jpeg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-10-18T12:34:14+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "gop sedition,h. res 368,h. res 368 sedition,moveon.org,republican sedition obamacare,sedition,sedition petition,buzzworthy", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GOP-sedition-petition.jpeg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Progressive group MoveOn.org has a \u201csedition petition\u201d that is sure to ruffle partisan feathers \u2014 demanding that authorities \u201cArrest and Try House GOP"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb39a\"", "article_summary": "Progressive group MoveOn.org has a \u201csedition petition\u201d that is sure to ruffle partisan feathers \u2014 demanding that authorities \u201cArrest and Try House GOP Leadership for Sedition\u201d after the crippling government shutdown.\nDemocracy has been suspended in the House of Representatives.\u201dWatch the clip that inspired MoveOn\u2019s sedition petition, above.\nArrest the perpetrators in Congress immediately and bring them to justice.\u201dAfter MoveOn\u2019s sedition petition hit the 15,000 signature goal, a new goal of 40,000 signatures was set \u2014 and more than 38,000 people have advocated arresting House GOP members for sedition in the wake of the shutdown.\nEvidence of alleged sedition is presented in a video that went viral this week, in which a House rule-change (H.
