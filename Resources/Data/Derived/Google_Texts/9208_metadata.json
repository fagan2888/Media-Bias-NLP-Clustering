The absence or malfunction of an enzyme called PCC causes consumed protein to build up harmful substances, which may subsequently do damage to the heart, bones, liver, and brain. For Archie, this means consuming no more than 25 grams of proteins each day.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t have too much protein. When we go to McDonald\u2019s for a treat, he has to have the chips, and only half the burger, with no bun,\u201d said Archie\u2019s father, Dave. \u201cFor him, an egg is a treat. He can\u2019t have any more. It\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d\n\nTo alleviate fatigue and hunger pangs, Archie has come to rely on the European Gatorade-analogue Lucozade, which high sugar and electrolyte content provides him the energy he cannot get from real food. He now drinks four 13 fl oz bottles every day. Although their son\u2019s habit costs them upwards of $200 each month, Dave and his wife Salli believe the sports beverage is what keeps him going.\n\n\u201cIf he is starting to feel a bit tired, maybe after he has been running around, it will just pick him up again straight away,\u201d Dave said, speaking to The Daily Mail. \u201cWhen he is well you wouldn\u2019t know there was anything different about him, but he is about the height of an eight-year-old simply because he is eating so much less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish we could get it on prescription,\u201d he added.\n\nInitially, doctors thought Archie was autistic, as he did not seem to respond to the world around him. The lethargy wasn\u2019t explained until after his second birthday, when a routine blood and urine test revealed the inherited disorder. Since then, he has been forced to avoid high protein foods and limit his diet to small portions of carbohydrates.\n\n\u201cWe are very lucky he is still alive - it is a silent killer,\u201d Archie\u2019s mother told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future holds but we are just happy that he is a happy little boy and loving life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "archie koncher, propionic acidemia, boy kept alive by lucozade, lucozade sugar", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "10-year-old Archie Koncher, who suffers from the rare disorder propionic acidemia, is kept alive by four daily servings of the UK sports drink Lucozade.", "title": "UK Boy Kept Alive With Lucozade", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-boy-kept-alive-lucozade-10-year-old-archie-koncher-overcomes-rare-genetic-disorder-sugary-energy", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/lucozade.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "10-year-old Archie Koncher, who suffers from the rare disorder propionic acidemia, is kept alive by four daily servings of the UK sports drink Lucozade.", "title": "UK Boy Kept Alive With Lucozade", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-boy-kept-alive-lucozade-10-year-old-archie-koncher-overcomes-rare-genetic-disorder-sugary-energy", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/lucozade.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/lucozade.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-15T19:31:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T19:57:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "10-year-old Archie Koncher, who suffers from the rare disorder propionic acidemia, is kept alive by four daily servings of the UK sports drink Lucozade."}, "article_summary": "Since then, he has been forced to avoid high protein foods and limit his diet to small portions of carbohydrates.\n10-year-old Archie Koncher was born with propionic acidemia (PA) \u2013 an incredibly rare genetic disorder that prevents his body from processing certain proteins and lipids properly.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future holds but we are just happy that he is a happy little boy and loving life.\u201d\nThe lethargy wasn\u2019t explained until after his second birthday, when a routine blood and urine test revealed the inherited disorder.\n\u201cWe are very lucky he is still alive - it is a silent killer,\u201d Archie\u2019s mother told reporters."}
