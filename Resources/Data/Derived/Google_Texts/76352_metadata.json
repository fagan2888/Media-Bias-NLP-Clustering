So many presents; so little time. Which should you open first? The scenario may have prompted your parents to say that you looked like a kid in a candy store.Remember that feeling?Being a team physician for a professional sports franchise might not make a person feel like a kid in a candy store, but have no doubt, there is something very cool about it.\u201cYou pinch yourself at some point,\u201d explains Spero Karas, MD , director of the Emory Orthopedic Sports Medicine Fellowship Program, and head physician for the Atlanta Falcons football team. \u201cYou\u2019re at the game, or on the sideline, you do kind of pinch yourself sometimes and say \u2018wow, I\u2019m actually working here. This is what I do for a living.\u2019\u201dCool, indeed.Karas was a sports enthusiast before recognizing the desire for a career in medicine, though that desire came fairly early in his teen years. A report he had to write for his 8th grade class spawned research into different career options. Medicine piqued his interest.He also had some positive role models.\u201cOur family physician, and the doctors who took care of me when I was injured as a high school athlete,\u201d Karas recalls. \u201cI tore my ACL, and I had good doctors who looked after me, and were very positive role models.\u201dThe early stages of his sports medicine career began while completing his residency in orthopedic surgery at Duke University Medical Center, assisting faculty in caring for the school\u2019s athletes. He followed that with a Knee, Shoulder, and Sports Medicine Fellowship at Steadman Hawkins Clinic in Vail, CO, where he also served as an associate team physician for the Denver Broncos and Colorado Rockies, before moving on to Atlanta in 2005.Karas says the flip side to the \u201ccoolness\u201d of walking the sidelines during a football game is the challenge to not view the game as a fan.\u201cYou have to remove yourself from the fan aspect of the game, and realize they don\u2019t need another cheerleader on the sideline,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat they need is a coach; somebody cool under pressure making decisions on return to play, being very objective, and not allowing down and distance to jade decision-making. So yeah, it is fun, and doctors are human. We get pumped up by the roar of 80,000 fans just like the players do. But you have to be very careful that you detach yourself from those situations in critical decision-making points of the game or season.\u201dThe most rewarding element of his job, Karas says, is when his hands have intervened in the health of an athlete through surgeries he performed.\u201cWhen you get those guys back to their previous level of performance, it\u2019s extremely rewarding,\u201d he says. Richard Levine, MD , is a board-certified orthopedist specializing in sports medicine, and knee and shoulder surgery. He is also in his 10th year as head physician for the Baltimore Blast, and 9th year as assistant physician for the Baltimore Ravens. He says the work he does is, to some extent, a result of his personality.\u201cIf you take any graduating class from medical school, you can see that people gravitate into fields that somewhat fit their personality,\u201d says Levine, who played 4 years of soccer and a year-and-a-half of lacrosse at Cornell University. \u201cAnd to take it one step further, even after becoming an orthopedist, you can see those individuals tend to gravitate toward a sub-specialty that correlates with their personalities. Orthopedists tend to have a certain passion for sports.\u201dLevine says having been a high school and collegiate athlete has been extremely helpful in his career as a sports physician. He\u2019s comfortable being in a locker room, and understands the perspective of the athlete, whether it\u2019s the weekend warrior or the high-level professional.He admits that the environment can be intimidating for someone who hasn\u2019t experienced being an athlete him- or herself. But intimidation has no part in the way Levine conducts his business.\u201cI think we\u2019re always looking out for the best interests of the athlete, and that comes above and beyond anything else,\u201d he says. \u201cThe decisions on which injuries are safe to play with and what\u2019s not are actually pretty easy. And most of the time the athletes know. If you\u2019ve ever played ball, you pretty much know if it\u2019s something that is significant or not.\u201dWhen he watches a game, Levine is scanning the field and understanding the mechanism of how certain injuries occur. That approach doesn\u2019t change, whether he\u2019s on the sidelines for the Blast or coaching his son\u2019s soccer team.\u201cNobody likes being injured, and getting back to their previous lifestyle is very important,\u201d Levine says. \u201cIt\u2019s always gratifying when we see an athlete who has an injury, and they don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold for them. Then to watch them rehab and recover, and get back out there and really do well, that\u2019s a very rewarding feeling.\u201dSports were a huge part of Michael Terry \u2019s life growing up, right through college. But he never really considered going professional in sports.\u201cI think by the time I was old enough to consider any career, I had a pretty decent understanding of my athletic abilities,\u201d says Terry, who parlayed that love for sports into a career as an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He\u2019s also the head physician for the Chicago Blackhawks\n\nHe acknowledges the huge difference in going from the operating room to the locker room, and a large disparity in caring for high-level weekend warriors versus professional athletes.\u201cI think the transition is a big one, but I really enjoy it,\u201d Terry says. \u201cI think it gives you a lot of balance, and certainly a different perspective.\u201dHe points to the different level of resources at the disposal of the professional athlete versus the average patient. The professional has all the best equipment, therapists, and training staff, because their expectation is also much higher. For the weekend warrior, it\u2019s exercising or engaging in athletic competition for the fun and the health benefits. For professionals, it\u2019s their livelihood. That also impacts the commitment they\u2019re able or willing to make to their rehabilitation.\u201cSomeone with a day job who isn\u2019t committed to the sport but exercises for the health benefits, those people have other conflicting interests,\u201d Terry says. \u201cThey have to go to work, or take care of their kids. But I think that\u2019s one of the jobs I have, is to understand what people can do in their lives, what they\u2019re willing to do, and the access they have, and try to balance and coordinate those different issues when you\u2019re taking care of the patient.\u201dTerry also acknowledges that he watches a hockey game much differently than the average fan. He recalls someone showing him a photograph of the entire crowd looking to the right, while he was looking left.\u201cThere are times when I\u2019ll watch a game for a very specific reason, looking at one player,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd often during a game I\u2019ll review film to see a play that concerned me, or to re-visit an injury.\u201dTerry says he is especially fortunate to be part of the Blackhawks\u2019 organization, and calls being part of it during the team\u2019s 2 Stanley Cup Championships a once-in-a-lifetime experience that he got to experience twice.\u201cFrom the players to the athletic training staff to the coaching staff and up to management, the organization has been tremendous with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely feel like part of the organization, even though I\u2019m not part of the team.\u201dGrowing up on Long Island, Struan Coleman, MD, played a wide variety of sports, including football, ice hockey, and lacrosse. He was also surrounded by friends and family members who were involved in medicine. But it was when he tore the meniscus in his knee during his sophomore year in high school that he began thinking about a career in sports medicine.\u201cGoing through [the injury], and healing without surgery, which is what I did, is a very important lesson for me now as a surgeon,\u201d says Coleman, who is now an orthopedic surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan , as well as the head physician for the New York Mets.Coleman says that, whether he\u2019s dealing with professional or amateur athletes, he tries to treat patients conservatively.\u201cThe body has great healing potential,\u201d he says. \u201cStrengthening the muscles around the injured area of the body can be very helpful.\u201dHowever, he acknowledges that, with certain injuries, if professional athletes want to get back to performing at an elite level, there are times when surgery is the best option. But, whether professional or amateur, every patient is treated the same.\u201cWhether they come into your office and are not an athlete, just have an injury, or are the starting pitcher for the Mets, you have to treat each person exactly the same,\u201d Coleman explains. \u201cTheir goals will be different, and you have to understand their respective goals, but ultimately you have to treat both of them as patients.\u201dColeman attends about 40% of Mets home games and has a group of sports medicine doctors who cover the remaining games. Rather than just watching the pitcher or the hitter, he may be studying the player who slid hard into third base, watching his body language or analyzing if he limps slightly. Coleman will also watch a player take practice swings in the on-deck circle: is their swing as smooth as it should be?Having grown up a Mets fan makes Coleman\u2019s job even more special. And while he has had several rewarding experiences in the course of his career, he singles out having been involved in Pedro Martinez\u2019s shoulder surgery. When Martinez then returned to the game and reached the 3,000-strikeout milestone, he summoned a group of individuals onto the field to thank them for making the accomplishment possible. Coleman was one of them.\u201cThe fact that Pedro asked me to be present for that special moment was big,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe the greatest for me, personally.\u201dWhen Rocco Monto, MD, played soccer at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, he was an All-American goalkeeper. As an athlete competing at the regional, state, and national levels, he experienced his share of success, as well as injuries. It was his exposure to the latter that prompted his career in sports medicine.\u201cI always felt that when I was with the orthopedic surgeon that he really wasn\u2019t listening to me, or didn\u2019t have a feel for where I was coming from or what I wanted as a player and patient,\u201d says Monto, who is an orthopedic surgeon with Nantucket College Hospital, as well as a team physician for the US National Soccer Team.The experience drove Monto. He recognized that he had a better shot at understanding athletes, and connecting with them because he had been in their shoes.\u201cYou get street credit,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know you\u2019ve been there, paid your dues, so when I tell them something there\u2019s a little weight behind it.\u201dAs for the \u201ccool factor,\u201d Monto says that comes from watching youth players develop into professional athletes. He\u2019s been working with S. National Soccer since 1992, and took care of Landon Donovan and Kyle Beasley when they were 15 years old. Now he refers to them as the \u201cgrizzled old veterans.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something unique; a gift that soccer gave to me.\u201dMonto acknowledges that there\u2019s a great deal of risk in the work he does. And while it\u2019s wonderful when he intervenes as a surgeon and the athlete experiences a full recovery, Monto says it\u2019s even more important that relationships are preserved even when rehabs don\u2019t work out.\u201cThe athletes still appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t get them to where they want to go, you\u2019re still part of where they wind up. And when you do that, there is nothing better in this world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When these physicians attend sporting events, then watch the game in a different way than the average fan.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "When these physicians attend sporting events, then watch the game in a different way than the average fan.", "title": "Sports Physicians Are Vital Part of the Team", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/journals/md_magazine/2014/vol6-issue4/sports-physicians-are-vital-part-of-the-team", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_issue/MDMagAug2014.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "cover story, physicians, sports medicine, orthopedics, surgery, injury, MD Magazine, publication, athletes", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0204\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think it gives you a lot of balance, and certainly a different perspective.\u201dHe points to the different level of resources at the disposal of the professional athlete versus the average patient.\n\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t get them to where they want to go, you\u2019re still part of where they wind up.\n\u201cThey know you\u2019ve been there, paid your dues, so when I tell them something there\u2019s a little weight behind it.\u201dAs for the \u201ccool factor,\u201d Monto says that comes from watching youth players develop into professional athletes.\nA report he had to write for his 8th grade class spawned research into different career options.\n\u201cYou\u2019re at the game, or on the sideline, you do kind of pinch yourself sometimes and say \u2018wow, I\u2019m actually working here."}
