Last year, New Jersey\u2019s 72 hospitals shared $675 million in charity care reimbursement from the state and federal government to help offset those costs, equalling about $2 for every $3 spent.\n\nCharity care costs fluctuated for Capital Health, which maintains two hospitals in Mercer, one in Trenton and one in Hopewell Township, as well as a satellite emergency room in Trenton.\n\nCapital Health Regional Medical Center, on Brunswick Avenue in Trenton, saw about $31.2 million in charity care costs in 2012, up from $24.5 million the year before.\n\nHowever, charity care for its sister operation, Capital Health Medical Center of Hopewell, was $6.9 million in 2012, down from $11.4 million a year earlier. The hospital was formerly in Trenton on Bellevue Avenue and a hospital spokeswoman attributed the decline to the move.\n\nHospital officials announced this month that they will close the satellite emergency department they have maintained at the former Bellevue site. Average daily visits dropped from 61 in November 2011 to 32 in March, and some days the department sees as few as 12 patients. The majority of those patients do not require emergency care and would be better served in a primary-care setting, hospital officials said in a news release.\n\nAcross the state, urban hospitals reported spending an average of $23.3 million on charity care, more than twice as much as the $9.9 million average spent by suburban hospitals.\n\nCapital Health spokeswoman Steffanie Archbald said in an email that the Brunswick Avenue hospital has been supporting a high amount of uncompensated care as a result of violence within the city and the high number of patients qualifying for charity care, and it continues to see an increase above 2012 levels in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe cost incurred for treating patients without insurance is an immediate cost, with funding lagging two years, and the charity care funding that we do receive is substantially less than the cost of providing the care,\u201d Archbald said. \u201cThe Hopewell campus continues to provide $7 million a year in documented charity care.\u201d\n\nThe largest percentage increase in documented charity care in Mercer County was at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital-Hamilton, where the amount increased $5.6 million, from $2.7 million to $8.3 million, or 208 percent, from 2011 to 2012.\n\nSkip Cimino, president and CEO of RWJ Hamilton, said in an email that the hospital has a long history of serving the working class in the county, and over the last few years, that segment of the population has particularly felt the effects of the economic downturn and job losses.\n\n\u201cAs a result, RWJ Hamilton has seen a rise in uninsured patients who, a year or two years ago, were easily in a different situation,\u201d Cimino said. \u201cOur job remains to take care of people in need, no matter how well they are insured.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey residents who earn below 301 percent of the federal poverty level (no more than $34,470 for one person) and who do not qualify for Medicaid or any other insurance are eligible to receive free or reduced-rate charity care services. New Jersey hospitals are required by law to provide all necessary care regardless of a patient\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nSuzanne Ianni, president and CEO of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, representing 16 urban hospitals, said she expects to see rates decline as the Affordable Care Act allows people with slightly higher incomes to obtain coverage through Medicaid next year.\n\n\u201cHowever, certain hospitals may have seen decreases as a result of their population health initiatives,\u201d Ianni said. \u201cHospitals are not only investing in staff to help patients enroll in Medicaid but also in \u2018feet on the street\u2019 to help low-income patients better manage their chronic diseases, such as diabetes or asthma where unmanaged patients frequently rely on the ER. That type of management could lead to a decrease in a hospital\u2019s documented charity care.\u201d\n\nSt. Francis Medical Center in Trenton reported an increase of $1.5 million in documented charity care in 2012, and the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro reported an increase of $1.2 million, according to the report.\n\nSome of the increase for St. Francis is because of Capital Health\u2019s decision to move one of its hospitals to Hopewell, which shifted more of the urban care burden.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a somewhat steady increase over the last few years in charity care. The change in the Capital Mercer campus impacted that a little bit,\u201d said Mark Kelly, St. Francis\u2019 chief financial officer. \u201cWe also opened a walk-in clinic in 2012 to provide a better setting for care. We\u2019re hoping with expanded Medicaid, we\u2019ll see more of the population become insured.\u201d\n\nCharity care costs at St. Francis steadily increased from $11.2 million in 2007 to a peak of $19.6 million in 2010. Charity care costs were $11 million in 2011 and $12.9 million in 2012.\n\nOfficials at University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro said in an email yesterday they were unable to comment on the report at this time.\n\nThe Star-Ledger contributed to this report.\n\nContact Nicole Mulvaney at nmulvaney@njtimes.com.\n\nOn mobile or desktop:\n\n\u2022 Like Times of Trenton on Facebook\n\n\u2022 Follow @TimesofTrenton on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Nicole Mulvaney | For NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@river','@times','capital-health','robert-wood-johnson-hospital-hamilton','trenton'", "title": "Mercer County hospitals spent $68.7M in documented charity care in 2012, report says", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mercer County hospitals spent $68.7M in documented charity care in 2012, report says\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/11/mercer_county_hospital_spent_687m_in_documented_charity_care_in_2012_report_says.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/the-times/photo/2013/07/13036116-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11718243\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-26T11:37:41Z\", \"author\": \"Nicole Mulvaney | For NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@times\",\"capital-health\",\"robert-wood-johnson-hospital-hamilton\",\"trenton\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2013/07/13036116-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "After a high of $1.027 billion in charity care spending in 2010, hospitals throughout the state spent about $998 million in 2012, up a modest $2.5 million from 2011.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@nicolemulvaney"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013, 12:04 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2013/07/-31e811c3eb5e69b5.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nmulvaney\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nicole Mulvaney | For NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"10723172\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Mercer County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "After a high of $1.027 billion in charity care spending in 2010, hospitals throughout the state spent about $998 million in 2012, up a modest $2.5 million from 2011.", "title": "Mercer County hospitals spent $68.7M in documented charity care in 2012, report says", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/11/mercer_county_hospital_spent_687m_in_documented_charity_care_in_2012_report_says.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013,  6:30 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "After a high of $1.027 billion in charity care spending in 2010, hospitals throughout the state spent about $998 million in 2012, up a modest $2.5 million from 2011."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef99\"", "article_summary": "Across the state, urban hospitals reported spending an average of $23.3 million on charity care, more than twice as much as the $9.9 million average spent by suburban hospitals.\nTRENTON \u2014 Mercer County hospitals spent about $68.7 million in documented charity care to treat working poor and uninsured patients last year, an increase of $10.5 million from 2011, according to a report from the state\u2019s Department of Health.\nHowever, charity care for its sister operation, Capital Health Medical Center of Hopewell, was $6.9 million in 2012, down from $11.4 million a year earlier.\nLast year, New Jersey\u2019s 72 hospitals shared $675 million in charity care reimbursement from the state and federal government to help offset those costs, equalling about $2 for every $3 spent.\nCharity care costs were $11 million in 2011 and $12.9 million in 2012."}
