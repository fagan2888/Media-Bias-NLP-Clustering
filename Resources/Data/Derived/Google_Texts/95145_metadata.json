Oh yes, and things like the Twitter blast at the top of this post.\n\nThen there was that famous statement by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith (see my post \"From old Kellerism to new BuzzFeed\") that bluntly stated:\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women\u2019s rights, anti-racism, and LGBT equality, there are not two sides.\u201d\n\nSmith later said, in a Hugh Hewitt interview (transcript here) explained his newsroom's open celebration of the 5-4 Obergefell decision:\n\nBS: I don\u2019t really think there, I mean, I guess I don\u2019t really think there was much of a controversy, or at least I didn\u2019t see. There were like, I\u2019ve been tweeting with three people today -- Tim Carney and a guy named, just, I mean, but I\u2019m not sure like three or four people make a controversy. But I think we have, we drafted and published a Standards Guide and an Ethics Guide several months ago, and I think we\u2019ve been wrestling with something I\u2019m sure you think about a lot, which is, although I think I probably come down somewhere a bit differently from you, which is you know, is it possible to, look, what is the tradition that used to be called kind of objective journalism, mainstream media journalism, the tradition the New York Times and the Washington Post come out of, which is the tradition I come out of? You know, how do you do that in a way that, you know, that\u2019s honest with your readers? And I think you know, there\u2019s always been, for a long time, been this debate both on the right and on the left saying come on, you guys, stop lying, don\u2019t conceal your opinions. We know you have real opinions. And at the same time, of course, everyone has a set of implicit opinions about, you know, you don\u2019t have to say, Hugh, that like you oppose racism and that you favor free speech. Those are obviously baked into your coverage, just as much as they\u2019re baked into the New York Times\u2019 coverage.\n\nParse that. Please.\n\nThis leads us back to the NSFC (not safe for church) tweet at the top of this post from BuzzFeed news editor Rachel Zarrell. A member of the wider GetReligion family send me the URL for that one with a simple statement: \"Time to tackle buzzfeed?\"\n\nI took this to mean that, in terms of WWW news trends, that newsroom -- with its constant blurring of the lines between hard news, editorials, entertainment and personal outrage -- is going to keep producing material that will drive traditional journalists bonkers. Can we ignore that? We ask the same questions in GetReligion email circles about The Daily Beast.\n\nTake that tweet at the top of this post. This is, of course, a reference to the ongoing issue of state officials -- clerks, mainly -- who believe that taking part in same-sex marriages violates their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religious freedom.\n\nThe irony of the Zarrell tweet is that it perfectly captures what SOME clerks would actually like to do -- stand aside.\n\nExperienced journalists covering this story know that there are plenty of clerks who have no problem with same-sex marriage. There are also some state officials who reject the Obergefell decision altogether and plan to fight it, tooth and toenail. They want to ignore the ruling.\n\nHowever, there are also clerks and other officials believe they are caught in a legitimate conflict of interest situation. Because of their religious beliefs, they do not believe that they can have anything to do with a same-sex marriage. However, they recognize the change the court has made in the law.\n\nThus, they believe they face a legal conflict of interest that they must declare, as covered in conflict of interest laws. It is their duty, facing this conflict, to stand aside and let another official -- one without this conflict of interest -- handle this public duty, presenting no obstacle to the citizens requesting this public service. They are willing to stand aside. However, they do not want to be fired for the free exercise of their religious beliefs.\n\nAs is often the case, journalists need to know that there are people caught in the middle, between the two most frequently covered camps in this debate.\n\nOf course, it is hard to cover a point of view if you don't know that it exists.\n\nIt's even harder to cover a point of view if your newsroom actively oppose its right to exist.\n\nThat brings us to the next Zarrell tweet:", "article_metadata": {"description": "This past year, I had a student in Washington who was really into BuzzFeed\r\n, for many reasons, including lots of valid ones.\r\n\r\nLike it or not, she said, the mainstream press was going to have to come to \r\nterms with key elements of the BuzzFeed\u00a0business model, especially the idea \r\nof breaking stories down into humorous and entertaining listicles that \r\nforce profitable mouse clicks.
