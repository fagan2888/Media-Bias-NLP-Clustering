Call it the ambivalent marriage \u2014 not always terrible, but not always great, either.\n\nNew research shows that ambivalence in a relationship \u2014 the feeling that a partner may be unpredictable with support or negativity \u2014 can take a quiet toll on the health of an individual.\n\nThe findings, by researchers at Brigham Young University, are part of a growing attempt to parse the so-called marriage benefit, the well-established notion that married people are healthier and live longer than the unmarried.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a lot of the research on the benefits of marriage measures relationship quality on this unidimensional scale,\u201d said Wendy C. Birmingham, who led the study, published in Annals of Behavioral Medicine. \u201cThey look at whether you\u2019re happy or you\u2019re not happy, or you feel supported or you\u2019re not supported. But not all relationships are one-dimensional.\u201d\n\nIn a carefully controlled study of 94 heterosexual couples in Salt Lake City, the researchers quizzed each partner privately about interactions in their marriage. The couples had been married, on average, for 5.4 years, but the lengths of their marriages ranged from one year to 41 years.\n\nThe researchers asked about the level of positive support the men and women received and gave when one of them needed advice or understanding. They also asked about the level of negativity between the spouses, or when they were excited or happy.\n\nNext, the men and women were given baseline blood pressure readings and wore a monitor from morning to bedtime. After random blood pressure readings during the day, twice each hour, subjects recorded exactly what they were doing at the moment.\n\nThe findings reveal the complex nature of marital relationships and the subtle effect positive and negative moments can have on physical health. Researchers found that the men and women in ambivalent relationships consistently posted higher systolic blood pressure readings. That suggests that one of the well-established benefits of marriage \u2014 better cardiovascular health \u2014 may not be as robust for couples in ambivalent marriages.\n\nArthur Aron of the Interpersonal Relationships Lab at Stony Brook University in New York, notes that every marriage will inevitably have good and bad qualities. But he said the results suggest that it is the unpredictable nature of an ambivalent relationship that may be taking the toll.\n\n\u201cBeing sometimes supportive and sometimes not supportive is not the same thing as being moderately supportive all the time,\u201d Aron said. \u201cPart of the issue may be the unpredictability. When you know someone is not going to be supportive, you acclimatize to that. But if they are sometimes one way and sometimes the other way, it\u2019s much harder.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/03/wedding_pic1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Call it the ambivalent marriage \u2014 not always terrible, but not always great, either.\nAfter random blood pressure readings during the day, twice each hour, subjects recorded exactly what they were doing at the moment.\nBut he said the results suggest that it is the unpredictable nature of an ambivalent relationship that may be taking the toll.\nResearchers found that the men and women in ambivalent relationships consistently posted higher systolic blood pressure readings.\nNext, the men and women were given baseline blood pressure readings and wore a monitor from morning to bedtime."}
