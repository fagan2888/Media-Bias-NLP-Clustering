Mike Huckabee will appear Thursday at a campaign rally in Fort Smith for Republican Senate candidate Tom Cotton.\n\nThe \u201cRiver Valley Political Rally\u201d will be held at the Fort Smith Museum of History, 320 Rogers Ave., starting at 11:30 a.m., according to the Cotton campaign. U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., is also expected to address the crowd.\n\nThis will mark the second appearance that Huckabee is making for Cotton\u2019s Senate campaign. He appeared with Cotton in Little Rock in August. Huckabee, now a resident of Florida and national television and radio personality, is considering a run for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to have the support of two great Arkansas leaders like Governor Huckabee and Senator Boozman,\u201d Cotton said in a statement. \u201cBoth Governor Huckabee and Senator Boozman have consistently stood up for Arkansas values and supported the right policies for our state.\u201d\n\nThe Cotton campaign also announced that it will host a free concert featuring country singer Collin Raye on Oct. 12 at the Arkansas Convention Center in Texarkana.\n\nCotton, a freshman congressman from Dardanelle, is challenging two-term incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., in a race that is among the most competitive this mid-term. The outcome also could help determine which party controls the Senate in the next session. Republicans need to gain six seats to secure the majority.\n\nIn August, Huckabee cast the race as a referendum on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to America that Harry Reid gets moved to the back of the room,\u201d he said. \u201cBills go in, but they never come out. \u2026 It has been unbelievable, the obstruction that this man has brought to the Senate.\u201d\n\nCotton has hammered away at a similar message, characterizing Pryor as a loyal Democratic vote for the Obama administration. Pryor, meanwhile, has highlighted his independence from the Democratic majority on issues such as environmental regulations.\n\nObama acknowledged that the mid-term campaigns have national implications during a speech Thursday at Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\n\u201cNow, I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle is pretty happy about that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot \u2014 every single one of them.\u201d\n\nObama then defended his presidency, noting that the deficit has been reduced and Obamacare is \u201cworking pretty well\u201d at delivering good, affordable health care. He also criticized Republicans in Congress for opposing efforts to raise the federal minimum wage protecting tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama confirmed what we\u2019ve known all along, a vote for Mark Pryor is a vote for the president and his failed liberal agenda,\u201d said Fred Brown, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee in Arkansas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former Arkansas Gov.
