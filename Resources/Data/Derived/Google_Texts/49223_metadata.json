(OTCBB:CAPR), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, today announced that it is currently enrolling a Phase II clinical trial with Cenderitide, a dual receptor natriuretic peptide agonist that has previously been used in approximately 270 patients including those suffering from acute decompensated heart failure. Capricor's current trial is a dose ranging study that is intended to evaluate the safety and feasibility of delivering the drug via a subcutaneous drug delivery patch pump. Capricor intends to address the large market for outpatient and ambulatory heart failure treatment including those patients with recent acute heart failure admissions as well as other potential indications.\n\nThe present trial will enroll up to 14 patients with stable, chronic heart failure. Currently, the first two cohorts of patients have completed dosing with the remaining subjects expected to be treated over the next month. Patients will receive up to eight consecutive days of Cenderitide through subcutaneous infusion using Insulet's drug delivery system based on the OmniPod\u00ae technology. This trial will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics profiles, and pharmacodynamic response to increasing dose levels of open-label Cenderitide administered in a stepwise fashion with each patient getting the entire range of doses. Cenderitide's treatment goal and target indication is to provide a novel and effective therapeutic option for the outpatient treatment of heart failure thereby addressing a critical unmet need and one of the largest potential markets in medicine.\n\n\"We now enter a potentially new era for the outpatient treatment of heart failure by combining a precision drug delivery system with a very potent class of drugs that are natriuretic, anti-aldosterone and have positive effects on remodeling,\" said Linda Marb\u00e1n, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Capricor. \"There is need for treatments that improve outcomes for recently decompensated patients. With sobering heart failure statistics, this has the potential to be an extremely exciting market opportunity for Capricor. Given the efficacy data generated by Novartis's LCZ696, which acts by inhibiting the enzyme that degrades endogenous natriuretic peptides, we are hopeful that by administration of our therapeutic natriuretic peptide Cenderitide, we may achieve beneficial clinical effects.\"\n\nHeart Failure\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults older than 65 years of age in the United States and is responsible for over 1 million hospital admissions annually. Among those patients that have been admitted, approximately 24% are re-hospitalized in one month, and 50% are re-hospitalized in six months. The Affordable Care Act may not allow Medicare payments for heart failure re-hospitalization within 30 days.\n\nAbout Cenderitide\n\nCenderitide belongs to a class of drugs called natriuretic peptides. Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the natriuretic peptide class can act on multiple disease processes that play a role in negative outcomes associated with heart failure. Cenderitide is designed as an outpatient therapy to be delivered continuously using a validated subcutaneous infusion pump for up to 90 days (the \"post-acute\" period) following a hospital admission for ADHF. Cenderitide was designed by scientists at the Mayo Clinic to be the only dual natriuretic peptide receptor agonist.\n\nCenderitide is currently not an approved product and is strictly for investigational purposes.\n\nFor more information on Cenderitide: http://capricor.com/product-pipeline/cenderitide-product/\n\nAbout Capricor Therapeutics\n\nCapricor Therapeutics, Inc.
