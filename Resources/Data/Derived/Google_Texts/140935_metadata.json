It estimated about a third of the U.S. population has metabolic syndrome.\n\nThe researchers at Loma Linda University studied 803 Seventh-day Adventist adults using a validated food frequency questionnaire and assessed both tree nut and peanut intake together and separately. Mean tree nut intake was 16 grams/day, or a half ounce, among the high tree nut consumers and 5 grams/day, or quarter ounce, among low tree nut consumers.\n\nThe study, published in the online journal PLoS One, found one serving, or 1 ounce, of tree nuts per week was significantly associated with 7 percent less risk of less metabolic syndrome.\n\n\"Interestingly, while overall nut consumption was associated with lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, tree nuts specifically appear to provide beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome, independent of demographic, lifestyle and other dietary factors,\" Jaceldo-Siegl said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the effect of nuts on metabolic syndrome the researchers also looked at the effect on obesity.\n\n\"We found that high tree nut consumers had significantly lower prevalence of obesity compared to the low tree nut consumers,\" Jaceldo-Siegl said. \"And, high consumers of tree nuts had the lowest prevalence of obesity when compared to the low peanut/tree nut groups.\"\n\nThe International Tree Nut Council funded the study. The international, non-profit, non-governmental organization is dedicated to supporting nutrition research and education for consumers and health professionals throughout the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People who eat tree nuts may have a lower risk off metabolic syndrome and obesity than those who don't eat tree nuts, U.S. researchers say.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "People who eat tree nuts may have a lower risk off metabolic syndrome and obesity than those who don't eat tree nuts, U.S. researchers say.", "title": "People who eat tree nuts may lower risk of metabolic syndrome", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/01/14/People-who-eat-tree-nuts-may-lower-risk-of-metabolic-syndrome/84571389681473/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/84571389681473/2014/1/60b00edd155bf8d82343e43b1cfbb902/v2.1/People-who-eat-tree-nuts-may-lower-risk-of-metabolic-syndrome.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "article_summary": "LOMA LINDA, Calif., Jan. 14 (UPI) -- People who eat tree nuts may have a lower risk off metabolic syndrome and obesity than those who don't eat tree nuts, U.S. researchers say.\nMean tree nut intake was 16 grams/day, or a half ounce, among the high tree nut consumers and 5 grams/day, or quarter ounce, among low tree nut consumers.\n\"We found that high tree nut consumers had significantly lower prevalence of obesity compared to the low tree nut consumers,\" Jaceldo-Siegl said.\n\"Interestingly, while overall nut consumption was associated with lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, tree nuts specifically appear to provide beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome, independent of demographic, lifestyle and other dietary factors,\" Jaceldo-Siegl said in a statement.\nIn addition to the effect of nuts on metabolic syndrome the researchers also looked at the effect on obesity."}
