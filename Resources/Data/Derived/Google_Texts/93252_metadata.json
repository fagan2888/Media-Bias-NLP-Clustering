On a press conference call, Zients finally acknowledged wide-spread enrollment problems, estimating that only 3 in 10 users have been able to sign up and complete an application (or a measly 700,000 total).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident by the end of November, HealthCare.gov will be smooth for a vast majority of users,\u201d said Zients. That estimate should scare the Obama administration: the end of November is dangerously close to the Thanksgiving deadline some experts say is crucial to snagging young, healthy consumers.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not running by Thanksgiving, that\u2019s DEFCON 2,\u201d warned MIT Economist Jonathan Gruber, who worked on both President Obama\u2019s and Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s health care laws. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem because people want to get insurance by January, but it\u2019s not a crisis.\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services has dispatched an army of field salesman and celebrities to convince young \u201cinvincibles\u201d to sign up for health insurance, which is needed to subsidize the costs of their elders.\n\nIn Massachusetts, which has a similar individual mandate, enrollment numbers increased exponentially towards the end of the deadline.\n\nBut, Massachusetts had twice as long and didn\u2019t have a funky enrollment deadline, where users had to sign up 3 months after the website launched to pick up insurance when the new plan started (for the Affordable Care Act, consumers must sign up by Dec. 15 to get insurance by Jan. 1).\n\nZients says a government contractor that worked on the malfunctioning backend, QSSI, will be taking over the Center for Medicare and Medicaid as the lead developer. However, continuing the White House\u2019s trend of bizarre and abject secrecy, he would not reveal who is part of the \u201ctech surge\u201d to fix the website.\n\n[Image Credit]", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/gregory-ferenstein/\" title=\"Posts by Gregory Ferenstein\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Gregory Ferenstein</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ferenstein\" rel=\"external\">@ferenstein</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare.gov is going to be broken until the end of November, says Jeff Zients, a consultant brought in to fix the beleaguered federal health insurance e-commerce website.
