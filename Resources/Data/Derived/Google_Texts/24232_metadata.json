Specifically:\n\nThe clips are confirmed as Gruber speaking and in one of the clips his state-only exchange comment was made during the prepared portion of his speech\n\nGruber makes the same argument, provides significant detail, and uses similar language in both clips\n\nBoth speeches were made two months before Obamacare had been signed into law by President Barack Obama, but only ten months before the time individual states were required to not only notify Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to set up an exchange but also submit a plan to HHS specifying the implementation details of their exchange\n\nNumerous Gruber publications support the tapes \u2013 After the first clip was discovered, Gruber claimed his remarks were a \u201cmistake\u201d made while \u201cspeaking off-the-cuff.\u201d However, a second video and three separate reports and articles were discovered by Breitbart that demonstrate Gruber believed Obamacare subsidies were only for state run exchanges.\n\nDOJ relied on a Gruber article \u2013 In order to defend itself in its Virginia Commonwealth Obamacare lawsuit, DOJ used one of the three uncovered reports, titled \u201cGetting the Facts Straight on Health Care Reform\u201d written by Gruber for The New England Journal of Medicine in December 2009. In the lawsuit, the Commonwealth argued that Congress exceeded its Article 1 powers in enacting Obamacare. Page 6 of DOJ\u2019s Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment specifically names Gruber\u2019s article \u2013 \u201cSee, e,g., Jonathan Gruber, Getting the Facts Straight on Health Care Reform, 361 NEW ENGL.J. OF MED. 2497, 2498 (2009).\u201d\n\nGruber spent significant time reviewing the Senate-proposed Obamacare bill and strongly supported the plan \u2013 As an article published on the Huffington Post by Jane Hamsher titled \u201cHow the White House Used Jonathan Gruber\u2019s Work to Orchestrate the Appearance of Broad Consensus\u201d makes clear:\n\nOn Monday the 23rd, the DNC was sending the Brownstein column around in its entirety\u2026one of 71 emails they would send touting Gruber\u2019s work and it was included in OFA\u2019s Monday Morning News Clips on BarackObama.com.\n\nThe Brownstein article mentioned above was published on November 21, 2010. The Senate bill had been read into the record and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders on December 24. Brownstein starts this widely distributed article by saying:\n\nWhen I reached Jonathan Gruber on Thursday, he was working his way, page by laborious page, through the mammoth health care bill Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had unveiled just a few hours earlier. Gruber is a leading health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is consulted by politicians in both parties.\n\nThe article quotes Gruber as saying \u201cEverything is in here\u2026 I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d do that they are not doing in the bill. You couldn\u2019t have done better than they are doing.\u201d\n\nCongress relied on Gruber \u2013 As Michael F. Cannon, Cato Institute\u2019s Director of Health Policy Studies, points out in his blog, \u201cGruber is not a member of Congress, so this isn\u2019t direct evidence that Congress intended to offer tax credits only in state-established Exchanges.\u201d\n\nHowever, as highlighted in the Hamsher article, then-Speaker Pelosi touted \u201cthe Gruber Analysis\u201d on her website. Furthermore, Senator Reid read from the piece on the floor of the Senate, saying that it provided substantiation from someone \u201cwho is one of the most respected economists in the world.\u201d Moreover, on December 3, Kathleen Sebelius released a statement on the \u201cBenefits of Health Insurance Reform for Businesses.\u201d She substantiated claims made in the statement by citing Gruber\u2019s November 3 testimony before the HELP Committee, and his November 5 paper.\n\nGruber\u2019s argument is logical \u2013 During the January 2010 time period when these two recently uncovered clips of Gruber occurred, individual states were considering whether or not to set up their own exchanges. Even though HHS was pressuring states to establish their own exchanges, many governors, especially Republican governors, were balking. Gruber\u2019s comment\u2013\u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits\u201d\u2013is a logical argument and a form of leverage HHS and the Obama administration likely used to pressure GOP governors to set up their own exchanges.\n\nGruber\u2019s independence and credibility are damaged \u2013 Having a second tape and several publications emerge after Gruber claimed it was a \u201cmistake\u201che made while \u201cspeaking off-the-cuff\u201d has severely damaged Gruber\u2019s credibility. Unfortunately for Gruber and the Obama Administration, this is not the first time Gruber\u2019s credibility has been questioned. In January 2010, after he had made numerous speeches and had several of his publications widely distributed and heralded as credible independent work, Gruber had to admit he was not independent. And, as Jane Hamsher wrote in her article, \u201cIn December 28, Gruber published an op-ed in the Washington Post \u2014 in which he neglected to mention his contract to consult with the White House on this very issue. He was asked point-blank if he had any contracts related to the piece for which he was being paid, and he said \u2018no.\u2019 The Post subsequently published a correction.\u201d\n\nIn the less than two weeks since the federal appeals court decision, the Obama administration\u2019s claim that Obamacare always intended to include subsidies for the Federal exchange has been dismantled. Now, Obamacare appears headed back to the Supreme Court, where even more damaging material is sure to emerge. Whatever the outcome, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s own words and writings make one thing abundantly clear: the language stating only state Obamacare exchanges are eligible for subsides is no \u201ctypo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "7 Facts That Prove Obamacare Subsidies Fiasco Is Not a 'Typo'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "7 Facts That Prove Obamacare Subsidies Fiasco Is Not a 'Typo'", "title": "7 Facts That Prove Obamacare Subsidies Fiasco Is Not a 'Typo' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/Obama-Town-Hall.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/02/7-emerging-facts-that-prove-obamacare-typo-is-no-such-thing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "7 Facts That Prove Obamacare Subsidies Fiasco Is Not a 'Typo'", "title": "7 Facts That Prove Obamacare Subsidies Fiasco Is Not a 'Typo' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/Obama-Town-Hall.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Senate, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-08-02T14:00:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf42\"", "article_summary": "Whatever the outcome, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s own words and writings make one thing abundantly clear: the language stating only state Obamacare exchanges are eligible for subsides is no \u201ctypo.\u201d\nPage 6 of DOJ\u2019s Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment specifically names Gruber\u2019s article \u2013 \u201cSee, e,g., Jonathan Gruber, Getting the Facts Straight on Health Care Reform, 361 NEW ENGL.J.\nNow, Obamacare appears headed back to the Supreme Court, where even more damaging material is sure to emerge.\nIn the lawsuit, the Commonwealth argued that Congress exceeded its Article 1 powers in enacting Obamacare.\nGruber is a leading health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is consulted by politicians in both parties."}
