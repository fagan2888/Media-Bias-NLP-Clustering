They argue there were 29 days at best to comment, and less time actually, because documents didn't arrive at the Burnsville library until later.\n\nThey also argue those materials didn't state the true level of Mississippi Silicon's pollution is expanding.\n\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports U.S. District Judge Debra M. Brown dismissed the lawsuit Thursday and denied a request for an injunction to stop the project. Brown says plaintiffs failed to prove that Mississippi Silicon's permit to build the plant is invalid.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A federal judge has ended the legal fight over a silicon metal plant being built in northeast Mississippi.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"description": "A federal judge has ended the legal fight over a silicon metal plant being built in northeast Mississippi.", "title": "Mississippi Silicon Lawsuit Dismissed by Federal Judge", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Mississippi-Silicon-Lawsuit-Dismissed-by-Federal-Judge-320385821.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/EE2/A43/EE2A43D8AB754091B42864DF64FEE1CC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DE0/814/DE081415268645C39B5E834EF0EC6DA2.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A federal judge has ended the legal fight over a silicon metal plant being built in northeast Mississippi.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Mississippi-Silicon-Lawsuit-Dismissed-by-Federal-Judge-320385821.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/60428C60-GXJAR.jpg", "title": "Mississippi Silicon Lawsuit Dismissed by Federal Judge", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Mississippi Silicon Lawsuit Dismissed by Federal Judge", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mississippi Silicon Lawsuit Dismissed by"}, "article_summary": "A federal judge has ended the legal fight over a silicon metal plant being built in northeast Mississippi.\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports U.S. District Judge Debra M.
