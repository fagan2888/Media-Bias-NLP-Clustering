Manufacturers need these medications to be safely distributed with limited barriers to access, and payors need to ensure they are used appropriately. The acquisition of Sonexus Health enables Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions to help its clients address these key challenges.\n\n\u201cThe addition of Sonexus Health to our portfolio brings us even closer to the patient, by enabling us to provide a next generation solution to help clients ensure that patients who need specialty medications can get faster access to them, and the right services to improve clinical outcomes,\u201d said Scott Howell, M.D., senior vice president of Clinical Affairs for Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. \u201cOur combined core competencies further strengthen our efforts to help payors, physician practices and biopharmaceutical manufacturers navigate the growing complexity of specialty care.\u201d\n\nCardinal Health Specialty Solutions clients will now have access to Sonexus Health\u2019s patient services \u2018hub,\u2019 which serves as a patient and physician practice support center that:\n\nReduces administrative burdens by working with patients, physician offices and insurance companies to facilitate treatment coverage and coordinate the medication reimbursement process;\n\nImproves patient access by identifying appropriate copay assistance and free-drug programs that can make specialty medications more affordable; and by delivering medications \u2013 based on manufacturer guidelines \u2013 with unmatched efficiency and supply chain integrity; and\n\nHelps improve patient outcomes by delivering disease education and medication compliance programs.\n\nIn addition, Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions clients will have access to expanded third-party logistics services, enabling them to send higher volumes of smaller parcel shipments directly to physician offices, clinics and hospitals.\n\n\u201cCardinal Health Specialty Solutions shares our commitment to improving the quality and efficiency of specialty care by providing patient-centered solutions and actionable insight that specialty manufacturers need and expect,\u201d said Mike Mullen, president of Sonexus Health. \u201cWe are excited to join the Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions team and to leverage their strength and scale to continue expanding our comprehensive services to an even broader number of clients.\u201d\n\nThe base of Sonexus Health\u2019s operations will remain in Dallas, and customers will continue to be served in the same service model currently offered.\n\nAbout Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions\n\nCardinal Health Specialty Solutions provides regulatory, clinical, reimbursement, technology and distribution services to help health care professionals, payors and pharmaceutical and biotech companies improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of caring for patients who are managing complex diseases.
