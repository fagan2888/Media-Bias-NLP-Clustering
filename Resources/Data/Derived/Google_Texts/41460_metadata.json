I don\u2019t know what the answer is \u2014 or if a car like the i3 is the long term future of the car,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that small. It\u2019s actually quite roomy inside. It\u2019s almost a small people carrier.\u201d\n\nHaving been part of the BBC Top Gear team for many years \u2014 a show which has relentlessly criticised and made fun of electric cars for many years \u2014 May said it was time to go green.\n\n\u201cI talk about cars, as I was saying earlier. I make a living out of doing that\u2026I sort of feel obliged to,\u201d he said of his BMW i3 purchase.\n\nLater in the show, May discussed range extended electric cars, and came clean that he is buying the BMW i3 REx range-extended EV rather than the all-electric i3 EV.\n\nEV fan or not, May still has a little range anxiety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a range extender,\u201d he said of the i3 REx\u2019s tiny range-extending petrol engine. \u201cIt really ought to be branded \u2018pure cowardice,\u2019 because that\u2019s what it is and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got one,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use it, and I will try not to use it,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like when I tell the doctor I\u2019m not going to do any drinking or smoking but I will do a bit. I will try to use the electric car infrastructure as much as possible.\u201d\n\nDespite having a range extended BMW i3 electric car however, May says the BMW i3 isn\u2019t going to be his only car \u2014 and when he goes long-distance away from his London home, he\u2019ll use another car instead.\n\nWhen pushed, May was a little sheepish as to what that car is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Ferrari,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m cheating I know. I really hoped you weren\u2019t going to ask me that!\u201d\n\nTalking of a gradual transition from petrol to electric and a future where multiple different fuel options exist, May reiterated that the change from petrol to electric will be a little bit the change from horse-drawn carriage to cars in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe real world is about money, and a lot of people have to make ends meet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds pompous I know, but electric cars are currently for the wealthy and electric cars will proliferate if they are made cheaper and more attractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want anybody to think I\u2019m buying an electric car so the Government is pleased with me. I couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m buying an electric car because I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s exciting and I\u2019m in the fortunate position of being able to do it and take part in this rather interesting experiment.\u201d\n\nAs for improving electric cars for the future? Aside from the obvious points like price, range and charging capabilities, May says automakers need to work harder to improve the onboard noise generators used to alert pedestrians to an electric car\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cThey kind of sound like vomiting robots,\u201d he moaned. \u201cThey could sound like bird chirps or snatches of Oasis riffs or something. They need to make a bit more effort.\u201d\n\nHere at Transport Evolved, we\u2019re pleased to hear at least one of the Top Gear trio is giving electric cars a real chance \u2014 but what do you think?
