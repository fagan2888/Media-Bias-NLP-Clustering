Because people often incorrectly estimate their future income, many Americans may have gotten subsidies\u2014based on their own projections of 2014 income\u2014that were too generous.\n\nFor Obamacare enrollees whose subsidies are too high, the average that they may owe back to the IRS is $208, though as the WSJ reported, \"some filers got subsidies that were too small and will get larger refunds.\"\n\nStill - that half of Americans are going to end up owing hundreds of dollars back to the IRS because of \"overpayments\" for Obamacare subsidies might come as a surprise to those millions of people.\n\nHat tip: Justin Green.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study from a tax preparation firm has found that half of all beneficiaries of Obamacare subsidies for insurance may have had subsidies that were too large, and are going to end up with much larger payments to the IRS this year than they were expecting..05/26/2016 4:27:50AM EST.", "author": "Kevin Glass", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A new study from a tax preparation firm has found that half of all beneficiaries of Obamacare subsidies for insurance may have had subsidies that were too large, and are going to end up with much larger payments to the IRS this year than they were expecting.", "title": "Kevin Glass - The IRS Mess That Will See Obamacare Enrollees Owing More Taxes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2015/01/04/the-irs-mess-that-will-see-obamacare-enrollees-owing-more-taxes-n1938005", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/325/2014-11-21T162759Z_2_LYNXNPEAAK0UF_RTROPTP_3_OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A new study from a tax preparation firm has found that half of all beneficiaries of Obamacare subsidies for insurance may have had subsidies that were too large, and are going to end up with much larger payments to the IRS this year than they were expecting.", "title": "Kevin Glass - The IRS Mess That Will See Obamacare Enrollees Owing More Taxes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2015/01/04/the-irs-mess-that-will-see-obamacare-enrollees-owing-more-taxes-n1938005", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/325/2014-11-21T162759Z_2_LYNXNPEAAK0UF_RTROPTP_3_OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The IRS Mess That Will See Obamacare Enrollees Owing More Taxes, Kevin Glass, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0b1\"", "article_summary": "Still - that half of Americans are going to end up owing hundreds of dollars back to the IRS because of \"overpayments\" for Obamacare subsidies might come as a surprise to those millions of people.\nBecause people often incorrectly estimate their future income, many Americans may have gotten subsidies\u2014based on their own projections of 2014 income\u2014that were too generous.\nFor Obamacare enrollees whose subsidies are too high, the average that they may owe back to the IRS is $208, though as the WSJ reported, \"some filers got subsidies that were too small and will get larger refunds.\"\n\u201cThe whole implementation of Obamacare will be frustrating for tax preparers.\u201d In addition to determining who has to pay a penalty, the accuracy of tax credits is likely to pose challenges.\nA new study from a tax preparation firm has found that half of all beneficiaries of Obamacare subsidies for insurance may have had subsidies that were too large, and are going to end up with much larger payments to the IRS this year than they were expecting."}
