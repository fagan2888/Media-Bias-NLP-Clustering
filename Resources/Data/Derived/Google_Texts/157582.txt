Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plan to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday.

Mr. Scott won a tight race against former Gov. Charlie Crist, a former Republican, this year â€” one of several big-time races that Mr. Christie, who chaired the Republican Governors Association, was able to put in the win column.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Scott said that Mr. Christie and Mr. Perry, both of whom appeared with Mr. Scott during the campaign and are considering presidential bids in 2016, would attend the swearing-in, The Associated Press reported.

Florida, which figures to be a key state in the GOP presidential nominating contest, is also home to former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, who are also considering running for president in 2016.
