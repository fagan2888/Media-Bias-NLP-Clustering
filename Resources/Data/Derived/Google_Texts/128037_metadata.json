If you see something, say something,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nEvery neighborhood should be doing what it can for itself, Goodman said\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to teach our children what safety is about,\u201d she added, stressing the importance of teaching youths to trust law enforcement.\n\nLilian Cox, owner of Pitfit Street Training in Las Vegas, encourages disadvantaged youths to defend themselves by teaching them about fitness and self-confidence.\n\n\u201cIf they ever have to throw down, they\u2019re going to have the upper hand,\u201d Cox said of kids who train with her intense nutrition and exercise program.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about physical strength, though. \u201cWe\u2019re social workers at heart,\u201d Cox said of her three-person team made up of herself, her partner, Liz D\u2019ercole,and her daughter, Rita Gomez.\n\nThe company\u2019s motto: \u201cWe believe that the parallels between consistently pushing through our tough workouts and pushing through difficult life circumstances provide a template for success across all areas of life.\u201d\n\nOutside of the event center, the Clark County Fire Department approached the neighborhood \u201ctake back\u201d idea by teaching kids about fire prevention in their mock house, designed to show potential fire hazards.\n\nIn the kitchen of the makeshift home, Fire Inspector Steve Dieter asked \u201cbefore we start cooking, is there anything unsafe?\u201d\n\nAfter pointing out the dangers of leaving items such as oven mitts and paper towels near the stove, Dieter explained how essential it is for each family to have its own fire escape plan, saying \u201cthere are no fire deaths in schools,\u201d because of monthly drills and necessary preparedness.\n\nSpeaking in favor of the \u201cMore Cops\u201d initiative that would raise Clark County\u2019s sales tax to aid Metro\u2019s need for officers that was tabled in November 2014, Goodman said, \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you live in Boulder City, North Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Henderson or Mesquite. Every one of your city councils voted unanimously in resolution for more cops.\u201d\n\nCalling for law enforcement\u2019s support, Goodman described valley officers as \u201cthe best in the world.\u201d\n\nEvery day when they prepare themselves for duty, \u201cthey don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be coming back home,\u201d Goodman said.\n\n\u201cKeep screaming for more cops,\u201d she said enthusiastically to the crowd who was surrounded by signs that read \u201cevery life matters,\u201d \u201craise kind kids,\u201d \u201cthis is your home town\u201d and \u201ccherish your neighborhood.\u201d\n\nCiting the rate of homicides, Sheriff Lombardo said to the onlookers, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to tolerate that type of crime.\u201d\n\nA cellphone photo frenzy closed the short appearance as the sheriff asked all Metro police officers in the building to come to the stage for a \u201cphoto opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just asked the sheriff if I could stay here for the photograph,\u201d Goodman said after having spent the previous 15 minutes posing for selfies with attendees and a Tina Turner impersonator. Well, it is election season.\n\nContact Kimberly De La Cruz at kdelacruz@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0381.
