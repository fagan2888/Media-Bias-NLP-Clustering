By 2017, nearly 20 percent of employees nationwide could get their health insurance through a private exchange, according to Accenture Research. A recent report by the National Business Group on Health said 30 percent of large employers are considering moving active employees to exchanges by 2015.\n\nThe CarePlus Benefits Exchanges are designed to ease employers' transition toward a fixed-budget approach to group health plans while employees get access to more benefit options than under traditional arrangements.\n\nThe exchanges help address the underlying cost of health care by highlighting and rewarding healthy behavior. They also allow employers to better plan for the future and avoid the potential volatility of traditional benefits budgets.\n\n\"The CarePlus Benefits Exchanges offer more options to employers than any other private exchange in the country and a truly unique shopping experience for their employees,\" said BB&T Insurance Holdings Chairman and CEO Wade Reece. \"We have two different exchanges to choose from and both are priced affordably and supported by the nation's top carriers. For employees and their families, both options allow them to create a personalized program that includes health, financial and wellness tools.\"\n\nThe CarePlus Benefits Exchanges are:\n\nThe CarePlus Standard Exchange \u2013 Developed by New York -based Liazon Corp., the standard exchange is designed for employers looking for low administrative overhead. It offers a user-friendly website featuring decision-support tools, help center, videos, and an information library to promote healthy living and wellness.\n\n\u2013 Developed by -based Liazon Corp., the standard exchange is designed for employers looking for low administrative overhead.

The CarePlus Benefits Exchanges were designed for a broad cross-section of employers, both small- to mid-sized as well as large businesses.\"\n\nCarePlus group health, wellness and administrative services, including the new Benefits Exchanges, are available through BB&T Insurance Holdings, which includes subsidiaries BB&T Insurance Services, BB&T Insurance Services of California, McGriff, Seibels & Williams, and Precept Insurance Solutions.
