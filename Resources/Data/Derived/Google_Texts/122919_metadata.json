And state Assemblyman Rich Gordon (D-Menlo Park) is preparing to release new findings from statewide hearings on the threat.\n\n\u201cLocal governments are starting to take the issue seriously and are doing their homework,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIn San Mateo County, we\u2019re exposed on two out of four sides to sea level rise.\u201d\n\nThe threat of rising tides, which had once been left to long-term analyses, is now being viewed as a serious issue for coastal communities along California\u2019s length. Though the full impact may not be felt for another 50 to 100 years, lawmakers, researchers and regional planners are trying to jumpstart planning efforts now, rather than scramble for solutions later.\n\nSan Mateo County is at particular risk of rising water, according to scientists, thanks to its location between the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. A 2009 study by the Pacific Institute named the county as one of the most vulnerable in the state. The county\u2019s Pacific coast faces a potential 18 miles of erosion and 30 miles of flooding on its roadways alone if seas rise roughly four-and-a-half feet as predicted by 2100, the report said.\n\nAlready, areas along the San Mateo County coast are showing the impacts of the sea. Stretches of Highway 1 north of San Mateo County loses up to 1.4 feet of roadside each year to erosion, according to a 2012 Caltrans report. The city of Pacifica condemned a row of apartment buildings in 2010 after their bluff-top location overlooking the ocean eroded severely, causing the building foundations to jut over the cliffs. And sections of Half Moon Bay sit within a high-risk zone for coastal flooding even without additional sea level rise.\n\nGenerally, planners tackle sea level rise by deciding to fortify a coastline with sea walls or other structures, conduct a managed retreat by allowing sea levels to rise uncontained in certain areas or use adaptive measures like replenishing sand on beaches.\n\nHalf Moon Bay began updating its General Plan and Local Coastal Program last year, with a goal of developing sea level scenarios by this spring. The city\u2019s new planning process, which will also tackle perennial topics like where and what to build, will update documents last revised in the 1990s. Officials say the new funds will be used to incorporate sea level risk into the revisions.\n\nJo Chamberlain, who sits on the city\u2019s citizen advisory council for the update, has seen ongoing coastal erosion as the executive director of the Coastside Land Trust, a nonprofit which preserves open space land.\n\n\u201cWe own many properties along the shoreline and it\u2019s eroding very fast,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect uncontrollable erosion to continue given our experience and what the research indicates.\u201d\n\nNext steps for the planning process include community discussion sessions and a citywide mailed survey. Meetings are expected to continue through 2015, when the new plans will need to be approved by the state\u2019s Coastal Commission.\n\nBut the sea level issue reaches beyond Half Moon Bay. San Mateo County\u2019s Pacific coast features a high number of unincorporated towns and agricultural lands that fall under the county\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nEach area faces unique challenges from sea level rise, according to Steve Monowitz, deputy planning director for the county. While northern coastal towns such as Moss Beach or Montara may be more affected by eroding bluffs, lower-lying areas may be at risk for flooding or loss of beachfront.\n\n\u201cThere is no one-size-fits-all solution for this problem,\u201d Monowitz said. \u201cOur general approach is to do the best we can to ascertain what areas are vulnerable, and then come up with a plan to either protect them or move them.\u201d\n\nOne town the county is intent on protecting is Princeton-by-the-Sea, a small community north of Half Moon Bay which sits within a high-risk area. \u201cWill this be inundated at some point? I think so,\u201d said Eric Trojak, who co-owns a winemaking business in Princeton.\n\nWith the widespread erosion of the popular Surfer\u2019s Beach north of Half Moon Bay posing a risk to nearby Highway 1, Trojak said he\u2019s seen more residents discussing a higher ocean, even if many don\u2019t expect to see it in their lifetime. The county has launched a planning process to better understand the risks to Princeton in the event of sea level rise, with a goal of a formal plan by 2015.\n\nThe economic threat of sea level rise stretches beyond homeowners and municipalities.\n\nPillar Point Harbor, north of Half Moon Bay \u2014 which provides more than 300 berths for commercial fishermen and other fleets \u2014 is seeking consultants to update its long-term financial plan, which manager Peter Grenell said must take into account sea level rise.\n\nInland, rising seas also pose a potential concern for agriculture, with saltwater able to contaminate freshwater aquifers used by farmers.\n\nThere has long been concern over saltwater contamination in the area, said Jim Wilkinson, a contractor with experience drilling coastal wells. While he has yet to see any, he notes that farmers in Monterey County have seen such contamination.\n\nGrant Ballard, a biologist who studies sea level rise along the county\u2019s coast, encouraged residents to educate themselves about the long-term risks.\n\n\u201cGetting people to have the conversation is critical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what will happen, but we do know the range of possibilities. What can we do today so that we don\u2019t look back and wish we had done more?\u201d\n\nListen to reporter Matthew Hansen explain the story behind the story on KZSU Stanford\u2019s \u201cPeninsula Report\u201d radio show with host Eliza Ridgeway:", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Assemblyman Rich Gordon,Coastside Land Trust,Environment,erosion,floods,Half Moon Bay,Matt Hansen,Matthew Hansen,pacifica,Princeton-by-the-sea,San Mateo County,sea level rise,Surfer\u2019s Beach,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured,Parks & Recreation,Politics & Gov", "description": "Even amid a historic drought, officials are planning for future sea level rise that could eventually bring extensive flooding, beach and bluff erosion and water\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe284f\"", "article_summary": "Grant Ballard, a biologist who studies sea level rise along the county\u2019s coast, encouraged residents to educate themselves about the long-term risks.\nSan Mateo County\u2019s Pacific coast features a high number of unincorporated towns and agricultural lands that fall under the county\u2019s jurisdiction.\nSan Mateo County is at particular risk of rising water, according to scientists, thanks to its location between the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay.\nStretches of Highway 1 north of San Mateo County loses up to 1.4 feet of roadside each year to erosion, according to a 2012 Caltrans report.\nAnd sections of Half Moon Bay sit within a high-risk zone for coastal flooding even without additional sea level rise."}
