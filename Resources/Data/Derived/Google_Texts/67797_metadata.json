That is when the community stepped up and saved the day.\n\nAnadarko Police Officer Dustan Chandler has a new partner, Sam.\n\nThe 2-year-old German Shepard joined the force as a drug dog. He is fully trained to sniff out marijuana, cocaine, heroin and meth, which are big concerns in Anadarko.\n\n\u201cRight now, the biggest problem we have in Anadarko is drugs, so I'm hoping just to get the drugs off the streets for now,\u201d Officer Chandler said.\n\nAnadarko leaders knew they needed a K-9 to fight drug trafficking, but had no money to pay for it other than seeking out government grants.\n\n\u201cThose take months and we wanted something that took weeks,\u201d Anadarko Police Chief Jason Smith told News 9.\n\nThe community stepped in to help out.\n\nSo many business and individual donations came in that police raised the entire $3,400 for Sam and his training in one week.\n\n\u201cI went to the community with the plea of help us get this started and they answered resoundingly,\u201d Chief Smith beamed.\n\nThe Perry Police Department even donated equipment to outfit Chandler's car for Sam.\n\nSam is a friendly dog; he does not bite because the police chief wanted him to also be a community liaison.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like it, I went to the high school and walked in the gym and everyone was running up here and petting him,\u201d Chandler explained.\n\nChandler still has to be trained to be a handler in a 49-hour class and said he cannot wait to start working with Sam.\n\n\u201cWe like the support from the community and all the donations that we've received, it actually shows that they really care and they're trying to help us better the community,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nOfficer Chandler goes to training on Monday and if everything goes well with his certification, he could be patrolling with Sam by the end of next week.\n\nAn Anadarko restaurant called Joe's Burgers has now started a fundraiser to buy Sam a $1,500 bullet-proof vest.\n\nThere\u2019s an online fundraising page if people outside of Anadarko would like to help, click here.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Anadarko Police had to scrap its K-9 program years ago due to budget cuts.
