States collect information about patients, providers and procedures faster than it can be analyzed -- if it is at all. Some data go here, some there, and often the dots trailing fraud schemes aren\u2019t connected.\n\nIn the hands of fraud investigators trained to build cases on months or years of paperwork, bills and receipts, data sets that could theoretically identify fraud have proved more taunting than useful.\n\nTexas is leading the way in changing that with new software that officials say has already helped identify more than $42 million in Medicaid fraud that would have previously gone unnoticed. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission awarded a $19.8 million contract to 21 CT, an Austin-based network security and fraud detection company, to build the software.\n\n\u201dI want to make the business of defrauding health care in Texas unprofitable for the fraudsters,\u201d said Kyle Flaherty, 21 CT\u2019s vice president for marketing.\n\nFrom a conference table in the company\u2019s third-floor suite looking out on Northwest Austin\u2019s hills, Flaherty demonstrated Torch, the program the company debuted at a national Medicaid fraud conference in San Antonio last week. With just a few clicks on a laptop, Torch can identify outliers and trends almost instantaneously, he said.\n\nIn lay terms, Torch could be described as a software monster that consumes data from myriad sources -- the state\u2019s health care system, federal data, physician data, business records, background checks and even Google maps -- information that wasn\u2019t necessarily meant to work together. Torch digests the information, linking relevant data, then spits it out onto a screen that is meant to work as easily as Google.\n\nThe data can be queried, but it also runs analytics in real time, allowing investigators to spot trends they hadn\u2019t considered.\n\nTherein lies the key selling point, company executives say: You don\u2019t need to be a data expert to use Torch, freeing investigators to follow their intuition while the software pulls in evidence.\n\nWith just the name of a doctor, the program can identify the Medicaid billing history, including the type of procedures billed, and produce a social network analysis to illustrate the doctor\u2019s connections based on business addresses, tax IDs, vehicle records and bank accounts.\n\nOften the visuals tell the story, Flaherty said. Using Torch, investigators have found networks of seemingly unconnected doctors linked by a single node -- a bank account number, for instance. The program can also discern whether doctors are billing for obscure procedures, a common method for cloaking bogus or unnecessary procedures.\n\n\u201dThe data\u2019s been there,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201dIt\u2019s the combination of software and human intuition that gets us there.\u201d\n\nSince January 2013, a version of Torch has been used by the Office of the Inspector General for the Health and Human Services Commission, the state agency that manages the roughly $28.3 billion in annual Medicaid spending -- about half of which comes from state tax dollars, according to 2012 figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nInspector General Douglas Wilson said that between January 2013 -- when investigators began flowing some 2.7 terabytes of data into Torch -- and March 2013, the software identified several cases that have resulted in settlements or successful criminal prosecutions, while others are still being investigated.\n\n\u201dIt allows us to find the unknown unknowns,\u201d Wilson said, noting that previous data systems used by his office were only useful in tracking fraud that investigators already knew about. \u201dThe Torch system allows us to sort of pull the string and find out why.\u201d\n\nInvestigators using Torch have also stumbled on about $83 million in possible fraud in Medicare, the federal medical insurance system for those 65 and older -- details Texas forwarded to U.S. officials, Wilson said.\n\n\u201dAs opposed to them funneling us leads,\u201d he said, \u201dwe\u2019re funneling them leads.\u201d\n\nIrene Williams, chief executive of 21 CT, said fraud investigators in other states are looking into following Texas\u2019 lead.\n\n\u201dPeople look up to and admire what the state of Texas is doing,\u201d Williams said. \u201dIt\u2019s becoming the model.\u201d\n\nState officials, citing security concerns, at first refused to release any details of 21 CT\u2019s contract, which the Austin American-Statesman requested under the Texas Public Information Act. Later, officials provided a heavily redacted copy of the contract that did little to illuminate how much Texas is paying for specific services. Seemingly mundane details like dollar amounts on purchase orders or delivery dates were blacked out.\n\nThe total contract with the company is for $19.8 million, with some of the money coming from federal matching funds, said commission spokeswoman Linda Edwards-Gockel.\n\nRecords kept by the Texas comptroller\u2019s office indicate the company has been paid at least $16.8 million.\n\nNovel as Torch may be to the health care industry, the underlying concept of finding relationships in disparate data is fundamental to the way companies such as Amazon track customers and their orders, preferences and payments. The technology has been on fraud investigators\u2019 wish list for years, but problems with data -- each state inputs, gathers and processes it differently -- and lack of expertise have been monumental obstacles.\n\nThough it remains to be seen how much fraud can be thwarted by programs like Torch, 21 CT might have found at least a partial answer to fraud investigators\u2019 prayers, said Frank Scafidi, public affairs director for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit that investigates fraud for insurance companies.\n\n\u201dThis technology that you\u2019re addressing, if it can bring all that together and show things -- those indicators or red flags -- it quickly delivers a point of focus for an investigator, so they don\u2019t really have to spend a lot of time connecting all those variables,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201dIt sounds like a good, useful development.\u201d\n\nScafidi, a former FBI fraud investigator, said criminals have been able to stay one step ahead of investigators who were awash in data yet lacked the expertise or technology to apply it.\n\n\u201dWe had so many different databases, we didn\u2019t know what the hell was in there,\u201d he said.\n\nJ.
