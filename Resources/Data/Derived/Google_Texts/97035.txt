Obamacare heroin is certainly not the public relation fix that Obama’s staff was hoping for after months of glitches with the rollout of the president’s regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. Over 1,000 bags of heroin were found this week by Massachusetts State Police, reports The Associated Press on Saturday.

While the major drug bust is certainly commendable, what’s getting all the attention is that each bag was stamped with the label “Obamacare” in red ink. Other bags were stamped with “Kurt Cobain.”

Police discovered the conspiracy after troopers, on a traffic stop in Northampton, noticed the suspect’s car going by with a “number of violations.” The car was stopped, and inside the trunk were 1,250 bags of the hard drug.

“During the stop, evidence of illegal narcotics led to a request for a State Police K9. Trooper David Stucenski and K9 Frankie located 1,250 individual bags of heroin in the vehicle,” a police statement read.

Tyler Robenstein, Marquese Jones, Sherod Green, and Ashley Beaulieu have all been charged with drug trafficking.

As for the bizarre labels, State police Lt. Daniel Richard says it's not unusual for heroin to be stamped with numbers, words or symbols to identify who's selling it.

But “Obamacare” and “Kurt Cobain?” Clearly meant as a joke, spoofing Obama’s embattled health care initiative and also the former Nirvana front man who suffered from addiction to heroin.
