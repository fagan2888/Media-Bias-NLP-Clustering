You could present yourself honestly and try your best to convince voters that you\u2019ll represent their interests, or you could fabricate a persona and hope to confuse enough voters to win.\n\nSpecifically, what Wilson did was distribute flyers with photographs of smiling African Americans, captioned with the words \u201cPlease vote for our friend and neighbor Dave Wilson.\u201d The pictures were grabbed from a casual internet search. The most incredible detail of this scam involves another flyer:\n\nIf this were any other election, this wouldn't have worked. But because it was a low-turnout race for an obscure position, Wilson could get away with the stunt.\n\nStill, it's hard to believe this happened. Yes, it\u2019s true that politicians mislead voters about their intentions and their policies, though this is overstated. But it\u2019s one thing to make a promise you can\u2019t follow or a claim you can\u2019t support, it\u2019s something else entirely to pretend to be someone else entirely. Americans are upset that President Obama lied about changes to the individual insurance market under the Affordable Care Act, but relative to this, that's no big deal. For a comparable lie, Obama would have had to mislead the United States into believing he was a citizen of the United States, when in fact, he was a Kenyan socialist? (Of course, some Americans believe this is actually the case.)", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201311112230, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "By masquerading as a black candidate, Dave Wilson finally catches a break for the white man in America.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "White Man Wins Local Election After Running as a Black Man", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"White Man Wins Local Election After Running as a Black Man\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46140329.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-11T22:30:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. Politics\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-11-11T22:30:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "By masquerading as a black candidate, Dave Wilson finally catches a break for the white man in America.", "title": "White Man Wins Local Election After Running as a Black Man", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/11/white-republican-wins-election-after-running-as-a-black-man/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1384209879343.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bf7\"", "article_summary": "Yes, it\u2019s true that politicians mislead voters about their intentions and their policies, though this is overstated.\nFor a comparable lie, Obama would have had to mislead the United States into believing he was a citizen of the United States, when in fact, he was a Kenyan socialist?\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a white conservative Republican politician vying to represent a mostly black and Democratic area on the board that governs the community colleges.\nThe most incredible detail of this scam involves another flyer:If this were any other election, this wouldn't have worked.\nBut because it was a low-turnout race for an obscure position, Wilson could get away with the stunt."}
