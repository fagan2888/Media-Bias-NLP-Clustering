In other words, thanks to the human brain, we are always slightly living in the past.\n\nOf course, the brain naturally prepares itself for its inevitable lagging through something called neural prediction, which involves observing the behavior of things, storing that information in your memory, and then using it later. For example, though the brain may not be able to process a moving ball\u2019s every movement as it hurtles toward you, it can predict where the ball will end up \u2014 which can help spur you to get out of the way. Neural prediction aids in video gaming as well; your brain may be a few milliseconds behind, but it can predict where something will end up and make you react a bit sooner.\n\nIt\u2019s not like game developers aren\u2019t aware of our brain\u2019s problems with video games. Carboni explains that game developers in fact add little things to help us, such as lighting and color to highlight certain important aspects, as well as lag and latency compensation systems.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, your brain is quirky, and everyone\u2019s filters and reaction times are different,\u201d Carboni says in the video. \u201cSo, stop blaming the hardware and software, and start blaming your own wetware (brain).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "video games, your brain sucks at video games, perception", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Your brain isn\u2019t too good at video games; even if you get to the final level and beat it, your brain is lagging behind.", "title": "This Is Why Your Brain Sucks At Video Games [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blame-wetware-your-brain-lags-behind-80-milliseconds-when-playing-video-games-298130", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/playing-vid-games.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Your brain isn\u2019t too good at video games; even if you get to the final level and beat it, your brain is lagging behind.", "title": "This Is Why Your Brain Sucks At Video Games [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blame-wetware-your-brain-lags-behind-80-milliseconds-when-playing-video-games-298130", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/playing-vid-games.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/playing-vid-games.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-14T14:21:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T14:21:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Your brain isn\u2019t too good at video games; even if you get to the final level and beat it, your brain is lagging behind."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1087\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s an 80-millisecond delay between your eyes seeing something and your brain processing it.\nIt\u2019s not like game developers aren\u2019t aware of our brain\u2019s problems with video games.\n\u201cBy the time you notice something, it\u2019s 80 milliseconds in the past,\u201d Carboni says in the video.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, your brain is quirky, and everyone\u2019s filters and reaction times are different,\u201d Carboni says in the video.\n\u201cIf a game is running at 60 frames a second, that means every frame is on screen for about 17 milliseconds.\u201d HD monitors have about 10 to 15 milliseconds per frame, which means your brain is about five frames behind when playing video games."}
