The team handily won its first four games and has, for the first time ever, advanced to the quarterfinals with a showdown with Brazil in Fortaleza on Friday.\n\nIn addition, Rodriguez, now 22, has emerged as the breakout talent of the tournament. He has notched five goals \u2014 more than Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, Brazil\u2019s Neymar and Germany\u2019s Thomas Muller \u2014 and is credited with one of the World Cup\u2019s most spectacular strikes in Saturday\u2019s game against Uruguay.\n\nHis back to the net, Rodriguez caught a pass with his chest at the top of the penalty area, then shocked the goalkeeper by twisting around and blasting a left-footed shot that banged off the crossbar and in. Uruguay was already reeling from the suspension of star striker Luis Suarez for biting an opposing player and Rodriguez\u2019s no-look stunner seemed to break the team\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cWe are making history,\u201d Rodriguez told reporters after the game.\n\nBack in Colombia, his goal set off celebrations. When the ball went in \u201ca chill went through my entire body,\u201d said law student Alvaro Barrero, one of thousands of fans who watched Los Cafeteros\u2019 2-0 victory over Uruguay on a giant outdoor screen set up in a Bogota park.\n\nRodriguez and his teammates have also found glory on the sidelines in Brazil. After each goal, the team performs choreographed dances to celebrate. Their best moves have been compiled and set to music on YouTube.\n\nThis outpouring of joy contrasts with Colombian soccer\u2019s painful past.\n\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s, drug kingpins financed several of the country\u2019s professional teams as a way to launder money \u2014 and scratch their soccer itch. They provided a huge monetary boost for some teams, like America de Cali, allowing them to sign top talent from around Latin America. America de Cali, it turns out, was underwritten by Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the leaders of the now-defunct Cali cartel.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coaching America de Cali, the team had a president. But everyone in the country, everyone in Cali, everyone on the team knew that the guy who ran things was Miguel Rodriguez,\u201d said Francisco Maturana, who went on to coach Colombia\u2019s national team in the 1990s, in a documentary film about cocaine traffickers and Colombian soccer.\n\nThis criminal influence perverted the game. Cartels and gambling syndicates often leaned on players and referees to throw matches. Colombia\u2019s 1989 professional soccer season was canceled following the murder of a referee, while a soccer association president was imprisoned for drug-related crimes.\n\nThen there was the Coffee Men\u2019s infamous performance at the 1994 World Cup in the United States. The star-studded team, which included Carlos \u201cEl Pibe\u201d Valderrama, Freddy Rincon and Faustino \u201cEl Tino\u201d Asprilla, was coming off a 5-0 victory over Argentina in a qualifying play and seemed like a powerhouse. Brazilian legend Pele picked the Colombians to take home the trophy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Searching for a new team to support now that the U.S. has been eliminated from the tournament?
