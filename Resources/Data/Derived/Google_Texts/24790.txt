The plane was featured Saturday in an ongoing series at the Tulsa Air And Space Museum.

A Tulsa oilman has owned the classic aircraft for about a year.

Crowds turned out for the chance to view a World War II era fighter plane at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum Saturday. The Corsair is owned and piloted by Trent Latshaw.

The plane was built in 1945, but the Navy didn't take delivery until 1946 so the plane didn't see combat action in WWII.

But Latshaw says veterans who came to visit the Vought F4U-4 share a deep connection with the fighter plane.

"He made the statement, he says, 'you know this plane saved our bacon several times during Korea,' so he said, 'I love this airplane,'" Latshaw said.

The visit from the Corsair was part of the museum's 'Just Plane Talk' series that features a different pilot and plane each month.
