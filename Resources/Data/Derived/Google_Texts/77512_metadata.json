Now imagine if instead of providing these children services or going after their abusers, we instead threw them in jail.\n\nAccording to a new report, that\u2019s exactly what is happening. The Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline: The Girls\u2019 Story, explains how girls\u2014and particularly girls of color\u2014are routinely arrested and detained for behaviors stemming from sexual violence and trauma. Authored by the Human Rights Project for Girls, Ms. Foundation for Women, and Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality, the report urges for recognition, in our broader discourse of criminal justice reform, of how girls are also being unjustly criminalized.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently there's been growing debate around mass incarceration and the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline,\u201d but in all those conversations, girls' lives remain invisible. These narratives fail to account for the distinct pathways of girls into the justice system, when in fact girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population. According to the Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention, approximately 600,000 girls are arrested in the U.S. annually. Most of these girls are remanded for non-violent offenses such as truancy, running away, or alcohol and substance abuse\u2014all behaviors that are strongly associated with suffering trauma. In fact, research shows that 73 percent of girls of girls in the juvenile justice system report past instances of physical and/or sexual abuse\u2014with rates as high as 93 percent and 81 percent in states like Oregon and South Carolina, respectively.\n\nRemarkably, it is this abuse that is funneling girls into the juvenile justice system, as it is often the root cause of the girls\u2019 running away, becoming truant, and abusing drugs. Citing case studies from young girl survivors, the report details, for example, the injustice of criminalizing girls who are trafficked for sex. Each year in the U.S., over 1,000 children are arrested for prostitution, despite most being too young to consent to sex. And according to the FBI, African-American children comprise 59 percent of all prostitution-related arrests for those under the age of 18\u2014more than any other racial group. The arrest of girls for prostitution also contradicts prevailing federal law that makes clear any child under the age of 18 engaged in a commercial sex act is by definition a victim of human trafficking. Yet in many states and jurisdictions, trafficked girls continue to face the added trauma and indignity of incarceration when they are in fact, victims of child rape.\n\nOther girls are arrested for running away from abusive homes or foster care placements\u2014or for being repeatedly late or absent from school because a trafficker is forcing a young girl to \u201cwork\u201d by moving her to different cities to be bought and sold\u2014or because she is being sexually harassed at school.\n\nBut there is hope\u2014pending legislation in Congress presents a critical opportunity to improve our response towards justice-involved girls. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA), which is the single most important piece of federal legislation focused on youth in juvenile justice systems, is up for reauthorization\u2014providing a significant avenue for reform.\n\nLast reauthorized in 2002, the bipartisan JJDPA is being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. This year\u2019s language includes significant updates and improvements specifically around girls, sex trafficking, and sexual violence. There is even language seeking to eliminate the use of restraints on pregnant girls in custody.\n\nThe Girls\u2019 Story aims to illuminate the hidden lives of girls behind bars to help promote a more gender-responsive, trauma-informed approach to girls in the system. But now, with the JJDPA up for reauthorization, lawmakers have a real opportunity to act. Starting with the JJDPA markup this Thursday, Congress can take the first step toward dismantling this unjust and harmful pipeline for girls.\n\nVafa is co-founder and director of Law and Policy at the Human Rights Project for Girls.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population.", "description": "Girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population.", "title": "JJDPA reauthorization: An opportunity to dismantle the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/248825-jjdpa-reauthorization-an-opportunity-to-dismantle-the-sexual", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/248825-jjdpa-reauthorization-an-opportunity-to-dismantle-the-sexual", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-23T06:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Yasmin Vafa", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-23T06:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/248825-jjdpa-reauthorization-an-opportunity-to-dismantle-the-sexual", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population.", "card": "summary", "title": "JJDPA reauthorization: An opportunity to dismantle the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline"}, "dcterms.title": "JJDPA reauthorization: An opportunity to dismantle the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline"}, "article_summary": "This year\u2019s language includes significant updates and improvements specifically around girls, sex trafficking, and sexual violence.\nThe Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA), which is the single most important piece of federal legislation focused on youth in juvenile justice systems, is up for reauthorization\u2014providing a significant avenue for reform.\nThe Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline: The Girls\u2019 Story, explains how girls\u2014and particularly girls of color\u2014are routinely arrested and detained for behaviors stemming from sexual violence and trauma.\nAccording to the Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention, approximately 600,000 girls are arrested in the U.S. annually.\nThese narratives fail to account for the distinct pathways of girls into the justice system, when in fact girls represent the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice population."}
