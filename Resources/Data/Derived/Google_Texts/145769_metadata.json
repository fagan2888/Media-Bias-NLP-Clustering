The university is one of four Christian universities in Oklahoma that have sued the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLankford invited Piper to the State of the Union because of the actions he's taken to defend religious liberty.\n\nPiper says Obamacare infringes on a woman's right to choose what type of contraception she wants or needs.\n\nPiper says the suit, which is poised to go before the Supreme Court, is about religious liberty that is guaranteed by the first amendment.\n\n\"Sexual decisions and sexual behavior and sexual choices have always been part and parcel of the religious conversation. And now all of the sudden the government is presupposing to establish and prohibit the free expression and practice therein of those religious convictions. That is not the place of the government.\"\n\nDespite his disagreement with the Obama administration, Piper looks forward to witnessing a piece of history.\n\n\"I think this is a big deal. The State of the Union is an opportunity for the USA to declare who it is and what it is our strengths and weaknesses are. And I think that's a wonderful opportunity to be part of that.\"\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address is next Tuesday at 8 p.m.\n\nStay in touch with us anytime, anywhere.\n\nDownload our free app for Apple and Android and Kindle devices.\n\nSign up for newsletters emailed to your inbox.
