The Optum services-based solution and the CMS rule-change now enable state Medicaid agencies to avoid the unwieldy IT implementation processes that accompany massive end-to-end MMIS system installations, and concentrate on their primary mission of improving the health outcomes of their beneficiaries \u2013 a goal that is becoming increasingly critical as Medicaid programs expand coverage in many states.\n\nStates that purchase services instead of setting systems requirements can benefit in numerous ways, including a shortened IT implementation period with less cost and reduced risk; more choices from proven commercial solutions that already work in the marketplace; improved administrative operations; and access to new technologies and cloud-based approaches that help agencies operate more flexibly.\n\nOptum estimates that its SaaS approach could cut by as much as half the timeframe for new MMIS implementations, thereby significantly reducing the time and cost of implementation, and containing operational costs in both the short and long term.\n\nOptum currently provides clinical, analytical, consulting, data, and technology solutions to 37 state Medicaid agencies and the District of Columbia. It will incorporate into its new solution Medecision\u2019s extensive population health management expertise, anchored by its flagship Aerial\u2122 solution that supports best performance in meeting quality measures, integration of behavioral health with traditional health care management, and management of community-based services; and TriZetto\u2019s broad Medicaid claims and administrative platform, Facets\u2122, which manages claims for nearly 30 percent of the Medicaid members who are covered by managed care organizations (MCOs).\n\n\u201cMedecision\u2019s people and technology help power the care that millions of American beneficiaries receive under Medicaid plans throughout the United States,\u201d said Deborah M. Gage, president and CEO, Medecision. \u201cWe focus on delivering compliant, community care-based applications that integrate behavioral and medical care decision support so that Medicaid beneficiaries receive optimal benefits. Through OMMS, we are proud to be part of delivering affordable, effective solutions that contribute to a healthier population.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expansion of managed Medicaid will be significant in the coming years, as the government continues to be the largest source of newly insured lives in the marketplace,\u201d said Krish Venkat, president, Healthcare and Life Sciences of Cognizant, parent company of TriZetto. \u201cPlatform-based solutions with flexible, as-a-service delivery models will be vital for health care organizations to address the demands of this growing market. We are pleased to team with Optum to bring the powerful and flexible capabilities of the Facets platform to the Optum Medicaid Management Services solution.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, MMIS systems \u2013 which process Medicaid fee-for-service claims and managed care encounters, and provide reporting on the program \u2013 are formally certified by CMS. Such certification enables states to access enhanced matching federal funds at the rate of 90 percent for design, development and implementation, and 75 percent for operational expenses.\n\nWith Optum\u2019s new solution, states will structure their request for federal matching funds in the form of business services rather than system requirements. CMS auditors would certify that all services requested by the state and approved by CMS have been made available, and then make federal matching funds available to the state.\n\nThe Optum solution provides states the following:\n\nBusiness services , such as Medicaid fee-for-service claims processing, care provider enrollment, call center activities and operations reporting.\n\n, such as Medicaid fee-for-service claims processing, care provider enrollment, call center activities and operations reporting. Analytics and data warehousing services that can use data to help states identify needs across their population, focus resources accordingly to improve outcomes, and measure the performance of care providers, health plans and new state-managed programs to improve care.\n\nthat can use data to help states identify needs across their population, focus resources accordingly to improve outcomes, and measure the performance of care providers, health plans and new state-managed programs to improve care. Health services such as wellness and care management programs to improve the health of Medicaid fee-for-service recipients.\n\nIn conjunction with the launch of its new solution, Optum has received certification from CMS as a \u201cQuality Improvement Organization (QIO)-like\u201d entity, a designation that enables it to perform quality improvement initiatives, and review cases and analyze patterns of care related to quality measures and medical necessity. The QIO-like designation allows states to receive 75 percent federal matching funds when Optum performs these services.\n\nAbout Optum\n\nOptum is a leading information and technology-enabled health services business dedicated to helping make the health system work better for everyone.
