× Expect to pay hundreds of dollars in penalties if you don’t have health insurance this year

Expect to pay a $695.00 fine or 2.5% of your salary, whichever is greater. You’ll also pay another $350 for each child that is not insured.

Those are the new penalties many Americans could face this year as mandated by the federal government.

According to healthcare.gov, the penalties for not being insured will be taken out when you file your federal tax return. Click here for more information on the penalties.

The good news? There is still time to sign up through Obamacare if you are not insured in 2016.

The deadline is January 31st.
