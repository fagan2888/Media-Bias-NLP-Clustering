Indeed, the CSA didn\u2019t enjoy much \u201csuccess\u201d in part because Jefferson Davis\u2019s presidency was confined to a series of train cars forever evading the advancing Union Army by the middle of his fifth year in office.\n\n\u201c[G]overnors get better at governing when they\u2019ve been in office longer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut at the same time, governors who are eligible to run for reelection do better than governors who are ineligible.\u201d\n\nIt could be that by rendering second-term presidents ineligible for future terms in office, the 22nd Amendment is slightly undermining the quality of governance by eliminating the basic mechanism of electoral accountability.\n\nThis is not entirely unreasonable, but \u201d the basic mechanism of electoral accountability\u201d cannot apply eternally. Whether constitutionally or physically limited, a president will eventually determine for him or herself that another election is not going to be in the cards. Moreover, second terms are not wholly disastrous for presidents, even those who face strident opposition in the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe recent history of two-term presidencies shows that things could be a lot better,\u201d The New York Times was forced to concede in July of 2013 prior to a brief review of the legacies of the last four two-term administrations. \u201c[A]ll four ultimately managed significant second-term accomplishments despite partisan opposition on Capitol Hill, leading historians to caution against predictions that the second Obama administration is doomed.\u201d\n\nRonald Reagan passed both sweeping immigration and tax code reform in his second term. Bill Clinton struck a bipartisan agreement to balance the federal budget. It is at least possible to be a successful president in the second term in office, but that president almost always has to contend with a Congress stacked with members of the opposition party.\n\nSome presidents are able to negotiate with their ideological opponents, and some are not. Obama is not, and all the excuses in the world for his failures are unlikely to reverse the looming verdict of history.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "History\u2019s verdict pending.", "title": "Vox: Obama can\u2019t govern, so let\u2019s repeal the 22nd Amendment", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/13/vox-repeal-22nd-amendment/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Matt Yglesias, Ronald Reagan,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T16:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T18:23:46+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbde2\"", "article_summary": "With the ceiling caving in on President Barack Obama nearly midway through his second term, this theme has returned with a vengeance.\nFrom Roosevelt to Obama, Summers wrote, the start of a second term almost always marks the beginning of an American president\u2019s least successful period in office.\nMoreover, second terms are not wholly disastrous for presidents, even those who face strident opposition in the legislature.\nSummers does not, however, recommend the outright repeal of the 22nd Amendment.\nObama is not, and all the excuses in the world for his failures are unlikely to reverse the looming verdict of history."}
