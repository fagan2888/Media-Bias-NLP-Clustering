When I set up home in a different part of Hackney in 1982, most of the borough was disreputable and dirt cheap - just right for wide-eyed social deviants making their way in the urban jungle. But even then gentrification\u2019s tide was rolling east from Islington and north from the Square Mile. It swept \u201cconspicuous thrift\u201d - stripped floorboards, lentil bakes, Guardian journalists and all that - into Stoke Newington and floated rough old Hoxton\u2019s property boat.\n\nA curious thing about the New Era homes is that their present residents weren\u2019t washed away long ago. It\u2019s 20 years since Hoxton became hip. Its \u201cedginess\u201d was embraced, its art scene was admired and its \u201ctrendies\u201d were insulted by class warriors. The new affluence has seeped north from Hoxton Square and the whole neighbourhood is now a real estate opportunity connecting swinging Shoreditch and the near-mansion tax terraces of De Beauvoir Town. It\u2019s bordered to the north by Regents Canal. New housing developments are strung along this waterway like beads. Joggers and cyclists populate its towpath. There\u2019s still council housing, but the area is sold as \u201cCity fringe\u201d.\n\nMany private renters will have been priced out over the years. But the longer-established of New Era\u2019s 90-odd households have been helped to stay because \u201cuplift\u201d seems to have passed their rent books by. Private flats for let on adjoining streets are advertised at \u00a3330 a week for a one-bed, \u00a3450-\u00a3500 for a two-bed and around \u00a3500 for a three-bed. New Era\u2019s residents were paying an average of \u00a3133, \u00a3150 and \u00a3163 respectively when their dwellings went on sale. When I quoted these figures to a local estate agent, he dropped his phone.\n\nThe estate was built in the 1930s with philanthropic goals. Ownership was passed down the family line until spring this year. Eight decades on, the now former owner says he doesn\u2019t accept that selling to Westbrook Partners, an American company whose methods have attracted criticism elsewhere, has left his former tenants in a tight spot. And some evidence suggests he didn\u2019t leave everything in great shape.\n\n\n\nThe marketing literature says new windows had been installed in the estate ten years ago and that the buildings had been re-pointed and some guttering replaced more recently. But \u201cmajor opportunity to refurbish\u201d does sound a bit like \u201chas potential\u201d. Housing consultant and social housing campaigner Colin Wiles writes: \u201cIt looks as though it\u2019s suffered from a lack of investment over the past few decades.\u201d I\u2019m told there are \u201cissues\u201d with the condition of several of the properties.\n\nThis sounds typical of too much of London\u2019s private rented sector, albeit with the benign side effect of rents that aren\u2019t so very much higher than the Hackney council house weekly average of \u00a3113. And now, here come those far off Americans, accused of planning to unleash the full backlog of market forces that the New Era tenants seem to have mostly avoided so far.\n\nThe campaign to prevent this is righteous and brave, but has its work cut out. The early departure from the scene of the Benyon Estate, a family firm which owns 300 properties in De Beauvoir and has a Conservative MP as a director, was hailed as a Russell Brand-inspired triumph at the time but, if anything, may have made things worse. Benyon had a stake in the Westbrook enterprise and was to manage the estate. There are worse landlords in London, and at least Benyon provided a human point of contact close to home. Rents were initially raised by 10% and there were fears they would soon go much higher. Hackney mayor Jules Pipe was critical. But an informal agreement that there would be no further increase for two years has been withdrawn since Benyon cut its ties.\n\nHow can a happy ending to this distressing story be arranged? Hackney Council has been doing what it can to moderate, but is unlikely to take up the suggestion of making a compulsory purchase, a complex and costly option at the best of times (and, for local government, the present ones don\u2019t qualify). Colin Wiles has challenged London\u2019s biggest housing associations, not short of a few bob, to buy the property from Westbrook. That would be a good result, but if it happened there would probably still be changes that not all would applaud. With government grant slashed, housing associations have to asset manage like never before in order to provide new sub-market priced homes while still balancing their books. It\u2019s hard to imagine New Era rents not going up more or more affluent residents not being sought.\n\nAn irony in all this is that Westbrook manages the pension funds of US public sector workers. UK companies in the pension field are seen as potentially desirable investors in London properties for private rent, being blessed with the resources to professionalise a sector over-stocked with bandits and buy-to-let amateurs. In booming London, where private renting is growing as home ownership falls, steady, long-term returns should be achievable without treating people heartlessly.\n\nBoris Johnson has recently hailed the London Pensions Fund Authority putting money into turning a car park in the Royal Docks into 200 homes, including 137 for private rent. He stressed the need for longer tenancy agreements to give renters more security. The Resolution Foundation, a think tank working to improve the lot of people on low to middle incomes, has produced an economic model for keeping such properties affordable. The New Era scenario is different in that the land concerned is not publicly owned and housing already exists on the site. But might it be in Westbrook\u2019s interest to look at ways of making its investment pay that don\u2019t involve cold-eyed evictions and all the shaming publicity they would attract?\n\nStandard procedure would entail pricing or less subtly shifting the tenants out, not by Christmas \u2013 it seems that\u2019s never really been on the cards \u2013 but perhaps from the middle of next year. The dozen households protected by the 1977 Rent Act would be the hardest to move, but in such cases a blend of pressure and inducements is often brought to bear. Once that job was done a major refit or redevelopment would go ahead and much wealthier people would move in.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to treat the existing tenants sympathetically, draw on their local knowledge, make money by letting or selling homes that become empty of their own accord at higher rates to people who can afford it. Humane rent rises could still occur \u2013 it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the current ones could be almost doubled and still fall below the area\u2019s private housing sector benefit cap \u2013 and some tenants might not mind if it meant their homes and the estate were improved as a result. Ideally, new tenants\u2019 contracts could take up Shelter\u2019s stable rental idea, an attempt to reconcile the goals of affordability, quality, security and financial return.\n\nYes, this may be imperfect and for the birds. But persuasion is surely worth a try. The mayor, though ever loath to obstruct laissez faire, has asked his housing deputy Richard Blakeway to try to find a way to keep the tenants in their homes. Blakeway is one of the best of the mixed bunch that makes up Johnson\u2019s team. With the mayor\u2019s full and conspicuous authority behind him, he might be better placed than anyone to broker an acceptable deal.\n\nWestbrook has yet to say what its plans for New Era actually are. Might the company prefer to emerge as a beacon of good practice in London\u2019s flawed private rented sector - and prosper accordingly \u2013 rather than be reviled as a pitiless predator? In this wrangle, they have the greatest power. That means they have the most choices too.\n\nUpdate November 26, 2014 As expected there will be no evictions before Christmas. As informed by the marketing literature for the estate, this article originally said that the new owner might be able to enhance their profits \u201cby building extra layers of flats on top of the existing ones\u201d. I\u2019ve since been advised that this will probably not be possible.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The new owners of low priced housing in East London have options for treating their existing tenants well", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Dave Hill", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The new owners of low priced housing in East London have options for treating their existing tenants well", "title": "How might the New Era estate story end?", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/nov/23/how-might-the-new-era-estate-story-end", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/23/1416749723479/3aa0f23e-15fb-4e66-baa4-9efb8f6b0450-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=893b06f0a4031f176c4ae6a6804a219f", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/davehillblog/2014/nov/23/how-might-the-new-era-estate-story-end?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/nov/23/how-might-the-new-era-estate-story-end", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/davehillblog/2014/nov/23/how-might-the-new-era-estate-story-end?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@DaveHill", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/23/1416749723479/3aa0f23e-15fb-4e66-baa4-9efb8f6b0450-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/davehillblog/2014/nov/23/how-might-the-new-era-estate-story-end?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Housing,Communities,Society,Politics,UK news,Boris Johnson,Property,Money,Social housing,Regeneration,London,Cities", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-23T14:15:21.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davehill", "section": "UK news", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T10:29:16.000Z", "tag": "Housing,Communities,Society,Politics,UK news,Boris Johnson,Property,Money,Social housing,Regeneration,London,Cities"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/23/1416749723479/3aa0f23e-15fb-4e66-baa4-9efb8f6b0450-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=093785aa12419c7ef7295f2b928a762e", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Housing,Communities,Society,Politics,UK news,Boris Johnson,Property,Money,Social housing,Regeneration"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4f9\"", "article_summary": "A curious thing about the New Era homes is that their present residents weren\u2019t washed away long ago.\n\u201cThis is a widespread problem across Hackney and across London,\u201d said a tenant of Hoxton\u2019s New Era housing estate last week, pledging to fight any huge rent hikes a new landlord might impose.\nAnd now, here come those far off Americans, accused of planning to unleash the full backlog of market forces that the New Era tenants seem to have mostly avoided so far.\nThe New Era scenario is different in that the land concerned is not publicly owned and housing already exists on the site.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine New Era rents not going up more or more affluent residents not being sought."}
