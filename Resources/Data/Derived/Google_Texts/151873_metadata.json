Scott Walker took aim Thursday at potential 2016 presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton with a web video that paints the Democratic front-runner as a pioneer of Obamacare\u2019s flawed promises.\n\nMr. Walker, part of a crowded GOP field, released a plan this week to repeal and replace President Obama\u2019s signature law with a system that gets rid of insurance mandates and doles out of tax credits based on age instead of income, overhauls Medicare and pursues tort reform so that doctors do not perform unnecessary tests.\n\nOver a somber piano, Mr. Walker\u2019s new campaign video depicts Mrs. Clinton in 2007 seemingly making the same promise that caused the White House heartburn in fall 2013, when millions of Americans received cancellation plans for that did not comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage requirements.\n\n\u201cYou can keep the doctors you know and trust, you keep the insurance you have if you like it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says in the clip.\n\nThe video pivots to Mr. Walker touting his plan to scrap Obamacare, standing on a stage in Minnesota to a soundtrack of triumphant strings.\n\n\u201cLike I did in my state, I\u2019m going to tell you, I\u2019m willing to stand up against anyone, including members of my own party, to get the job done,\u201d Mr. Walker says. A lot of candidates talk about repealing Obamacare, we\u2019ve actually got a plan to make sure Congress acts because they\u2019re going to have to live under the same rules as everyone else in America.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker has boasted that he is one of few GOP candidates to propose concrete ways to replace the health care law as president, although one of his party rivals, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blasted the plan as \u201cObamacare lite\u201d and challenged Mr. Walker to a health care debate in Iowa.\n\nFor her part, Mrs. Clinton has defended Obamacare on the campaign trail, although she has called for certain fixes to address high deductibles and a \u201cglitch\u201d that determines the affordability of an employer\u2019s plan based on an individual instead of the cost of insuring a family, locking some people out of subsidies on the Obamacare marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin Gov.
