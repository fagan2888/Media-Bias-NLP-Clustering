Sam Brownback and his Democratic challenger, Paul Davis, have laid out their positions on education, taxes, Medicaid expansion and renewable energy during their first debate.\n\nBoth candidates tried to portray themselves as supporters of education during Saturday's debate at the Kansas State Fair. Some of the sharpest exchanges came over tax cuts under Brownback that have led to two credit downgrades and a projected budget shortfall for the state.\n\n\"Number one, there are more Kansans working now than ever in the history of this state,\" said Governor Brownback. \"Number two, we've put more money into education than ever in this history of this state.\"\n\nDavis shot back, \"We are trailing our surrounding states and the rest of the country in virtually every economic growth indicator there is. And it has plunged our state deep into debt.\"\n\nBoth men went back and forth on wind energy and whether the renewable energy portfolio would remain in place to promote wind energy in Kansas. \"Will you veto a bill that repeals the RPS Governor, this is a critical issue for our state,\" Davis asked Brownback. \"Let's see if a bill gets to my desk,\" Brownback replied. \"I will veto a bill that repeals our RPS,\" said Davis.\n\nDavis is trying to woo moderate Republicans and independent voters who are concerned about the effects of Brownback's tax cuts. \"The governor's experiment just isn't working,\" said Davis. \"Now everything you've heard from Representative Davis is wrong,\" the governor said.\n\nDavis told a standing-room-only crowd that he would expand Medicaid in Kansas if elected governor, because rural hospitals are fighting to survive without the expansion. Brownback blamed the health care overhaul for lowering funding to the hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Governor Sam Brownback and his opponent, state representative Paul Davis square off in first debate at the Kansas State Fair.", "language": "english", "author": "Mike Iuen, Associated Press", "og": {"description": "Governor Sam Brownback and his opponent, state representative Paul Davis square off in first debate at the Kansas State Fair.", "title": "Brownback, Davis square off in first debate at Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Brownback-Davis-disagree-on-taxes-in-first-debate-274217111.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FF6/E73/FF6E73D7E37C465BA5F5D5724E58C6D5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4D5/198/4D51986EF89341F9AFADB780738B6912.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Governor Sam Brownback and his opponent, state representative Paul Davis square off in first debate at the Kansas State Fair.", "title": "Brownback, Davis square off in first debate at Kansas State Fair", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Brownback-Davis-disagree-on-taxes-in-first-debate-274217111.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Sam-Brownback-Paul-Davis.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Brownback, Davis square off in first debate at Kansas State Fair", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Brownback, Davis square off in first"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3a6\"", "article_summary": "Both candidates tried to portray themselves as supporters of education during Saturday's debate at the Kansas State Fair.\nBoth men went back and forth on wind energy and whether the renewable energy portfolio would remain in place to promote wind energy in Kansas.\n\"Will you veto a bill that repeals the RPS Governor, this is a critical issue for our state,\" Davis asked Brownback.\n\"Number one, there are more Kansans working now than ever in the history of this state,\" said Governor Brownback.\nSam Brownback and his Democratic challenger, Paul Davis, have laid out their positions on education, taxes, Medicaid expansion and renewable energy during their first debate."}
