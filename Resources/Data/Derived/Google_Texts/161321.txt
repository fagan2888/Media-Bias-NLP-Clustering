MONTGOMERY, Alabama -- State employees will pay more for health insurance under changes approved today by the State Employees’ Insurance Board to help address a projected $36 million deficit.

The board raised some premiums, increased co-pays for urgent care, emergency room visits, outpatient surgeries and made other changes. The board also allocated roughly $11.1 million from reserves to help pay the deficit. The changes will take effect Jan. 1.

Some board members expressed concern that the increases were coming at a time when state employees have gone years without a pay increase, but also said they had felt they had no other choice considering their financial situation.

SEIB Chief Executive Officer William Ashmore has said the deficit was caused by a combination of rising costs, fewer state employees to pay into the program and fees and benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act.

Active state employees pay $15 a month for single coverage and $205 for family coverage, including discounts for not using tobacco and participating in a wellness program.

The changes approved by the board include that:

- Smokers will end up paying an additional $5 per month. Premiums are being raised across-the-board by $5, but the monthly non-smoking discount is being from $45 to $50.



-- Members will begin to pay for dental coverage. The fee would be $3 a month for single coverage and $8 a month for family coverage. There is no separate premium for dental coverage under the current plan.

-- Members will pay an additional $50 a month to cover spouses who have access to their own employer insurance plans.

-- Surviving spouses will pay $15 more per month for single coverage and $20 more for family coverage.

-- The copay for urgent care will increase from $35 to $100.

-- The emergency room and outpatient surgery copay will increase to $150.

-- The monthly premiums for non-Medicare retirees will increase to $10 a month for single coverage and $20 a month for family coverage.

-- The copay for lab work will drop from $10 to $7.50.

Acting Finance Director Bill Newton said the board had three options to address the shortfall -- increasing premiums, cutting benefits or tapping reserves. He said today's action involved all three.

The plan was approved after a month of debate.



“After careful consideration, the board made some tough decisions,” Board Chairman Joe Dickson said in a statement.



“However, I am confident that we stayed true to our goal of providing the best health care coverage possible at an affordable rate for our members.”

The head of a group representing retired state, county, and municipal employees criticized the change and said the board should have taken more from reserves. “We begged for a life preserver and the SEIB threw us an anchor,” said Liane Kelly, executive director of ARSEA/APEAL.
