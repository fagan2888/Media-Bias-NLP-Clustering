Those may come later in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary campaign.\n\nClick to watch News 9's coverage\n\nInstead, it was an historic two hours. Fourteen Republican presidential candidates took turns on stage at the Saint Anselm College Dana Center in the Voters First Forum on Monday night and gave what were in effect to opening statements to rank-and-file New Hampshire GOP primary voters.\n\nWATCH: Responses from all 14 candidates at the forum\n\nIn separate one-one-one interviews with moderator Jack Heath of radio station WGIR\u2019s \u201cNew Hampshire Today\u201d program, there was tough talk on national security, immigration, cutting the federal deficit, reforming the tax code and repealing the Affordable Care Act. There were several calls for defunding Planned Parenthood in the wake of the releases of controversial videos by a pro-life group.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called himself \u201ca different kind of Republican\u201d and a constitutional conservative. Former New York Gov. George Pataki recalled being Sept. 11, 2001, saying, \u201cI felt the flames.\u201d Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry touted his work to have his state lead the nation in job growth, and on immigration, promised that if he is elected, \u201cthe will to secure the border will reside in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Pataki talked about being elected in heavily Democratic, \u201cblue\u201d states. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he won 60 percent of the women\u2019s vote in being elected chief executive of the most important general election swing state.\n\nAnd so it went.\n\nThe forum, sponsored by the New Hampshire Union Leader and media outlets in Iowa and South Carolina, was organized in response to Fox News\u2019 decision to limit participation in the first debate of the campaign, scheduled for Thursday in Cleveland, to the top 10 candidates based solely on national polling.\n\nThe forum was open to all presidential candidates with active campaigns in New Hampshire. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee chose not to participate. Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore announced his candidacy after the deadline for entry into the event.\n\nTrump, despite his standing at the top of the GOP pack, was not mentioned.\n\nPaul, calling himself a \u201cconstitutional conservative,\u201d said that while Americans who are involved in combat against the United States should lose their right to due process. Those who oppose the country, but are not in combat against it, \u201cdo get the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his patented call for less government collection of private records from individuals.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear weapons deal with Iran \u201cthe single greatest national security threat facing America.\u201d\n\nHe said President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u201cwill become the world\u2019s leading financiers of radical Islam\u201d if the deal is approved.\n\n\u201cIf this administration is responsible for sending billions of dollars to Iran, and those billions go to jihadists who use that money to murder Americans, Israelis and Europeans, then this administration is responsible,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, meanwhile, called for not only a tougher stance against illegal immigration, but also for modernization of the legal immigration system.\n\n\u201cLegal immigration must be based on merit,\u201d Rubio said, \u201con whether you are coming to be an American, rather than just to live in America.\u201d Portraying himself as a youthful, optimistic alternative, he said the mood of the nation is \u201cthe fundamental question of this election.\u201d\n\nPaul, Cruz and Rubio appeared by satellite after voting on Capitol Hill in favor of de-funding the Planned Parenthood organization. The other 11 candidates appeared live. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina skipped the vote to instead attend the event.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania focused on a need to restore manufacturing jobs with a new flat tax not only for individuals, but also for corporations.\n\nKasich said he balanced budgets both on the state and federal levels.\n\n\u201cWe need a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, which I have been pushing since I was a very young man,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham of South Carolina said his goal as president is to \u201cput radical Islam in a box and save us from becoming another Greece.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the threats to this country grow,\u201d Graham said, \u201cwe\u2019re disarming ourselves and we\u2019re moving to neuter the FBI and the CIA at the time we need it the most.\u201d\n\nOverall, he said, there are \u201ctoo many terrorists, too much debt, too few jobs.\u201d\n\nChristie said he is the only candidate with a \u201cconcrete plan\u201d to reform entitlements. He also promoted his plan in his home state to set up programs to mandate treatment, not prison, for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nDr. Ben Carson said the Affordable Care Act \u201cflies in the face of what we are as a nation,\u201d but said it should not be repealed until an alternative is in place. That alternative, he said, should be \u201csomething that puts the power back in the hands of consumers and health care providers.\u201d\n\nCarson, in calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, said controversial videos that showed organization officials discussing the use of fetal tissue \u201cshow the level of depravity we have sunken to as a nation.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d that ground troops in Iraq are necessary to deal with Islamic terrorists and called for a multinational effort supported by U.S. air power.\n\nBush warned, \u201cWe let our guard down a little bit\u2019 in the fight against terrorism in recent years.\n\nFormer business executive Carly Fiorina said it is time for leaders to challenge the status quo and said she has a \u201cproven track record\u201d of doing that in the private sector.\n\nShe said Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, \u201clied about Benghazi,\u201d a reference to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in that Libyan city.\n\nGraham, however, tried to top her, likening what he called Hillary Clinton\u2019s lies about the Benghazi attack to what he called former President Bill Clinton\u2019s attempt to mislead the nation about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he was \u201cso tired of this president trying to divide us,\u201d and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all Americans.\u201d\n\nWalker, calling himself \u201cpro-worker and pro-taxpayer,\u201d said President Obama\u2019s Clean Power plan to cut carbon emissions by 25 percent, unveiled Monday, \u201cwould be like taking a buzz saw to our nation\u2019s economy. We need a leader in the White House who is going to recognize that balance.\u201d\n\nPataki called for the elimination of the ACA and the Common Core education program, and for a reduction of the federal workforce by 15 percent.\n\nAnd, recalling the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, said he \u201cwalked the streets of lower Manhattan.\n\n\u201cWe cannot bow down to radical Islam anywhere,\u201d Pataki said.\n\nThe campaign of Democratic presidential candidates Clinton criticized the Republicans as \"out of touch,\" while former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's deputy state campaign director said \"a lot of denial\" was heard at the event.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 03 Aug 2015 23:30:00 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Fourteen Republican presidential candidates laid out their conservative plans for reforming immigration, cutting the federal deficit, repealing the Affordable Care Act and getting tough on Islamic terrorism at Saint Anselm College on Monday night.", "title": "Republicans talk tough on immigration, foreign policy at Voters First Forum", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/republicans-flocking-to-voters-first-forum/34514434", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/34521364/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/i159k6/-/img-14-GOP-candidates-participate-in-Voters-First-Forum.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/republicans-flocking-to-voters-first-forum/34514434", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/34514434", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/34514434", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/34514434"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/34514434", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/34514434", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/republicans-flocking-to-voters-first-forum/34514434"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Voters First Forum, NH Primary", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Voters First Forum, NH Primary", "description": "Fourteen Republican presidential candidates laid out their conservative plans for reforming immigration, cutting the federal deficit, repealing the Affordable Care Act and getting tough on Islamic terrorism at Saint Anselm College on Monday night."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ddd\"", "article_summary": "The forum was open to all presidential candidates with active campaigns in New Hampshire.\nThe campaign of Democratic presidential candidates Clinton criticized the Republicans as \"out of touch,\" while former Maryland Gov.\nFourteen Republican presidential candidates took turns on stage at the Saint Anselm College Dana Center in the Voters First Forum on Monday night and gave what were in effect to opening statements to rank-and-file New Hampshire GOP primary voters.\nU.S. Sen.
