LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland — Even the recently cautious Lara Gut now says the overall World Cup title in alpine skiing is “99.9 percent” hers.

Gut racked up more race points Sunday, finishing third on home Swiss snow in a fog-delayed combined event that her closest active rival, Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, chose to skip.

Rebensburg, who does not ski slalom, conceded defeat in the season-long points chase Saturday, and Gut made sure of victory by padding her lead to 355 ahead of four races left in finals week at nearby St. Moritz.

“It might be 99.9 percent mine, but I still have three of my races to race, and it is only on the 20th (next Sunday) that I will think about it,” Gut said.

Gut effectively sealed the giant crystal globe by finishing third. The victory went to Swiss teammate Wendy Holdener.

Holdener also edged Gut, the longtime Swiss team star, for the season title in combined to earn her a first career crystal trophy.

“I am lucky that I have a lot of experience,” Gut said. Though just 24, she was a teenage prodigy who won two silver medals at her first world championships in 2009.

“It is not the first time I am under pressure,” she said.

Lindsey Vonn’s season-ending knee injury two weeks ago when leading the standings denied the sport an expected thrilling duel for its most coveted prize.

Gut acknowledged that Vonn’s challenge then absence affected her thinking.

“Every week there was a different situation,” said Gut, who has six race wins this season to Vonn’s nine.

Vonn, a four-time overall winner, could retain her second-place standing ahead of Rebensburg. Vonn will get a crystal trophy as downhill standings winner.
