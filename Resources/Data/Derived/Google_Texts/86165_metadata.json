In Oklahoma, for example, surrogacy contracts are considered a form of child trafficking. In Michigan, surrogates face five years in jail and up to $50,000 in fines.\n\nGestational surrogacy contracts are also against the law in New York, but State Senator Brad Hoylman (D-27th Senate Dist.) introduced a bill last year that would change that. And he has first hand experience with the issue. Hoylman and his husband had to go to California to find a surrogate to carry their daughter Silvia, who's now four.\n\n\"If the [bill] passes, we'll have surrogates who could actually engage with intended parents and egg donors,\" says Hoylman.\n\n\"We don't want to turn baby making into a commercial industry,\" says Jennifer Lahl, president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, who, among other things, worries that surrogacy contracts don't \"anticipate every problem\" that could arise between a surrogate and a couple.\n\nWith the legalization of same-sex marriage and ever-improving reproductive technologies, the movement to legalize commercial surrogacy is likely to grow in coming years.\n\nAbout 6 minutes.\n\nProduced and edited by Joshua Swain, with help from Todd Krainin and Amanda Winkler.\n\nScroll down for full text, links, and downloadable versions, and subscribe to Reason TV's YouTube Channel to receive automatic updates when new material goes live.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The battle to legalize commercial surrogacy.", "title": "Should Women Be Allowed to Rent Their Wombs?", "url": "http://reason.com/reasontv/2015/03/24/commerical-surrogacy-rent-wombs", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14272121253830.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The battle to legalize commercial surrogacy.", "creator": "@nickgillespie", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14272121253830.jpg", "title": "Should Women Be Allowed to Rent Their Wombs?", "site": "@reason", "player": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://reason.com/embed/reasontv/2015/03/24/commerical-surrogacy-rent-wombs", "height": 360}, "card": "player"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Reasontv", "published_time": "2015-03-24T16:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/joshua-swain"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded4f\"", "article_summary": "\"I really, really like being pregnant,\" she says.\nWith the legalization of same-sex marriage and ever-improving reproductive technologies, the movement to legalize commercial surrogacy is likely to grow in coming years.\nIn Oklahoma, for example, surrogacy contracts are considered a form of child trafficking.\nGestational surrogacy contracts are also against the law in New York, but State Senator Brad Hoylman (D-27th Senate Dist.)\n\"They need help, it's something I want do, and it's a way for me to make a little bit of extra money.\""}
