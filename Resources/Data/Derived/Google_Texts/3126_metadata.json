UPMC is the state\u2019s largest employer and one of the key providers of health care in western Pennsylvania, while Highmark is the primary health insurer in the Pittsburgh market, possessing a 90% market share.\n\nFor several years, a contract between Highmark and UPMC gave Highmark\u2019s policyholders access to UPMC doctors and facilities at in-network rates. This decade-long relationship was mutually beneficial: Highmark was able to offer its customers access to UPMC\u2019s quality services, while UPMC gained additional insured consumers. This contract is due to expire December 31.\n\nThe relationship between Highmark and UPMC began to sour in 2013, when Highmark purchased the West Penn Allegheny Health System, a direct competitor of UPMC, for $1.1 billion. The new Allegheny Health Network posed a new competitive threat for UPMC, which decided not to renew its access contract with Highmark. Once the contract expires, Highmark consumers will no longer receive in-network rates for services at UPMC.\n\nThis change will directly affect patients. Many likely will need to choose between keeping Highmark as their insurer or moving to another insurer that can provide access to UPMC services and doctors. Many critics of UPMC\u2019s decision to end the contract have pointed out that hundreds of patients\u2014some of whom may be in the middle of treatment\u2014will be required to switch doctors.\n\nLegislators in Harrisburg have responded with proposed legislation that would force UPMC to contract with Highmark. Representatives Jim Christiana, a Republican, and Dan Frankel, a Democrat, introduced House Bills 1621 and 1622 on October 2, 2013. The bills make several changes that will force UPMC to contract with Highmark.\n\nIn an article in Law 360, Dan Packel said the bills are necessary to curb market power a provider might gain through consolidation.\n\n\u201cThe legislation, contained in House Bills 1621 and 1622, seeks to curtail market power that providers gain through consolidation, by preventing consumers from being denied access to hospitals based on insurance coverage. It would also prevent dominant hospitals or related physician practices in any given marketplace from demanding unreasonably high rates for health care services. Specifically, the measures would mandate all hospitals and hospital-owned physician practices that are part of an integrated delivery network\u2014health care systems that affiliate with an insurance plan\u2014to contract with any willing insurer,\u201d wrote Packel.\n\nBut many groups questioned why state government was becoming involved in a private contract dispute between two companies and choosing a winner in Highmark. In an editorial in the Patriot News, Stephen DeMaura, president of Americans for Job Security, a pro-business issue advocacy organization based in Virginia, argued the proposals could have a strong negative effect on competition. He noted one of the biggest supporters of the bill, the Service Employees International Union, stands to benefit greatly from the forced contract.\n\n\u201cThe two bills would kill market competition and limit affordable consumer choices by forcing two entities that offer both health insurance and healthcare into a contract. Not surprisingly, the legislation has the backing of the Service Employees International Union, which represents healthcare workers,\u201d wrote DeMaura.\n\nDavid Williams of Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA) argued in a Human Events piece that the two bills give unnecessary power over the health care market to the government. \u201cSadly, the legislation being spearheaded in Harrisburg by State Senator Vulakovich and Representative Christiana goes down a similar \u2018government knows best\u2019 path. Their legislation not only undermines free market principles, but it also kills market competition and limits affordable choices for consumers and many of the most vulnerable among us. Lastly, it meddles with Pennsylvanians\u2019 healthcare options by choosing to empower regulators, not providers.\u201d\n\nWilliams also noted forcing Highmark and UPMC into a contract sets a troubling precedent. \u201cIf these bills move forward in the state legislature it could have similar consequences as ObamaCare and could establish a devastating precedent for the rest of the country. Competition is not only beneficial to the private sector; it\u2019s essential for state and national economies. To put it in terms every Pennsylvanian can understand; imagine the outrage that would exist if the federal government forced Hershey and Mars into a contract.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95bc\"", "article_summary": "It would also prevent dominant hospitals or related physician practices in any given marketplace from demanding unreasonably high rates for health care services.\nFor several years, a contract between Highmark and UPMC gave Highmark\u2019s policyholders access to UPMC doctors and facilities at in-network rates.\nBut many groups questioned why state government was becoming involved in a private contract dispute between two companies and choosing a winner in Highmark.\nLegislators in Harrisburg have responded with proposed legislation that would force UPMC to contract with Highmark.\nHighmark and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) are two health care companies that dominate Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania region."}
