T he morning after he helps Seth Meyers re-launch NBC’s Late Night, VPOTUS Joe Biden will visit ABC’s The View to discuss the Affordable Care Act and “the importance of signing up for health insurance through the marketplace before the March 31 deadline,” ABC said this morning. Biden will sit down with hosts Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy as part of the show’s continuing “Red, White & View” thread in which they interview political guests. Biden’s a fave of The View, having made three previous visits to the daytime talk show; he made history on April 22, 2010, when he became its first sitting Vice President to sit on the couch. He took the occasion to apologize for his hot-mike F-bomb during the heath care act’s signing ceremony. “I was just thankful my mother couldn’t hear it or see it, and it was a little embarrassing,” he said on the show. “I realized there was a microphone but I had no idea it was that sensitive.”

Bet he will be asked about another of his comments: Biden made news the other day when he claimed “There isn’t a Republican party” anymore. “I wish there was a Republican party. I wish there was one person we could sit across the table from and make a deal and make the compromise and know when you got up from the table that the deal was done,” Biden said during a House Democratic policy confab, according to press reports. He later added, “All you had to do was look at their response to the State of the Union [Address]. What were there — three or four?”
