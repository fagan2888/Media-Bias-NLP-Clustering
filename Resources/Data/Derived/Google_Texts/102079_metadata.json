What she really wanted was to scotch the whole affair and just have someone announce her death after she\u2019d already been buried. \u201cI\u2019d like to be remembered happily if that is possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that can\u2019t be I\u2019d rather be forgotten.\u201d Forgotten? \u201cI had to tell her,\u201d said her friend William Turner Levy, \u201cthat she was being unrealistic.\u201d\n\nUnrealistic, but not surprising. After all, this was the famously unfussy First Lady who served hot dogs to the king and queen of England during their 1939 state visit, who dragged her own suitcase around the world on countless humanitarian missions, and who insisted, after her husband died, that she\u2019d never do anything newsworthy again. Naturally, she wanted her afterlife to be just as unpretentious as what came before. \u201cJust a plain pine coffin covered with pine boughs. Inside the coffin are to be plain pillows and sheet with cloth,\u201d she\u2019d written in a letter to her doctor years earlier.\n\nThe service was held in Hyde Park\u2019s St. James\u2019 Church, which seated just 250 people. Among those who didn\u2019t make the guest list: Horace W. B. Donegan, the grandstanding Episcopal bishop of New York. The five Roosevelt children refused to invite him, dreading he would eulogize their mother at length. (He showed up anyway but otherwise kept quiet.) Even the weather seemed to cooperate with Eleanor\u2019s wishes. November 10, 1962, was a cold, damp day with the wind blowing off the Hudson River and pushing the chill through the streets of the town.\n\nYet the mourners, like the good bishop, weren\u2019t going to let a cold shoulder stop them from saying good-bye. Thousands lined the roads, some standing five-deep to watch the hearse carry Mrs. Roosevelt from St. James\u2019 to the Roosevelt mansion, Springwood, two miles away. For generations, the Roosevelts of Hyde Park had been buried in the quiet graveyard behind the little church, but President Roosevelt had requested that he and Eleanor be laid to rest in the large rose garden just to the side of the family home. It was, in its way, the perfect spot. After all, \u201cRoosevelt\u201d in Dutch means \u201cfield of roses.\u201d Perhaps just as important, FDR\u2019s overbearing mother, Sara, was tucked a safe distance away, resting in uncharacteristic silence back behind the church.\n\nThe president\u2019s arrangement, however, helped produce exactly the kind of funeral Eleanor wanted to avoid. It was as if someone had picked up the entire Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade and dropped it into small-town America. The nightly news, including the BBC, delivered extensive coverage. Limousine-lock tied up the roads; amid all the excitement, two local keystone cops crashed their cruisers into each other right in front of the Hyde Park state police barracks. Most people were fans, but there were haters, too. One man standing along the funeral route waved a sign that read, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re dead, Eleanor.\u201d Two other men were arrested for carrying \u201cderogatory\u201d signs.\n\nThe roster of invited guests might have been small, but it was A-plus-list. President and Mrs. Kennedy arrived on Air Force One (which was taking its maiden voyage and would be used, almost exactly one year later, to transport JFK\u2019s body back from Dallas). Vice President and Mrs. Johnson came, as did the former presidents Truman and Eisenhower, making this the first time that three presidents attended the funeral of a First Lady. Chief Justice Warren, Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Governor Rockefeller of New York, the United Nations ambassador Stevenson, and a sizable contingent of the Washington establishment were there. One well-aimed Soviet missile would have decimated the U.S. government.\n\nThat was no idle concern. Mrs. Roosevelt\u2019s funeral came at the tail end of the Cuban missile crisis. Just days earlier, Nikita Khrushchev had agreed to dismantle the Soviet missiles he\u2019d lined up in Cuba like cigars ready to be lit, and Castro was still threatening to shoot down anything bigger than a kite that wandered into his airspace. The U.S. military was so concerned, the Pentagon wanted to install a kind of hotline in the pew at St. James\u2019 where President Kennedy was to be seated. The Reverend Gordon Kidd said no. \u201cIf he had to talk on the phone during the service it would be terribly frustrating and confusing,\u201d Kidd reasoned.4 The Feds settled for a phone placed unobtrusively on an outside wall of the church, though Eleanor would undoubtedly have scoffed at that, too. After all, Khrushchev didn\u2019t scare her. She had visited him on his home turf in 1957 for a magazine interview, a somewhat tense meeting that ended with Khrushchev\u2019s declaring his own sort of d\u00e9tente with one of the world\u2019s most formidable women. \u201cAt least,\u201d he said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t shoot each other.\u201d When he popped in for a visit at her woodsy Val-Kill cottage two years later, Eleanor had only one real worry. She realized she had no vodka\u2014even though Khrushchev was coming at 7:00 a.m. (Her son John dutifully ran down a bottle.)\n\nGiven all the world leaders Eleanor met and hosted over the years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that she received what was arguably the first power funeral of an American woman. What was notable was that one of Washington\u2019s most influential women was among the few who declined to attend. Her name was Alice Longworth. Mrs. L., as she was known, was a battle-ready Republican, a Capitol Hill institution with a biting wit, and a woman who, like Eleanor, tossed aside gender barriers as easily as she flicked the ashes off her long-stemmed cigarette holder. She was also Eleanor\u2019s first cousin.\n\nAlice\u2019s father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the older brother of Eleanor\u2019s father, Elliott. To her cousin Eleanor, Alice was a childhood playmate, a teenage confidante, and, in adulthood, a relentless rival. Their relationship had taken a sharp turn for the worse thirty years earlier, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president, a job Alice believed rightly belonged to her favorite brother, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.\n\nOver the years, the press played Alice and Eleanor off each other like rivals in a blue-blooded version of Oz: the good witch and the bad witch. Eleanor was the saint, the woman who revolutionized the role of First Lady with her very public activism, obvious concern for the poor and oppressed, and outspoken passion for human rights. She did more to cement the role of the United Nations in American and world diplomacy than any other woman and almost any man. Alice played the troublemaker. She relished any opportunity to tweak the stodgy establishment, and no one was more establishment\u2014or, in Alice\u2019s eyes, more sanctimonious\u2014 than Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt. Eleanor didn\u2019t just marry into the esteemed Roosevelt clan when she wed her fifth cousin Franklin. Roosevelt was also her maiden name.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The do-gooder first lady and the acid-tongued conservative writer battled for decades -- and changed D.C. for women", "author": "Marc Peyser and Timothy Dwyer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The do-gooder first lady and the acid-tongued conservative writer battled for decades -- and changed D.C. for women", "title": "The Roosevelts who despised each other: The untold story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/the_roosevelts_who_despised_each_other_the_untold_story_of_eleanor_roosevelt_and_alice_roosevelt_longworth/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/longworth_roosevelt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The do-gooder first lady and the acid-tongued conservative writer battled for decades -- and changed D.C. for women", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/longworth_roosevelt.jpg", "title": "The Roosevelts who despised each other: The untold story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The Roosevelts who despised each other: The untold story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, American History, Books, Eleanor Roosevelt", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0f9\"", "article_summary": "She relished any opportunity to tweak the stodgy establishment, and no one was more establishment\u2014or, in Alice\u2019s eyes, more sanctimonious\u2014 than Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt.\nTopics: Alice Roosevelt Longworth, American History, Books, Eleanor Roosevelt, News, Politics NewsEleanor Roosevelt hoped no one would come to her funeral.\nTo her cousin Eleanor, Alice was a childhood playmate, a teenage confidante, and, in adulthood, a relentless rival.\nThe president\u2019s arrangement, however, helped produce exactly the kind of funeral Eleanor wanted to avoid.\nThousands lined the roads, some standing five-deep to watch the hearse carry Mrs. Roosevelt from St. James\u2019 to the Roosevelt mansion, Springwood, two miles away."}
