A new report, commissioned by GOP groups, finds that concluding female voters view the party as 'intolerant,' 'lacking in compassion' and 'stuck in the past.\u201d\n\nA new study confirms something that we\u2019ve known for quite some time, namely that Republicans have huge problems with female voters and it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re doing much of anything to solve them:\n\nA detailed report commissioned by two major Republican groups \u2013 including one backed by Karl Rove \u2013 paints a dismal picture for Republicans, concluding female voters view the party as \u201cintolerant,\u201d \u201clacking in compassion\u201d and \u201cstuck in the past.\u201d Women are \u201cbarely receptive\u201d to Republicans\u2019 policies, and the party does \u201cespecially poorly\u201d with women in the Northeast and Midwest, according to an internal Crossroads GPS and American Action Network report obtained by POLITICO. It was presented to a small number of senior aides this month on Capitol Hill, according to multiple sources. Republicans swore they\u2019d turn around the party\u2019s performance with women after Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in 2012. And while they are in good shape in 2014, poised to pick up seats in the House and possibly take the majority in the Senate, the new report shows they have not improved their standing with women \u2013 which could exacerbate their problems if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee in 2016. The report \u2013 \u201cRepublicans and Women Voters: Huge Challenges, Real Opportunities\u201d \u2013 was the product of eight focus groups across the country and a poll of 800 registered female voters this summer. The large-scale project was a major undertaking for the GOP groups. \u201cThe gender gap is hardly a new phenomenon, but nevertheless, it\u2019s important for conservatives to identify what policies best engage women, and our project found multiple opportunities,\u201d said Dan Conston, a spokesman for the American Action Network. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that conservatives have more work to do with women.\u201d Republicans in Washington say they recognize the problem. Republicans who have seen or been briefed on the polling were not surprised about the outcome. The poll was conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Axis Research. (\u2026) The report is blunt about the party\u2019s problems. It says 49 percent of women view Republicans unfavorably, while 39 percent view Democrats unfavorably. It also found that Republicans \u201cfail to speak to women in the different circumstances in which they live\u201d \u2013 as breadwinners, for example. \u201cThis lack of understanding and acknowledgment closes many minds to Republican policy solutions,\u201d the report says. The groups urge Republicans to embrace policies that \u201care not easily framed as driven by a desire to aid employers or \u2018the rich.\u2019\u201d (\u2026) Even on fiscal matters \u2013 traditionally the party\u2019s strongest issue set \u2013 Republicans hold only slight advantages that do not come close to outweighing their negative attributes. The GOP holds a 3 percent advantage over Democrats when female voters are asked who has \u201cgood ideas to grow the economy and create jobs,\u201d and the same advantage on who is \u201cfiscally responsible and can be trusted with our tax dollars.\u201d When female voters are asked who \u201cwants to make health care more affordable,\u201d Democrats have a 39 percent advantage, and a 40 percent advantage on who \u201clooks out for the interests of women.\u201d Democrats have a 39 percent advantage when it comes to who \u201cis tolerant of other people\u2019s lifestyles.\u201d Female voters who care about the top four issues \u2013 the economy, health care, education and jobs \u2013 vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Most striking, Democrats hold a 35-point advantage with female voters who care about jobs and a 26 percent advantage when asked which party is willing to compromise. House Republicans say jobs and the economy are their top priorities.\n\nNone of this is new, of course. The so-called \u201cgender gap\u201d has been a fact of American political life for decades now and has played a large role in deciding everything from the election of Bill Clinton in 1992 to Terry McAuliffe\u2019s narrower than expected victory over Ken Cuccinelli in the 2013 Virginia governor\u2019s race. During the 2012 presidential election, we saw it play a role in the battle for control of the Senate, thanks in no small part to exceedingly stupid comments by people like Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in their effort to justify what seems to any normal person like the heartless position that even a woman who has been raped should be denied the right to an abortion. We\u2019ve seen it as Democrats have capitalized on the efforts by Republican-controlled state legislatures to even further restrict the right to abortion and to push personhood amendments that would have the effect of banning some forms of contraception and, potentially, IVF procedures as well. More recently, of course, the right\u2019s reaction to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate has helped to further alienate it from female voters.\n\nAs far as solutions go, what the study proposes is pretty straightforward:\n\nRecommended: Election 2014: the most competitive Senate races\n\nThe groups suggest a three-pronged approach to turning around their relationship with women. First, they suggest the GOP \u201cneutralize the Democrats\u2019 \" attack that Republicans don\u2019t support fairness for women. They suggest Republican lawmakers criticize Democrats for \u201cgrowing government programs that encourage dependency rather than opportunities to get ahead.\u201d That message tested better than explaining that the GOP supports a number of policies that could help fairness for women. Second, the groups suggest Republicans \u201cdeal honestly with any disagreement on abortion, then move to other issues.\u201d And third, \u201cpursue policy innovations that inspire women voters to give the GOP a \u2018fresh look.\u2019 \" The report suggests lawmakers and candidates inject \u201cunexpected\u201d GOP policy proposals into the debate as a way to sway female voters. Suggestions include ways to improve job-training programs, \u201cstrengthening enforcement against gender bias in the workplace\u201d and \u201cexpanding home health-care services by allowing more health-care professionals to be paid by Medicare for home health services.\u201d\n\nOn paper, I suppose, it sounds good. Certainly, the fact that polling indicates that economic issues remain of primary concern to female voters, notwithstanding the fact that the GOP\u2019s long association with extremist social conservatives would seem to indicate that concentrating on so-called \u201cpocketbook\u201d issues would be the smart way for the GOP to deal with its problems with female voters. It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll see a day any time soon when women start flocking to the GOP in large numbers, of course, but if it helps to cut down the so-called \u201cgender gap,\u201d then it would make a difference on the margins that could tip the balance in an election. This would be especially true, it seems, in the so-called \u201cpurple\u201d states and among suburban female voters in areas like Northern Virginia. It\u2019s also worth noting that the \u201cgender gap\u201d almost completely disappears if you look at the voting patterns of married men and married women, which means that the real problem that the Republican Party has isn\u2019t among female voters per se so much as it is with single female voters. Given that this is a growing part of the population, and that these women are likely to carry their voting attitudes over into their married lives when that time comes, of course, this doesn\u2019t mean the problem isn\u2019t serious. However, it isn\u2019t insurmountable either.\n\nThe problem that the Republican Party has in this regard, of course, is two-fold. First of all, it will be next to impossible for the party to tone down the social conservative rhetoric that this survey and others indicates are so off-putting to female voters for the simple fact that social conservatives are such a substantial part of the GOP and among the most activist members of the party\u2019s base. Not only does this mean that the party cannot afford to put them off by taking positions on issues like abortion and marriage equality that they are opposed to, but it also means that they can\u2019t afford to ignore them in the manner that the survey\u2019s recommendations suggest. The best example of that can be found in the recommendation a few years back from former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) that the GOP needed to declare a \u201ctruce\u201d a social issues and concentrate on economic issues, especially for the then-upcoming 2012 elections. The reaction to Daniels\u2019 comments from activist social conservatives was overwhelmingly negative. Anti-abortion groups and prominent Republican social conservatives attacked him for what they perceived as an abandonment of principles. Others called it \u201can affront to the millions of conservatives who believe that social issues such as abortion and traditional marriage are non-negotiable.\u201d Obviously, if the GOP tried to do the same thing again, we\u2019d see a similar reaction.\n\nThe party\u2019s second problem, though, is one that the survey recognizes and one that is not easily fixed. Namely, it\u2019s the simple fact that Republicans seem to not be able to understand how to communicate with female voters, and that\u2019s a problem that even seems to extend to female Republican politicians. Until they fix that, no amount of change is going to amount to much of anything.\n\nDoug Mataconis appears on the Outside the Beltway blog at http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "122e73ab5ecde3feb39c96c25b875e0d", "sailthru.author": "Doug Mataconis", "description": "Even Republican women lawmakers seem to have difficulty communicating with women voters \u2013 and for the Republican Party, there don't appear to be any easy fixes.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/08/0829-WOMEN-VOTERS-sized.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Even Republican women lawmakers seem to have difficulty communicating with women voters \u2013 and for the Republican Party, there don't appear to be any easy fixes.", "title": "Republicans still have a problem with female voters", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2014/0829/Republicans-still-have-a-problem-with-female-voters", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/08/0829-WOMEN-VOTERS-sized.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/08/0829-WOMEN-VOTERS-sized.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "title": "Republicans still have a problem with female voters", "description": "Even Republican women lawmakers seem to have difficulty communicating with women voters \u2013 and for the Republican Party, there don't appear to be any easy fixes.", "card": "summary", "site": "@csmonitor"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-29", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-29T19:04:28-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2014/0829/Republicans-still-have-a-problem-with-female-voters", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics-voices,section-politics,section-usa,class-blog-post,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Politics Voices", "published_time": "2014-08-29T19:04-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Matt Born/The Star-News/AP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce982\"", "article_summary": "The report \u2013 \u201cRepublicans and Women Voters: Huge Challenges, Real Opportunities\u201d \u2013 was the product of eight focus groups across the country and a poll of 800 registered female voters this summer.\nNamely, it\u2019s the simple fact that Republicans seem to not be able to understand how to communicate with female voters, and that\u2019s a problem that even seems to extend to female Republican politicians.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that conservatives have more work to do with women.\u201d Republicans in Washington say they recognize the problem.\nThis would be especially true, it seems, in the so-called \u201cpurple\u201d states and among suburban female voters in areas like Northern Virginia.\nEven Republican women lawmakers seem to have difficulty communicating with women voters \u2013 and for the Republican Party, there don't appear to be any easy fixes."}
