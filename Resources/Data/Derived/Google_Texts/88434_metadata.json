Some have also reported finger amputations. The Mainstays card table includes four black padded metal folding chairs, made by Dongguan Shin Din Metal & Plastic Products Co. They were sold in Wal-Mart stores nationwide throughout May 2013 and up to November 2013, costing about $50. \u201cConsumers should immediately stop using the recalled card table and chair sets and return the entire set to Walmart for a full refund,\u201d the Consumer Product Safety Commission wrote. \u201cThe chairs can collapse unexpectedly, posing a fall hazard and a risk of finger injury, including finger amputation.\u201d\n\nFingertip injuries are often common accidents that can occur at home or at work, from a finger being slammed in a door, or slicing vegetables. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), a fingertip injury can involve damage to the skin and soft tissue, bone, as well as the nail. Fingertips contain a large amount of nerves and are thus quite sensitive. \u201cWithout prompt and proper care, a fingertip injury can disrupt the complex function of the hand, possibly resulting in permanent deformity and disability,\u201d the AAOS wrote. There are two main types of finger injuries \u2014 injury without exposed bone, and one where bone is exposed. Typically, reconstructive flap surgery, which involves covering the chopped off part with new skin, can restore the finger. Another option, which is a complicated surgical procedure, is replantation, where the surgeon reattaches the amputated piece.\n\nIf you are suffering from a fingertip injury, make sure you elevate that finger and apply ice to reduce swelling and bleeding. Cover the wounded part with a dry and sterile cloth, then create a short splint if possible. If an entire finger or fingertip has been cut off, clean the chopped-off part with water or saline, cover it in gauze and place it in a watertight bag. Place the bag on ice, but not the amputated part directly on ice.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wal-mart, recall, card tables, mainstays, finger amputations, injuries, chairs,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wal-Mart has recalled sets of tables and chairs after receiving reports of serious injuries caused by the items' unexpected collapse.", "title": "Wal-Mart Recall 2014: 73,000 Card Tables Recalled After Finger Amputations", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wal-mart-recall-2014-over-73000-card-tables-and-chairs-recalled-amid-reports-finger-amputations", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/chair.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wal-Mart has recalled sets of tables and chairs after receiving reports of serious injuries caused by the items' unexpected collapse.", "title": "Wal-Mart Recall 2014: 73,000 Card Tables Recalled After Finger Amputations", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wal-mart-recall-2014-over-73000-card-tables-and-chairs-recalled-amid-reports-finger-amputations", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/chair.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/chair.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-04T13:38:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-04T13:38:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wal-Mart has recalled sets of tables and chairs after receiving reports of serious injuries caused by the items' unexpected collapse."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf022\"", "article_summary": "There are two main types of finger injuries \u2014 injury without exposed bone, and one where bone is exposed.\nThe superstore Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has recalled 73,400 sets of card tables and chairs because they may pose a risk of an unexpected collapse, leading to dangerous injuries, such as finger amputations.\n\u201cWithout prompt and proper care, a fingertip injury can disrupt the complex function of the hand, possibly resulting in permanent deformity and disability,\u201d the AAOS wrote.\nIf you are suffering from a fingertip injury, make sure you elevate that finger and apply ice to reduce swelling and bleeding.\nThe Mainstays card table includes four black padded metal folding chairs, made by Dongguan Shin Din Metal & Plastic Products Co."}
