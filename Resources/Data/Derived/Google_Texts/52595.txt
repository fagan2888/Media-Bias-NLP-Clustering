DETROIT (AP) - Fragile preparatory drawings for Diego Rivera’s Detroit Industry murals are being readied for display as part of a new exhibition at the Detroit Industry of Arts.

The Detroit Free Press reports (http://on.freep.com/1zSMvjM ) the drawings include a full-size, 9-foot-by-7-foot study for part of the murals that recently was worked on by experts and technicians. It’s included in “Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Detroit,” which opens March 15.

The Mexican artists lived in Detroit in 1932 and 1933 while Rivera completed the murals. Among the show’s works are eight preparatory drawings. The newspaper says they were lost for roughly 45 years until being rediscovered in the museum’s basement in the 1970s.

The exhibit is making its debut after the museum’s collection was protected from possible sale during Detroit’s bankruptcy.
