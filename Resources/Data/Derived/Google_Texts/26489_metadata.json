Others relate to workforce quality and competition. And probably the biggest issue of all is the drought and what to do about ensuring an adequate future water supply.\u201d\n\nGreer said the program\u2019s first presentation, which was on the topic of impact of the Affordable Care Act and given by Kelly Kolodzey of the Texas Association of Counties, was perhaps the most time-sensitive and interesting to attendees.\n\n\u201cStarting soon, everything is going to change,\u201d Kolodzey said. \u201cMy purpose here is to impart as much as I know about the ACA to you and to drive home the point that you must start to understand and prepare for these changes now.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Doug Miller said the event provided the opportunity to get feedback on how he and other elected officials are doing and to learn what they can do to better serve their communities and constituents.\n\nUvalde County Judge William \u201cBill\u201d Mitchell spoke about the time and effort involved in having the new event center planned, funded and developed. He said the facility was an excellent example of what can be accomplished through vision, good communications, building a consensus by involving stakeholders and finding an acceptable way to fund the project.\n\n\u201cThe community has really wrapped its arms around this facility and the vision we had of it for the purpose of economic development,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we have this opportunity to show it off to others and let them see what might be possible with the same sort of support in their counties.\u201d\n\nDuring the afternoon, conference attendees heard from Dr. Rick Avery, director of the V.G. Young Institute, part of the Texas A&M University System, as well as from Ronnie McDonald, AgriLife Extension executive director for community relations and strategic partnerships. Avery and McDonald spoke about the need to further develop county leadership, with McDonald touting the Texas Rural Leadership Program as a means to help \u201cdevelop progressive and dynamic leaders in Texas communities.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Jim Allison, general counsel for the County Judges and Commissioners Association, gave an update on the state\u2019s 83rd Legislature, including the status of House and Senate bills relating to water, education, transportation, health care services, sewage disposal, revenue allocation, bond requirements, polling and more.\n\nThe final presentation, \u201cTexas Water Issues,\u201d was given by Dr. Raul Lopez, director of the Texas Water Resources Institute. Lopez noted that finding solutions to the challenges of current and future water use and availability depends on \u201cfinding a balance between the needs of the various stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a number of things to consider in determining how to plan for future water use in this region,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, we have to consider endangered and invasive species, the needs of the oil and gas industry and other businesses, and the needs of growing municipalities in finding this balance.\u201d\n\nGreer said she was pleased AgriLife Extension continues to host these annual conferences in her district and others throughout the state.\n\n\u201cThese conferences provide a unique opportunity for county commissioners, judges and others who serve the public,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that AgriLife Extension hosts these events throughout the state and plays a role in helping public servants find solutions and discover new ways to serve their communities.\u201d\n\n-30-", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ba0\"", "article_summary": "By: Paul Schattenberg, 210-467-6575, paschattenberg@ag.tamu.eduContact: Kathleen Greer, 830-278-9151, kl-greer@tamu.eduUVALDE \u2014 More than 30 county commissioners, county judges and other elected officials from various Southwest Texas counties attended the annual District 10 County Commissioners Conference held Dec. 13 in Uvalde.\nThe final presentation, \u201cTexas Water Issues,\u201d was given by Dr. Raul Lopez, director of the Texas Water Resources Institute.\n\u201cThese conferences provide a unique opportunity for county commissioners, judges and others who serve the public,\u201d she said.\nThe conference, presented by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which took place at the Uvalde County Fairplex Event Center, was attended by county officials representing Bandera, Bastrop, Blanco, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kimble, Kinney, Medina, Real, Sutton, Uvalde and Wilson counties.\nYoung Institute, part of the Texas A&M University System, as well as from Ronnie McDonald, AgriLife Extension executive director for community relations and strategic partnerships."}
