In case you missed it…

Two of the nation’s biggest hospital chains — Community Health Systems Inc. and Health Management Associates Inc. — formalized their merger on Monday, with the newly combined entity now at the top of the health-care heap along with industry leader HCA Holdings Inc.

Community /quotes/zigman/261693/delayed /quotes/nls/cyh CYH acquired Health Management, which formerly traded under the symbol HMA. That now leaves Community and HCA /quotes/zigman/1545475/delayed /quotes/nls/hca HCA as the nation’s two-largest hospital chains.

HCA and Community are just miles apart from each other; HCA is based near Vanderbilt University in Nashville, while Community is headquartered in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, 18 miles away. Nashville is a hub of sorts for health-care companies, many of which were spin-offs from venerable HCA or the creation of former officials of the hospital company.

Community Health is one step removed from being a direct HCA spinoff. Its founders included two men who left HCA to join another health-care company before forming Community Health. HCA still appears to be the bigger company as it employs 204,000 people at 165 hospitals and 115 free-standing surgery centers in 20 states and England.

Community Health now has more hospitals, 206, in more states, 29, to its name. But its employee count of 135,000 is well below that of HCA. Because of its surgery centers, HCA can count 280 facilities overall.

Community announced in late July that it was buying Naples, Fla.-based Health Management for $3.8 billion. Health Management share holders will get $10.50 per share in cash and roughly 7% of a Community Health share for each Health Management share they own.

Amid a down day in health care, shares of both Community and HCA were up. HCA added 1.5% to $49.10 while Community was up roughly 1% to $40.48.
