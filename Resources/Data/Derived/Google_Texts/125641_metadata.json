I\u2019ve loved watching the Oscars and BAFTAs and now want to recreate some of the stars\u2019 sparkle at home, without spending a fortune. I have short, silver hair and am wearing a full-length emerald green dress.\n\n\n\nAgnes, 72, Lanarkshire.\n\nPRIME YOUR SKIN\n\nMake-up looks better if your skin is in good condition, which is why Los Angeles\u2019 top facialists get booked months in advance before the Oscars. But you can do some of their best tips at home for free.\n\n\n\nTop facialist Nichola Joss, beauty therapist for Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank, advises drinking plenty of water and using a youth boosting treatment oil. Try the Sanctuary Therapist\u2019s Facial Oil (\u00a317.50, Boots) or Weleda\u2019s iconic Skin Food (\u00a38.95, weleda.co.uk), a miracle moisturiser.\n\n\n\nWhen I interviewed the 69-year-old actress Jacqueline Bisset, she told me almond oil is one of her secret wonder products.\n\n\n\n\u2018It nourishes my skin and keeps it supple,\u2019 she said. Other advice included: \u2018Get your blood moving by exercising! It keeps your skin looking fresh.\u2019 And her best tip? \u2018Sleeping for eight hours in a nice, cool room.\u2019\n\n\n\nA face mask can give skin a boost before a big event, but use it at least two days before in case it brings out irritations.\n\n\n\nActress Natalie Portman uses Glamglow Mud Mask, (\u00a325, Marks & Spencer), but an inexpensive alternative is the Superberry Mud Mask, (\u00a32.59 from Superdrug).\n\nTHE PERFECT CANVAS\n\nCamera-ready foundation is a red carpet must-have. The new Giorgio Armani Maestro Fusion Compact Make-up (\u00a331, armanibeauty.co.uk) is a cream foundation with a blend of oils and waxes that melt into the skin.\n\n\n\nFor a less expensive version, try George Flawless Cr\u00e8me Foundation (\u00a34, Asda).\n\n\n\nSTATEMENT EYES\n\nMake-up artist Lina Cameron, who has worked with Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, says: \u2018Eyes need to look dramatic. Bourjois Intuitive Black Liner, (\u00a36.99, Superdrug) is easy to use. To make eyes stand out, curl your lashes before applying mascara. I like Maybelline Great Lash Very Waterproof (\u00a34.99, Boots).\u2019\n\n\n\nSTATEMENT LIPS\n\nRed lips look classically Hollywood \u2014 try No 7 Precision Lips pencil in Fire, (\u00a36.75, Boots) and fill with Seventeen Stay Pout Lipstick in Date Night, (\u00a34.49, Boots) \u2014 but orange can be striking, too.\n\n\n\nIllamasqua\u2019s Satin Finish Glamore Lipstick in Soaked, (\u00a316.50, illamasqua.com) is a vibrant tangerine.\n\n\n\nHAIR RAISING\n\nIt\u2019s not just Hollywood stars who can get away with something fun \u2014 so can you! Channel Helen Mirren, who appeared on the red carpet with pink hair at last year\u2019s BAFTAs, with Body Shop\u2019s brightly coloured Hair Chalks (\u00a35, bodyshop.co.uk).\n\n\n\nWould you like advice for a special event? Write to me at elsa@dailymail.co.uk\n\n\n\nUNSUNG HERO\n\n\n\nPeople have been asking me where Rimmel London\u2019s Nail Rescue has gone.\n\n\n\nThe excellent conditioning treatment for fragile, brittle nails is now called Nail Nurse (\u00a34.49, Superdrug).\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s every bit as good as the original product.\n\n\n\nApply every day for a fortnight and it will strengthen damaged nails.\n\n\n\nYou can also wear it as a basecoat and it will prevent nails from going yellow.\n\n\n\nELSA'S PICK\n\nThis March, Elemis is celebrating the tenth birthday of its Cellular Recovery Skin Bliss Capsules with a limited super-sized set for \u00a379.50 (a saving of \u00a344.50 on the usual price).
