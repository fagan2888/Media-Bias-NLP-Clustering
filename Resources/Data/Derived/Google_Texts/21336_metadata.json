But he\u2019s got spunk, and studies have shown that you don\u2019t have to be accurate to be believable; all you need is confidence. Now, a new study further proves that it\u2019s easy to deceive people when you\u2019ve got too much confidence.\n\nResearchers from Newcastle University and the University of Exeter called it being \u201cself-deceived,\u201d but it\u2019s really just overconfidence. They found that people who were full of themselves were better able to get promotions or reach influential positions simply by letting their confidence exude onto other people, who were deceived into thinking the self-deceived were qualified. \u201cThese findings suggest that people don\u2019t always reward the most accomplished individual but rather the most self-deceived,\u201d said study author Dr. Vivek Nityananda, research associate at Newcastle, in a press release.\n\nIndeed that is the case, and it\u2019s probably because these people have tinges of narcissism within themselves. Narcissists are natural leaders, even if they\u2019re not necessarily good at their job \u2014 it\u2019s their competitive attitudes that get them there. From pundits like Rush Limbaugh to high school athletes, confidence is key to getting ahead in life, even if you don\u2019t deserve it.\n\nNityananda discovered these misconceptions of the overconfident after studying a group of 72 college students, all of whom were asked to rate their own ability and that of their peers to complete an assignment. They found that 45 percent of the students were under-confident in their ability to score high \u2014 the researchers found these people were perceived as less able by others \u2014 while 40 percent of students were overconfident. These students were also perceived by others to be able to score high, regardless of what their actual grades were.\n\nThe researchers credited these illusory qualities, at least partially, to airplane crashes and financial crises \u2014 the idea being that self-deceived individuals are more likely to overestimate other people\u2019s abilities and take greater risks. \u201cIf overconfident people are more likely to be risk prone then by promoting them we may be creating institutions, such as banks and armies, that are more vulnerable to risk,\u201d joint lead author Dr. Shakti Lamba said in the release.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s exactly what New Yorker writer and best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell said with regard to the 2008 financial crisis at the 2009 New Yorker Summit. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on on Wall Street isn\u2019t the result of experts failing to act as experts: It\u2019s the result of experts acting exactly as experts act. It\u2019s not a result of incompetence, it\u2019s a result of overconfidence.\u201d\n\nSource: Lamba S, Nityananda V. Self-Deceived Individuals Are Better at Deceiving Others.
