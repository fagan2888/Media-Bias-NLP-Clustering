Dr. Kelli Ward is attempting the incredible difficult challenge of facing Arizona Senator and former GOP presidential candidate John McCain for the U.S. Senate seat. Ward talked issues with Dispatch Radio, beginning with her background, general beliefs and track record.

“It has been difficult, but it’s also been exhilarating,” she says of the campaign. “No matter where I go within Arizona…people are ready for that change (unseating McCain and others)” and then points out how the years in Congress “has changed Senator McCain.”

“…He’s simply is not the conservative he claims to be…” noting the “tax hikes,” “bailouts” and “massive new spending” that Sen. McCain has supported.

Check out the full clip below.

Kelli addresses the challenges to stop Obamacare, McCain’s name calling of Sen. Mike Lee or Ted Cruz (“Whacko birds”) and how he hasn’t been good on the second amendment.

“…the list just goes on and on and on as to why people are angry, why people are upset, why people are disgusted with the beltway…”

Ward talks about the polls, battling Ann Kirkpatrick, Donald Trump being atop the 2016 ticket and how the immigration issue resonates with Arizona voters.

Just a great interview, listen for yourself.
