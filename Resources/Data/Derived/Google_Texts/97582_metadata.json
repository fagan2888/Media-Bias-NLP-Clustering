If there\u2019s an easy way to do things or a hard way, the government will always choose the more difficult.\n\nHere\u2019s a perfect example.\n\nWhen my husband signed up for Medicare four years ago, he opted not to enroll in a prescription plan because he wasn\u2019t taking any prescriptions other than one for which he paid $4 a month. No big deal. Well, he was diagnosed with glaucoma this year and, as a result, is required to use eye drops which have turned out to be very costly.\n\nSo, we started looking for a Part D prescription plan and found out that he will actually be penalized for (1) being a healthy individual requiring no expensive medications for the past four years and (2) saving money instead paying out for coverage he didn\u2019t need. (Let\u2019s not even discuss that I, at 60+ years of age, had to pay for pregnancy insurance which has finally been eliminated from my policy, but I still have to pay for \u201cpediatric vision\u201d and increased premiums thanks to Obamacare.)\n\nI called Medicare.gov today to find out exactly how much the \u201clate enrollment penalty\u201d is going to be. The gal on the phone could barely read it from her pre-printed script but here\u2019s what I wrote down. There will be a 1% charge on the premium for every 63 days my husband was eligible for, but not enrolled in, a Plan D drug program forever and ever. The gal actually had to put us on hold to figure this out \u2013 on a premium, for example, of $25 a month, the penalty will be approximately $16 a month ad infinitum.\n\nFirst of all, I have no clue why someone has to pay for something they don\u2019t want or need.\n\nSecond, my husband is now being penalized for saving that premium for the last 48 months.\n\nThird, it isn\u2019t as if Medicare is affected by this new policy. Over the course of the last four years, we\u2019ve actually paid out-of-pocket for antibiotics, etc. that he\u2019s needed at NO cost to Medicare.\n\nFourth, who came up with this 1%?\n\nFifth, what the heck does 63 days have to do with anything?\n\nSixth, if the government could actually come up with a rationale why my husband should be penalized, why not just a one time deal?\n\nI can go on and on but this is what our government has created. And this is what we can expect from a Hillary administration who intends to grow government even more and, God forbid, a Bernie Sanders administration who wants government in every aspect of our lives.\n\nI\u2019m praying for a Republication who will simplify government, but I really don\u2019t hold out much hope. As I\u2019ve said before, Hillary is Teflon-coated. No one seems to care that she\u2019s a liar. And, unless she murders Bill and it\u2019s caught on video, we\u2019ll be stuck with her for the next eight years.\n\nBut, I can dream. I would love to see Mrs. Fiorina reduce the tax code to three pages; I would love to send in a tax return on a postcard if Mr. Cruz has his way. I would love to see a flat tax. It can be done, but that\u2019s just not the way government works.\n\nI don\u2019t get it, but if you do, God bless you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "there\u2019s an easy or hard way, the government will always choose the most difficult and complicated.", "og": {"site_name": "BernardGoldberg.com", "description": "there\u2019s an easy or hard way, the government will always choose the most difficult and complicated.", "title": "The Government\u2019s Way of Doing Things", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/easy-way-hard-way-street-sign-300x200.jpg", "url": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/the-governments-way-of-doing-things/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "there\u2019s an easy or hard way, the government will always choose the most difficult and complicated.", "creator": "@bernardgoldberg", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/easy-way-hard-way-street-sign-300x200.jpg", "title": "The Government\u2019s Way of Doing Things", "site": "@bernardgoldberg", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Contributors", "tag": "prescription drugs programs", "published_time": "2015-11-13T11:54:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If there\u2019s an easy way to do things or a hard way, the government will always choose the more difficult.\nIt can be done, but that\u2019s just not the way government works.\nI would love to see Mrs. Fiorina reduce the tax code to three pages; I would love to send in a tax return on a postcard if Mr. Cruz has his way.\nSecond, my husband is now being penalized for saving that premium for the last 48 months.\nFirst of all, I have no clue why someone has to pay for something they don\u2019t want or need."}
