Republicans take aim at IRS budget\n\nEver since the IRS tea party scandal broke two years ago, House Republicans have redoubled their efforts to gut the agency\u2019s budget \u2014 year after year after year.\n\nBut now \u2014 for the first time since Lois Lerner\u2019s infamous 2013 apology \u2014 they\u2019re finally getting their moment to impose serious financial constraints on the tax-collecting agency they love to hate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse GOP appropriators on Wednesday proposed chopping IRS resources almost 8 percent, reducing the agency budget to $10.1 billion. It would be a huge hit to the agency responsible not only for overseeing tax collections but administering Obamacare\u2019s health care subsidies.\n\nAnd those cuts are bound to balloon even more once the bill hits the House floor. Republicans are eager to offer further amendments snipping at the IRS \u2014 especially amid headlines about the IRS targeting conservative groups, giving rogue employees bonuses and falling short of protecting taxpayer rights and privacy.\n\nWhile House Republicans in past years have had to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled Senate \u2014 which was often able to restore the IRS budget or at the very least, ease proposed cuts \u2014 this time around, GOP allies are behind the wheel in the Senate.\n\nThat means President Barack Obama \u2014 who requested an 18 percent increase for the IRS \u2014 could be forced to sign a spending bill later this year that would add new hardships for the agency, which already is reeling from scandal and begging for more money to boost taxpayer services and protect taxpayers\u2019 information. Holding up a broader spending bill in the name of the IRS, after all, is a political no-no with an American public deeply skeptical of tax collectors. If the president were to refuse to sign a spending bill only because of cuts to the IRS, he\u2019d risk serious political backlash.\n\n\u201cThis will hold the agency\u2019s budget below the sequester level and below the fiscal year 2004 level,\u201d a House Appropriations Committee news release boasts. \u201cThis funding level is sufficient for the IRS to perform its core duties, but will require the agency to streamline and better prioritize its budget.\u201d\n\nThe bill would cut $838 million from the current IRS budget, bringing the agency\u2019s funding $2.8 billion below what Obama requested.\n\nThe bill, as in years past, would also block the IRS from proposing a controversial, much-awaited regulation aimed at reining in the political activities of 501(c)(4) tax-exempt groups like Crossroads GPS. Such groups are supposed to limit their campaign activity under law, but the IRS got in trouble during the tea party hubbub for holding up the approvals of conservative groups that weren\u2019t engaging in politics but advocacy.\n\nStill, the IRS says it needs clarity for itself and for taxpayers about what is and isn\u2019t allowed.\n\nAnother thing it can\u2019t do under the GOP bill: Collect penalties under Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. That would potentially save hundreds if not thousands of dollars for Obamacare protesters who refuse to buy coverage.\n\nThe agency argues that such cuts would only hurt taxpayers and leave a threadbare IRS unable to help people address their tax problems. The IRS also administers the core of Obamacare \u2014 health care tax credits \u2014 and recently experienced cybersecurity lapses that amounted to people\u2019s personal information being hacked.\n\nThe bill specifically gives the IRS a $75 million boost for taxpayer services, in an effort to prevent any cuts from hurting Americans who need their tax questions answered.\n\nThe cuts are part of a $20.2 billion financial services bill filled with political red meat designed to appeal to GOP lawmakers. While Republican appropriators have decried spending caps for other appropriations bills, leaving them in a tough spot cutting key priorities, they\u2019re more than happy to make reductions on this measure.\n\n\u201cWhile making good use of limited tax dollars, this legislation also makes great strides in reining in wasteful spending, and stopping harmful and unnecessary bureaucratic over-reach,\u201d House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said in a statement.\n\nOverall, the bill is about $1.3 billion below last year\u2019s level and $4.8 billion below what the president wanted.\n\nThe legislation makes cuts to prized Democratic agencies, including a proposal to bring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the congressional appropriations process. Currently, it\u2019s funded through the Federal Reserve, but the change would give Congress \u2014 namely, Republicans \u2014 more power over the agency.\n\nThe bill is also packed with conservative policy provisions like one requiring the administration to \u201creport to Congress on the cost and regulatory burdens of the Dodd-Frank Act,\u201d and another to bar the SEC from mandating political-donation disclosures in filings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans are finally getting their moment to impose serious financial constraints.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "House Republicans are finally getting their moment to impose serious financial constraints.", "title": "Republicans take aim at IRS budget", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gop-irs-budget-118835.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/10/150610__hal_rogers_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,House Republicans,Consumer Protection,White House,Tax,Cybersecurity,IRS,Crossroads GPS,House Appropriations Committee,Hal Rogers", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe132d\"", "article_summary": "Republicans take aim at IRS budgetEver since the IRS tea party scandal broke two years ago, House Republicans have redoubled their efforts to gut the agency\u2019s budget \u2014 year after year after year.\nStory Continued BelowHouse GOP appropriators on Wednesday proposed chopping IRS resources almost 8 percent, reducing the agency budget to $10.1 billion.\nIf the president were to refuse to sign a spending bill only because of cuts to the IRS, he\u2019d risk serious political backlash.\nRepublicans are eager to offer further amendments snipping at the IRS \u2014 especially amid headlines about the IRS targeting conservative groups, giving rogue employees bonuses and falling short of protecting taxpayer rights and privacy.\nWhile House Republicans in past years have had to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled Senate \u2014 which was often able to restore the IRS budget or at the very least, ease proposed cuts \u2014 this time around, GOP allies are behind the wheel in the Senate."}
