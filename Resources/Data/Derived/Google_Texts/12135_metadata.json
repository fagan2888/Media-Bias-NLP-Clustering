Rand Paul about a vote he cast earlier this year to continue federal subsidies to tobacco farmers for crop insurance.\n\nPaul had just finished telling the crowd at the Motor City Casino that government programs hinder rather than help economic activity so, given his libertarian view of government programs, it\u2019s odd that he would support a program that shackles tobacco farmers in his home state of Kentucky to the burden of federally-subsidized insurance. This is a man who once equated food stamps to slavery, after all.\n\nCrop insurance subsidies sound a lot like Obamacare\u2014Paul is a critic\u2014for plants instead of people. You'd think Paul would want the government to get out of the way, so the free market would be better able to fulfill the crop insurance needs of his tobacco-growing constituents.\n\nThe junior senator from Kentucky has (mostly) been against farm subsidies in the past and he did mention his general opposition on Friday. However, when he had an opportunity to kill one of those subsidies, Paul apparently sided with the big government status quo. What happened?\n\nPaul explained that he voted against the tobacco amendment\u2014offered by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA)\u2014because, he said, it wouldn\u2019t have actually eliminated the subsidy.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the amendment was to cut the program,\u201d Paul said, explaining that the issue was whether or not the program would be included in the budget or as an off-budget item.\n\nHowever, back in May, the Lexington (KY) Herald-Examiner presented a very different interpretation of the amendment that McCain and Feinstein said would save taxpayers $33 million every year.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., introduced an amendment to the 2013 Farm Bill to drop the eight USDA tobacco insurance programs. The Council for Burley Tobacco notified farmers of the proposed change Tuesday and asked them to contact Sen. Rand Paul, R-Bowling Green, to urge him to oppose the amendment. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Louisville, opposes the change, the council said.\n\nThe Herald-Examiner even quoted industry lobbyists and tobacco farmers who were concerned that the amendment\u2019s passage might drive some tobacco farmers out of business.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Richard Burr (R) spoke in opposition to the amendment in terms that made it clear he believed it would do more than move tobacco crop insurance \u201coff budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing this agricultural commodity asks is let us participate in the federal crop insurance program,\u201d Burr said. \u201cDon't do this to a piece of the agriculture community ... that contributes a lot to this country.\u201d\n\nSen. McCain's staff also confirms the proposed amendment\u2014it failed on a 44-52 vote\u2014would have stripped public funding for the program.\n\n\"Senator McCain\u2019s amendment would eliminate tobacco as a covered commodity for federal subsidies in crop insurance programs,\" said McCain spokeswoman Rachael Dean in an email. \"The Congressional Budget Office projected that removing tobacco from these programs would reduce mandatory spending by about $37 million a year \u2013 a substantial savings that would be used to help pay down the federal deficit.\"\n\nThe non-partisan CBO concluded the amendment would save taxpayers $333 million between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2023.\n\nCrop insurance programs are bad policy across-the-board ,as McCain argued on the Senate floor last May: \u201c[C]rop insurance in general has a dubious reputation as a \u2018safety net\u2019 for farmers because it largely insures against revenue loss instead of crop loss due to weather or pests. According to the Congressional Research Service, taxpayers spend about $14 billion a year to subsidize about 60% of the cost of crop insurance premiums. The federal government also reimburses private crop insurance companies for about 24% of their \u2018administrative and operating\u2019 costs.\u201d\n\nHowever, one might argue helping insure lettuce, corn, and apple crops serves a critical national interest\u2014to make sure farmers grow enough food to feed all Americans\u2014tobacco subsidies serves no such purpose.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, tobacco farmers grow cancer. Sure, we all have to die from something and no one should tell adults they can\u2019t enjoy a smoke. It's a free country after all. Still, there\u2019s no reason the American taxpayer needs to help pay for your cigarette break.\n\nBased on his vote, Rand Paul believes otherwise. So do 51 other U.S. senators, including Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Fine.I just wish Mr. Paul would be honest about his hypocrisy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_rand_paul_10019.jpg", "description": "Rand Paul wants less government for Detroit, but when it comes to Kentucky tobacco farmers, he's not so sure.", "title": "Why Did Rand Paul Lie To Me At The Detroit Economic Club?"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dbf\"", "article_summary": "The Herald-Examiner even quoted industry lobbyists and tobacco farmers who were concerned that the amendment\u2019s passage might drive some tobacco farmers out of business.\nHowever, when he had an opportunity to kill one of those subsidies, Paul apparently sided with the big government status quo.\nCrop insurance subsidies sound a lot like Obamacare\u2014Paul is a critic\u2014for plants instead of people.\nLast week, after his speech to the Detroit Economic Club, I asked Sen.
