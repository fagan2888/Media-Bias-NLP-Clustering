A Meridian girl has been accepted into a prestigious school.

Tia Hall, a Meridian High School senior, got accepted into the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles after a long period of interviews, essays, and applications. Only 30 percent of auditions make it into this school and Tia is very thankful.

"It’s not all about being famous. It's about doing what you love, and if I’m acting I will be happy no matter where and I would really love to be in a movie. That lights camera action stuff, that's me. I love that," Hall says.

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help Tia make her dreams a reality and get to AMDA.
