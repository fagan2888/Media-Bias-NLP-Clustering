The image was, of course, a powerful one. Here was the nation\u2019s first African-American president connecting with the aura of the president who, nearly 150 years before, had freed the slaves. But Obama clearly intended the symbolism to go beyond this. Lincoln was not only the American president who made his election possible, he was also the president whom Obama most wished to emulate: a man of compassion, who stood for justice, and who occupied a transformative presence on the national stage.\n\nWell, Obama succeeded, just not the way that he hoped he might have. The Lincoln Americans carry in their breast pockets is a mythic figure: a gifted orator \u2013 author of some of the nation\u2019s most stirring phrases \u2013 who was known as the \u201cGreat Emancipator\u201d and who had successfully presided over our nation\u2019s bloodiest war, saving the country from ruin.\n\nAll that may be true. But there is another, less affirmative Lincoln that history, so protective of its heroes, has obscured: As president, Abraham Lincoln claimed broad executive powers, was a master of indecision, and, in a nation with deep-seated regional differences, was almost certainly too enamored of the federal solution. In other words, he was a lot like the man in the White House today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a pen and I\u2019ve got a telegraph\u201d\n\nFor someone who was so steeped in the law and the Constitution, Lincoln was surprisingly dismissive of the separation of powers. He claimed that the emergency conditions of the war \u2013 which, of course, were considerable \u2013 required him to suspend habeas corpus, this despite the fact that the Constitution addresses the authority to do this in Article I, which outlines the powers of Congress, not the executive. Chief Justice Roger Taney noted the breach and called him on it, but Lincoln went ahead anyway.\n\nWhen he signed the Confiscation Act of 1862 \u2013 which Congress had authored to allow the seizure of property, including slaves, from those offering direct support to the Confederate cause \u2013 Lincoln, worried that this act might alienate the Border States, penned a draft veto message and, like a modern-day signing statement, sent that to Congress along with his signature enacting the law \u2013 \u201ca veto that was not a veto\u201d for an act he signed yet never intended to enforce. And the document for which he is perhaps best known \u2013 the Emancipation Proclamation \u2013 was, despite its clear moral foundations, a \u201ctaking\u201d \u2013 that is, a seizure of property without compensation as prohibited by the Constitution. Recognizing that a legislative solution was politically impossible, Lincoln opted instead to \u201cproclaim\u201d the end of slavery in the rebel states \u2013 the proclamation serving here as modern-day presidents use the executive order \u2013 and to do so under his powers as commander-in-chief.\n\nEquality, the \u201cdefining issue of our time\u201d\n\nLincoln, like so many before and after him, including this president, also had a willful view of the law. Since the Constitution did not yet defend \u201cequality\u201d per se (that would come with the 14th Amendment), he asserted that the Declaration of Independence, a revolutionary manifesto that recognized \u201call men\u201d as \u201ccreated equal,\u201d to be superior to the slavery-protective Constitution even though as a manifesto the Declaration carried no legal weight. After arguing that secession itself was unconstitutional \u2013 states could not withdraw from the Union simply by declaring themselves dissatisfied, for that, he insisted, was \u201cthe essence of anarchy\u201d \u2013 he endorsed the 1862 secession of the western counties of Virginia from the rebel government in Richmond when he recognized their application to the Union as a separate state. Even his own attorney general \u2013 Edward Bates \u2013 had counseled him to reject the West Virginia argument as inconsistent with the sanctity of the Union (\u201cit is a very grave and important thing to cut up and dismember one of the original States of this nation\u201d) but Lincoln acted differently, distinguishing between \u201csecession against the Constitution, and secession in favor of the Constitution\u201d \u2013 my secession versus yours.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama hoped to emulate Lincoln's sense of justice and compassion.
