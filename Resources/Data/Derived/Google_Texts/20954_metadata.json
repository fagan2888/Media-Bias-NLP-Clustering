The first three came on the strong side earlier this year. And in a further tip to Hodges\u2019 improved maturity and study habits, he handled Sunday\u2019s strongside nickel defense duties, while Chad Greenway took care of the weak side.\n\n\u201cLast year, I don\u2019t think my head was in it like it should have been,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cNot like it is this year.\u201d\n\nThe Jets opened with what appeared to be a low-risk play-action slant pass to Harvin, who was lined up in the left slot. But a formation with two tight ends to the offense\u2019s right side told Hodges to look for the slant pass to the opposite side.\n\n\u201cWe see the formations so many times in practice that come game time, we already know what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Hodges, who also had eight tackles and two passes defensed. \u201cYou see the formation and you go set yourself up to try and make the play.\u201d\n\nThe interception was the first of Hodges\u2019 career and the 12th of the season for quarterback Geno Smith. But in Smith\u2019s defense, Harvin was wide open at first and still looked open right up to the point when Hodges showcased the athleticism that coaches rave about. \u201cHats off to Gerald,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a play that not many linebackers can make.\u201d\n\nWhen Smith play-faked to running back Chris Ivory, Harvin was open. Free safety Harrison Smith was 4 yards behind and to Harvin\u2019s left, while Hodges was between the hash marks, 5 yards inside of Harvin.\n\nWhen Geno Smith let go of the ball, Harvin appeared to be in good position to make the catch. Until, that is, Hodges leapt and snared the ball with his left hand. He then came down, spun to his right and used defensive end Everson Griffen\u2019s block of Smith at the 3-yard line to score his first touchdown since high school.\n\n\u201cI think [Geno Smith] looked me right in the eye as he was throwing,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cI think he thought he could throw it over my shoulder. It was a great play. Right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nVikings coach Mike Zimmer expected to see a heavy dose of slants to Harvin. \u201cIt\u2019s a play that a few teams have thrown on us this year,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201c[Hodges] made a great catch and ran with it.\u201d\n\nGreenway wasn\u2019t surprised that Hodges recognized the formation and was expecting the slant. \u201cHis study habits have been good this year,\u201d Greenway said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a play we\u2019ve seen a thousand times. But to recognize it is one thing. To react as quickly as he did and to actually make that play from that close is tough.
