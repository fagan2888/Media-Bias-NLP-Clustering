Bush, hanging chad, math, Politics News\n\nAn example of an extremely significant, decidedly unintended result of a relatively tiny event can be nightmarish. This one is, at least for me. It concerns the role I played in getting George W. Bush elected president in 2000. That I was the butterfly whose fluttering cascaded into Bush\u2019s election still pains me. I had written an op-ed for the New York Times titled \u201cWe\u2019re Measuring Bacteria with a Yardstick\u201d in which I argued that the vote in Florida had been so close that the gross apparatus of the state\u2019s electoral system was incapable of discerning the difference between the candidates\u2019 vote totals. Given the problems with the hanging chads, the misleading ballots (in retrospect, aptly termed \u201cbutterfly ballots\u201d), the missing and military ballots, a variety of other serious flaws and the six million votes cast, there really was no objective reality of the matter.\n\nLater when the Florida Supreme Court weighed in, Chief Justice Charles T. Wells cited me in his dissent from the majority decision of the rest of his court to allow for a manual recount of the undervote in Florida. Summarizing the legal maneuverings, I simply note that in part because of Wells\u2019s dissent the ongoing recount was discontinued, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and George Bush was (s)elected president.\n\nSpecifically, Judge Wells wrote, \u201cI agree with a quote by John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, \u2018the margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, no matter who wins.\u2019 Further judicial process will not change this self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder.\u201d (Incidentally, the CNN senior political analyst at the time, Jeff Greenfield, cited the quote in his book on the 2000 presidential election, \u201cOh, Waiter! One Order of Crow!,\u201d and wrote, \u201cThe single wisest word about Florida was delivered not by a pundit but by mathematician John Allen Paulos.\u201d I doubt, however, that Greenfield thought it was reason to stop the recount.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifteen years ago, a Florida judge cited my stats theory and the recount ended.
