You'd think with all the members of organized crime, abandoned cars and general debris in New York's Hudson River that someone might turn, you know, a blind eye if hypothetically someone was making a movie which involved a van flying into the river.

But the producers of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which opened this weekend, were amazed at the hoops they had to go through to perform a stunt which involved a police van making a pronounced dive into the murky depths.

"It was quite difficult, we had to get extensive permission from the city," says producer Mace Neufeld, who had produced all five of the Jack Ryan films.

When it came time for the stunt, the crew had to have two tug boats standing by to immediately move the vehicle pronto. "I have never seen anyone remove a car so quickly, it hit the water and it was then out the water in a half-hour," says Neufeld laughing. "They are trying to keep that river clean."
