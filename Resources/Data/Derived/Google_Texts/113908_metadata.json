Unfortunately, the answer, for too many of our nation\u2019s children, is: \u201cNot very well.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. is the world\u2019s wealthiest country, we rank 26th in child well-being. Children in Italy, Estonia and Slovakia all fare better than ours. Back in 1970 \u2014 a year after we put the first man on the moon \u2014 we ranked first in high school graduation rate. Today, we\u2019ve fallen to 23rd.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwenty-third is also where my home state of Ohio sits in overall child wellbeing among the 50 states, according to the annual Kids Count rankings.\n\nThe richest democracy in the world ought to do better.\n\nFortunately, we can. One part of the solution lies within our grasp: paid family leave. Moms who have the time to recover from childbirth without fearing for their economic security are less likely to suffer anxiety and depression, and dads who take leave tend become more involved with their children.\n\nThe benefit for children can be seen in their long-term mental and physical health: Parental leave is linked to lower rates of infant and child mortality and to improved cognitive development in children.\n\nEven businesses benefit from paid family leave, with reduced turnover and increased productivity. In California, one of three states already providing paid maternity leave, 90 percent of businesses report positive or neutral effects.\n\nBut here\u2019s a sad truth: the United States is the only rich or middle-income country on the planet that doesn\u2019t guarantee any paid parental leave by federal law. Germany provides 15 months of maternal or parental leave; Hungary offers two years.\n\nIn contrast, we ask parents to make a trade-off that betrays the family values so many of our leaders profess. We tell mothers, \u201cYou can take time to recover from childbirth, bond with and nurture your new baby, but you\u2019ll have to forfeit your pay and perhaps even your job.\u201d As a result, nearly one in four new mothers reports going back to work less than two weeks after giving birth. Fathers are often left with even fewer options if they choose to take time after the birth of a child.\n\nWhen did it become OK here in the United States to make parents choose between growing their families and keeping their jobs?\n\nThat\u2019s why I co-sponsored the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, introduced by my Senate colleague -Kirsten -Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and in the House by Rep. -Rosa -DeLauro (D-Conn.). The FAMILY Act would help working families care for a new baby or deal with a serious health condition faced by a family member by providing workers with up to 12 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds of their pay, up to a maximum of $4,000 per month. It builds on what works, extending our nation\u2019s most effective antipoverty program for seniors and disabled workers to also cover paid family medical leave.\n\nTo help raise awareness of the importance of family leave, Gillibrand and I \u2014 along with Sen. Patty Murray Patty MurrayFeds can learn lessons from states about using data to inform policy Lawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds MORE (D-Wash.), DeLauro and Rep.

At the same time, it can be like the dice are loaded against them.\u201d\n\nThe result is parental anxiety and stress \u2014 stress that, as shown by the 20-year -Wisconsin Study of Families and Work and other scientific studies highlighted in \u201cThe Raising of America,\u201d can literally alter their young children\u2019s developing brains.\n\nThe consequences can be devastating, not only for their future emotional and physical health but for the future health, prosperity and equity of the nation. By underinvesting in parents and early childhood, we are also underdeveloping America.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late. There\u2019s still time to change direction. Let\u2019s start by asking how organizations, communities, states and the nation can better help moms and dads be the parents they want to be and improve every child\u2019s chances to realize his or her greatest potential.\n\nLet\u2019s start by passing the FAMILY Act.\n\nBrown is Ohio\u2019s senior senator, serving since 2007.
