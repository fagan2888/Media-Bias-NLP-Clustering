Mississippi authorities say a gun shop owner and his 17-year-old son died in a shootout over a $25 service charge. Another man and his 29-year-old son are hospitalized.

Pearl River County Sheriff David Allison tells news outlets investigators don't know whether the customers or the owners started the shooting Saturday at McLemore Gun Shop near Picayune.

He tells The Sun Herald they're trying to figure out just what happened before filing any charges.

Neither he nor Chief Deputy Shane Tucker was available for comment when The Associated Press called for an update Sunday.

Allison tells WJTV and WLOX-TV that the customers came to pick up a gun and got angry because there was a $25 service charge even though the gun had not been fixed.
