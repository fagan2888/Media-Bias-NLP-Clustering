In an organization twice as big, there will be less of that and it will allow me to focus on being the face and voice of the agency,\" Lee said.\n\nLee said as a leader he prides himself on operational excellence and hopes to implement similar strategies he learned from Willmar at Central Minnesota Mental Health Center.\n\nAlso a major focus for Lee is implementing what he considers to be the triple aim of the Affordable Care Act: better care and better patient experience done more efficiently.\n\n\"Unless we do a considerably better job of providing for people with mental illness we will not achieve the triple aim,\" Lee said. \"And Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has a very robust commitment to it.\"\n\nLee has spent over two decades with Woodland Centers, serving first as a staff psychologist, then clinical director before becoming CEO. He will take over duties at Central Minnesota Mental Health Center from interim Executive Director Cathy LaGow.\n\nCentral Minnesota Health Center serves Stearns, Benton, Sherburne and Wright counties with locations in St. Cloud, Monticello, Buffalo and Elk River. The facility employs over 350 people.\n\nFollow Vicki Ikeogu on Twitter @VickiSCTimes or call her at 259-3662.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/money/2016/01/06/new-executive-director-named-mental-health-center/78326968/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has named Richard Lee its new executive director", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has named Richard Lee its new executive director", "title": "New executive director named for mental health center", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/money/2016/01/06/new-executive-director-named-mental-health-center/78326968/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has named Richard Lee its new executive director", "title": "New executive director named for mental health center", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3a1fd026cf9d69e90282338458077b92b7cba3e/c=0-32-498-530&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/06/StCloud/StCloud/635876741539692716-Richard-Lee-Central-Minn.-Mental-Health-Center.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/sctimesvicki"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Dr. Richard Lee, Richard Lee, Rick Lee, Central Minnesota Mental Health Center, Woodland Centers, Willmar, St. Cloud, Monticello, Buffalo, Elk River"}, "article_summary": "He will take over duties at Central Minnesota Mental Health Center from interim Executive Director Cathy LaGow.\nRichard Lee (Photo: Submitted photo)Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has appointed a new executive director after a vacancy of nearly one year.\n\"But Central Minnesota Mental Health Center is twice as big.\"\nRichard Lee, chief executive officer of Woodland Centers in Willmar, will assume his new role at Central Minnesota Mental Health Center on Feb. 1.\n\"And Central Minnesota Mental Health Center has a very robust commitment to it.\""}
