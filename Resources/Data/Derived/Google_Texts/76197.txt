ANNAPOLIS — Anne Arundel Medical Center announces Maulik Joshi as the new executive vice president of Integrated Care Delivery and chief operating officer. Maulik comes to AAMC from the American Hospital Association in Chicago, where he served as associate executive vice president and president of the Health Research and Educational Trust.

“We are thrilled to welcome Maulik. This ‘next-generation COO’ is a new, transformational position for our organization, and one that I believe will help us continue to build on our successes as healthcare delivery channels continue to evolve under the Affordable Care Act and Maryland’s all-payer system,” said Tori Bayless, AAMC’s president and CEO. “He will help us implement and streamline best practices in health care delivery as we continue to develop our capabilities in population health while maintaining our focus on providing the highest quality, patient-centered care.”

In addition to his work with the AHA, Maulik brings vast and varied healthcare experience, making him ideally suited for this new role. A published author on the topic of health care transformation, his leadership and experience with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Delmarva Foundation, Institute for Healthcare Improvement and University of Pennsylvania Health System are invaluable.

Maulik has a doctorate in public health and a master’s in health services administration from the University of Michigan and a bachelor of science in mathematics from Lafayette College.

He served on the Board of Trustees for Anne Arundel Medical Center, the Board Quality and Patient Safety Committee for Mercy Health System, the Health Outcomes Committee for Advocate Health Care, and was the treasurer of the Board of Trustees for the Center for Advancing Health.
