If we screw that up, we will have committed a massive sin.\u201d\n\nThe council was reacting to a report from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and commissioned by the Legislature that placed the upfront cost of augmenting the depleted lake at roughly $50 million to $100 million.\n\nAmong the questions: who would pay for ongoing operations, oversee the project and pick up the bill even if the state helped with initial costs.\n\nSaid Council Member Doug Biehn: \u201cThis didn\u2019t start happening until outer suburbs, the Woodburys and Lino Lakes, started developing. \u2026 The cost should be shared.\u201d\n\nMembers of the local group pushing the project, including lake owners, have said it\u2019s doubtful anything will happen unless costs can be reduced.\n\nDavid Peterson\n\nCARVER\n\nCity judges Village Hall unsafe, closes building\n\nThe city of Carver on Thursday closed its Village Hall after a roof inspection deemed the building a safety risk.\n\nWith heavy snow in recent weeks, the city had set up a monitoring system on the building\u2019s roof. Officials first noticed a problem when gutters were installed.\n\nBut the roof is just one concern, City Administrator Brent Mareck said. There are strong indications that there are other structural issues with the building, he said.\n\nThe 3,200-square-foot hall opened in 1957. It\u2019s used for recreational programs, local events and city elections, Mareck said.\n\nThe Carver City Council will discuss plans for the building at its meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 16.\n\nbeatrice dupuy\n\nHENNEPIN COUNTY\n\nEight projects get $1.2 million in county grants\n\nThe Hennepin County Board last week awarded $1.2 million in environmental grants to clean up contaminated sites for eight projects:\n\n\u2022 City of Mound Housing and Redevelopment Authority, $390,982 to remove asbestos and lead paint for renovated affordable rental housing.\n\n\u2022 Hennepin County Resident and Real Estate Services, $250,000 to raze polluted buildings on a former factory site in Minneapolis.\n\n\u2022 Minnesota Brownfields, $200,000 to fund environmental grants for cities and nonprofit groups.\n\n\u2022 City of Golden Valley, $152,000 to clean up soil at the DeCola Ponds Project, where stormwater management structures will be built.\n\n\u2022 City of Lakes Community Land Trust, $115,000 to remove asbestos and lead paint for renovated houses.\n\n\u2022 Perspectives Inc., $61,000 to clean up soil at a family center.\n\n\u2022 Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, $50,000 to dispose of contaminated soil excavated for a biking and walking path along the river.\n\n\u2022 City of St. Louis Park, $50,000 to clean up soil for expansion of an outdoor recreation center.\n\nKEVIN DUCHSCHERE\n\nWAYZATA\n\nLocal sailor honored for musical performance\n\nA Wayzata native who plays percussion with the U.S. Navy Band received the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal this month.\n\nChief Musician Randy Johnson, who attended Wayzata High School in Plymouth, received the award for his superior performance as command sponsor coordinator.
