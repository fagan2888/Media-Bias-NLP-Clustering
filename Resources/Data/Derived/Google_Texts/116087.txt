ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - Michigan running back De’Veon Smith seems to have survived a scare.

Smith’s right ankle was injured on a run in a 31-0 win over No. 22 BYU on Saturday and he didn’t return to the game.

He limped off the field, barely putting weight on his right foot. He was later taken across the field on a cart to the locker room, where X-rays were negative.

“I’m feeling good,” Smith said. “I got a little banged up, but it’s not a big deal.”

Smith had run for 125 yards on 16 carries, including a tackle-breaking, 60-yard touchdown, against the Cougars. He leads the Wolverines (3-1) with 331 yards rushing and four TDs.

“Yes, I expect to play next week,” Smith said.

Michigan opens Big Ten play at Maryland.
