Readmissions hovered around 19 percent of all hospital admissions from 2007 to 2011, then dropped to 18.5 percent in 2012 and dipped below 18 percent in 2013, according to CMS.\n\nThat rate is too high, according to Dan Hogan, CEO of Medalogix, a fledgling healthcare analytics firm based in Nashville, Tenn., in part because the incentive to coordinate and provide post-discharge care isn\u2019t all that great.\n\nWhen CMS first started penalizing hospitals in 2012 for preventable readmissions, the payment adjustment was no more than 1 percent. It has since grown to a maximum of 3 percent, but that still may not be much of a hammer. \u201cEven today, a 3 percent penalty won\u2019t deter large hospitals,\u201d Hogan told MedCity News.\n\nCMS has announced that it will base 95 percent of all Medicare fee-for-service payments on outcomes or efficiency by 2018. That, along with similar initiatives among private payers, should make a difference. \u201cI think everybody is coming to the realization that alternative payment models will be the way of the world in the next five years,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nAnother thing that could lower readmissions, according to Hogan, is greater use of palliative and hospice care, which saves money and improves quality of life compared to long-term hospitalization for people who are dying. In 2013, Medicare spent $170 billion on care in the last six months of life, or 28 percent of total Medicare spending of $554 billion.\n\nFor this reason, four-year-old Medalogix has invested in analytics of mortality rates related to readmissions. \u201cWhen we started, we were just delivering risk stratification,\u201d Hogan said. Recently, the company has hired more clinicians to manage patients. Medalogix also is pushing clinical decision support, which Hogan said is underutilized in healthcare in general and \u201calmost nonexistent in home health.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Medalogix Touch analytics engine for home health agencies pulls from electronic health records to identify post-acute patients at the highest risk of hospital readmission. Medalogix reported in April that home health providers using this technology saw transfers to inpatient care fall by 20.1 percent in seven months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the evolution of the electronic medical record,\u201d Hogan said. EMRs started out as a mechanism for hospitals to capture charges and bill insurance companies. Soon, according to Hogan, EMRs will be integrating clinical decision support, particularly in post-acute care.\n\nPhoto: National Center for Policy Analysis", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Medicare hospital readmissions rate remains high, according to Dan Hogan, CEO of Medalogix, a fledgling healthcare analytics firm based in Nashville, Tenn., in part because the incentive to coordinate and provide post-discharge care isn't all that great.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The Medicare hospital readmissions rate remains high, according to Dan Hogan, CEO of Medalogix, a fledgling healthcare analytics firm based in Nashville, Tenn., in part because the incentive to coordinate and provide post-discharge care isn't all that great.", "title": "Medalogix: Cut hospital readmissions by focusing on post-acute care", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Readmissions-art.png", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/08/medalogix-hospital-readmissions-post-acute-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Readmissions-art.png", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "The Medicare hospital readmissions rate remains high, according to Dan Hogan, CEO of Medalogix, a fledgling healthcare analytics firm based in Nashville, Tenn., in part because the incentive to coordinate and provide post-discharge care isn't all that great.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cut hospital readmissions by focusing on post-acute care"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, home health, hospital readmissions, Medalogix, Medicare, Nashville, Tennessee, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Tennessee", "published_time": "2015-08-21T17:51:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEven today, a 3 percent penalty won\u2019t deter large hospitals,\u201d Hogan told MedCity News.\nWhen CMS first started penalizing hospitals in 2012 for preventable readmissions, the payment adjustment was no more than 1 percent.\nSoon, according to Hogan, EMRs will be integrating clinical decision support, particularly in post-acute care.\nFor this reason, four-year-old Medalogix has invested in analytics of mortality rates related to readmissions.\nReadmissions hovered around 19 percent of all hospital admissions from 2007 to 2011, then dropped to 18.5 percent in 2012 and dipped below 18 percent in 2013, according to CMS."}
