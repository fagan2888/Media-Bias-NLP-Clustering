Both Kirsten Powers and Ron Fournier have spent the last day offering cris des coeurs over the incompetence of the White House, as the National Journal columnist did yesterday and Powers did last night on Fox News Special Report (via RCP and Truth Revolt):\n\nKIRSTEN POWERS: Well, I think his explanation is probably the true explanation, that they need to do this, but at the same time, it\u2019s now gotten to the point where it seems like there\u2019s an exemption made for pretty much everybody except for individuals. A lot of people who have really been screwed over by the law, you know, who are left without insurance or with extremely expensive insurance. So, I think that Ron Fournier of The National Journal wrote something that ran today about \u2014 BRET BAIER: This was after he expressed himself last night on the panel. POWERS: The headline is why I\u2019m getting tired of defending Obamacare. And I\u2019m going to say amen, brother, because it\u2019s exactly how I feel. People who have supported the law, who support universal health care, are constantly put in the position of having to defend this president, who has really incompetently put this together, rolled it out, and that\u2019s why he has to do this. It\u2019s why he has to keep doing this, because it\u2019s not working.\n\nThe objection from both assumes that this project had a hope of succeeding in the first place. Let\u2019s not forget that ObamaCare passed nearly four years ago, and HHS had 42 months of lead time until its rollout date. Four months after that, the White House keeps shifting deadlines, plainly to avoid the political consequences of its utter failure and ineptitude. How long is long enough to climb off the bandwagon?\n\nFournier\u2019s argument on that question rests on a supposed lack of alternatives:\n\nI want the ACA to work because the GOP has not offered a serious alternative that can pass Congress.\n\nThat, however, is a circular argument \u2014 because a Congress controlled by Democrats in one chamber will not pass any kind of replacement for ObamaCare, no matter how \u201cserious\u201d or workable it might be. Harry Reid wouldn\u2019t even bring it onto the agenda, let alone schedule a floor vote, and Democrats would close ranks with the White House even if he did. Fournier\u2019s argument boils down to the acceptance that Democrats won\u2019t change their minds, so we may as well keep cheering on the failure, and hope that the incompetents that produced it over four years can fix it in six months. That\u2019s absurd, but it\u2019s the final fig leaf for less-partisan supporters of ObamaCare.\n\nFournier\u2019s colleague Sam Baker argues that Obama\u2019s doing most of the damage to his law now, not Republicans:\n\nRepublicans have done everything they can think of to strike down Obamacare, but they\u2019ve still only managed to come in second place. For all the House votes to repeal, defund, or weaken Obamacare, some of the most significant setbacks for the law have come from the administration itself. Monday\u2019s delay in the law\u2019s employer mandate was just the latest in a series of self-inflicted wounds, just like the HealthCare.gov launch and delays in several programs that simply weren\u2019t ready for prime time. To be clear, the self-inflicted wounds haven\u2019t been fatal. Obamacare is moving forward\u2014and the doomsayers\u2019 prophecies have fallen flat: People are signing up, premiums are lower than expected, and the law\u2019s basic survival is assured. It gets stronger every month as more people pour into new insurance marketplaces in each state. But the law does have a specific vision of the future of health insurance. And to hit that vision, it relies on a delicate balance of popular carrots\u2014think coverage for those with preexisting conditions\u2014and unpopular sticks, such as the ever-controversial individual mandate. And the administration keeps chipping away at unpopular parts\u2014sometimes directly, and sometimes by handing Republicans a political weapon.\n\nBy the way, who\u2019s going to fix the website, which defenders have mostly cited as the main obstacle on the path to Nirvana? The names have changed, but the faces look awfully familiar:\n\nAfter denigrating the work of CGI and replacing it as the largest contractor on the federal health care website, the Obama administration is negotiating with the company to extend its work on the project for a few months. And the new prime contractor, Accenture, is trying to recruit and hire CGI employees to work under its supervision.\n\nI\u2019m sure that will work out well\u2026\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Don\u2019t bother.", "title": "Powers: I\u2019m getting tired of defending ObamaCare, too", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/12/powers-im-getting-tired-of-defending-obamacare-too/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8QVD538A0YY/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/8QVD538A0YY/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-12T17:01:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T18:34:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, CGI Federal, delays, incompetence, Kirsten Powers, ObamaCare, Ron Fournier,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0245\"", "article_summary": "Powers: I\u2019m getting tired of defending ObamaCare, tooposted at 12:01 pm on February 12, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyThe obvious question, then, is \u2026 why continue?\nPOWERS: The headline is why I\u2019m getting tired of defending Obamacare.\nFour months after that, the White House keeps shifting deadlines, plainly to avoid the political consequences of its utter failure and ineptitude.\nHarry Reid wouldn\u2019t even bring it onto the agenda, let alone schedule a floor vote, and Democrats would close ranks with the White House even if he did.\nLet\u2019s not forget that ObamaCare passed nearly four years ago, and HHS had 42 months of lead time until its rollout date."}
