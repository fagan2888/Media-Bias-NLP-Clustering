This article discusses the decision of the federal district court in Marin v. Dave & Buster\u2019s, Inc., No. 15 Civ. 3608 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18086 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2016).\n\nIn Marin, the court denied a defendant employer\u2019s request to dismiss a lawsuit alleging acts of discrimination in violation of Section 510 of ERISA. Plaintiff, a former employee of defendant suing on behalf of herself and a purported class, alleged that defendant intentionally interfered with her ability, and that of other employees, to obtain healthcare coverage under defendant\u2019s group health plan by reducing their scheduled work hours.\n\nUnder the ACA\u2019s \u201cplay-or-pay\u201d employer mandate, an \u201capplicable large employer\u201d must offer health insurance coverage to its \u201cfull-time\u201d employees \u2212 those employed an average of at least 30 hours per week \u2212 or else be subject to penalties. Some employers have considered reducing employees\u2019 hours to below the 30-hour threshold in order to avoid having to offer health insurance to them.\n\nERISA Section 510 makes it unlawful for any person, among other things, to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan \u201cfor the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.\u201d Marin appears to be the first reported case questioning whether an employer can be liable under Section 510 if it reduces employees\u2019 hours in order to avoid the ACA mandate.\n\nThe Complaint\n\nIn May 2015, Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin filed a purported class-action lawsuit against her former employer, Dave & Buster\u2019s, Inc. (Dave & Buster\u2019s), alleging that it violated Section 510 by reducing her hours so that it could reduce the number of its full-time employees.\n\nIn her complaint, plaintiff alleged that she was hired as a full-time employee in August 2006 and worked approximately 30 to 45 hours a week for seven years. During that time, she was eligible for and received health insurance coverage under Dave & Buster\u2019s group health plan. She also alleged that in 2013, Dave & Buster\u2019s designed and implemented a nationwide effort to \u201cright-size,\u201d or rebalance, the number of full-time to part-time workers that it employed. Specifically, she alleged that Dave & Buster\u2019s:\n\nheld employee meetings to communicate their intention to cut the number of full-time employees \u201cto avoid increasing health care costs\u201d;\n\ntold a reporter that they were \u201cin the process of adapting to upcoming changes associated with health care reform\u201d;\n\nnoted in public filings that \u201c[p]roviding health insurance benefits to employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits we currently provide \u2026 to a potentially larger proportion of our employees \u2026 will increase our expenses\u201d; and\n\nstated in a letter to plaintiff\u2019s attorney that reducing her hours was part of a nationwide program to \u201cright-size\u201d the number of company full-time and part-time employees.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that her hours were reduced to 10 to 25 hours a week from August 2013 to February 2014 and that in March of 2014, Dave and Buster\u2019s notified her that she was no longer eligible to participate in its group health plan because she was no longer a full-time employee averaging 30 hours or more per week.\n\nThe complaint seeks, on behalf of plaintiff and the class, restitution for lost wages and benefits, with interest, from the date of the reduction of their hours and benefits.\n\nThe Motion to Dismiss\n\nIn February, the district court denied Dave & Buster\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a legally sufficient claim under Section 510. In the motion, Dave & Buster\u2019s argued that plaintiff was not entitled to future benefits under the health plan and, therefore, could not sustain a claim under Section 510 because she was alleging only loss of an opportunity to accrue future or additional benefits.\n\nIn its decision, the court explained that the critical element in a Section 510 claim is the intent of the employer. In other words, did the employer intend to interfere with benefits? The court noted that (i) plaintiff alleged that Dave and Buster\u2019s alleged discrimination affected her current benefits, in addition to interfering with her ability to attain future benefit rights; and (ii) her claim arose from the employer's unlawful motivation, acting to interfere with either the exercise or the accrual of benefits to which plaintiff \u201cmay become entitled.\u201d The court was required, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, to accept that the factual allegations in the complaint would be proved. It therefore concluded that the complaint stated a plausible and legally sufficient claim for relief that Dave & Buster\u2019s interfered with plaintiff\u2019s current healthcare coverage, in addition to interfering with her ability to attain future benefits.\n\nThe court noted that Dave & Buster\u2019s\u2019 reliance on prior summary judgment opinions issued by the court and the Second Circuit was premature at this stage of the case. As a result, the case will proceed into discovery. The court has yet to consider whether the class that plaintiff purports to represent is entitled to be certified.\n\nOther Cases in the Second Circuit\n\nThe courts in several cases in the Second Circuit have ruled in favor of employers in connection with Section 510 claims.\n\nIn Dister v. Cont\u2019l Grp, Inc., 859 F.2d 1108 (2d Cir. 1988), the court of appeals affirmed a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer, finding that no reasonable jury could find that the employer intentionally fired a complaining employee to interfere with his ability to obtain certain retirement plan benefits because there was insufficient evidence presented that the employer had a discriminatory motive for terminating him.\n\nIn Kelly v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 717 F. Supp. 227 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), the district court granted summary judgment for an employer because the complaining employee\u2019s claim that he was prevented from enjoying a future benefit, not created at the time of his discharge, was not a cognizable claim under Section 510.\n\nIn Gioia v. Forbes Media LLC, 501 Fed.Appx. 52 (2d Cir. 2012), the court of appeals affirmed a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer who was accused of violating Section 510 because it laid off employees who, as a result, had their group health insurance benefits terminated. The Second Circuit affirmed the ruling because plaintiffs, executors of the estate of a deceased former employee, did not present evidence that the employer who made the decision to lay off the employees had knowledge of the decedent\u2019s health insurance claims or claim history.\n\nPlaintiffs argued that the employer hired new employees around the same time as the layoff, which would undercut the employer\u2019s claim that the layoff was part of an effort by it to reduce costs. However, on review of the record, the Second Circuit found that those new employees filled different, pre-existing positions, and that the decedent was only one of a group of employees in the same group who were laid off during that time.\n\nAs to an email presented as evidence in which the supervisor of the decedent discussed allocation of responsibilities after the layoff to a reduced staff, the Second Circuit found that it failed to establish a genuine issue of fact because there was no suggestion in the email that there was an intent on the supervisors\u2019 part to terminate the complaining employee to cut healthcare costs.\n\nEmployer Takeaways\n\nThough the Marin case calls into question whether an employer can lawfully manage the hours of its workforce in light of the increased costs of providing healthcare coverage under the ACA, it is important to note that the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case does not provide an answer. Rather, with this ruling, the issue is one step closer to being addressed by the court.\n\nAs Marin unfolds, employers should be aware that similar litigation may surface. In the meantime, employers should carefully review, before distribution, all communications to employees regarding decisions to modify work schedules. This case demonstrates how such communications may bolster an employee\u2019s claims of discriminatory intent. In contrast, a careful coordination of disclosures accompanied by a well-crafted communications strategy can help to minimize the risk of future litigation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/can-the-aca-employer-health-insurance-76677/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jdsupra.com/showThumbnail.aspx?img=15495_226.jpg&size=og", "site_name": "JD Supra", "title": "Can the ACA Employer Health-Insurance Mandate Be Avoided by Reducing Employees\u2019 Hours?
