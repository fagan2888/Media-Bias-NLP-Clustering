The plans that they are losing are the \"mini-meds\" offered to low-paid part-time and hourly workers of restaurants, temp agencies, retail stores, and other such businesses.\n\nThese plans are in no way, shape, or form real health insurance. I\u2019ve seen some that top out at no more than a few thousand dollars a year. To be clear: That\u2019s NOT the deductible; it\u2019s the most the plan will pay in a year for all your medical care put together.\n\nIn an article on junk insurance last year, I included the story of Judy Goss, a woman from Michigan who had one such policy, from a Cigna subsidiary called Starbridge. It covered $3,000 a year in care, and when she was given a breast cancer diagnosis and needed $30,000 in immediate treatment, she had to put it off for three months until she got approved for a high-deductible Medicaid plan (available to her only because she had young children).\n\nThese plans never came close to meeting the standards of the new health care law, which required plans to have an annual cap on benefits of no less than two million dollars as of 2013, and to eliminate annual caps completely starting in 2014. The federal government gave more than 1,200 of the plans, covering 3.9 million people, special waivers to continue until the end of 2013, when, at last, their policyholders would have better alternatives.\n\nBy definition, these plans have been marketed to people with incomes that are almost certainly low enough to qualify for extremely generous marketplace premium subsidies, and also for cost-sharing subsidies that will lower deductibles to a few hundred dollars at most. Many will discover they can buy comprehensive coverage for not much more than the $65 a month that Judith Goss was paying for her inadequate policy.\n\nBut some of them still don\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve been effectively uninsured all this time, which is why they\u2019re angrily putting their notices on Mycancellation.com.\n\nSo to the Sears employee losing a Cigna Starbridge plan; the restaurant staff losing coverage from Aetna SRC, another major mini-med underwriter; the hourly employees of a business identified only as \u201cMathesen\u201d who are also losing Aetna SRC \u201ccoverage,\u201d and Willie (last name whited out), who\u2019s losing a Starbridge plan, here\u2019s my advice. Go out and raise a toast to your good luck in staying healthy enough that you never found out what terrible health insurance you had.\n\nThen hop on our free interactive tool, HealthLawHelper.org, to find out what your new options are. And get yourself some real health insurance.\n\np.s. A special demerit to Cigna, who drafted the letter to Willie on his employer\u2019s behalf. They didn\u2019t even bother to mention that he should investigate replacement coverage on his state\u2019s health care marketplace. To their credit, the other employers did.\n\nGot a question for our health insurance expert? Ask it here. It helps if you include the state you live in.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Nancy Metcalf", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, HealthLawHelper, mini-meds, junk insurance, Cigna Starbridge, Aetna SRC, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Money", "Title": "Mini-Med Health Plans Are Being Canceled - Consumer Reports News", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/11/mini-med-health-insurance-plans-being-canceled-at-last/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/magazine-articles/2012/March/CR032K12-Junk Health Goss-8490.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Mini-Med Health Plans Are Being Canceled - Consumer Reports News"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2013-11-06T17:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2013-11-06T16:58Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Mini-Med Health Plans Are Being Canceled - Consumer Reports News", "keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, HealthLawHelper, mini-meds, junk insurance, Cigna Starbridge, Aetna SRC, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Money", "contenttag": "Money", "description": "Cancellation notices are going out for mini-med group health insurance plans.
