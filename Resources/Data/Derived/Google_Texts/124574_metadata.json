While the top 0.1 percent of families in the United States possess as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, money psychologist Jamie Traege-Muney moaned to The Guardian that the movement wrongly \u201csingled out the 1 percent and painted them globally as something negative.\u201d\n\nBut a growing cadre of this statistical owning class are now crafting a healthier relationship to the rabble at their doorstep. Responding to Occupy and other movement moments, young people with wealth are organizing the resources of their peers and families to level the playing field \u2014 and support one another in the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I disagree that having wealth in this society is uncomfortable,\u201d said organizer and donor Farhad Ebrahimi. \u201cBut treating it is not about individual therapy or even engaging in philanthropy or charity. It\u2019s about collective action.\u201d As a teenager, Ebrahimi was gifted a pool of wealth from his high-tech entrepreneur father. Growing up Iranian-American during the Iran-Iraq war was part of a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that led him to punk rock and radical politics, though for years Ebrahimi continued to identify more as a musician than an organizer. It was only later that he would conjoin his background with his beliefs.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even 100 percent sure they were compatible at first,\u201d he explained. \u201cI approached philanthropy pretty agnostically in the beginning.\u201d Shortly after graduating from MIT in 2002, Ebrahimi founded the Chorus Foundation using $25 million of his personal money. Focused on funding projects to address climate change, Chorus is dedicated to \u201cworking for a just transition to a regenerative economy in the United States.\u201d And unlike other foundations, Chorus has a built-in expiration date: intending to spend out the entirety of its \u2014 and Ebrahimi\u2019s \u2014 reserves by 2024. While he expects another gift from his father at some point in the future, he says it will go toward a \u201cChorus Foundation Round Two\u201d with the same goal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to put myself out of business,\u201d Ebrahimi said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to create a world in which someone would not end up in my situation of having been gifted more money than I possibly know what to do with.\u201d\n\nAndrew Carnegie\u2019s \u201cGospel of Wealth,\u201d a bible of sorts for modern philanthropists, was penned at the height of the Gilded Age in 1889. Observing the continued accumulation and stratification of wealth that surrounded him, Carnegie declared it \u201ca waste of time to criticize the inevitable,\u201d seeing inequality \u2014 not unlike the contemporary economist Thomas Piketty \u2014 as a structural outcome of capitalism. He scorned the \u201csocialists or anarchists who seek to overturn present conditions,\u201d arguing that their plight \u201cis to be regarded as attacking the foundation upon which civilization itself rests.\u201d Much like Hillary Clinton did in last week\u2019s Democratic debate, Carnegie argued that the wealthy have to \u201csave capitalism from itself,\u201d ameliorating its worst excesses by choosing to redistribute their own surplus. In doing so, he called on his fellow industrialists to \u201cconsider how the foundation, as one of the [capitalist] system\u2019s most prominent offspring, might act most wisely to strengthen and improve its progenitor.\u201d\n\nOrganizer Abe Lateiner \u2014 who describes his giving as \u201cspiritual and empowering work\u201d \u2014 has a gospel that is noticeably distinct from Carnegie\u2019s. Confronting the idea that society\u2019s most well-off should pick which causes deserve funds, Lateiner warns that \u201cWriting checks by yourself on New Year\u2019s Eve is not liberating if you\u2019re doing whatyou think is best \u2014 which is exactly what got us here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe isolation thing is very real,\u201d Lateiner said of his affluent bretheren seeking wealth therapy. \u201cThere are very specific, non-material, damaging things that come with privilege.\u201d Excess resources, he explained, \u201care wonderful for our material well-being, but destroy the spirit [and] our ability to connect socially.\u201d\n\nHaving grown up in a \u201csolidly Democratic\u201d household, Lateiner\u2019s family never discussed money around the dinner table, and he struggled to explain his circumstances even to close friends. \u201cMy inability to talk about money or class on a personal level has definitely ruined relationships and cut off opportunities for relationships,\u201d Lateiner said. \u201cI mean that as friendships and romantic relationships and everything in between.\u201d Having taught for six years \u2014 something he described as \u201cthe best way, within my liberal framework, I could think of to give back\u201d \u2014 Lateiner came across an article in the New York Times in 2012 about young, socially conscious heirs, including Naomi Sobel and Resource Generation executive director Jessie Spector.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Influenced by Occupy Wall Street, these 1 percenters aren't wallowing in self-pity.
