His two goals and eight points in 30 games are unimportant compared to what has done with his 6-foot-3, 220-pound frame. He\u2019s unafraid of injury or retaliation and throws his big body around to create space and opportunity for his teammates. He\u2019s the depth power forward the Avalanche hoped he would become after signing him as an undrafted free agent last spring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 30 games now and it\u2019s been going well so far,\u201d Martinsen said Saturday after a 2-1 loss at Columbus. \u201cIt goes up and down but I feel that my game is more stable than it was at the beginning. I felt like I had a little down before (Thursday\u2019s) New Jersey game, a couple games when I didn\u2019t play my best, but I found a way to get back.\u201d\n\nMartinsen \u2014 one of two Norwegians currently playing in the NHL and the eighth all-time \u2014 is currently the left wing on Colorado\u2019s third line, with center Chris Wagner and future Hall of Famer Jarome Iginla on the right side. Martinsen began in the American Hockey League with the San Antonio Rampage before being called up Nov. 9 and making his NHL debut the following night at Philadelphia.\n\nMartinsen has two career fighting majors, both coming immediately after delivering big legal checks. He fought Chris Neil on Nov. 25 after crushing an Ottawa player against the boards. And he fought Arizona\u2019s Steve Downie after laying out one of Downie\u2019s teammates Dec. 27.\n\nHe won both fights, based on voting at hockeyfights.com.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going out there to fight guys. But obviously, I know if I throw around big hits someone is going to come up and say, \u2018That\u2019s not OK.\u2019 I know that,\u201d Martinsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is for me. I\u2019m a big guy and I know how to defend myself when that comes up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going out there to look for guys to fight. But if it happens, it happens.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andreas Martinsen throws weight around for Avalanche", "title": "Andreas Martinsen throws weight around for Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/andreas-martinsen-throws-weight-around-for-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117_024115_andreas-martinsen.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117_024115_andreas-martinsen.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T14:26:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:40:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going out there to look for guys to fight.\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba \u2014 Andreas Martinsen, the trail-blazing Avalanche rookie forward from Norway, was recently given permission to check out of the team-provided hotel and get his own place in the Denver area.\nHe\u2019s unafraid of injury or retaliation and throws his big body around to create space and opportunity for his teammates.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 30 games now and it\u2019s been going well so far,\u201d Martinsen said Saturday after a 2-1 loss at Columbus.\nMartinsen, 25, has been akin to a fabulous freshman in his maiden season in North America."}
