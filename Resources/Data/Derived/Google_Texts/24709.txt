Doctors who want to provide abortions will need admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, according to a bill filed by Rep. Mike Hill, R-Pensacola, the the News Service of Florida reports.

The proposal is similar to measures that have caused controversy in other states. According to the News Service, supporters say that it provides safety for patients, but critics say that the measure is designed only to make it more difficult to provide abortions.

Meanwhile, a Lakeland legislator wants to require hospitals to notify doctors of plans to close obstetrical departments 120 days in advance, according to the News Service of Florida. A bill filed last week by State Rep. Colleen Burton, R-Lakeland, is similar to a measure that passed the Senate last year but died in the House.
