It\u2019s A Good Deal For Small Business Workers\n\nPresident Obama began his speech thanking small businesses for their role in the U.S. economy. While short on details of how the trade deal would help the businesses (as TPP negotiations are still being held behind closed doors), the president spoke repeatedly about the importance of small businesses in the Pacific Northwest and Oregon.\n\n\n\nThe president pointed to Portland\u2019s Egg Press, saying the greeting card company would benefit from the TPP by expanding their operations in Australia.\n\n\n\nObama also put a plug in for the Oregon beef industry.\n\nAlan Sylvestre/OPB\n\n2. Obama Asked For Trust During Closed Door Talks\n\nWith ongoing negotiations classified, President Obama couldn\u2019t talk about the specific policies of the TPP. Instead, he made a strong personal case that he had the people of the U.S. \u2013 and not big businesses \u2013 in mind while crafting this deal.\n\nAlong with his push for the Affordable Care Act, Obama cited months of strong job numbers, the spirit of the American people, and \u201csome pretty good policies from my administration\u201d as the reason the U.S. should trust his administration.\n\n\n\nCalling the TPP \u201cthe most progressive trade agreement in history,\u201d Obama appealed to the liberal wing of his party, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere have been a bunch of critics,\u201d the president said. \u201cTypically, they\u2019re my friends coming from my party. On this one, they\u2019re like, whooping on me.\u201d\n\n\n\nSen. Warren and other have expressed concern with the deal, comparing it often to the unpopular North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn this issue, on trade, I think some of my dearest friends are wrong,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re also upset with the secret nature of the negotiations.\n\n\n\nThe president noted that when the negotiations are finalized, the proposed TPP will have to be posted online at least 60 days before Congress can act.\n\n3. This Isn\u2019t NAFTA\n\n\u201cI was just getting out of law school when NAFTA got passed,\u201d the president quipped, noting that the trade agreement was approved more than 20 years ago.\n\n\n\nObama repeatedly voiced his belief that NAFTA was flawed trade policy.\n\n\n\n\u201cPast trade agreements didn\u2019t always reflect our values or do enough to protect American workers,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe president said the TPP would include protections to ensure that child labor, environmental protections and working conditions would be dramatically improved in the 12-country agreement.\n\n\n\nAlan Sylvestre/OPB\n\nObama responded by arguing the labor movement would gain a stronger foothold in countries such as Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnder this agreement, Vietnam would have to raise its labor standards,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt moves us in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also said businesses looking for countries with cheap labor and bad environmental standards \u201calready left\u201d the U.S.\n\n4. This Agreement Is About Maintaining American Trade Power\n\nDirectly addressing the current isolationist streak emerging in American politics, Obama made an argument that rejecting the TPP is a rejection of America\u2019s economic dominance.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome folks think we should just withdrawal.\u2026 I disagree,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy, and we should do it today. Because if we don\u2019t write the rules for trade around the world\u2026guess what? China will.\u201d\n\n\n\nChina is not yet included in the TPP, but is widely expected to join at some point in the future.\n\n5. The TPP Helps Middle Class People\n\nThroughout the speech, President Obama wove in his belief that the middle class will benefit from the TPP.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the rules are fair, we win every time,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe described the TPP as setting a level trade field, and said that the pact would bring advanced manufacturing jobs to the U.S., along with protections for the environment and children.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust do it,\u201d the president concluded, a shout-out to the long running Nike slogan.", "article_metadata": {"author": "John Sepulvado", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/blog/newsblog/five-points-from-president-obamas-portland-speech/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north,h_300,q_90,w_400/Obama_27_np0uzw.jpg", "description": "During his roughly 45-minute speech on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, the president appeared loose and in his element at the home of the sporting apparel manufacturer.", "title": "Five Points From President Obama's Portland Speech"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>During his roughly 45-minute speech on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, the president appeared loose and in his element at the home of the sporting apparel manufacturer.</p>", "title": "Five Points From President Obama's Portland Speech", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,g_north,h_348,q_90,w_620/Obama_27_np0uzw.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The TPP Helps Middle Class PeopleThroughout the speech, President Obama wove in his belief that the middle class will benefit from the TPP.\n\u201cHello Oregon,\u201d President Obama said as he took the stage at the Nike headquarters outside of Beaverton.\nPresident Barack Obama delivered a speech about the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement in May at Nike's world headquarters near Beaverton.\nObama Asked For Trust During Closed Door TalksWith ongoing negotiations classified, President Obama couldn\u2019t talk about the specific policies of the TPP.\nIt\u2019s A Good Deal For Small Business WorkersPresident Obama began his speech thanking small businesses for their role in the U.S. economy."}
