L. Mencken once remarked that \u201cThe truly civilized man is always skeptical and tolerant.\u201d Although he never pinned his ideological colors to the mast, it is little wonder that Mencken has become the \u201cwittiest defender of liberty,\u201d revered in libertarian circles for his belief in the virtues of free will, the tolerance of the market, and the skepticism of good intentions. It\u2019s a stance that\u2019s distinctly lacking in our politics today, but one of great value.\n\nFor example, these traits appear to have disappeared in the discussion of CVS Caremark\u2019s decision to cease selling cigarettes and other tobacco products, effective October 1. According to Larry J. Merlo, President and CEO of CVS Caremark, the sale of tobacco products was \u201cinconsistent with our purpose\u201d and discontinuing their sale was \u201cthe right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact this obviously reins in consumer choice, as a private company CVS obviously has every right to take such action. In a blog post, Reason\u2019s Nick Gillespie praised the company, adding \u201cthat we should let people make more decisions about their lives, their loves, and their businesses.\u201d Amen to that \u2014 and long may it last. However, there is an ugly underbelly to this move.\n\nThe widespread consensus that CVS decided to benevolently forego the $2 billion in annual tobacco sales might not be what it\u2019s cracked out to be. Firstly, Dr. Troyen Brennan, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, stated that \u201cCVS Caremark believes that now is the time for retailers, perhaps spurred by policy makers, to eliminate sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products by institutions that also have pharmacies.\u201d CVS isn\u2019t merely taking voluntary action, they\u2019re also publicly calling for coercive measures to undermine the business models of their competitors and the integrity of consumer choice. And that\u2019s something to celebrate?\n\nWhether this has been prompted by government isn\u2019t entirely clear, but with the lucrative Affordable Care Act and the carefully coordinated social media campaign with the White House, it certainly has some of the hallmarks of \u2018Blue Eagle\u2019-style corporatism. At least the skeptics among us won\u2019t be too surprised if government rules or Congress legislates that any pharmacy receiving government funds via Medicare or Medicaid can no longer sell products they deem unwholesome.\n\nBut the real concern here stems from the fact that CVS is taking this \u2018voluntary\u2019 move because they\u2019re simply replacing these lost revenues with fruits emanating from their hard fought battles to increase the size of government. Consumers lose choice; CVS will be compensated by their taxes. From the initial discussions around the Affordable Care Act to its eventual passage and botched implementation, CVS\u2019s lobbying team has been omnipresent \u2014 and increasingly aggressive. In fact the company more than doubled its lobbying expenditures in the third quarter of 2013 to nearly $5 million. Such massive investment isn\u2019t made to create a free market and enhance consumer choice. It\u2019s to ensure that government \u2014 not competition \u2014 is augmenting your bottom line.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ewan Watt", "description": "The company spent millions lobbying for Obamacare.
