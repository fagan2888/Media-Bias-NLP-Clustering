A producer behind the Super Bowl pregame and halftime shows has been tapped to head up production for next year’s Democratic National Convention.

Ricky Kirshner, an Emmy, Peabody and Edward R. Murrow Award winner, will serve as one of two executive producers for the 2016 convention in Philadelphia, the Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) announced Friday.

The production pro was behind Super Bowl performances that included Prince, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé and Bruno Mars. Kirshner also worked as executive producer for the 2008 and 2012 Democratic conventions.

Vicangelo Bulluck, who has a decade of experience producing the NAACP Image Awards, will also executive produce the convention, scheduled for July.

“I am honored to be working with Ricky and to be a part of the DNCC team,” Bulluck said in a statement. “This will be the most digitally-integrated convention in history, with a reach far beyond the walls of the convention hall.”
