Less government.\n\nRatcliffe is focused on the job he was sent to do for his more than 700,000 constituents. There were opportunities for Republican leadership to do a better job,\" he said. \"I believe that.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, then candidate Ratcliffe promised not to vote for John Boehner for Speaker of the House. On Jan. 6, Ratcliffe cast his vote for Boehner for Speaker of the House. \"Given the choices that I had at the time,\" Ratcliffe said, \"John Boehner was the best choice for Speaker.\"\n\nCurrently, Ratcliffe is remaining close to his Tea Party roots. He is co-sponsor of HR 596, a bill which if passed would repeal the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obama Care. Ratcliffe said this desperately needs to happen for people from his district.\n\n\"It's government at its worst,\" he said. \"It's intrusive, it's expensive, and it just doesn't work.\"\n\nRatcliffe's priorities are: Repeal the Affordable Act; secure the border; and grow the economy. His plan to accomplish these tasks are no-nonsense.\n\n\"What we need to do is cut spending, cut borrowing, cut taxes, cut entitlements,\" Ratcliffe said. \"That's how we'll restore fiscal sanity in this country.\"\n\nRatcliffe, acting as a member of the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, he wants to fix foreign relations he says President Obama has hurt. \"We've had a president that's had a schizophrenic foreign policy,\" he said. Ratcliffe added the president has strained relations with Israel and instead pursued relationships with countries that could hurt America.\n\nRatcliffe hopes to pass a border security bill, something he feels would not only help people from Texas, but keep all Americans safe.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "WASHINGTON -- John Ratcliffe, the 4th District Congressman, is the first Republican in Texas to unseat a sitting Republican.", "language": "english", "author": "Alex Miller", "og": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- John Ratcliffe, the 4th District Congressman, is the first Republican in Texas to unseat a sitting Republican.", "title": "Rep.
