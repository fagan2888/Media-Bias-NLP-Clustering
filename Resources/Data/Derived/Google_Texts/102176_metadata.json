Tavenner ran the government bureaucracy responsible for the inept rollout of HealthCare.gov, the promulgation of phony PPACA enrollment figures, and the handout of legally dubious waivers to Democrat-friendly donors. And, when Congress subpoenaed her emails\u2014stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before\u2014she discovered that they had somehow been deleted. Having thus committed as many blunders as can be reasonably expected of any incompetent apparatchik, she announced last Friday that she will depart next month.\n\nThe \u201cnews\u201d media have represented Tavenner as a casualty of Obamacare\u2019s disastrous launch, as if the mind-boggling mismanagement of its implementation can be attributed to some natural disaster. Her boss, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, actually praised her handling of the botched rollout: \u201cIt\u2019s a measure of her tenacity and dedication that after the tough initial rollout of HealthCare.gov, she helped right the ship.\u201d In reality, Tavenner and her underlings at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are responsible for running it aground. And, as Reuters reports, \u201ca team of outside experts got the website working.\u201d Not coincidentally, the leader of that team will replace her as acting CMS administrator.\n\nIf the inept rollout of HealthCare.gov were the only blot on Tavenner\u2019s escutcheon, it might be possible to have some sympathy for her. But her record of malfeasance is by no means limited to that exercise in bureaucratic incompetence. We are told by Jonathan Cohn (remember him?) that Tavenner\u2019s legacy includes a commitment to \u201ctransparency.\u201d The former New Republic writer evidently has a short memory. Not only was Tavenner one of at least twenty Obama administration officials who \u201cinadvertently\u201d deleted emails sought by congressional investigators, she was actually dumb enough to instruct a subordinate in writing to delete emails to the White House relating to the HealthCare.gov disaster.\n\nThe most ironic feature of this tawdry tale is that, as CMS administrator, Tavenner oversees enforcement of the \u201cSunshine Act.\u201d This is a provision of Obamacare ostensibly meant to ensure that physicians conduct business transactions with complete transparency. It requires manufacturers of medical products to report anything worth more than $10.00 that they have given a physician. If a software vendor takes your doctor out to lunch and buys him a steak, it must be reported to CMS. Failure to do so can result in penalties of up to $1 million. In other words, while Marilyn Tavenner instructed her staff to destroy their emails, she was in charge of keeping your physician and his business associates honest.\n\nNot that such hypocrisy began when Tavenner replaced Donald Berwick as CMS administrator. While the Obama administration was trying to get the hapless Dr. Berwick confirmed by the Senate, she was his Deputy Principal Administrator. According to a Politico piece from early 2011, \u201cHHS announced earlier this month it would move CCIIO under the administration of Marilyn Tavenner.\u201d CCIIO is an acronym for the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, the obscure bureaucracy that doled out the infamous Obamacare waivers to members of the Democrat donor base. In other words, the waiver scam was perpetrated by an agency under Tavenner\u2019s direct supervision.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that Tavenner\u2019s entire career has been accompanied by a miasma of corruption. Alleged journalists like Sara Kliff at Vox gush about Tavenner\u2019s beginnings as a nurse: \u201cMy favorite story about Tavenner\u2026 is one from her nursing days when she helped bring a patient back from the dead. Seriously.\u201d Oddly enough, Kliff and most of the \u201cnews\u201d media neglect to mention that she was also a high level executive at a for-profit hospital system when it was busy defrauding Medicare, and received a $1.5 billion fine for its trouble. Tavenner wasn\u2019t directly implicated in that particular Medicare scam, but it seems passing strange that corruption seems to follow her, like Mary\u2019s little lamb, wherever she goes.\n\nThe exercise in skullduggery that finally resulted in Tavenner\u2019s resignation from CMS, however, occurred just last year. When the White House and its media mouthpieces began claiming that the number of suckers who bought \u201ccoverage\u201d via PPACA exchanges would be the ultimate measurement of Obamacare\u2019s success, large sign-up figures became a major priority. The CMS administrator was tasked with producing a total that didn\u2019t leave the President or HHS Secretary Burwell with egg on their faces. And with the grim inevitability of Greek tragedy, as the immortal P.G. Wodehouse would have phrased it, the Obama administration duly claimed that eight million people had signed up through the exchanges.\n\nNo one with any sense believed them, of course. As Guy Benson put it, \u201c[T]he official numbers didn\u2019t account for duplicates, non-paying \u2018customers,\u2019 and consumer attrition\u2014not to mention the high percentage of \u2018new\u2019 enrollees who previously had insurance, but were forced to use Obamacare\u2019s exchanges to obtain plans after their existing arrangements were cancelled under the new law.\u201d Eventually the Obama administration revised the official figure down to 7.1 million. But the news got worse. As CNN reported, \u201cOnly 6.7 million Americans were enrolled in Obamacare health insurance plans \u2026 The higher figure the White House reported earlier included people who enrolled in stand-alone dental plans.\u201d\n\nAt this point, the President and Secretary Burwell looked in the mirror and saw a viscous yellow substance dripping from their chins. It was about that time that Marilyn Tavenner started thinking about spending more time with her family. She had violated the ostensible mission statement of the Obama administration: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201d In plain English, that means don\u2019t get caught. Nurse Tavenner was imprudent enough to get caught and, therefore, had to resign. Good riddance to bumbling bureaucrats.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe8a\"", "article_summary": "It was about that time that Marilyn Tavenner started thinking about spending more time with her family.\nMarilyn Tavenner, the Obama administration official who presided over Obamacare\u2019s worst debacles and most devious deceptions, has finally made an intelligent decision\u2014she resigned.\nIn other words, while Marilyn Tavenner instructed her staff to destroy their emails, she was in charge of keeping your physician and his business associates honest.\nShe had violated the ostensible mission statement of the Obama administration: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201d In plain English, that means don\u2019t get caught.\nWhile the Obama administration was trying to get the hapless Dr. Berwick confirmed by the Senate, she was his Deputy Principal Administrator."}
