At least last night, new host Jimmy Fallon provided an answer. After Barack Obama took a victory lap with the announcement of 7.1 million enrollments through the system by its March 31st deadline, Fallon responded by noting that \u201cit\u2019s amazing what you can achieve when you make something mandatory, and fine people if they don\u2019t do it \u2014 and keep extending the deadline for months\u201d:\n\nJust how solid are those numbers? Forbes\u2019 Avik Roy looks at an LA Times report of a RAND study, and concludes that any celebration is premature at the very least:\n\nIf you\u2019ve been a regular reader of this space, you know that the numbers routinely paraded by the Obama administration regarding Obamacare website sign-ups don\u2019t tell us much about the actual number of uninsured individuals who have gained coverage. A new study from the RAND Corporation indicates that only one-third of exchange sign-ups were previously uninsured. The RAND study hasn\u2019t yet been published, but its contents were made available to Noam Levey of the Los Angeles Times. RAND also estimates that 9 million individuals have purchased health plans directly from insurers, outside of the exchanges, but that \u201cthe vast majority of these people were previously insured.\u201d The RAND report appears to corroborate the work of other surveys. Earlier this month, McKinsey reported that 27 percent of those signing up for coverage on the individual market were previously uninsured.\n\nYesterday, the Daily Mail reported that the number might be a lot lower when taking into account who has actually paid their premiums to complete the enrollment process:\n\nA triumphant President Barack Obama declared his signature medical insurance overhaul a success, saying it has made America\u2019s health care system \u2018a lot better.\u2019 But buried in the 7.1 million enrollments he announced in a heavily staged Rose Garden appearance is a more unsettling reality. Numbers from a RAND Corporation study that has been kept under wraps suggest that barely 858,000 previously uninsured Americans \u2013 nowhere near 7.1 million \u2013 have paid for new policies and joined the ranks of the insured by Monday night. Others were already insured, including millions who lost coverage when their existing policies were suddenly cancelled because they didn\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s strict minimum requirements.\n\nIf true, that would mean that the final number of previously uninsured to successfully complete an enrollment in private health insurance would come to about 2.5% of the 40 million Democrats claimed needed ObamaCare in the first place. That number does make some sense, as ObamaCare market disruptions threw 5-6 million out of their existing plans. The 7 million figure \u2014 even if that represented total successful enrollments \u2014 would barely be break even in that context.\n\nSmall wonder Fallon was laughing, and his audience along with him.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plus, how many of that 7 million are actual gains?", "title": "Video: Fallon rips ObamaCare victory lap by White House", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/02/video-fallon-rips-obamacare-victory-lap-by-white-house/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-02T16:41:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T17:03:57+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Jimmy Fallon, ObamaCare, victory lap,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd56a\"", "article_summary": "The RAND study hasn\u2019t yet been published, but its contents were made available to Noam Levey of the Los Angeles Times.\nEarlier this month, McKinsey reported that 27 percent of those signing up for coverage on the individual market were previously uninsured.\nA new study from the RAND Corporation indicates that only one-third of exchange sign-ups were previously uninsured.\nThat number does make some sense, as ObamaCare market disruptions threw 5-6 million out of their existing plans.\nVideo: Fallon rips ObamaCare victory lap by White Houseposted at 12:41 pm on April 2, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyWhen Jay Leno left the Tonight Show on NBC, some wondered whether the show would still target the Obama administration for its satirical look at current events."}
