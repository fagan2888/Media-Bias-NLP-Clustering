That opposition, he notes, could begin to cross party lines, with the possibility of votes on small changes to Obamacare that could override a presidential veto.\n\nTroy notes:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe first aspect of the law the GOP will probably address is the \u201cmedical-device tax.\u201d This 2.3 percent tax on medical devices is supposed to bring in $30 billion in revenue, but it is better understood as a tax on innovation. One of the reasons it is the bill\u2019s most politically vulnerable aspect is that some Democrats, including Minnesota Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar, join the Republicans in opposing it. (Minnesota happens to be the capital of the medical-device industry.)\n\nEven if such changes do not go through, Obama cannot protect the law forever: \u201cPresident Obama can engage in a holding action to protect the ACA from legislative changes over the next two years. But he cannot hold off changes forever, and it is a near certainty that the next president, from whichever party, will be far more open to significant alterations.\u201d In addition, the case of King v. Burwell comes before the Supreme Court this spring, and could gut not only federal subsidies but the employer mandate.\n\nSo while President Barack Obama intends to launch what is being billed as a charm offensive when he addresses Congress later this month, the new Republican leadership on Capitol Hill has unfinished past business on its agenda. The fate of Obamacare is increasingly grim, and if Republicans can put forward a convincing alternative, they can probably undo most of it, if not all of it. Democrats have no \u201cPlan B\u201d for the day Obamacare collapses. That presents the GOP with a unique opportunity for leadership.\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
