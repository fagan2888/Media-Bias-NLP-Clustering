TheBelvietv YouTube Screenshot: Eva Faith\n\nA British mom\u2019s decision to breastfeed her baby changed once the baby girl was born.\n\nVicki Griffiths, 26, gave birth to Eva Faith on Sept. 8 with the intent to breastfeed her new daughter, until she noticed a physical abnormality. Eva was born with two fully formed front teeth. Vicki's family, along with the nurses and midwives at the James Cook University Hospital in North Yorkshire, were left dumbfounded by Eva\u2019s two small surprises. Vicki's husband, Steven, was the one who spotted the teeth in his daughter\u2019s lower jaw.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back into the room Steven said, 'she\u2019s got teeth, you know!' and then we both burst out laughing,\u201d Vicki told the Daily Mail. \u201cWe were in shock, and so were the midwives.\"\n\n\u201cI had been planning to breastfeed, but when I saw Eva\u2019s teeth I was put off. I don\u2019t think anybody could blame me!\" Vicki said.\n\nThe Griffiths worry that their daughter will start growing more teeth before she is old enough to have Calpol or other children\u2019s medicine for teething pain. The couple was concerned that Eva might have to have her teeth taken out, a procedure usually done in rare cases where babies are born with teeth. If a baby\u2019s teeth is wobbly, they can be a choking hazard for the newborn and therefore are often removed.\n\nA pediatrician examined the little girl\u2019s teeth, who deemed that they were stable enough to not cause any harm to the child. Eva currently sips on bottled milk and keeps her mouth open, according to Griffiths. Newborns with natal teeth usually have one or two teeth in the lower gum.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was really mad to look at, but we\u2019ve got used to them now,\u201d Griffiths told the Gazette Live.\n\nCases of natal teeth occur about three times every two years at James Cook hospital, according to Jonathan Wyllie, a consultant neonatologist at the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe deliver 4,000 babies a year. It's every 2,000 to 3,000 births,\u201d said Wyllie, the Daily Mail reports.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eva faith, baby born with teeth, natal teeth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A British mother will not breastfeed her daughter because she was born with two front teeth.", "title": "Mother Refuses To Breastfeed Baby Born With 2 Front Teeth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-refuses-breastfeed-baby-born-2-front-teeth-i-dont-think-anybody-could-blame-me-257476", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/20/baby_born_with_two_front_teeth.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A British mother will not breastfeed her daughter because she was born with two front teeth.", "title": "Mother Refuses To Breastfeed Baby Born With 2 Front Teeth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-refuses-breastfeed-baby-born-2-front-teeth-i-dont-think-anybody-could-blame-me-257476", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/20/baby_born_with_two_front_teeth.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/20/baby_born_with_two_front_teeth.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-20T16:56:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-20T16:56:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A British mother will not breastfeed her daughter because she was born with two front teeth."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb862\"", "article_summary": "TheBelvietv YouTube Screenshot: Eva FaithA British mom\u2019s decision to breastfeed her baby changed once the baby girl was born.\nA British mother will not breastfeed her daughter because she was born with two front teeth.\nThe couple was concerned that Eva might have to have her teeth taken out, a procedure usually done in rare cases where babies are born with teeth.\nVicki Griffiths, 26, gave birth to Eva Faith on Sept. 8 with the intent to breastfeed her new daughter, until she noticed a physical abnormality.\nEva was born with two fully formed front teeth."}
