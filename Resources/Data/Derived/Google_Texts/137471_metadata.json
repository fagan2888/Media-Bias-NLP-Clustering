That hurts,\" said Terik Lewis.\n\nThe owner of Zan, Billy Jalili, said the allegations of racism are not true and that the dress code is needed for safety reasons. He does admit though that enforcement of the dress code is not easy nor do his staff always do it perfectly.\n\n\"When we see somebody come in with the baggy pants and hat on we just have to say no. Was it maybe the right decision or not we have to make a decision. It's a tough job and I don't think there's anybody out there that can do this job 100% correct. We make mistakes but for most of the time we have been correct,\" Jalili said.\n\nThe students who organized the protest also reached out to the NAACP.\n\nIn a statement it said \"we have received numerous reports of various and inconsistent reasons used by the club management to prevent members of ethnic groups from entering the establishment. Our hope is to try to mediate a workable solution to eliminate these discriminatory practices. We look forward to meeting in person with the owner and the students to reconcile the differences and reach a mutual agreement. \"\n\nJalili said he looks forward to meeting with them too, and is open to speaking with anyone about the allegations to try and clear things up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Allegations of discrimination at downtown Springfield nightclub,&nbsp;Zan, have evolved into a protest planned Thursday night", "author": "Audrey Esther", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Allegations of discrimination at downtown Springfield nightclub,\u00a0Zan, have evolved into a protest planned Thursday night", "title": "Nightclub Owner Responds to Allegations of Racial Discrimination", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/nightclub-owner-responds-to-allegations-of-racial-discrimination", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2015/10/01/zan_1443742211955_5031492_ver1.0_640_360.png", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "keywords": "News,Local News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-10-01T23:39:02+0000", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T23:39:02+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "-- Allegations of discrimination at downtown Springfield nightclub, Zan, have evolved into a protest planned Thursday night.\nThe owner of Zan, Billy Jalili, said the allegations of racism are not true and that the dress code is needed for safety reasons.\nHe does admit though that enforcement of the dress code is not easy nor do his staff always do it perfectly.\nWe look forward to meeting in person with the owner and the students to reconcile the differences and reach a mutual agreement. \"\nJalili said he looks forward to meeting with them too, and is open to speaking with anyone about the allegations to try and clear things up."}
