This achievement represents an increase of approximately 184% relative to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year and an increase of approximately 71% relative to the first quarter of FY2015. It is also the largest quarterly unit sales in the Company's history.\n\n\"This record volume of quarterly unit sales demonstrates that the Company is uniquely positioned to be able to deliver very large quantities of product in a very short time period,\" stated Karen King, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Female Health Company. \"It also reinforces the continued importance of the FC2 Female Condom in protecting women against sexually transmitted diseases and in family planning programs around the World.\"\n\nIn other news, the Company continues its work on the development of the US consumer market for female condoms. \"We are moving forward with a new brand and package design that is more complementary to the target user,\" noted King. \"In the interim, we continue to work on establishing the infrastructure to support consumer product sales, which we intend to address primarily through social and digital marketing campaigns. One of our most significant recent accomplishments involved the registration of the product with the relevant organizations to support reimbursement.\"\n\n\"It is a little known fact that female condoms are reimbursable under the Affordable Care Act and most major health plans administered by United-Healthcare, Aetna, Humana, Kaiser, Cigna among many others,\" continued King. \"For a large majority of the major health plans, the key requirement is a prescription from an in-network doctor to achieve full reimbursement. We believe this provides further evidence of the value to the health care system of a female-controlled device that protects against unwanted pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. FC2 Female Condom offers women a non-hormonal birth control option under their control. Many users report a high preference for female condoms over male condoms due to the less restrictive, more 'natural' experience provided by the unique design of the product.\"\n\nThe Company will report its full financial results for the second quarter of FY2015 on April 30, 2015. Management will host an investor conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on April 30, 2015 to discuss year-to-date FY2015 financial results and other topics of interest. Details for accessing the conference call will be forthcoming in a future press release.\n\nAbout The Female Health Company\n\nThe Female Health Company, based in Chicago, Illinois, manufactures and markets the FC2 Female Condom\u00ae (FC2).
