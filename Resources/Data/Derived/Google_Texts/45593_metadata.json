Building walls won't change things,\" Obama said, an apparent jab at Trump's calls for a wall along the US-Mexico border to keep illegal immigrants out.\n\nObama noted that no wall could stop outbreaks of infectious diseases like Ebola and Zika, or help the United States remain competitive in a time of globalization.\n\n\"Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders and blame our challenges on immigrants, that does not just run counter to our history as the world melting pot,\" Obama said.\n\n\"It contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe US president also denounced politicians who hold themselves up as examples of straight-talkers but shun political correctness.\n\n\"In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It's not cool to not know what you're talking about,\" he said. \"That's not challenging political correctness. That's just not knowing what you're talking about.\"\n\nObama was speaking to students at Rutgers University, about one hour from New York. He wore a red and black gown and received an honorary degree from the school.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "GENERAL", "description": "WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) \u2013 US President Barack Obama on Sunday criticised the populist campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, decrying", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "og": {"image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/assets/12966210/Barrack-Obama_w400.jpg", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "title": "Obama slams Trump in speech: 'Ignorance is not a virtue' - News"}, "alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "revisit-after": "1 days", "keywords": "jamaica, observer, news, sports, entertainment, business, fno, style,", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "google-site-verification": "yc7ZVsD5gtxqAQNNEofsEYoEzmgFpOs1wXLNRIu5BV8", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) \u2013 US President Barack Obama on Sunday criticised the populist campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, decrying \"anti-intellectualism\" and noting that \"ignorance is not a virtue.\"\nIt's not cool to not know what you're talking about,\" he said.\nObama was speaking to students at Rutgers University, about one hour from New York.\nThat's just not knowing what you're talking about.\"\nBuilding walls won't change things,\" Obama said, an apparent jab at Trump's calls for a wall along the US-Mexico border to keep illegal immigrants out."}
