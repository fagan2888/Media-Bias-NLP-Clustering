A recent study by the Society of Humane Resource Managers found that more than a third of organizations allow workers to telecommute at part time and 22 percent offer full-time telecommuting to some workers.\n\nToday\u2019s telecommuters are not the stereotypical millennials or working moms. They\u2019re most likely to be men and they\u2019re just as likely to have children as to not have them, according to a report last year by the Flex+Strategy Group. That study found that 36 percent of men do most of their work at home, versus 23 percent of women.\n\nPart of the reason for the disparity could be that women are worried that asking for flexible arrangements could relegate them to the \u201cmommy track.\u201d Managers are more likely to grant flexible time to grant flextime to high-status men seeking flexible schedules in order to advance their careers, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Social Issues. Requests by women were unlikely to be granted, regardless of their job status or reason.\n\nTo find the best jobs for telecommuting, we started with CareerCast\u2019s list of the top-rated jobs of 2015, which ranks jobs based on dozens of factors related to income, environment, and stress. Then we pulled out the top-ranked jobs that paid a mid-level income of at least $70,000; had advertised, open telecommuting positions; and employed at least 10,000 people in 2012, the last time the Bureau of Labor Statistics updated its job-level data.\n\nOne thing stands out from our list: To do really well working from home, you need specialized skills. But with the right skill set, earning decent money while working from home is an increasingly viable option.\n\nActuary or Risk Analyst\n\nIncome: $94,200\n\nNumber of jobs: 24,000\n\nSample job listing: Senior Actuarial Analyst at United Health Group\n\nStatistician\n\nIncome: $79,200\n\nNumber of jobs: 27,600\n\nSample job listing: Principal biostatistician at Pharmaceutical Product Development\n\nData Scientist\n\nIncome: $124,000\n\nNumber of jobs:\n\nSample job listing: Senior Data Analyst at Starr & Associates\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nIncome: $124,100\n\nNumber of jobs: 1 million\n\nSample job listing: Software Engineer \u2013 Product Development at Etail Solutions\n\nComputer Systems Analyst --\n\nIncome: $81,200\n\nNumber of jobs: 520,600\n\nSample job listing: AMSEC Computer Systems Security Analyst at Huntington Ingalls Industries\n\nNetwork and Computer Systems Administrator\n\nIncome: $74,160\n\nNumber of jobs: 366,400\n\nSample job listing: Specialist Systems Engineer at Symantec\n\nHR manager\n\nIncome: $101,200\n\nNumber of jobs: 102,700\n\nSample job listing: HR Shared Services Employee Relations Advisor at AIG\n\nComputer programmer\n\nIncome: $76,200\n\nNumber of jobs: 343,000\n\nSample job listing: Junior Support Programmer at HelpSpot\n\nCivil Engineer\n\nIncome: $81,100\n\nNumber of jobs: 272,900\n\nSample job listing: Civil Engineer (Highway) Construction at the U.S. Department of Transportation\n\nManagement Consultant\n\nIncome: $80,224\n\nNumber of jobs: 718,700\n\nSample job listing: Workforce Solution Consultant III at Kronos", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The number of American workers who telecommute at least part of the time has been on t", "title": "10 Best Work-from-Home Jobs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/10-Best-Work-Home-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/03012012_March_Home_Office_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/10-Best-Work-Home-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/03012012_March_Home_Office_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The number of American workers who telecommute at least part of the time has been on t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Actuary or Risk AnalystIncome: $94,200Number of jobs: 24,000Sample job listing: Senior Actuarial Analyst at United Health GroupStatisticianIncome: $79,200Number of jobs: 27,600Sample job listing: Principal biostatistician at Pharmaceutical Product DevelopmentData ScientistIncome: $124,000Number of jobs:Sample job listing: Senior Data Analyst at Starr & AssociatesSoftware EngineerIncome: $124,100Number of jobs: 1 millionSample job listing: Software Engineer \u2013 Product Development at Etail SolutionsComputer Systems Analyst --Income: $81,200Number of jobs: 520,600Sample job listing: AMSEC Computer Systems Security Analyst at Huntington Ingalls IndustriesNetwork and Computer Systems AdministratorIncome: $74,160Number of jobs: 366,400Sample job listing: Specialist Systems Engineer at SymantecHR managerIncome: $101,200Number of jobs: 102,700Sample job listing: HR Shared Services Employee Relations Advisor at AIGComputer programmerIncome: $76,200Number of jobs: 343,000Sample job listing: Junior Support Programmer at HelpSpotCivil EngineerIncome: $81,100Number of jobs: 272,900Sample job listing: Civil Engineer (Highway) Construction at the U.S. Department of TransportationManagement ConsultantIncome: $80,224Number of jobs: 718,700Sample job listing: Workforce Solution Consultant III at Kronos\nTo find the best jobs for telecommuting, we started with CareerCast\u2019s list of the top-rated jobs of 2015, which ranks jobs based on dozens of factors related to income, environment, and stress.\nThat study found that 36 percent of men do most of their work at home, versus 23 percent of women.\nBut with the right skill set, earning decent money while working from home is an increasingly viable option.\nAlthough some high profile companies have reversed course, more businesses are embracing telecommuting as a key to recruitment and retention efforts and disaster continuity strategies."}
