When I was a preschooler, a relative gave me a beautiful triton shell. Knobby and pale-rose on the outside, kitten's-mouth pink on the inside, the shell was a palm-size wonder to my 4-year-old self. I wanted badly to know: How did the sound of the ocean get inside it? How did it become such a beautiful color? What made it? I eventually learned that a living thing called a mollusk made my triton - a thing that looked like the contents of a handkerchief, sure, but was part of a distinguished, diverse family whose lineage on Earth stretches back more than 500 million years.
