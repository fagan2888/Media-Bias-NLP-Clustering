It additionally delineates which healthcare providers are qualified for RHCP support; SNFs are not included at this time.\n\nFunding will be provided to advance healthcare among rural communities via telecommunications and broadband services. Passage of the bill from the committee means it will be reported to the full Senate for upcoming consideration.\n\nConsidering the evolution of the rural hospital struggle\n\nRural hospitals have been a hot topic among congressional discussions. Rural hospitals are often struggling to remain independent and not be swallowed up by their larger neighbors. Similarly, Medicare reimbursement concerns mean hospital leaders are fighting to survive.\n\nRural hospitals tend to serve patient populations made up of high elderly and low income beneficiaries compared to the rest of the nation, explained numerous hospital leaders within official Congress testimony last May.\n\nThese patients are more likely to visit the emergency room, \u201cthe most expensive venue for care,\u201d said Julie Peterson, CPA, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cAnd, because these patients have not been able to pay their medical bills, the cost of their care is passed on to privately-insured individuals in the form of higher insurance premiums.\"\n\n\u201cLong gone are the days when each small town had its own \u2018Jack of all trades\u2019 doctor who could ... check on Grandma\u2019s aching back,\u201d added Kristi Henderson, DNP, CFNP, CACNP, FAEN.\n\nThe definition of \u201crural\u201d is vague and subjective, said Kimber Wraalstad, North Shore Hospital Administrator. Those leaders and experts producing medical reimbursement laws remain ill-informed about what defines an isolated geographic area, she said.\n\nPosing an example, Wraalstad explained that some in Washington, D.C. \u2013 a city with a population topping 650,000 \u2013 may look at the smaller city of Duluth, Minnesota \u2013 with a population below 90,000 \u2013 and say, \u201cboy, that\u2019s rural.\u201d\n\nPerhaps perspective is merely relative to where you are and what you know. \u201cI look at Duluth and I see urban metro,\u201d she stated.\n\nIn light of these highlighted struggles and many more, it is hopeful Thune\u2019s bill will soon advance the quality of healthcare delivered among those rural communities lacking the access and availability of their larger peers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator John Thune confirmed praise yesterday for the Commerce Committee\u2019s passage of the Rural Health Care Connectivity Act of 2015 (S. 1916).", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/senate-committee-approves-rural-healthcare-connectivity-act", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_5149815041.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "Senate Committee Approves Rural Health Care Connectivity Act"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senator John Thune confirmed praise yesterday for the Commerce Committee\u2019s passage of the Rural Health Care Connectivity Act of 2015 (S. 1916).", "title": "Senate Committee Approves Rural Health Care Connectivity Act", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_5149815041.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Rural hospitals are often struggling to remain independent and not be swallowed up by their larger neighbors.\nUnited States Senator John Thune (R-SD), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, confirmed praise yesterday for passage of a bill he authored, Rural Health Care Connectivity Act of 2015 (S. 1916).\nIt additionally delineates which healthcare providers are qualified for RHCP support; SNFs are not included at this time.\nConsidering the evolution of the rural hospital struggleRural hospitals have been a hot topic among congressional discussions.\nSimilarly, Medicare reimbursement concerns mean hospital leaders are fighting to survive."}
