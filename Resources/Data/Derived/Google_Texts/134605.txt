LOVELAND — Loveland has opened three drop-off spots for residents to recycle real Christmas trees through Jan. 21.

The city will turn the trees dropped off at Centennial or Kroh Park into mulch, which is then used at parks throughout the city in the spring and summer.

Residents are asked to make sure they remove all decorations from their trees before dropping them off at the following locations:

• Centennial Park, located at First Street and Taft Avenue, in the parking lot, open daily from sunup to sundown.

• Kroh Park, located at U.S. 287 and 52nd Street, open daily from sunup to sundown.

• The Loveland Recycling Center, 400 N. Wilson Ave., open 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays.

A drop-off also is open at the Larimer County landfill, 5887 S. Taft Hill Road, through Jan. 18. Business hours there are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The landfill will close at 2:30 p.m. thursday and will be closed Friday.

The city also will accept Christmas lights at designated bins to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project, which helps Americans who are injured in war. The city will remove the copper wire from the lights and all of the money from the recycling of the wire will go to the nonprofit.

Drop-off bins for lights are at the Loveland Public Library, 300 N. Adams Ave., Loveland Recycling Center, Loveland Public Works Building, 2525 W. First St., Loveland Water and Power Service Center, 200 N. Wilson Ave., Lowe's 1355 Sculptor Drive, and Home Depot, 1100 Nickel Drive.
