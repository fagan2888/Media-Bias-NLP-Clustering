It\u2019s all in how they say it. A team of researchers led by Juan David Leong\u00f3mez, a psychologist at the University of Stirling, has discovered that certain \u201cparalingual\u201d features of the human voice, particularly changes to pitch and modulation, can betray the speaker\u2019s hidden sexual attraction to his or her listener. (Or at least, these qualities of the human voice reveal the speaker\u2019s perception of the listener\u2019s attractiveness.) What\u2019s more, these instinctive, unconscious vocal adjustments actually seem to work in terms of increasing the speaker\u2019s odds of getting laid: listeners prefer and respond more favorably (or in technical terms, in a more \u201cproceptive\u201d fashion) to opposite-sex voices that contain these special subtle acoustics than to those that don\u2019t.\n\nIn an article soon to be published in the journal Evolution & Human Behavior, Leong\u00f3mez and his colleagues discovered that when (heterosexual) men, for instance, are asked to flirt with a beautiful woman, two noticeable things begin to happen to their voices. First, their voices get deeper\u2026 or rather their voices achieve a deeper minimal octave than under comparison conditions. And second, men\u2019s voices become more sing-songy or pitch-variable when speaking to a pretty woman, sort of like, well, how you\u2019d speak to a baby. It isn\u2019t quite as pronounced as such prosodic \u201cinfant-directed speech\u201d (and it\u2019s probably unwise, I hasten to add, for a man to speak to any woman as if she were a puppy), but nonetheless, the investigators found these male voice adjustments during verbal courtship to be an empirically demonstrable effect. What this means is that not only do men\u2019s voices get deeper when they\u2019re chatting up some lovely woman, but they also get higher compared to when their speech is directed at another male or to an unattractive female listener. This effect appeared in both of the language samples tested \u2013 native male English and Czech speakers \u2013 and even after controlling for the unscripted content of the men\u2019s speech.\n\nSo how do Leong\u00f3mez and his co-authors interpret this puzzling effect? Why, from an evolutionary perspective, of course. \u201cProducing a low pitch at some point during an interaction [with an attractive female] might provide sufficient indication of physical masculinity while freeing men to \u2018play\u2019 with their pitch\u2026 because low-pitched masculine voices might be associated with aggression, such modulation could potentially enable men to signal both their masculinity and lack of threat simultaneously.\u201d In other words, \u201cHey, sexy lady, hear this? Hear how I\u2019m sounding right now? That\u2019s right: I\u2019m a virile, testosterone-fuelled male specimen of our species but, cross my heart, I\u2019ll be sweet to you\u2026 and our future offspring.\u201d And indeed, a group of na\u00efve female listeners asked to judge the verbal recordings of male wooers found those with the most significant pitch variability the most attractive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests that it's not what you say that attracts the opposite sex but how you say it", "title": "The secret to successful flirting", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests that it's not what you say that attracts the opposite sex but how you say it", "title": "The secret to successful flirting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/12/successful_flirting_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_122942818.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests that it's not what you say that attracts the opposite sex but how you say it", "title": "The secret to successful flirting", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_122942818.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jesse Bering", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Chemistry, Language, linguistics, Neuroscience, Psychology, Scientific American, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And second, men\u2019s voices become more sing-songy or pitch-variable when speaking to a pretty woman, sort of like, well, how you\u2019d speak to a baby.\n(Or at least, these qualities of the human voice reveal the speaker\u2019s perception of the listener\u2019s attractiveness.)\nFirst, their voices get deeper\u2026 or rather their voices achieve a deeper minimal octave than under comparison conditions.\nThis effect appeared in both of the language samples tested \u2013 native male English and Czech speakers \u2013 and even after controlling for the unscripted content of the men\u2019s speech.\nSo how do Leong\u00f3mez and his co-authors interpret this puzzling effect?"}
