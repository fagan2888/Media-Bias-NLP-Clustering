Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who publicly revealed in 2009 that she is a breast cancer survivor, says she still thinks about the disease \u201cevery single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been through breast cancer, it sort of stares you in the face every morning. There\u2019s no getting away from it as a survivor, so that\u2019s sobering,\u201d she says. Noting that she \u201ctook all the steps,\u201d Wasserman Schultz says the thought of a recurrence doesn\u2019t cause frequent nail biting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about it, if I\u2019m going to get it again \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say ever \u2014 but it\u2019s not a constant worry,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee chairwoman discovered a lump in her breast during a self-exam only months after a clean mammogram when she was 41. She underwent multiple surgeries, including a double mastectomy.\n\nNow, Wasserman Schultz is to be recognized for her work fighting the disease at Thursday\u2019s Susan G. Komen gala, \u201cHonoring the Promise.\u201d The annual fundraiser at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington will also honor The Carlyle Group\u2019s David Rubenstein and will be emceed by Joan Lunden, who earlier this year disclosed her diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer, a rare form of the disease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to sharing this moment with my family and with my care-giving team. My best friends who came up and took care of me when I was recovering from my mastectomy and other surgeries are all going to be there,\u201d Wasserman Schultz, 47, says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very emotional experience.\u201d\n\nOver the course of her cancer journey, she says she had to look for and create lighter moments for herself, \u201cbecause you want to jump off a building sometimes when you\u2019re at your low points.\u201d\n\nWhat is an example of the bright side during the road to recovery?\n\n\u201cI not-so-jokingly refer to my, um, \u2018enhanced\u2019 look as my silver linings from having gone through breast cancer,\u201d the congresswoman says. \u201cI finished up with a little more than God gave me, and that was my reward for being a breast cancer survivor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
