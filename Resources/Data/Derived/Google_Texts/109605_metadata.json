Charles Krauthammer proclaimed that Trump\u2019s candidacy \u201cwill damage the [Republican] party\u201d because Trump isn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d candidate. George Will said Trump was an \u201caffront\u201d to those focused on \u201cmaking conservatism intellectually respectable and politically palatable.\u201d Bill Kristol even said that he would support a third-party candidate over Trump.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s position is attributable to what Republicans have been doing for decades to denigrate government and expertise.\n\nIt\u2019s not about Trump but what we could call Trumpism. Its rise has led to all the outsiders doing well.\n\nCarly Fiorina sounded confident debating but she\u2019s never served in government. Fiorina followed up from doing terribly as CEO of Hewlett Packard to losing decisively to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. Last week she was seriously off on foreign policy and climate change. Told that tapes of Planned Parenthood didn\u2019t show what she claimed, she doubled down.\n\nBen Carson, a surgeon with no political or government experience and very limited policy knowledge, is doing well in national polls and in Iowa and some other states.\n\nWhile lazy commentators compare Trump (and sometimes Carson and Fiorina) to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, they\u2019re completely off base. Sanders had four terms of mayor of Burlington, and he delivered, protecting consumers and revitalizing the downtown. And that was before serving in the U.S. House and Senate. Sanders won his last election with 71 percent of the vote.\n\nJust as absurd are comparisons between outsider Republicans and President Reagan. Before running for president, Reagan was governor of California. He was a principled pragmatist who both cut and raised taxes and propounded an optimistic view of a nation that is welcoming to immigrants.\n\nWhatever you think of their policies, every Democratic candidate has had extensive experience in government.\n\nBut for decades, Republican elites have promoted the idea that government, especially the institutions they don\u2019t control, is awful.\n\nIn trying to take congressional control from Democrats in 1994, Newt Gingrich urged Republican candidates to characterize their opponents and Congress itself with 64 specific words, including \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cpathetic,\u201d \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cabuse of power,\u201d and \u201csick.\u201d Denigrating Congress was a flip from promoting congressional power during Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration.\n\nGinning up suspicion toward and fear of government was endemic when Congress worked on the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin\u2019s absurd claim of \u201cdeath panels\u201d is most famous, but others used similar language, some crafted by strategist Frank Luntz.\n\nA 2009 memo from Luntz advised Republicans to claim there would be a \u201cWashington takeover.\u201d After all, \u201cTakeovers are like coups. They lead to dictators and a loss of freedom.\u201d\n\nTying the ACA to rationing, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, said, \u201cIn a government-run system, the government decides who gets treatment in medicine and who doesn\u2019t. That means the government decides who lives, who dies.\u201d None of this was true, but it promoted distrust in government.\n\nRepublicans too often stand against experts. What a change from when the party was associated with the Progressive Movement\u2019s embrace of trained professionals for governing a century ago.\n\nNow it\u2019s common to hear Republicans brush aside what major scientific organizations say about climate change, often with claims scientists are corrupt and in league with insidious politicians. Trump falsely links immunizations and autism.\n\nEmpirical reality is overlooked. As the unemployment rate falls and the percentage of Americans with health insurance surges, some Republicans still claim Obamacare isn\u2019t working and that it\u2019s killing the economy.\n\nWhile both parties have their share of strangeness, political scientists Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein note that this turn away from pragmatism increasingly characterizes today\u2019s Republicans.\n\nResearch by veteran reporter Jackie Calmes attributes these dynamics to a conservative media who \u201cdon\u2019t give a damn about governing.\u201d Those media have stoked the xenophobia and birtherism Trump espouses.\n\nAnd so today\u2019s top Republican candidates are people who have never governed, propelled by a party base that all too frequently embraces their know-nothingism. Considering that nearly half of Republicans falsely believe Obama is Muslim, it\u2019s no surprise that Trump didn\u2019t correct a man who said so.\n\nEstablishment Republican criticisms of Trump are often grounded in fears their party is completely turning off Latino voters and young people.\n\nBut it must be said: The party is reaping what it sowed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Pollways", "description": "Republican pundits have been beside themselves about the rise of Donald Trump.
