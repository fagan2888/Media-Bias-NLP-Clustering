A white Audi tumbled into Cherry Creek at Speer Boulevard at 13th Avenue after running a red light, colliding with a minivan, hitting a power pole and landing on its roof Sunday.

No one was injured in the accident at 8:58 a.m., said Denver police Officer Everett Moore.

The Audi was travelling southbound on Speer when it ran the light at 13th Avenue and struck a green minivan travelling west on 13th.

The car then glanced off the power pole and into the creek. “We aren’t transporting anybody to the hospital,” Moore said.
