Speaking on his radio show Monday, longtime right-wing talk radio star Rush Limbaugh argued that it was only a matter of time before “the left” decided to “politicize” the unfolding Ebola outbreak, pointing to criticism of President Reagan’s indifferent response to the HIV/AIDS crisis as proof.

“Pretty much everything I’m talking about, I’m talking about because it is political,” Limbaugh explained to those among his audience who might not understand what Ebola in Africa has to do with the issues currently animating the GOP base.

“You ever heard of AIDS?” Limbaugh asked, rhetorically. “You think that wasn’t political? One of the most intense efforts to undermine support for Ronald Reagan was hatched through AIDS.”
