Throughout her remarks, she showered him with compliments, ending with, \"You're so handsome that I can't speak properly.\u201d\n\nAs Hot Air pointed out, the leading lady is no stranger to good-looking men: \u201cAs regards the part about O being so handsome that he rendered her dumbstruck, remind yourself that this is a woman who was once engaged to a young Brad Pitt.\u201d She also dated Ben Affleck and recently went through a \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d (read: divorce) with Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin.\n\nBut in between Paltrow\u2019s effusive adulation, she tackled several political topics. The actress noted November\u2019s approaching midterm elections in which Democratic control of the Senate is at risk. She called it a \"critical time\" for Democrats. \"It would be wonderful if we were able to give this man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass,\" she said.\n\nL.A., you are in for a Goop-tastic evening. @BarackObama to headline high-$$ DNC #fundraiser at @GwynethPaltrow's pad pic.twitter.com/M0r8ECi9jD \u2014 Political Party Time (@SFpartytime) October 9, 2014\n\nThe woman who earned an estimated $19 million from her acting last year called Obama\u2019s push for equal pay \u201cvery important to me as a working mother.\u201d She also praised the president\u2019s efforts towards investments in sustainable energy and \"everything green.\"\n\nObama tackled more hard-hitting political problems in his speech, including the Middle East and the Islamic State, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and relations with Russia over Ukraine. He also reminisced about Democratic successes during his nearly six years in office: economic recovery from the Great Recession, rescuing the auto industry in America, the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), increasing production of clean energy and rising test scores and graduation rates in the country\u2019s schools.\n\nThe president then outlined policies he would like to tackle after the November 4 elections. He spoke of raising the minimum wage and closing the pay gap between men and women; rebuilding infrastructure throughout the country; and investing in education, research and development. He mentioned actions he\u2019s been able to take without help from Congress \u2012 including attempts to give women equal rights in the workplace and to help DREAM kids stay in the country. Then he asked for support from the attendees.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re acting despite Congress. But imagine what we could do with a Congress that operated on some common sense. Imagine that. Imagine what we could do not just on any particular issue \u2012 although it would make a huge difference for us right away to be able to pass comprehensive immigration reform, or to pass a minimum wage law, or pass a fair pay law \u2012 but just in terms of the mood of the country; in terms of people believing that once again we can do something in common,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBelieving that we can rise above narrow, ideological interests. Believing that we can match the decency and common sense of the American people with our politics.\u201d\n\nAbout 200 supporters, including Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford, spent at least $1,000 each to attend the Democratic fundraiser, with 50 dropping at least $15,000 to attend a dinner with the president.\n\n@OriginalFresca MY NAME IS SABO.
