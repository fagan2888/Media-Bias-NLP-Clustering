Then-gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner called the spending plan \u201cphony,\u201d while the party in power acknowledged it was \u201cincomplete\u201d and riddled with gimmicks.\n\nBut the state is now on course to dig itself a far greater budget hole, through either unwillingness or inability to act on the current fiscal year\u2019s budget. One estimate puts the deficit at $5 billion, thanks to court- and statute-mandated spending already underway at levels that both sides say is unsustainable.\n\nLawmakers say they\u2019re not even sure how much money is going out the door. They agree the situation is leading Illinois - already billions in debt - to rack up more. They acknowledge balancing the budget gets more difficult with each passing day. Yet, like most everything else at the state Capitol these days, they\u2019re split along party lines as to who\u2019s to blame and how to fix it.\n\nThe effect on residents and businesses is clear: There\u2019ll be a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase in what the state will eventually have to raise in taxes, cut in spending - or both, said Laurence Msall, president of The Civic Federation, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\n\u201cThis is an incremental path down the road of fiscal recklessness and irresponsibility,\u201d Msall said.\n\nAt the center of the problem is a disagreement between Rauner and Democrats over what should be included in the budget.\n\nThe former private equity investor negotiating his first state budget wants a package that includes changes to curb public-employee unions\u2019 influence and reduce costs for businesses. He says he won\u2019t consider a tax increase until the Legislature gives into some of those priorities. But Democrats say Rauner\u2019s agenda will hurt the middle class, and want to raise revenue to balance the budget without severe spending cuts.\n\nIn May, Democrats approved a budget that spent almost $4 billion more than the approximately $33 billion Illinois is expected to take in this year. Rauner signed the piece of the budget that funds schools, but vetoed the rest, saying he was trying to put Illinois on the road to \u201cfiscal sanity.\u201d\n\nHe also deemed the one-month, stop-gap budget Democrats sent him unconstitutional because, if applied over the full fiscal year, it would lead to an unbalanced budget.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of consent decrees issued by federal courts kicked in, mandating Illinois continue to spend money on services like the Department of Children and Family Services and Medicaid. Plus, payments to pension funds, debt service and tax refunds also are automatically authorized by law. And Rauner and labor unions were granted a court order requiring the state to continue to pay its employees at their normal salaries; Democratic Attorney General Lisa Madigan had objected.\n\nNinety percent of what the state usually spends has been authorized, despite having no approved budget, an analysis by Senate Democrats concluded. They say if spending continues at this rate, Illinois is on track to spend about $38 billion this year, leading to a $5 billion deficit.\n\nThe Rauner administration didn\u2019t dispute the numbers, but blamed House Speaker Michael Madigan and other Democrats for supporting a \u201cfailed status quo.\u201d Rauner this week called the situation \u201cvery tragic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending at levels that are unaffordable by court decree that is \u2026 racking up more debt, more liabilities, more unpaid bills, that\u2019s raising our interest costs and our overall costs,\u201d he said Thursday in Peoria.\n\nMadigan says it\u2019s Rauner who has forced the state to spend money by seeking pay for state workers and approving the schools budget. The House revenue committee will continue hearings Monday to try to determine how much the state is spending - something all involved, Rauner\u2019s staff included, acknowledge is a mystery.\n\n\u201cAre we spending money at a $32 billion rate per year? Or $34 billion rate per year or a $38 billion rate per year?\u201d asked GOP Rep. David Harris of Arlington Heights.\n\nWhen and if the two sides do reach a budget deal, they will have to raise taxes, cut spending retroactively or make 12 months\u2019 worth of changes in a condensed time period - making any action both more painful and more politically difficult.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sara Burnett on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/sara_burnett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illinois Republicans and Democrats alike wailed when the Democrat-controlled Legislature approved a state budget last year that was more than $1 billion out of balance.
