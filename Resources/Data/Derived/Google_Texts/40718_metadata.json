All the teams were asked to run through a training simulation in which an premature infant had come down with a common, but severe, medical complication known as necrotizing enterocolitis (fancy term aside, the condition describes bowel tissue dying off).\n\nLikewise, all teams were told that a \u201cforeign expert on team reflexivity in medicine\u201d from the United States would be observing them throughout the stimulation, occasionally chipping in with their own thoughts over the phone. Half the teams were given a expert that played the jerk, offering \u201cmildly rude\u201d statements that had nothing to do with their performance, and the other half were given neutral comments.\n\nThe simulations were videotaped and presented to another team of trained judges that evaluated them based on dimensions of help-seeking and information-sharing behavior, as well as their overall diagnostic and procedural performance on a five point scale (One being poor, five excellent).\n\n\u201cThe composite diagnostic and procedural performance scores were lower for members of teams exposed to rudeness than to members of the control teams (2.6 vs 3.2 and 2.8 vs 3.3 respectively),\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cRudeness alone explained nearly 12% of the variance in diagnostic and procedural performance.\u201d\n\nThe authors were especially interested in the subject because medical mistakes can arise from even a slight slip in performance among staff when treating patients. \u201cTeam-targeted rudeness may underlie such performance deficiencies, with individuals exposed to rude behavior being less helpful and cooperative,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWhile their findings may not dissuade jerks from signing up to work in a hospital, it should encourage staff to stamp out rude behavior when it rears its ugly head \u2014 they might just save a life.\n\nSource: Riskin A, Erez A, Foulk T, et al.
