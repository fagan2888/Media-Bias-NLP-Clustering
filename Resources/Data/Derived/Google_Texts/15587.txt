WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reflected on a polarizing term that featured major decisions on marriage equality, health care and housing discrimination on Wednesday evening in a conversation with Duke Law professor Neil Siegel.

Though the court’s term, which wrapped up exactly one month ago, has been widely described as a liberal one, she said she wouldn’t characterize the term (or herself) as “liberal.” To Ginsburg, consecutive terms that produce record dissatisfaction with the court have become par for the course, because she and her fellow justices tend to take up cases that have divided those below them.

“Every year I keep waiting for the year when we will be out of the headlines, but it hasn’t happened yet,” she told Siegel before a standing-room-only crowd of Duke Law alumni and summer students. “It’s hard not to have a big year at the Supreme Court.”

Ginsburg said she would have spent more pages explaining an equal protection rationale for legalizing marriage equality nationwide if she had written a concurring ruling separate from that of Justice Anthony Kennedy. To explain why she didn't, she said that multiple dissents -- there were four in the marriage equality case from conservative justices -- were "bound to spread confusion," noting that she keeps a book of Justice Louis Brandeis' unreleased dissents in her chambers to remind herself of the virtue of restraint.
