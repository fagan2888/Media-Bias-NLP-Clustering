Lin-Manuel Miranda And President Barack Obama

President Barack Obama will surely be missed once he steps down from office because of funny moments like this one.

In the video, the President helped Hamilton star and writer Lin-Manuel Miranda in creating an epic freestyle rap by holding cue cards containing random words such as "Constitution," "Obamacare," and "Supreme Court."

Kudos to the President for providing us some awe-inspiring memory before he leaves.
