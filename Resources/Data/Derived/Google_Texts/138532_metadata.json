Activist groups looking to end prescription drug abuse\u2019s stranglehold on the United States are now calling for the resignation of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg due to the organization\u2019s supposed contributions to addiction, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"We are especially frustrated by the FDA's continued approval of new, dangerous, high-dose opioid analgesics that are fueling high rates of addiction and overdose deaths,\" read a letter signed by the National Coalition Against Prescription Drug Abuse and 15 other anti-addiction groups. \"Dr. Hamburg's support for using opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is squarely at odds with efforts by the CDC to discourage this widespread practice.\u201d\n\nIn the letter addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Hamburg and the FDA are criticized for last October\u2019s decision to approve yet another potent painkiller called Zohydro, despite repeated warnings against the addiction medication from health care professionals. One of the groups responsible for Wednesday\u2019s letter, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, has petitioned the FDA frequently to restrict the use of prescription opioids.\n\nAlthough the HHS has promised to seriously consider all aspects of the nation\u2019s continuing drug abuse epidemic, HHS representative Tait Sye said that Hamburg\u2019s job will not be affected by any decisions. \"Secretary Burwell appreciates hearing from stakeholders on the important issue of prescription opioid abuse, and looks forward to responding to their letter,\" Sye said in a statement. Sye also stated that prescription painkiller abuse \u201cis a serious issue and one that the secretary is focused on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around half of deaths related to prescription painkillers also include the use of benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. There were an estimated 14,800 prescription painkiller deaths in 2008, and for every one death there were 10 treatment admissions, 32 emergency department visits, 130 people who abuse or are dependent, and 825 nonmedical users. Over 12 million people reported using prescription painkillers outside of a health care professional\u2019s recommendation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drug, addiction, activists, fda, commissioner, margaret, hamburg", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In the midst of a national prescription painkiller abuse epidemic, anti-drug addiction activists are calling for FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg's resignation.", "title": "Is The FDA Comish To Blame For America's Prescription Drug Abuse Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/addiction-activists-call-fda-commissioner-margaret-hamburgs-resignation-over-national-304782", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/opioid-abuse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the midst of a national prescription painkiller abuse epidemic, anti-drug addiction activists are calling for FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg's resignation.", "title": "Is The FDA Comish To Blame For America's Prescription Drug Abuse Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/addiction-activists-call-fda-commissioner-margaret-hamburgs-resignation-over-national-304782", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/opioid-abuse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/opioid-abuse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-09-24T15:49:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T15:49:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In the midst of a national prescription painkiller abuse epidemic, anti-drug addiction activists are calling for FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg's resignation."}, "article_summary": "Over 12 million people reported using prescription painkillers outside of a health care professional\u2019s recommendation.\nAlthough the HHS has promised to seriously consider all aspects of the nation\u2019s continuing drug abuse epidemic, HHS representative Tait Sye said that Hamburg\u2019s job will not be affected by any decisions.\nThere were an estimated 14,800 prescription painkiller deaths in 2008, and for every one death there were 10 treatment admissions, 32 emergency department visits, 130 people who abuse or are dependent, and 825 nonmedical users.\n\"Secretary Burwell appreciates hearing from stakeholders on the important issue of prescription opioid abuse, and looks forward to responding to their letter,\" Sye said in a statement.\nActivist groups looking to end prescription drug abuse\u2019s stranglehold on the United States are now calling for the resignation of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg due to the organization\u2019s supposed contributions to addiction, The Associated Press reported."}
