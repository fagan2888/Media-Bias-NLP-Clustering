But are all fruits and vegetables equally good at controlling weight?\u201d researchers asked. \u201cIn this study, [we] investigate whether consumption of fruits and vegetable with a higher fiber content or lower glycemic load is more strongly associated with a healthy weight than consumption of fruits and vegetables with a lower fiber content or higher glycemic load.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston analyzed weight and diet changes in 133,648 U.S. men and women already enrolled in three chronic disease-related cohort studies. They specifically looked at the associations between changes in intake of specific fruits and vegetables and self-reported weight changes.\n\nAfter adjusting for influential lifestyle factors, such as smoking and level of physical activity, researchers found that an increase in total fruit and vegetable intake led to a 0.53- and 0.25-pound weight loss, respectively. Yet, increased intake of starchy vegetables, like corn, peas, and potatoes, led to weight gain; non-starchy vegetables that are higher in fiber and lower on the glycemic index, including broccoli and Brussels sprouts, were more strongly associated with weight loss.\n\nEating more fruit was actually greater for weight loss, but the overall association appeared strongest when men and women ate more berries, apples, pears, tofu/soy, cruciferous and green leafy vegetables, such as cauliflower, broccoli, kale, radishes, Swiss chard, collard greens, rutabaga, and turnips (some of which pair well with these fall-inspired recipes). Researchers said this particular haul increases satiety while boasting fewer calories, which may be \u201cpartly responsible for the beneficial effects.\u201d\n\nBonus: Just about all of these fruits and vegetables are in season for the fall, according to the USDA. True, you can pretty much get any fruit and vegetable in the supermarket all year round, but some believe seasonal eating does make a difference. For one, the flavor is better: The Guardian cited that \u201cthere is a natural body clock to food that makes seasonal food taste better.\u201d And if you\u2019re buying from your local farmer, the whole \u201cfarm-to-table\u201d method sustains more of your food\u2019s nutrients among other things.\n\nThat said, researchers aren\u2019t sure these findings are \u201cgeneralizable\u201d \u2014 \u201cnearly all the participants were well-educated white adults,\u201d they said. The self-reported measures of the study may have also \u201cintroduced measurement errors.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s OK \u2014 fruits and vegetables are still what\u2019s up for weight loss.\n\nSource: Bertoia ML, Mukamal KJ, Cahill LE, Hou T, Ludwig DS, Mozaffarian D, et al.
