John Bel Edwards\u2019 administration are voicing concerns about the state budget proposal that the House passed last week, as the upper chamber begins to tackle the state\u2019s finances for the coming year.\n\n\u201cThe budget is still really problematic from our standpoint,\u201d Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne said Sunday, adding that the Senate has \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d on the budget that will go into effect July 1.\n\nSenate budget leaders are still processing the nearly $26 billion spending plan that the House approved Friday but have started working to hash out the chamber\u2019s version of spending priorities for the state.\n\nA final version of the budget typically takes shape as the two chambers negotiate their differences in the final days of the session.\n\nAmong the red flags raised so far: Senators say they are skeptical of the House\u2019s plan to skim about $100 million off of fees and statutory dedications that enter into a debt fund to free up money for other priorities. They also voiced concerns about areas of the budget that are on the chopping block.\n\n\u201cSome things stick out,\u201d Senate President John Alario, R-Westwego, said.\n\nThe House plan to take 3.3 percent of certain fees and dedicated funding for agencies to free up money for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, in particular, raised questions.\n\nAlario said he worried that the money, which the House directed in the introduction of the 200-plus page budget document, might not meet state requirements to be considered recurring funding. If deemed one-time money, the funding couldn\u2019t be used to cover annual expenses.\n\n\u201cThere may be some trouble viewing it as a recurring money, if it only appears in the preamble,\u201d Alario said.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s chief budget analyst, Sherry Phillips-Hymel, echoed that concern \u2014 as well as the largely unknown impact on agencies that normally would get that money.\n\n\u201cThis is not money that was sitting in the treasury idle,\u201d Hymel said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of almost a fund sweep.\u201d\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said on Friday that he recognized the budget process is far from over.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not in a perfect order that we\u2019d like it to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all working through this.\u201d\n\nHenry has defended his proposal to take a slice of fees and statutory dedications as a previously untapped money source, as Louisiana faces an estimated $600 million shortfall in the coming year.\n\nEdwards has said he plans to call the Legislature into a second special session when the regular session ends to bring in more revenue \u2014 likely through removing or cutting some tax exemptions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no good answer. We\u2019re $600 million short right now of what we think is needed to adequately fund government,\u201d Dardenne said.\n\nHenry said he would prefer to avoid a second special session until the state gets a better idea of its financial uptick from the special session held earlier this year.\n\nHe had initially presented a budget plan that sought to prioritize full funding for the popular TOPS while paring back funding for the state Department of Health and Hospitals.\n\nThe final version of the House budget took about $72 million from TOPS to fund contracts to operate the state\u2019s largely privatized safety net hospitals for the poor.\n\nHospital operators on Sunday told the Senate Finance Committee that they believe that the proposal still underfunds them by about $150 million. They questioned the Edwards administration\u2019s figures for how much money the state will save through expanding Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the administration\u2019s figures that calculate Medicaid and better match rates, those contracts are fully funded.\n\n\u201cThere are competing interests there,\u201d DHH Undersecretary Jeff Reynolds said. \u201cThere needs to be a reconciliation between the state\u2019s point of view and the partners\u2019 point of view, reaching a number that is reasonable and fair to all parties.\u201d\n\nThe state is renegotiating the contracts with private hospital partners, he noted.\n\nDHH Secretary Rebekah Gee said that the move to replace hospital funding doesn\u2019t make the agency whole. She said that the House version of the budget would lead to the elimination of some waiver programs, including the Children\u2019s Choice Waiver that provides support to families with children with developmental disabilities and the Adult Day Health Care Waiver that provides services that help people avoid moving to nursing homes.\n\n\u201cWe have to, in my view, have a second special session,\u201d Gee said. \u201cThe current budget makes me cut 50 percent of restaurant inspections, think about that. That keeps me up at night.\u201d\n\nFollow Elizabeth Crisp on Twitter @elizabethcrisp.
