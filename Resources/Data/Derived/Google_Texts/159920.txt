Kimball, SD

A Kimball man accused of aiding his son in a shootout with police has been released from jail.



A Brule County judge this week approved Michael London's release from jail after concluding he is not a flight risk and is not a threat to the community. The Mitchell Daily Republic reports the 66-year-old Chamberlain man was charged with two counts of aiding and abetting aggravated assault in January.



Prosecutors say Michael London warned his son, Donald London, that police had arrived at his house looking for him. Authorities say they had received reports that Donald London planned to kill the Chamberlain police chief.



Authorities say more than 100 rounds were then fired from within the Kimball home during the standoff. A State Highway Patrol trooper was shot in the arm and the side.
