The attempt at a world record fell short, but a Manalapan family’s quest to shine a light on a devastating childhood disease continues to draw backers.

The Manalapan police department and Keller Williams Realty are partnering with Jim and Karen Raffone’s JAR of Hope Foundation in different but significant ways in the coming days.

The Raffones, whose 6-year-old son Jamesy suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, orchestrated an Aug. 23 gathering that fell just short of breaking the Guinness mark for biggest crowd doing simultaneous push-ups (615). It did, however, raise $12,380 for research on Duchenne, a rare and ultimately fatal degenerative condition.

Manalapan police officers who provided security at the event invited Jim Raffone to join them in doing 10 push-ups in solidarity with Jamesy prior to Friday’s 9/11 memorial service in front of the town hall. The service starts at 6 p.m.

On Saturday, Keller Williams is throwing a JAR of Hope fundraiser picnic at Ivy League Day Camp on Gordons Corner Road in Manalapan. The picnic runs from noon to 5 p.m. and includes food, games, swimming and other activities.

“The way the community is responding is truly remarkable,” Jim Raffone said. “It just proves that once you get the truth of the disease out there, it really touches people. The gravity of this disease really grabs you.”

Tickets for the picnic cost $35 for adults and $20 for children ages 5-16 (children 4 and under are free). They must be reserved in advance and can be purchased at Keller Williams’ offices in Morganville, Jackson and Shrewsbury. For information, call 732-536-9010.
