WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said legislation scheduled for a vote on the House floor this week that would reform the central bank was "a grave mistake." In a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, released by the Fed on Tuesday, Yellen said the legislation would politicize interest rate decisions. The bill, approved by the House Finance Committee on a party-line vote, which would require the Fed adopt a policy rule approved and monitored by the Government Accountability Office. Yellen said no rule exists to guide the Fed when rates are close to zero - where they have been for the past seven years.
