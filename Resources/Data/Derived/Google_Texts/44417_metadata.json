Black did not disappoint with his responses, with most of the pressing questions engagingly answered by the Tenacious D rock star.\n\nRedditors rushed in to ask Jack about his previous roles, especially Bernie, where Black\u2019s performance was critically lauded by netizens and professional reviewers alike. Redditor jeallybeam asked:\n\n\u201cHey Jack. I saw Bernie recently and was just amazed at how different your character was from your other films and was absolutely astounded at how great your performance was. So my question is, how does it feel to you to play a serious character in a drama? Was the experience one that you had to prepare a lot for?\u201d\n\nJack answered:\n\n\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t have all that much time because it kinda came together really fast. Richard Linklater gave me the script and I loved it and it was just like, let\u2019s do it. I didn\u2019t have much time to get very in depth in my research but I had an amazing experience. It definitely was one of the highlights of my career. Not that many people saw it, but as an artistic endeavor, it was amazing.\u201d\n\nAnother intriguing question came from deadlysin687, who asked if Jack voiced a character in the upcoming zombie game Dead Island 2. Jack, who has had experience with video game voice roles before, quickly denied his participation although he praised the game\u2019s trailer, describing it as the \u201cbest\u201d he\u2019s seen:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking it up right now\u2026Dead Island 2 trailer. I\u2019m just going to watch this real quick. Is this a video game? Oh my god. It\u2019s a video game. Very real looking! Yeah, it\u2019s not me, but now I\u2019m so into this. I can\u2019t stop watching a trailer. This is not a trailer, this is a short film. Holy sh*t, is he a zombie? I want to see if they got a voice impersonator. Oh my god. This is like the best trailer ever. It\u2019s almost over guys. That\u2019s infuriating. Yeah, I can definitely guarantee that\u2019s a Jack Black impersonator. It sounds like the dude that plays me in the Kung Fu Panda TV show.\u201d\n\nOn the subject of Sasquatch, GRXVES asked:\n\n\u201cDo you believe in the existence of Sasquatch?\u201d\n\nJack Black answered:\n\nIt goes without saying, I\u2019m a believer.\n\nThat may have been a reference to an episode of Black\u2019s old HBO show, Tenacious D, where he appeared with the band\u2019s other half, Kyle Gass \u2013 although we\u2019d like to maintain our belief that he does sincerely believe in Sas.\n\nRead the rest of the AMA here. Jack Black\u2019s next film, Kung Fu Panda 3, brings back Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie and will be shown in theaters next year.\n\nphoto credit: brianjmatis via photopin cc", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jack Black appeared yesterday for a Reddit AMA to answer fan questions about his music, his previous roles and his deep belief in Sasquatch.
