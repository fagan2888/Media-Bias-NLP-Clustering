A New York woman who blogged online about her 5-year-old son’s illness has been charged with slowly killing him by poisoning him with sodium.

Lacey Spears, 26, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges of second-degree depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter in the January death of Garnett Spears, CBS’s New York affiliate reported.

Authorities believe Miss Spears poisoned her son for years and that she may have suffered from Munchausen syndrome by proxy — a behavioral pattern in which people exacerbate the afflictions of those in their care in order to seek attention.

Prosecutors said Miss Spears researched the effects of salt on the body and then fed her son lethal amounts of sodium, the station reported.

Miss Spears had a sizable following online and wrote about her son’s illness in a blog, titled “Garnett’s Journey.”

On Jan. 23, the mother said on Facebook that “Garnett the great journeyed onward today at 10:20 a.m.”

A judge denied bail for Miss Spears, who faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
