After hearing the show\u2019s \u201cWheelmobile\u201d \u2014 the show\u2019s traveling audition studio \u2014 would make a stop in Decatur, Kamienski and her friends made the drive south to audition.\n\nOnce in Decatur, producers had the prospective contestants fill out applications, which were then drawn at random. Those selected would then participate in a mock game.\n\n\u201cIronically, I never got chosen that day. My name never got drawn from the drum,\u201d Kamienski said, adding producers would review applications for callbacks.\n\nA couple of weeks later, she said, she received a call inviting her to audition once again in Springfield.\n\nAfter practicing, playing more mock games and a written test, Kamienski and other hopefuls were told they would receive a written letter should they be chosen to appear on the show.\n\nTwo weeks to the date, she said, her husband handed her a letter bearing the \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d logo, an invite to appear on a taping.\n\nWork nearly got in the way, though. Kamienski, a wedding photographer, had planned to shoot a wedding in Ireland, conflicting with the original taping date.\n\n\u201cI was devastated because I thought, \u2018There\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to call me back. I\u2019ve just lost my opportunity,\u2019\u201d Kamienski said.\n\nLuckily, she said, all was not lost, and producers did call back with another date \u2014 Sept. 11. Soon enough, Kamienski, her husband, Chris, and her mother, Cathy Stratman, were flown to Culver City, Calif., for taping.\n\n\u201cThe minute we walked in the door, they treated us like royalty,\u201d Kamienski said. \u201cThey were wonderful.\u201d\n\nWhile discussing contracts and enjoying complimentary snacks, Kamienski said the contestants were greeted by one of the show\u2019s personalities.\n\n\u201cThis lady walked in eating a peanut butter and jelly, and grabbed a Coke out of the refrigerator \u2026 and then she turned around and was like, \u2018Good morning, guys!\u2019 It was Vanna White,\u201d Kamienski said, describing the show\u2019s longtime hostess as \u201csweet as could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sat down and talked with us and asked about our families,\u201d Kamienski said. \u201cI was shocked how approachable and nice she really was.\u201d\n\nKamienski said she was in for another shock once the producers moved contestants into the studio to practice.\n\n\u201cI had heard a rumor that the wheel was kind of small and they make it look bigger on TV,\u201d Kamienski said. \u201cThat was all a big lie. The wheel is ginormous, and it is so heavy. My arm literally hurt for like two days after the show.\u201d\n\nGametime didn\u2019t start for Kamienski once the cameras started rolling. The studio filmed five episodes that day, she said. Kamienski\u2019s appearance was No. 5.\n\n\u201cIt was really fun when it was finally our turn,\u201d she said. \u201cI was standing right next to Pat, so that was really exciting.\u201d\n\nKamienski described host Sajak as kind and encouraging.\n\n\u201cHe was just wonderful. He was really encouraging and just a great guy,\u201d Kamienski said.\n\nThough she can\u2019t spill many details of the taping, Kamienski said there was an awkward moment that resulted in some laughs afterward. When Sajak asked about her occupation as a wedding photographer, Kamienski told him she dreams of becoming a criminal photographer taking photos of crime scenes.\n\n\u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018You are a sick individual,\u2019 and then he just went on with the show,\u201d Kamienski said with a laugh. \u201c\u2026 But he leaned over at commercial and said, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry I called you a sick individual.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, Kamienski said she is eagerly awaiting her night on TV. She and Chris will host a viewing party at the Washington Knights of Columbus Hall for family and friends.\n\n\u201cI love it because as a wedding photographer, I meet a lot of people. It\u2019s a great conversation starter and it\u2019s something a lot of people can identify with,\u201d Kamienski said. \u201cI love that my friends are excited for me because they think it\u2019s fun, but then my friends\u2019 parents are excited because they also watch the show. Even my kids \u2014 who are 10 years old and 8 years old \u2014 watch the show all the time, so it\u2019s nice because not only has it been a long, withstanding show, but it\u2019s definitely a show that stretches all generations, so everybody can enjoy it together. Just to be able to be a part of that was just so much fun.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kara Kamienski can\u2019t tell you how much money she\u2019s won.\r\nShe can\u2019t say how many vowels she\u2019s bought, or how many puzzles she\u2019s solved.\r\nBut she can say the chance to appear on one of television\u2019s most iconic game shows was \u201cfantastic,\u201d not to mention Pat Sajak and Vanna White are as nice in real life as they appear on TV screens across America.\r\nKamienski will appear as a contestant on Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cWheel of", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-9ACA696C-05FD-47EE-B441-37FD20FA5673-pub264"}, "author": "Dylan Polk GateHouse Media Illinois", "og": {"site_name": "Journal Star", "image": {"width": 513, "identifier": "http://GM2-IPweb.newscyclecloud.com/storyimage/IP/20151206/NEWS/151209584/AR/0/AR-151209584.jpg", "height": 768}, "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kara Kamienski can\u2019t tell you how much money she\u2019s won.\r\nShe can\u2019t say how many vowels she\u2019s bought, or how many", "title": "Washington woman to appear on Friday episode of 'Wheel of Fortune'"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17800696, "title": "Washington woman to appear on Friday episode of 'Wheel of Fortune'", "image": {"src": "http://GM2-IPweb.newscyclecloud.com/storyimage/IP/20151206/NEWS/151209584/AR/0/AR-151209584.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630"}, "site": "@pjstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kara Kamienski can\u2019t tell you how much money she\u2019s won.\r\nShe can\u2019t say how many vowels she\u2019s bought, or how many puzzles she\u2019s solved.\r\nBut she can say the chance to appear on one of television\u2019s most iconic game shows was \u201cfantastic,\u201d not to mention Pat Sajak and Vanna White are as nice in real life as they appear on TV screens across America.\r\nKamienski will appear as a contestant on Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cWheel of"}, "bt": {"modDate": "20151207T00:26:00Z", "pubDate": "20151207T00:26:00Z", "author": "Dylan Polk GateHouse Media Illinois"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417961115?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-pjstar", "fb": {"app_id": 227092457330017}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.spreedinc.providers.gatehousemedia.peoriajournalstar", "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-9ACA696C-05FD-47EE-B441-37FD20FA5673-pub264"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Kamienski will appear as a contestant on Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d airing at 6:30 p.m. on WMBD-TV.\nWhen Sajak asked about her occupation as a wedding photographer, Kamienski told him she dreams of becoming a criminal photographer taking photos of crime scenes.\nKamienski, a wedding photographer, had planned to shoot a wedding in Ireland, conflicting with the original taping date.\n\u201cI had heard a rumor that the wheel was kind of small and they make it look bigger on TV,\u201d Kamienski said.\n\u201cI love it because as a wedding photographer, I meet a lot of people."}
