Office manager Teresa O\u2019Donnell told Clinton about how her monthly costs for health care insurance for her family of four went from $490 to $1,081 a month. \u201cI know Obama told us that we\u2019d be paying a little more. But doubling, over doubling, my health insurance cost has not been \u2018a little more.\u2019 It has been difficult to come up with that kind of payment every month. I would like to vote Democratic, but it\u2019s cost me a lot of money, and I\u2019m just wondering if Democrats really realize how difficult it\u2019s been on working-class Americans to finance Obamacare?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked.\n\nMs. O\u2019Donnell to the contrary notwithstanding, Obama actually promised that Obamacare would lower premiums by an average of $2500 per family. It was one of the several core promises Obama made to cram the law down our throats. Each one of the promises was a calculated lie. O\u2019Donnell must have missed that, but she certainly asked a good question.\n\nClinton struggled to answer the question. In order to buy some time she first quizzed O\u2019Donnell about her coverage. Then she unspooled a run-on sentence of Faulknerian length. \u201cOK, well, first of all let me say, I very much want to get the cost down and that is going to be my mission because I do think that for many, many people, but there are exceptions, like what you\u2019re telling me, having the Affordable Care Act has reduced cost, has created a real guarantee of insurance, because if you\u2019d had a pre-existing condition under the old system you wouldn\u2019t have gotten affordable insurance, so it\u2019s done a lot of really good things, but it has become increasingly clear that we\u2019re going to have to get the cost down,\u201d she said.\n\nAre price controls and the consequences they entail in the future under Madam Hillary?\n\nThe video below has Chelsea Clinton decrying the \u201ccrushing costs\u201d of Obamacare. She reports that Madam Hillary is open to using \u201cexecutive action\u201d to reduce \u201ccrushing costs\u201d of Obamacare. The video appears to be taken at an event with the camera turned to the audience rather than Chelsea, but her voice is clearly audible.\n\nThe video picks up with \u201c\u2026cap on out of pocket expenses. This was part of my mom\u2019s original plan back in \u201993 and \u201994, as well as premium costs.\u201d The two go together. Otherwise a cap on out of pocket expenses would simply require higher premiums. Capping both will make private insurance unprofitable and lead to the imposition of the Bernie Objective.\n\nChelsea\u2019s exposition continues: \u201cWe can either do that directly or through tax credits. And, kind of figuring out whether she could do that through executive action, or she would need to do that through tax credits working with Congress. She thinks either of those will help solve the challenge of kind of the crushing costs that still exist for too many people, who even are part of the Affordable Care Act and buying insurance\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a preview of coming attractions under the Clinton administration. Ed Morrissey elaborates in \u201cWe gotta fix Obamacare\u2019s crushing costs says\u2026Chelsea Clinton.\u201d The Daily Mail reads the entrails in \u201cChelsea Clinton attacks Obamacare\u2019s \u2018crushing costs\u2019 and hints her mother would change Democrats\u2019 key policy.\u201d\n\nVia Shoshanna Weissman/Weekly Standard.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "During the Clinton hour of the Democratic infomercial on CNN in Columbus earlier this month, the moderator called on victim of Obamacare.
