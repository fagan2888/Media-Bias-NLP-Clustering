John C. Calhoun during the so-called tariff crisis in the late 1820s and early 1830s. By doing this, they completely ignore nullification happening in a more practical sense.\n\nCalhoun held that since each state is a party to a legal compact \u2013 the Constitution \u2013 each state had the constitutional authority to determine whether or not it had been exceeded or violated. In his conception of the process, a single state could then take a steps to legally nullify any act it deemed unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, Calhoun\u2019s scheme isn\u2019t the only path we can follow to render a federal act null and void, or simply unenforceable in practice. Looking at nullification from a results-oriented, practical understanding, there are various avenues to nullify beyond Calhoun\u2019s peculiar legal process. In fact, Thomas Jefferson himself mentioned no specific path to nullify in the Kentucky Resolutions. He never outlined a process, much less an exclusive method of nullification, like Calhoun claimed.\n\nThe nullification process Calhoun conceived tracked closely to the general principle Thomas Jefferson wrote about in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, asserting that a part of the federal government (the Supreme Court that is) could not serve as the final arbiter in determining the extent of federal power. Jefferson wrote:\n\n\u201cThe government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.\u201d\n\nBut Calhoun took this general principle and invented his own elaborate process to carry out nullification. As I noted in my handbook Smashing Myths: Understanding Madison\u2019s Notes on Nullification.\n\n\u201cThe Calhoun-inspired South Carolina plan for nullification held that if a single state declared a federal act unconstitutional, it legally repealed the law. From that point forward, the state\u2019s position would be recognized as legally binding, correct and true until \u00be of the other states, in convention, overruled the single state and overturned its nullifying act.\u201d\n\nJames Madison was asked to offer his opinion on the proposal and came down strongly against it. And rightly so, based primarily on the \u201cpeculiar\u201d (his word) process that Calhoun and South Carolina proposed. The Smashing Myths handbook covers Madison\u2019s views in more detail.\n\nAt the time of the founding, the federal government did very little in comparison to what it does today. The size, scope and reach of the federal government in the early days of the American republic would barely register as a blip in the 21st Century.\n\nBecause of its massive size and reach, the federal government has become more and more dependent on state and local support to carry out its laws and regulatory programs. We witness this with most federal programs. Here are some examples.\n\nFederal enforcement of laws across the spectrum include a state or local component in the vast majority of cases. Whether they are going after firearms, marijuana, or something else, when the feds carry out a raid, state and local law enforcement almost always supports them. In many cases, state and local personnel on the scene outnumber federal agents.\n\nPrograms like the Affordable Care Act count heavily on states to implement and execute the program. When states refuse to set up exchanges or expand Medicaid, it has a significant impact on the federal government\u2019s ability to operate the program as planned.\n\nSome federal laws, like the REAL ID act, rely almost entirely on states to implement them.\n\nToday, very few federal programs operate on federal resources alone. This holds true of NSA spying, enforcement of gun regulations, drone surveillance, prohibition and countless other federal actions.\n\nDuring the partial, temporary federal government shutdown in 2013, the National Governor\u2019s Association confirmed this reality in a statement expressing its concern.\n\nStates are partners with the federal government in implementing most federal programs. A lack of certainty at the federal level from a shutdown therefore translates directly into uncertainty and instability at the state level.\n\nNot some federal programs \u2013 most of them.\n\nLogic dictates that if a lack of participation on the federal side of this \u201cpartnership\u201d can cause problems for states, the opposite holds true as well. The \u201cFather of the Constitution\u201d knew this in 1787, and it holds true today.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, very few federal programs operate on federal resources alone.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "Pundits, members of the media, and legal experts generally focus exclusively on nullification in a purely legal sense, specifically on a particular process created and proposed by South Carolina Sen.
