I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said. \u201cA loss like that? That was ridiculous. That was \u201880s Broncos. It was just so hard to watch.\u201d\n\nSalas, who was born and raised in Colorado, added that rumors were afloat in Denver on Monday morning that the game was fixed.\n\n\u201cWe just got whipped. Some people are even thinking that it was rigged,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Seahawks country, the revelry launched from the first snap of the game.\n\nAries Rivers of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, told ICTMN it was evident that the Broncos didn\u2019t bring their A-game.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t even seem like the Seahawks were playing against anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a clean sweep. It didn\u2019t seem like they broke a sweat at all.\u201d\n\nFamed Native American photographer and die-hard Seahawks fan Matika Wilbur referred to this year\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday as the \u201cbest day of my life!...\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally cried,\u201d she said, laughing heartily. \u201cThe real Super Bowl was two weeks ago when we beat the [San Francisco] 49ers.\u201d\n\nWilbur said her mother called her late Sunday after the game and asked, \u201cAre you coming home for the holiday?\u201d referring to the Seahawks\u2019 win.\n\nWilbur said that during and after the game she felt bad for Peyton Manning. \u201cHow old is he now? Like 50? Is he ever going to get back to the Super Bowl?\u201d\n\nBut, back in Denver, not all is lost. Optimism is Monday\u2019s remedy for Broncos fans, Salas said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we made it that far,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always next year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You could almost hear the collective moan coming from Denver late Sunday as the Seattle Seahawks brought to Super Bowl XLVIII what Peyton Manning and the Broncos left at home in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/03/native-american-fans-celebrate-seattle-win-shocked-denver-loss-153390", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/broncos_and_seahawks_fans_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Native American Fans Celebrate Seattle's Super Bowl Win, Shocked by Denver Loss"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-03T14:23-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/03/native-american-fans-celebrate-seattle-win-shocked-denver-loss-153390", "dc": {"title": "Native American Fans Celebrate Seattle's Super Bowl Win, Shocked by Denver Loss"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Native American Fans Celebrate Seattle's Super Bowl Win, Shocked by Denver Loss"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bab\"", "article_summary": "Jessica Pearl Salas, a Yaqui and Navajo, told Indian Country Today Media Network that she was shocked by the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl performance.\nAries Rivers of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, told ICTMN it was evident that the Broncos didn\u2019t bring their A-game.\nIs he ever going to get back to the Super Bowl?\u201dBut, back in Denver, not all is lost.\nYou could almost hear the collective moan coming from Denver late Sunday as the Seattle Seahawks brought to Super Bowl XLVIII what Peyton Manning and the Broncos left at home in the Mile High City.\nIt didn\u2019t seem like they broke a sweat at all.\u201dFamed Native American photographer and die-hard Seahawks fan Matika Wilbur referred to this year\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday as the \u201cbest day of my life!...\u201d\u201cI literally cried,\u201d she said, laughing heartily."}
