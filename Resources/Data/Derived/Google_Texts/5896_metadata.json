This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. It cannot afford to put Democrats in charge of Congress. It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump, and maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\u201d \u201cAny other outcome is a danger to economic growth, puts our national security in peril, enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land, entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence, and undermines our constitutional republic.\u201d \u201cThere is a path to winning in November, and it comes through unity. To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement comes on the final day of the Texas Republican Party convention in Dallas. Party leaders had been urging delegates to fall in line and support Trump as the nominee to better unify the party.\n\nRead more from the convention:\n\nFall in line with Trump or resist?
