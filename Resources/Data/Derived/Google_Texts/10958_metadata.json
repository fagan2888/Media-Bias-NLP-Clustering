Koch, the billionaire brothers who are perhaps the best-known patrons of conservative Republican politics, are bespectacled and in their 70s. They look genial enough.\n\nBut Democrats are embarking on a broad effort that aims to unmask the press-shy siblings and portray them, instead, as a pair of villains bent on wrecking progressive politics.\n\nOn Thursday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is starting a digital campaign that will use Internet ads and videos, as well as social media, to tie Republican Senate candidates to the policies and actions of the Koch brothers. Its slogan: \u201cThe G.O.P. is addicted to Koch\u201d (pronounced coke).\n\nUp first on the list is Alaska, where Democrats will try to link Dan Sullivan and Mead Treadwell, the Republican Senate candidates, to an oil refinery in the state owned by Koch Companies Public Sector. The refinery is set to cease gasoline and jet fuel production, which would lead to the layoffs of roughly 80 refinery workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, foreshadowed the campaign by taking to the Senate floor on Tuesday \u2014 an unusual move \u2014 for the second time in two weeks to accuse the Koch brothers of unfairly meddling in the political system by helping to pump more than $30 million dollars so far in television advertising and other activities into the most competitive congressional races across the country. On Wednesday, he attacked them again during his weekly news conference.\n\nMany of the ads by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group backed by the Koch brothers, are especially critical of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut whether the words of Mr. Reid, a member of an institution with historically low approval ratings, and even the efforts of other Democratic groups, will be any match for what the Kochs can spend remains an open and urgent question for Democrats.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid can stand on the floor at the United States Senate and howl at the moon all night long if he wants,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist. \u201cBut the reality is that he is powerless to stop millions of Americans from watching ads that tell the personal stories of real people who have been hurt by Obamacare. He\u2019s basically spitting in the ocean and fooling himself into thinking that he\u2019s making waves.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in his Senate office on Wednesday, Mr. Reid said his outspokenness against the Kochs stemmed from his concern for the middle class. \u201cRight now, because of people like the two brothers, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is getting squeezed out of existence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re against everything that\u2019s good for America today.\u201d\n\nKoch Industries, meanwhile, accused the Senate majority leader of trying to change the subject from what it says are the destructive Democratic policies that many of the ads it supports are simply highlighting.\n\n\u201cAttacking Koch is nothing new and appears to happen whenever Senator Reid and the Democratic leadership want to distract voters from their abysmal record and failure to meaningfully address the issues in this country,\u201d said Robert A. Tappan, director of external relations for Koch Industries. \u201cCongress has a 13 percent approval rating for a reason. We are confident Americans will see through this tactic.\u201d\n\nMr. Reid said his focus on the Koch brothers was both personal and political.\n\n\u201cHow could I do nothing? How could I let these people try to buy America?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t I have an obligation, of someone that has been designated to run the Senate, to speak out when I see two people trying to buy America?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDemocrats say the strategy of spotlighting the Koch brothers\u2019 activities is politically shrewd. The majority leader was particularly struck by a presentation during a recent Senate Democratic retreat, which emphasized that one of the best ways to draw an effective contrast is to pick a villain, one of his aides said. And by scolding the Koch brothers, Mr. Reid is trying to draw them out, both to raise their public profile, and also to help rally the Democratic base.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe approach stems, in part, from Democratic-funded research showing that many voters believe the political system is rigged in favor of the super-rich.\n\n\u201cPart of responding to these attacks that the Koch brothers are spending millions upon millions on is to make sure the voters understand who is behind them, and what\u2019s behind them,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. \u201cAnd our research has shown pretty clearly that once voters recognize the source of the attacks, they tend to discount them substantially.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Garin produced a research project for Patriot Majority PAC, an outside Democratic group, looking at the public awareness that swing voters and traditionally Democratic constituencies have of the Koch brothers. He found that his focus group respondents had an \u201coverwhelmingly negative\u201d reaction to the Kochs\u2019 political involvement, with their top concern being that \u201cthe Koch brothers\u2019 agenda will hurt average people and the undermine the middle class.\u201d\n\nCraig Varoga, who runs Patriot Majority, used Mr. Garin\u2019s findings to start a \u201cStop the Greed Agenda\u201d campaign \u2014 which seeks to highlight what it views as \u201cmega-billionaire special interests,\u201d such as the Kochs\u2019, around the country. He also plans to do more to spotlight the brothers\u2019 ideological agenda this year.\n\nSenate Majority PAC, a group that supports Democratic Senate candidates, has also begun featuring the Koch brothers in their ads. An ad for Bruce Braley, a Democratic Senate candidate in Iowa, specifically warns of negative advertising by \u201cout-of-state billionaires playing politics with health care.\u201d And an ad attacking Terri Lynn Land, a Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, even features black-and-white images of the Koch brothers. \u201cTerri Lynn Land: Helping the powerful at our expense,\u201d says the ad\u2019s narrator at one point, as a photo of the brothers flashes in the background.\n\nMr. Reid, who is known for his halting, whispery speaking style, said he realized attacking the Koch brothers and their money might be a Sisyphean task, but he remains undaunted. \u201cI\u2019m going to \u2014 with my inadequate ability to speak and project \u2014 I\u2019m going to do everything I can with my lack of talent to bring attention to those guys,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140305222334, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats are embarking on a broad effort that aims to unmask Charles G. and David H.
