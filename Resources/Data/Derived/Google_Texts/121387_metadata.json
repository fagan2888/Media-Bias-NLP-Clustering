Both are reliable election losers in this state.\n\n\u201cThe party needs new messengers and new messages,\u201d he said, frankly.\n\nAs a practicing cancer doctor, he actually said something nice about Obamacare. For years he raised millions of dollars to help pay medical care for the uninsured, and he is happy that he no longer has to do that.\n\nSo what makes this guy a Republican?\n\nWell, for one thing, he talked about his displeasure with Democratic-controlled Oregon state government. He thinks it needs to run much better \u2014 not necessarily smaller, just smoother \u2014 if the state is going to grow and prosper. He said state workers are a talented lot, but their hands are tied by moribund bureaucracy, managers that don\u2019t want to make a waves and an atmosphere where imagination and excellence are so far out of the norm as to be unwelcome.\n\nHe said rural Oregon has been forgotten in the Valley-dominated statehouse.\n\nAnd that shows in economic and population declines in much of Oregon, outside of the main population centers. Pierce said he would incentivize the movement of people and resources to rural areas. No, Eastern Oregon doesn\u2019t have to be an urban center, put it has to attract enough people to make businesses profitable. And it has to have enough economic variety to keep the best and brightest from fleeing to metropolitan lights. He spoke of the need to support airplane subsidies in rural areas, like Pendleton. He called a significant statewide minimum wage hike an undue burden on economically depressed areas. He said Portland wouldn\u2019t stand for valuable, empty high rise buildings that occasionally burned and endangered the town. That\u2019s what rural Oregon has to deal with as our forests become more unhealthy and temperatures increase.\n\nAnd the Republican he bases his politics on? No, he didn\u2019t mention Ronald Reagan. Instead, it was Abraham Lincoln.\n\nPierce was short on details and heavy on generalities. But that\u2019s how you begin to introduce yourself to voters, and let both sides drill down into specifics as a long and arduous campaign moves along.\n\nClearly, it\u2019s going to take a new kind of GOP candidate to have success in Oregon \u2014 a state, remember, whose most beloved politicians have been out-of-the-mold Republicans. We\u2019re not comparing Pierce to a Hatfield or McCall, but we notice he comes from their tradition rather than the more modern, defiant, intransigent and losing one.\n\nPierce has his work cut out for him just to win the GOP nomination, much less unseat probable Democratic nominee Kate Brown. But when a candidate so clearly has a focus on rural Oregon, it\u2019s hard not to hope they stay in the game for a long time and have a significant impact on the race.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "East Oregonian", "description": "Is Bud Pierce the kind of Oregon Republican who can win a statewide election?The gubernatorial candidate and his campaign staff made their first trip to Umatilla County last week and met with the East Oregonian editorial board.
