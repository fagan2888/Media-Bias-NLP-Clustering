(AP) \u2014 An Eagle County town already popular among backcountry skiers and snowmobilers is considering building an outdoor ice-climbing park.\n\nThe town of Red Cliff is hoping the ice-climbing park will draw more visitors. Vail Daily reports (http://bit.ly/1r3Xh4n ) that the town wants to have the park open just three or four months a year, coming down in warmer months. It would be suitable for beginners.\n\nRed Cliff Mayor Scott Burgess says the climbing park would be the second biggest ice-climbing park in the country behind Ouray. The $250,000 plan awaits a vote by the board of trustees. Avon-based Apex Mountain Guides and other private investors would pay for construction.\n\nIf the ice-climbing park is approved, it could be open by the winter of 2015-16.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Vail Daily, http://www.vaildaily.com/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eagle County town mulls ice-climbing park", "title": "Eagle County town mulls ice-climbing park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/eagle-county-town-mulls-ice-climbing-park/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140808__ice-climbing-parkp1.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140808__ice-climbing-parkp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-08T05:49:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:15:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b3e\"", "article_summary": "RED CLIFF, Colo.
