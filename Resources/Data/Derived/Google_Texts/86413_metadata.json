All those things are wrapped around HR. It becomes a paper intensive world, especially in greenhouses where the employee count can be huge. We\u2019re talking about 300, 500, 1000 employees, and swings at peak time. It might go from 80 full-time, year-round to 300 employees during peak season.\n\nKeeping track of who were good employees, who doesn\u2019t need to come back, who does need to come back, how long employees have been working for you; all those things are important, especially when you\u2019re starting to get into the Affordable Care Act. You need to know how many full time equivalents you have. Do you owe them benefits, do you not?\n\nGM: Human resources can encompass a number of different subjects, including payroll, benefits, licensing, certifications, etc. In what ways does your system help simplify organizing all of these different subject areas?\n\nGL: Well the HR management system houses a centralized repository of all employee information. Whether that is health and dental benefits or beneficiary information or pay rates or certifications or worker\u2019s compensation claims in the past, it is a central repository of all that information. The benefit being that if any information is needed about that employee, it\u2019s all in one spot. When we\u2019re thinking about managing pay rates per mile or licensing expiration dates or certifications and when those certs need to be renewed, all of that can be tracked with one system.\n\nAnd the administrators can be alerted to those particular life events. Whether that\u2019s, \u201cHey, it\u2019s his work anniversary,\u201d or, \u201cUh-oh, his commercial vehicle license is about to expire. You\u2019ve probably got to make sure he gets that renewed.\u201d The administrators or those in authority can be alerted to that to take action and help.\n\nGM: How are they alerted?\n\nGL: It can be sent via an email, automatically, that says, \u201cHere is everybody whose certifications are due to expire in the next 30 days.\u201d And then continue to send you an email every day until those are corrected and renewed. Or it could be on like a centralized dashboard where they go in and look and get those notifications more in line.\n\nGM: What if an audit is being conducted? Could that information be accessed by the auditing agency? Could you provide proof of certification for particular employees?\n\nGL: If you are keeping track of that information in a centralized repository, then you can generate reports that say, \u201cHere\u2019s proof.\u201d You can even scan documents and images and attach it to that employee\u2019s file. If you wanted to make a photocopy of his driver\u2019s license for whatever we\u2019re trying to track then that can be attached to his record. And then if an audit happens, I can pull up all kinds of reports that show, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the summary of all of our employees and here\u2019s their certification dates and here is the attachments that prove that.\u201d\n\nAll that stuff can make an audit relatively easy. The alerting engine also keep us on our toes. We\u2019ll know what those auditors are requiring then, if there is some employee that has a discrepancy, we can get that pulled out with a note that says, \u201cThis particular employee doesn\u2019t have this record on file. We need to go track it down.\u201d\n\nGM: How does the system manage payroll?\n\nGL: People are the greatest asset in an organization and your business lives and dies by its people. One of the methods of retaining people is to pay them. So payroll is another thing underneath the HR blanket that is regulated and has innumerable consequences if not done correctly. One consequence is the inability to retain good help. If your payroll gets messed up, chances are pretty good people won\u2019t stay around for very long. They want to get paid and paid in a timely fashion and as agreed.\n\nIf your payroll is incorrect, you can go to jail. It\u2019s very important that payroll is done correctly. Our system not only manages benefits to those employees through an HR system, but can also handle paying those people.\n\nThe system can recognize a piece rate or bonus pay employee versus a salaried employee and everywhere in between. The other thing that our systems have are standard government reporting, whether that\u2019s printing out your W-2s at the end of the year or your 1099s or your I-9 reports or your EO reports or your 941 reports, all those reports just print naturally out of the system.\n\nThe goal is to grow your business while minimizing additional labor costs. If your business adds on 300 more customers and you have to add 50 more direct laborer employees, that\u2019s fine. But if you have to add on three more office administrative employees to manage that direct labor, that doesn\u2019t really give you a direct benefit to the production process or to the customer satisfaction process. It\u2019s just overhead. What our HR payroll system does is allow a smaller number of administrators to manage the paperwork and associated information about the employees making a direct contribution to the bottom line.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Greenhouse Management", "description": "Understanding and tracking the many aspects of HR can be challenging.
