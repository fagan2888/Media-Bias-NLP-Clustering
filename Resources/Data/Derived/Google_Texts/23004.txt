Washington

Michelle Obama is unveiling a new website for her initiative encouraging students to continue education after high school.



The first lady's aides say BetterMakeRoom.org will be a place where students ages 14-19 can access information on signing up for the SAT and ACT exams, filling out federal financial aid forms and visiting college campuses. Students can also share stories about their goals, their progress and what's inspiring them to go to college.



Mrs. Obama was announcing the website at the White House on Monday.



The White House says more than 20 media, business and nonprofit groups are assisting the campaign.
