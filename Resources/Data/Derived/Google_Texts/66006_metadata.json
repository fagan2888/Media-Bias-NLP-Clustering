In the past two years, Congress removed 100,000 housing vouchers and the federal government hasn\u2019t added government housing in more than a decade, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Columbia Housing & Redevelopment Corporation aims to defy the national trend and provide affordable homes to those in need despite budget cuts, as well as educating individuals on ways to work themselves out of a poor economic situation.\n\nAs part of the proposed 2015-2019 Tennessee Consolidation Plan, a housing and community needs survey revealed rehabilitation assistance as one of the most important housing needs for a community. To CHRC Executive Director Trent Ogilvie, rehabilitation means educating an individual on how to life a quality life just as much as providing a home for someone who\u2019s fallen on hard times.\n\n\u201cIt does relate back to education and it does relate back to, \u2018If I don\u2019t have enough income to make it, how do I have a budget to control my expenses so I\u2019m not always stuck in that deep despair of not ever having enough,\u201d Ogilvie said. \u201cIt may lead to crime, health issues, or other situations. When you\u2019re talking about affordable housing, it\u2019s directly related to what can individuals afford and how can they get access?\u201d\n\nLosing the ability to obtain a voucher removes a person\u2019s chances of escaping an area of concentrated poverty and giving them opportunities to have access to more available homes.\n\n\u201cThe section 8 voucher is really two-fold. Not only is it helping meet the need of someone who needs affordable housing, but it also gives them mobility,\u201d Ogilvie said. \u201cSo, they are no longer confined to a certain neighborhood where public housing may located or where they\u2019ve got concentrations of poverty in that neighborhood.\u201d\n\nOriginally a design by the federal government, public housing was once conceived as placing certain groups of low-income families in a designated area. That, Ogilvie says, is a recipe for concentration.\n\n\u201cRight, wrong or indifferent \u2026 they established what is called \u2018qualified census tracts.\u2019 So when you look at history, they approved money to put housing of individuals with low income in certain areas. If you continue to do that, you\u2019re going to have concentrations of poverty,\u201d Ogilvie said.\n\n\u201cYou put low income people there, minimal education, no jobs, no opportunity, then you\u2019re going to see higher crime and all of the other negative issues.\u201d\n\nSince 1959, the CHRC\u2019s mission is to avoid a concentration of poverty in Columbia and Maury County. It now oversees 296 public housing units in the five communities of Southern Hills, Creekside, Northridge, Northridge Annex and most recently, Oakwood. It has also helped to build four single-family houses, with four more planned for this year, Ogilvie said.\n\nIn order to avoid concentration, there has to be diversity in housing options and individuals must receive a qualified amount of monthly income, or as Ogilvie puts it,\u201dLove income does not mean no income.\u201d\n\nCost is based on 30 percent of a person\u2019s monthly income and if a child is under 18, he or she must be enrolled in school.\n\nCHRC\u2019s program requires more of its applicants than a record of total income, however. The root of the problem is not the lack on income, Ogilvie said, but centers around a person\u2019s behavior and understanding that things can be done to ensure they don\u2019t remain in poverty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that they have a right to affordable housing, but they have a responsibility that comes along with it,\u201d he said. We believe that we are improving the community where a lot of people are struggling. A lot of people right now pay more than 30 percent of their monthly income for housing.\u201d\n\nRent and utilities, home upkeep, lack of employment and finding proper child care are three of the biggest issues people struggle with, he said. Rents have seen a 34 percent spike since 2002, with many now paying more than 50 percent of their total gross monthly income for it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I think, as a community, you need to look at, because if a person is paying almost 50 percent of their income related to housing, that\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s why you have to have diversification of housing to meet those needs so (individuals are) within that 30 percent range,\u201d Ogilvie said. \u201cAll of those things, in my opinion, are very important.\u201d\n\nWatching the process for an individual to one day buy a house for their family without the needs of public housing gives the client a sense of self-responsibility and a sense of pride that goes beyond any dollar amount, he said.\n\n\u201cWe encourage literacy. We encourage education. We want individuals to know that affordable housing and keeping that housing affordable goes back to taking pride in where you live, valuing yourself, valuing the property that you have, and we\u2019ve come a long way as far as an agency,\u201d Ogilvie said.\n\nAt CHRC\u2019s most recent inspection by the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, the agency received a 94 out of 100, which Ogilvie said is one of the highest scores it\u2019s received despite losing 35 percent of its capital funding for housing repairs.\n\nThe CHRC has had such an impact that Maury County now has one of the highest demands for public housing. With 792 applicants currently on its waiting list, repairing the existing facilities and educating individuals to overcome the need for them is as important as it has ever been, Ogilvie said.\n\n\u201cWe want to continue to keep it, but it takes a lot of vision, a lot of hard work,\u201d Ogilvie said. \u201cIt takes a lot of money and the federal government has realized that we don\u2019t have the money to keep up all of these properties. So, we want to give you the tools to go out and raise the capital you need from the private sector, from banks or through tax credits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2008 recession left approximately 8.4 million Americans without jobs, while others experienced dropped wages and reduced work hours, forcing many to lose their homes and turn to the rental market.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "JAY POWELL jpowell@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "The 2008 recession left approximately 8.4 million Americans without jobs, while others experienced dropped wages and reduced work hours, forcing many to lose their homes and turn to the rental market.", "title": "Affordable Housing: More than a place to live", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/affordable-housing-more-place-live", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Affordable-Housing-Home-Sold_3438_swt_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/affordable-housing-more-place-live", "title": "Affordable Housing: More than a place to live", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1208563", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1208563", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T23:51:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "The affordable housing market experienced its own losses, which are still being felt at the national level.\nWe want individuals to know that affordable housing and keeping that housing affordable goes back to taking pride in where you live, valuing yourself, valuing the property that you have, and we\u2019ve come a long way as far as an agency,\u201d Ogilvie said.\nAs part of the proposed 2015-2019 Tennessee Consolidation Plan, a housing and community needs survey revealed rehabilitation assistance as one of the most important housing needs for a community.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that they have a right to affordable housing, but they have a responsibility that comes along with it,\u201d he said.\nNot only is it helping meet the need of someone who needs affordable housing, but it also gives them mobility,\u201d Ogilvie said."}
