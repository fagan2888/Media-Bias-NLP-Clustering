Monroe Community College President Anne Kross wrote, \"Unbelievable. Take this down. ... Everything about this is tone deaf and just wrong.\"\n\nDOE agreed, according to Inside Higher Ed:\n\nWe apologize for this insensitive Twitter post, which flies in the face of our mission of opening doors of opportunity for every student,\" said Dorie Nolt, [DOE] spokeswoman. \"It was an ill-conceived attempt at reaching students through social media. We are reviewing our process for approving social media content to ensure it reflects the high standards we expect at the U.S. Department of Education.\u201d\n\nBut if DOE's goal is to get as many desperate millennials to sign up for FAFSA as possible, isn't this just speaking to them in their own language? As blogger Liz Gross points out, many college applicants have used that very same \"insensitive\" language to describe themselves. In fact, #helpmeimpoor\u2014an explicit reference to the same movie\u2014exists in Twitter space and is used by debt-weary students to both laugh and vent about their situations. As Gross writes:\n\nI\u2019m a social media and market research strategist for a student loan servicer. My target audience is very close to that of @FAFSA\u2014it\u2019s the same students just a few months or years later, they\u2019ve gotten their loans and are thinking about paying them back. I\u2019m very familiar with the conversation that happens online regarding financial aid and student loans. I\u2019ve considered sending a similar tweet. Here\u2019s why. The tweet reflects the language of the audience. #HelpMeImPoor is commonly used by students when they refer to their struggles paying for college. This exact meme has been used by students in that context. These are their words. Here\u2019s just one example.\n\nI have a different take.\n\nThe cost of college has spiraled of control, plunging students into a collective trillion dollars of loan debt. It's a self-feeding loop: The federal government launches a dedicated campaign to persuade desperate students to borrow more and more money, which in turn empowers universities to keep raising prices.\n\nIsn't the idea that the government has any business convincing students to fall further into debt\u2014sticking taxpayers with the bill if anything goes wrong\u2014the truly offensive notion here?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The U.S. Department of Education issued an apology after an outcry materialized over an apparently offensive Tweet.", "title": "Education Dept.
