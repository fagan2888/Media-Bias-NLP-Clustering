It later showed a recording of Ma's opening remarks.\n\nTAIWAN WORRIES\n\nThe meeting comes as Xi hopes to cement his place among China's pantheon of great leaders and Ma, stepping down next year due to term limits, tries to shape his legacy marred by growing anti-Beijing feeling in Taiwan.\n\nWhile China is laudatory, concerns have been raised in Taiwan, and on Saturday about 500 people took to the streets in Taipei to protest against the meeting.\n\n\"Though he said he won't sign any agreements there, the Ma-Xi meeting itself shows there will definitely be some discussions or negotiations which have not been approved of by Taiwan's people,\" said protester Sung Yun-chuan.\n\nDPP leader and presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen, in a statement on her Facebook page, said the meeting could only be considered historic if it was able to express respect for Taiwan's democracy and that there should be no preconditions for the peaceful and stable development of ties with China.\n\n\"We will wait and see if this can be achieved. I want to again remind President Ma that if he cannot do this then the people of Taiwan will be very disappointed,\" she said, before the meeting happened.\n\nMa and Xi will have dinner together before they both fly out of Singapore.\n\nMa will present Xi bottles of spirits made on two groups of islands just off the mainland that have been occupied by Taiwan forces since the end of the civil war.\n\nHe will also present Xi with a ceramic sculpture of a Taiwan blue magpie perched on a leafy green branch as a gift for their first meeting, a bird unique to the island, Taiwan's presidential office said.\n\n(Amends to DPP in paragraph 24)\n\n(Additional reporting by Lee Chyen Yee, and Faith Hung and Damon Lin in Taipei; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China and Taiwan must not let proponents of Taiwan's independenc", "title": "Oppose Taiwan independence, China's Xi says at historic meeting", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/06/Leaders-China-Taiwan-meet-first-time-six-decades", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-taiwan-politics_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/06/Leaders-China-Taiwan-meet-first-time-six-decades", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-taiwan-politics_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China and Taiwan must not let proponents of Taiwan's independenc", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China and Taiwan must not let proponents of Taiwan's independence split them, China's President Xi Jinping told Taiwan's president on Saturday at the first meeting between leaders of the two sides since China's civil war ended in 1949.\nZhang Zhijun, the head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Xi told Ma that the biggest threat to the peaceful development of relations was pro-independence forces.\nMa also asked Xi indirectly to respect Taiwan's democracy.\nI want to again remind President Ma that if he cannot do this then the people of Taiwan will be very disappointed,\" she said, before the meeting happened.\nMoving into a meeting room, Xi, speaking first and sitting opposite Ma, said Chinese people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait had the ability and wisdom to solve their own problems."}
