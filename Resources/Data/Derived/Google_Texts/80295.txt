A man is in critical condition after being shot Saturday afternoon near Valley Center.

The shooting happened just before 4 p.m. in the 10000 block of 93rd St. North. The Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office says it all started with an argument between two men in a front lawn. Sheriff's Sgt. Nathan Gerdsen says one of the two men pulled out a gun and shot the other.

"First units were in the area and didn't locate a victim until 4:05 hours who reported being shot one time in the face," said Gerdsen.

The 28-year-old victim was rushed away by ambulance in critical condition.

"At that time he was conscious and breathing and taken to the local hospital," added Gerdsen.

Not too long after deputies found the victim, the shooting suspect was located as well.

"We have a person of interest in custody and are in the very infant stages of the investigation, interviews are still to be conducted," Gerdsen said.

The sheriff's office says there's much more information to gather on what led up to the argument and shooting.

"The actual relationship is unknown at this time," said Gerdsen.

Once again, the shooting suspect is in custody, but his name has not been released. Officers say charges will be determined at a later time.
