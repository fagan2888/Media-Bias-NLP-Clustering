At 8 a.m., when Bennington Free Dental Day officially opened, about 50 people were braving the windy morning air in the dental practice's parking lot, just south of Southern Vermont Medical Center.\n\nDundas, medical director of the Bennington Free Clinic, volunteered at Saturday's event to sign up community members for the health clinic and to inform them about how to obtain insurance plans through Vermont Health Connect, the state's health insurance marketplace.\n\nThe Free Adult Dental Care Day was started in southern Vermont in 2007 by Dr. Robert Ruhl, Dr. Louis Beaudette and Dr. John-Michael Stewart for adults ages 18 or older who do not have Medicaid or private dental insurance. Bennington Free Dental Day continues this initiative with the mission of addressing the dental issues of those who don't have dental care, which can cause other non-dental health issues if not properly treated. Accordingly, other health organizations were at the event like SVMC and BROC Community Action in Southwestern Vermont.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParticipants in the free clinic passed through five stations before meeting being evaluated for dental treatment: blood pressure readings and a brief smoking intervention if needed; a finger stick diabetes pre-screening; a body mass index (BMI) reading with weight loss info for those over the ideal BMI; voter registration; and health clinic information. Dundas said the diabetes pre-screening machine was not working in the morning due to the cold weather.\n\n\"Sue has had to keep the machine in her pocket to warm it up,\" he said, referring to Sue Andrews, executive director of Greater Bennington Interfaith Community Services. She explained her understanding of the current dental care situation in southern Vermont: According to her, the Bennington insurance payer mix is skewed to Medicaid due to a higher rate of low-income families and individuals. Since Medicaid does not pay the full cost of a dental visit, Medicaid patients are often ineligible to receive a full visits' worth of care. If dentists treat patients beyond what Medicaid pays for, their practices incur out-of-pocket costs for every Medicaid patient they see, which can be a lot.\n\nBennington Free Dental Day was unable to treat people with Medicaid, but Dr. Roger Hirschberg of Union Street Dental in Bennington was receiving and working with these patients.\n\nAndrews claimed that more people have been buying dental insurance plans in Vermont through the Affordable Care Act. She approximated that one individual can pay $50 per month for up to $1,500 worth of dental care per year.\n\nAfter people completed the five outdoor stations at Free Dental Day, they went inside to get X-rays and find out if they needed teeth extracted or restorative procedures. Paula Sherman of Oral Surgery Associates, who coordinated Bennington Free Dental Day, was one of three staff members registering patients at the front desk. Once patients were called in, Dr. Richard Barbierri conducted triages to determine each person's most immediate dental need.\n\nSeveral dentists such as Dr. Justin Salem, Dr. David Rothschild and Dr. Christopher Bevin were doing on-site extractions. All restorative work was done off-site by Drs. Loren Peck and Robert Cauley at Union Street Dental or by Dr. Anita Masaitis in Dr. Rich Heilmann's Manchester office. Dental hygienists and assistants from Bennington, Brattleboro, Pittsfield and North Adams helped dentists on-site.\n\nDr. Barbierri recognizes a large need in the Berkshires and southern Vermont for dental care across all phases of dentistry. Throughout his work in the area, he has seen high cavity rates among young adults. He saw teeth so badly damaged on Saturday that he perceived no other choice but to recommend tooth extractions for those patients.\n\n\"Fluoride can help these problems immensely,\" he said.\n\nSaturday was the first free dental clinic for Raven Vanderburgh, 25, of Bennington. She had two broken wisdom teeth with nerves exposed, both of which were extracted. She is currently without insurance, but she seeks to treat her cavities once she obtains a dental plan.\n\n\"The dentists were excellent. It was a very good experience, and I was scared,\" said Vanderburgh. According to dental assistant Aaron Rothschild, cost and fear are two prevailing factors keeping people from getting dental treatment.\n\nJanet Foley, another Bennington resident and patient at the clinic, feels that Bennington County should have a sliding-scale fee system for people who want restorative dental work. The sliding-scale system means reduced dental costs for individuals or families based on income and other factors. She said she makes too much money to be eligible for insurance subsidies, but the money she has pays for her son's healthcare. Without insurance subsidies, Janet said she cannot afford restorative treatment, which can be more expensive than extractions.\n\nLaurie Figary of Pownal was happy to get teeth pulled today due to how seriously they were decaying. She felt that a lack of calcium in her diet in addition to the unhealthy food she obtained at food banks led to her dental issues. Laurie had to use her Medicaid to pay for hearing aids and glasses, so she did not have enough money left to pay for a dental visit, she said.\n\nSouthwestern Vermont Health Care Financial Counselor Sue Daugherty attended Free Dental Day to inform people about signing up for Vermont Health Connect and help them create a stronger insurance plan. As a navigator, she is certified to assist people in obtaining supplementary insurance. For example, Paula Sherman directed one patient to Daugherty because the patient had Medicare and was potentially eligible for a secondary insurance plan through Vermont Health Connect that could provide additional financial assistance. This does not guarantee people dental insurance, Daugherty explained, but it can remove some financial burdens, help people save money and eventually lead to their obtaining dental insurance.\n\nDaugherty also explained how she might inform people about a spend-down, in which a person who is ineligible for public health insurance based on his or her income can spend money out-of-pocket to meet the income requirements for programs like Medicaid.\n\nA small of group of Free Dental Day attendees were families who were either undocumented citizens or who had trouble communicating in English and required interpreters. Carlos Mendez, 21, served as an interpreter for patients that day who spoke primarily Spanish. A senior at Bennington College and originally from Los Angeles, is heavily involved in the Latino community action group on his campus called GANAS.\n\n\"People think about Latinos being in the Bennington area is surprising. Just like everyone else, they need healthcare,\" he said.\n\nMendez feels that the local Latino community is isolated, and so GANAS seeks to integrate these residents into the greater Bennington community since many of them have been living here for years, he said.\n\nSue Andrews added that though Vermont law provides permits for undocumented citizens, being seen is still dangerous for undocumented Latino families, and obtaining health insurance runs the risk of being found out by the federal government.\n\nOn Saturday, one Spanish-speaking family consisted of several undocumented individuals, but the baby in the family was born in the United States and is thus eligible for Dr. Dynasaur, low-cost health coverage in Vermont for children, teens and pregnant women.\n\nAccording to Andrews, undocumented citizens in the area sometimes work 80-hour weeks under another person's social security number so as to not get caught by the federal government, so they pay taxes to cover themselves but do not receive the benefits since they are not technically registered citizens. Many of these people, she said, wouldn't even come to a free clinic like Saturday's because due to fear.\n\nBennington Free Dental Day addressed what many of its organizers feel is a serious need for improved and increased dental health in the southern Vermont and Berkshires regions. Though patients who attended the event might be able to afford some sort of private health coverage through Vermont Health Connect, the next open enrollment for this program is not until January 1, 2016.\n\nJacob Colon can be reached at jcolon@benningtonbanner.com or (802) 447-7567 ext. 118.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.benningtonbanner.com/localnews/ci_27993670/bennington-free-dental-day-draws-about-50-at", "sailthru.author": "By Jacob Colon \n  jcolon@benningtonbanner.com  @JacobLColon on Twitter", "ag": {"canon": "BenningtonBanner:article:27993670:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-26T17:26:17-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "benningtonbanner.com", "description": "BENNINGTON &GT;&GT; According to Dr. Richard Dundas, people began to arrive at Oral Surgery Associates at 2 Harwood Drive in the middle of the night on Saturday in order to receive first-come, first-serve free dental care.
