Ted Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE (R-Texas) on Wednesday called for his colleagues to reject an annual defense bill because of the \u201cextreme land grab\u201d tacked onto the measure.\n\nThe bipartisan proposed bill, released late Tuesday, includes a variety of public land and energy provisions, including designating new national parks and wilderness areas, and speeding the permitting process for oil and gas drilling, and energy and mineral measures.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCruz called the provisions and the decision to attach them to the National Defense Authorization Act \u201can extreme land grab to the NDAA [that] is a disservice to members of the Armed Forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the military\u2019s shrinking budget, it is offensive that this bill would be used to fund congressional pork,\u201d Cruz, a top subject of speculation for the 2016 presidential election, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAnd, at a time where jobs are scarce, and the federal government has removed billions of acres of land from productive use, Congress should not be restricting more than a half-million new acres,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s statement focused on the conservation aspects of the public land package, including 250,000 acres of new wilderness designations; 400,000 acres of land taken out of commercial use; and 15 new national parks or park expansions.\n\nThe defense bill is considered must-pass legislation, as it authorizes Defense Department operations.\n\nCruz asked the House and Senate to reject the bill, which he called an attempt by \u201cself-serving politicians\u201d to exploit service members.\n\nThe top senators from both parties who are responsible for the defense bill defended it Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHopefully, people will be persuaded that this is a bipartisan, [Energy and Natural Resources] Committee package, bicameral, that has been thoroughly vetted by the committee, and will not object to its passage,\u201d said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get things done around here, and it\u2019s not the ideal way to legislation, obviously,\u201d he added, noting that the Energy panel supports the package.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the Armed Services Committee\u2019s top Republican, said he agreed with Republicans who oppose the land provisions but defended them as necessary to passing the defense measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d he said. \u201cI dislike it just as much as anybody else. But you have to have a bill. That\u2019s what people lose sight of.\u201d\n\nRep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the move is not out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cAs it has traditionally done, this year's annual national defense bill contains natural resources provisions that are the result of a bipartisan agreement,\u201d Hastings said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe agreement offers a balanced approach to public lands management, providing opportunities for new job creation and energy and mineral production, while simultaneously protecting special areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Martin Matishak contributed to this report, which was updated at 2:37 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Cruz called on colleagues to reject the must-pass legislation.", "description": "Cruz called on colleagues to reject the must-pass legislation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Cruz called on colleagues to reject the must-pass legislation.", "title": "Cruz decries 'extreme land grab' in defense bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/225877-cruz-federal-land-provisions-in-defense-bill-unacceptable", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-03T15:12:57-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-03T15:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/225877-cruz-federal-land-provisions-in-defense-bill-unacceptable", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-03T14:07-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Public land, National Defense Authorization Act,Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T14:07:41-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T15:12:57-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/225877-cruz-federal-land-provisions-in-defense-bill-unacceptable", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Cruz called on colleagues to reject the must-pass legislation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cruz decries 'extreme land grab' in defense bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Cruz decries 'extreme land grab' in defense bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbae0\"", "article_summary": "The defense bill is considered must-pass legislation, as it authorizes Defense Department operations.\nThe top senators from both parties who are responsible for the defense bill defended it Wednesday.\n\u201cAs it has traditionally done, this year's annual national defense bill contains natural resources provisions that are the result of a bipartisan agreement,\u201d Hastings said in a statement.\nThat\u2019s what people lose sight of.\u201dRep.
