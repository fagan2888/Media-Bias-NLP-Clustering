Virginity may seem like the “simple” act of having sex for the first time, but according to the documentary “How To Lose Your Virginity,” there is a lot more to someone’s “first time.” Filmmaker Therese Shechter sat down with “sex educators, virginity auctioneers, abstinence advocates, and young men and women who bare their tales of doing it — or not doing it” to find out what it really means to lose your V-card.

Although religions and abstinence activists would have us believe that a woman can only stay “pure” by maintaining her virginity until marriage, as the film points out, they rarely blueprint what actually constitutes losing your virginity. After all, there is no medical definition for Female Virginity. This lack of clarity often leads to some interesting questions by young women who wonder when or if they lost their virginity.

For example: “He only put in for a minute,” or “It was only in half an inch. Does that count?” “If I masturbated did I lose my virginity?” All of these questions and many more are discussed by Shechter and her guests, who are looking to uncover “the myths and misogyny surrounding a rite of passage that many obsess about but few truly understand.”
