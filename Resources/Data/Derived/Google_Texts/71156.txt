Two Jackson County men are behind bars after police arrested them Saturday for armed robbery.

Demarcus Staley, 20 and Reginald Williams Jr., 20, were both arrested by Graceville Police Saturday.

According to reports, Saturday, the Bonifay Police Department responded to a local medical care facility in reference to a report of an armed robbery. The victim told officials about the armed robbery, which began by the victim being followed by the suspects to his place of employment from Jackson County.

The Graceville Police Department located and apprehended the suspects within minutes. The suspects were transported to the Jackson County Jail to await first appearance and extradition back to Holmes County.

Bonifay Police Chief Chris Wells stated in a release that he, "Appreciates the assistance rendered by the Graceville Police Department in locating the suspects in such a timely manner," Wells stated. “I greatly appreciate the manpower and assistance provided by the Graceville Police Department in this investigation. We have to work together to get the job done and this case is a good example of cooperation among our agencies.”
