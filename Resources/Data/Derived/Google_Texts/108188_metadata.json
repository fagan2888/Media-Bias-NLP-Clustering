The Anthem hackers made off with names, birth dates, home addresses, salary information and, most importantly, Social Security numbers. Medical records and credit card data were not exposed.\n\nBut a stolen Social Security number is worth roughly 10 to 20 times more than a stolen credit card number, said John Gunn, of data security firm VASCO. Unlike credit cards, Social Security numbers are never reissued.\n\n\u201c10 years from now, I can still sell your Social Security number,\u201d he said.\n\nMost high-profile breaches to date \u2014 including those at Target, Home Depot and Neiman Marcus \u2014 exposed shoppers\u2019 credit card data. In aggregate, well over 100 million credit card numbers were stolen.\n\nThe value of the data stolen in the Anthem breach is the equivalent of a billion stolen credit card numbers, Gunn said.\n\nWith such desirable data flowing between federal exchange sites and insurers, lawmakers on Thursday emphasized the need to bolster the government\u2019s cyber defenses.\n\n\u201cCertainly we need to make sure our own government websites and our cyber assets are secure,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nQuestions about HealthCare.gov are rising at a crucial moment for the Obama administration.\n\nWith less than two weeks before the healthcare law's 2015 enrollment deadline, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appears poised to meet its target of 9.1 million paid enrollments.\n\nThis sign-up period has proceeded smoothly for the federal exchange in a victory for HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was nominated in part as a fixer who could avoid the mistakes of ObamaCare's first year online. Security experts have given the site much higher marks in its second year.\n\nPerhaps as a result, Republican attacks on the technical aspects of healthcare implementation have quieted substantially in the last eight months.\n\nIndeed, most congressional Republicans used the Anthem incident not to bash ObamaCare but to push for cybersecurity legislation.\n\nLawmakers are considering two main cyber bills. One would provide legal liability protections for companies sharing cyber threat information with the government. The other would likely create federal data security standards and require companies to notify both their customers and the government following data breaches.\n\nThe White House has also issued its own legislative proposals for both bills.\n\nThe Anthem breach \u201cshows again why it\u2019s so important that we take some of those initial first steps,\u201d said Johnson, whose committee is preparing its own version of an information sharing measure. \u201cEvery last one of these additional attacks certainly improves the chance of us passing something because people realize how important it is.\u201d\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) has already said he will hold hearings on the Anthem incident in an attempt to build more momentum for cyber legislation. Anthem officials will also brief the Energy and Commerce panel on Friday.\n\nIndustry groups and government officials argue both measures are needed to bolster the country\u2019s cybersecurity. Privacy advocates have concerns that enhanced information sharing could allow the government to collect more sensitive information on Americans.\n\nThe Anthem hack will only fuel these debates, raising questions about the best way for the government and Congress to protect healthcare networks.\n\n\u201cDoes it make sense for Anthem to be leading the response when it\u2019s something that could involve more than Anthem?\u201d Budd asked.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about moving forward, how do we ensure that anybody's personal information is safe? What\u2019s the best way to do that?\u201d Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune John ThuneSelf-driving cars: The next great leap in automotive safety Overnight Tech: Senate panel poised to advance email privacy bill Senators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security MORE (R-S.D.) told The Hill.\n\nAnthem may be the first major healthcare breach, but it won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more,\u201d Hatch said.\n\nElise Viebeck contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Worries rise about security of health data.", "description": "Worries rise about security of health data.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Worries rise about security of health data.", "title": "Anthem hack raises ObamaCare concerns", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/231956-anthem-hack-raises-obamacare-concerns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-06T12:00:17-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-06T12:00-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/231956-anthem-hack-raises-obamacare-concerns", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-05T18:45-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "ObamaCare, Data security,Ron Johnson, Orrin Hatch, Fred Upton, John Thune,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-05T18:45:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T12:00:17-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/231956-anthem-hack-raises-obamacare-concerns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Worries rise about security of health data.", "card": "summary", "title": "Anthem hack raises ObamaCare concerns"}, "dcterms.title": "Anthem hack raises ObamaCare concerns"}, "article_summary": "The other would likely create federal data security standards and require companies to notify both their customers and the government following data breaches.\nThe mammoth data breach at health insurer Anthem Inc. has given new life to concerns about whether information shared with federal healthcare websites is safe.\n\u201cDoes it make sense for Anthem to be leading the response when it\u2019s something that could involve more than Anthem?\u201d Budd asked.\nIndeed, most congressional Republicans used the Anthem incident not to bash ObamaCare but to push for cybersecurity legislation.\nThe Anthem hack will only fuel these debates, raising questions about the best way for the government and Congress to protect healthcare networks."}
