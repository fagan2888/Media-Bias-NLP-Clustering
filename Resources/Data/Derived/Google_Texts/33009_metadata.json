Often, it\u2019s manifested as the change from sullenness to downright indifference. A recent study now supports that lag, as scientists from Link\u00f6ping University have developed a suicide test that is 97 percent accurate at predicting a depressed person\u2019s risk.\n\nThe link between depression and suicide has been known for some time, yet hard data on how to concretely assess a person\u2019s suicide risk has remained light. Simple questionnaires may be effective, but the new blood test, which measures circulation and blood pressure in the person\u2019s sweat glands, has now quantified a previously qualitative analysis.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, the study involved 783 depressed in-patients in Germany who were tested for hyporeactivity \u2014 a measure of slow reaction time. Later assessments of the subjects showed hyporeactivty in 97 percent of the people who committed suicide, compared to only two percent in the people that did not. \u201cThe results are so strong that I\u2019m astonished\u201d, said Lars-H\u00e5kan Thorell, associate professor in experimental psychiatry at Link\u00f6ping University, in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the risk for false-positives. The test didn\u2019t differentiate between someone moderately depressed and someone who is severely depressed, which means that just because someone shows hyporeactivity doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re suicidal. Rather, the effect goes the opposite direction: people who were suicidal showed greater rates of hyporeactivity.\n\n\u201c[The test] indicates a certain percent, even if the normal population can have this neurophysical disorder,\u201d Thorell points out. \u201cEveryone who has it is not suicidal \u2014 but almost all suicidal, depressed patients have it.\u201d Other measures to keep in mind are the fact that 80.2 percent of bipolar patients showed hyporeactivity, 67.3 percent of depressed patients, and 58.5 percent of other diagnoses. In other words, a very large group of people may show hyporeactivity, and the suicide rate may be very small, yet those who committed suicide nearly always showed hyporeactivity.\n\nThorell and his colleagues measured hyporeactivity via sensors placed on subjects\u2019 fingers, which would pick up their reaction time to a pattern of tones. When a tone first plays, the subject nearly always reacts. But each subsequent tone yields slower reaction. \u201cA depressed person has a biological inability to care about the surroundings, while a healthy person continues to react,\u201d Thorell said.\n\nGoing forward, Thorell will conduct larger studies in 15 other countries to better understand the role hyporeactivity plays in predicting suicidality. What still needs unpacking are the specific differences between those at risk for suicide and the hyporeactivity found in otherwise healthy patients. Someone who is only moderately depressed, or just beginning to show symptoms, may not benefit \u2014 indeed, may come into harm depending on the person\u2019s medication \u2014 from suicide prevention efforts. Such are the limits of looking backward in a study.\n\nNevertheless, Thorell remains hopeful given his team\u2019s latest findings. \u201cWe can determine very accurately whether a person risks committing suicide,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich can revolutionize suicide prevention.\"\n\nSource: Thorell L, Wolfersdorf M, Straub R.
