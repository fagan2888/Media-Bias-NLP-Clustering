In announcing his bid today for speaker of the House of Representative, Rep. Louie Gohmert promised to be the engine of change that conservatives have been calling for in their rebellion against the establishment wing of the Republican Party.

If elected speaker, @RepLouieGohmert says he will “fight amnesty tooth and nail.”

“It is time for a change; it really is time for a change,” Gohmert said on “Fox & Friends” while announcing his campaign to unseat incumbent Speaker John Boehner.

Gohmert, R-Texas, criticized Boehner, R-Ohio, for a “number of years of broken promises,” and specifically challenged the speaker’s decision to pass the “CRomnibus” spending bill in December without blocking President Obama’s executive actions on immigration.

If elected speaker, Gohmert said he will “fight amnesty tooth and nail.”

He said his agenda would also include defunding Obamacare and having “positive solutions that will return power back to the people.”

House members are set to vote for their next speaker on Tuesday.

Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., announced Saturday that he is also willing to serve as an alternative to Boehner.
