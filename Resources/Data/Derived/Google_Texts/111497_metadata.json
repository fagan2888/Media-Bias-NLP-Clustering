Besides, he said, the country\u2019s budget relies heavily on income from oil exports. Russia can\u2019t balance its budget unless the average price of oil is about $100 a barrel.\n\nRelated: Falling Oil Prices Will Hurt Russia, Iran and ISIS\n\nEven that price may be too low. Some analysts say oil should sell at up to $115 a barrel to allow Russia to balance its budget because spending has risen dramatically for social programs and the military. Further, US and European Union sanctions on Russia\u2019s financial as well as oil sectors have left the government short of cash.\n\nRussia doesn\u2019t have the technology, the infrastructure or even the climate to control the price of oil, according to Valery Nesterov, an analyst with Russia\u2019s Sberbank CIB. He told Reuters that it can\u2019t simply halt production at some fields because they\u2019ll \u201cjust freeze if you stop them.\u201d And Russia lacks the modern equipment needed to prevent that.\n\nFurther, Nesterov said, Russia should have followed China\u2019s lead by building storage facilities for fuel reserves. As one anonymous Western oil trader told Reuters, even if Russia held back on some oil for export, \u201cwhere would you put it?\u201d\n\nIn fact, there are two storage possibilities, though neither is optimal. One would be the Transneft pipeline system, which was built to store as well as transfer oil. But it wasn\u2019t designed for prolonged storage.\n\nThen there\u2019s the floating storage vessel Belokamenka in the Barents Sea north of Western Russia. But it can hold no more than 2.6 million barrels. One anonymous oil industry official told Reuters that even Belokamenka isn\u2019t an option because \u201cyou will need 365 like it to take off 2 million barrels per day from the market.\u201d Russia\u2019s exports now stand at 4 million barrels per day.\n\nRelated: Investors Say \u2018Nyet\u2019 to Russian Bond Sales\n\nSo Russia must put the onus of price support on other oil-producing countries as OPEC\u2019s summit on production levels looms on Nov. 27 in Vienna. Minister Novak and Igor Sechin, the CEO of the Kremlin-owned oil giant Rosneft, are also due to meet with OPEC member Venezuela in Vienna, which has been outspoken about the need for the cartel to cut production.\n\nAs oil producers such as Venezuela and Russia fret about the drop in oil prices, more affordable energy would benefit the worldwide economy, according to Fred Beach, who specializes in energy, military affairs and government policy at the University of Texas\u2019 Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cI think the global economy will be the biggest winner, and will sustain the lower prices for some time,\u201d Beach told the Russian television network RT. \u201cMany people feel the global recession was really triggered by the rise in oil prices back in 2000-2008. Some of the slow growth or stagnant growth in the global economy is because the prices stayed so high for so long.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared at OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nRussia-China Deal Could Kill U.S. LNG Exports\n\nWant To Hurt Russia?
