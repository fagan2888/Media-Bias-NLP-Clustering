Instead, it\u2019s one that any company would love to have.\n\nWith CGI approaching $1-billion in annual free cash flow, investors will likely be pushing to hear more about what all this cash will be used for.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber expects CGI will deliver approximately $200-million in FCF when it reports fourth quarter results in mid-November. He attributes these gains to diminishing integration payments associated with the Logica acquisition and anticipated margin expansion.\n\nThat gain would bring CGI\u2019s trailing 12-month FCF to about $700-million, up from $427-million in fiscal 2013. RBC forecasts the company will generate $1.1-billion of FCF in fiscal 2016.\n\n\u201cWith higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI\u2019s potential uses of cash,\u201d Mr. Teiber told clients. \u201cCGI\u2019s top priorities for cash are: organic investments, share buybacks, de-leveraging and acquisitions; dividends are a lower priority.\u201d\n\nHe believes CGI may start to allocate more capital to share buybacks as opposed to debt repayment in the near term, since the former is more accretive and CGI trades below its peers.\n\nMr. Teiber also pointed to CGI\u2019s US$855-million debt financing in September at attractive rates, the fact that share buybacks have lagged CGI\u2019s 10-year average since the Logica deal, its lower leverage since soon after the deal, and a share price that is below the level of prior repurchases.\n\nMeanwhile, the analyst suggested another acquisition would be a possible material catalyst.\n\n\u201cCGI\u2019s ability to find hidden gems, which are accretive and strategically attractive (like the AMS acquisition in 2004) or extract maximum share price and EPS accretion (like the Logica acquisition in 2012) create the most shareholder value,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"With higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI's potential uses of cash.\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "\"With higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI's potential uses of cash.\"", "title": "CGI Group Inc has an enviable cash problem", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/investing/trading-desk/cgi-group-inc-has-an-enviable-cash-problem", "image": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/cgi1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "\"With higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI's potential uses of cash.\"", "title": "CGI Group Inc has an enviable cash problem", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/cgi1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "trading desk, cgi group inc.", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2a9\"", "article_summary": "He attributes these gains to diminishing integration payments associated with the Logica acquisition and anticipated margin expansion.\nWith CGI approaching $1-billion in annual free cash flow, investors will likely be pushing to hear more about what all this cash will be used for.\n\u201cWith higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI\u2019s potential uses of cash,\u201d Mr. Teiber told clients.\nCGI Group Inc. has a problem.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber expects CGI will deliver approximately $200-million in FCF when it reports fourth quarter results in mid-November."}
