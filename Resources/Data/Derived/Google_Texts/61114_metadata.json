And the opposing camps will be further energized by Republican-led congressional investigations of Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing convergence of events,\u201d said Charmaine Yoest, CEO of the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a moment like this for 40 years.\u201d\n\nIn the presidential race, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is a longtime defender of abortion rights and has voiced strong support for Planned Parenthood \u2014 a major provider of abortions, health screenings and contraceptives.\n\nNearly all GOP candidates favor overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Some top contenders \u2014 including Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 disapprove abortions even in cases of rape and incest.\n\n\u201cWe may very well have the most extreme Republican presidential nominee since Roe \u2014 a nominee who\u2019s not in favor of abortion in any possible way,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List. The organization, which supports female candidates who back abortion rights, says it is en route to breaking its fundraising records. A similar claim is made by some anti-abortion political action groups.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed for this election? One factor is the increased polarization of the two major parties. Only a handful of anti-abortion Democrats and abortion-rights Republicans remain in Congress, and recent votes attempting to ban late-term abortions and halt federal funding to Planned Parenthood closely followed party lines.\n\nAnother difference: Republicans in the presidential field and in Congress seem more willing than in past campaigns to take the offensive on abortion-related issues. Past nominees George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney opposed abortion but were not as outspoken as some of the current GOP candidates.\n\n\u201cAbortion will bubble over into the general election,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which supports female candidates opposed to abortion. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to handle this issue, you will be eviscerated.\u201d\n\nAlso unfolding will be a new investigation launched by House Republicans to examine Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Planned Parenthood\u2019s leaders say a majority of U.S. voters oppose efforts to cut off its federal funding, most of which subsidizes health services for patients on Medicaid. Planned Parenthood\u2019s political action fund hopes to spend a record amount \u2014 more than $15 million \u2014 on election-related advocacy.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Abortion to be a hot issue on presidential campaign trail", "title": "Abortion to be a hot issue on presidential campaign trail", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/27/abortion-to-be-a-hot-issue-on-presidential-campaign-trail/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_113633_denverpost.com-20150710__Right-to-Life-Convention-p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_113633_denverpost.com-20150710__Right-to-Life-Convention-p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T18:18:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:59:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And the opposing camps will be further energized by Republican-led congressional investigations of Planned Parenthood.\nThe organization, which supports female candidates who back abortion rights, says it is en route to breaking its fundraising records.\n\u201cAbortion will bubble over into the general election,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B.
