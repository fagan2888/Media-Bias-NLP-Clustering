Police responded to an early morning robbery Sunday. They say are currently searching for one suspect.

It happened around 2:00 Sunday morning. Police were dispatched to the Holiday Inn on North Frontage Rd. Det. Dareall Thompson says a black male entered the business and held the clerks at gunpoint while demanding they hand over money. Investigators say once the employees gave the robber money, he ran out of the business.

Thompson describes the suspect as a tall black male, wearing a dark colored hoodie and camo pants. Thompson says he had a mustache. This description matches the suspect that robbed the Tobacco World on North Hills Street one week ago. Thompson says police are currently looking into both robberies.
