Mark Sebastian, CC BY 2.0\n\nA NASA research program will pay participants upwards of $5,000 to do nothing. Conducted by the agency\u2019s Flight Analogs Project Team at the Johnson Space Center, the Bed Rest Study is the ultimate job for people who would rather stay in bed. The experiment, which is designed to study the effects prolonged exposure to microgravity, requires participants to remain horizontal for a period of 70 days.\n\nAccording to the space agency\u2019s website, the Bed Rest Study is an ongoing effort to improve conditions for astronauts working in a weightless environment. Since large-scale studies are unfeasible in orbit, the effects of microgravity must be simulated on the ground. Head-down bed rest, it turns out, offers an excellent alternative to space flight.\n\n\u201cThis study will show how much your body, tilted down slightly with head down and feet up, for 70 days, 24-hours a day, without getting out of bed, except for limited times for specific tests, is like an astronaut\u2019s body during the weightlessness of space flight,\u201d the agency writes. \u201cWatching you will help scientists learn how an astronaut\u2019s body will change in weightlessness during space flight in the future.\u201d\n\nThe program, which divides participants into exercising subjects and non-exercising subjects, consists of three segments \u2013 the Ambulatory Period, the Bed Rest Period, and the Recovery Period. During the Ambulatory period, both groups will spend a few weeks moving around freely inside the bed rest facility. This allows researchers to monitor their bodies under normal conditions.\n\nAfter that, the Bed Rest Period begins. During this 70-day experiment, participants will spend all of their time in bed. According to The Daily Mail, subjects have access to video games, TV, books, and internet. Food is provided to maintain bodyweight.\n\nFinally, participants enter the Recovery Period. After 70 days of literally doing nothing, participants are slowly deconditioned and reintroduced to normal activity over 14 days. At the end of the study, the \u201cpillownauts\u201d will have spent between 97 and 105 days at the facility.\n\n\u201cI'm a very active person, so it's difficult to be restricted to bed sometimes, but many of us are willing to do it for the sake of future space exploration,\u201d said Heather Archuletta, who has taken part in the study three times. \u201cThe... money... is... pretty freaking awesome, however. About $5,000 per month, which is great if you've just graduated, can't find a job, are between jobs, or just plain love space exploration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nasa bed rest study, bed rest study compensation, nasa sleeping study, paying studies, flight analog project, johnson space center", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "NASA's Bed Rest Study pays participants $5,000 a month to remain horizontal in an effort to study the effects of microgravity.", "title": "NASA Will Pay You $5,000 A Month To Stay In Bed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nasa-will-pay-you-5000-month-stay-bed-bed-rest-study-requires-participants-do-nothing-70-days-257115", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-book.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NASA's Bed Rest Study pays participants $5,000 a month to remain horizontal in an effort to study the effects of microgravity.", "title": "NASA Will Pay You $5,000 A Month To Stay In Bed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nasa-will-pay-you-5000-month-stay-bed-bed-rest-study-requires-participants-do-nothing-70-days-257115", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-book.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-book.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-17T23:20:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-28T12:19:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "NASA's Bed Rest Study pays participants $5,000 a month to remain horizontal in an effort to study the effects of microgravity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9df\"", "article_summary": "The Bed Rest Study will help researchers and developers improve conditions for astronauts working in orbit, NASA said.\nConducted by the agency\u2019s Flight Analogs Project Team at the Johnson Space Center, the Bed Rest Study is the ultimate job for people who would rather stay in bed.\nThe experiment, which is designed to study the effects prolonged exposure to microgravity, requires participants to remain horizontal for a period of 70 days.\nAccording to the space agency\u2019s website, the Bed Rest Study is an ongoing effort to improve conditions for astronauts working in a weightless environment.\nAfter that, the Bed Rest Period begins."}
