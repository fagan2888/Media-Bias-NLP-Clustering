But the Senate was told in a previous session that the money was brought into the Philippines by two Chinese high-rollers, one from Macau and one from Beijing.\n\nThe hackers who infiltrated the computer systems of Bangladesh Bank tried to steal $951 million from its account at the New York Fed although most transactions were blocked.\n\nBut $81 million was transferred into four RCBC accounts at a single Manila branch, which had each been opened with a $500 deposit and remained inactive for almost a year. All of the funds were then transferred to a foreign exchange broker and further distributed.\n\n\"I am but a pawn in a high-stakes chess game played by giants in international banking and high finance,\" Maia Santos Deguito, the branch manager, told the senate committee.\n\n\"If this committee is looking for the 'grandmaster,' it is not me,\" she said.\n\nWithout naming names, Deguito blamed the crime on senior RCBC officials \"in cahoots with extremely wealthy businessmen whose far-reaching powers and influence span several countries.\"\n\nIn a previous hearing, RCBC's president and lawyer had pointed the finger at Deguito, saying that even transactions totaling hundreds of millions of dollars could be handled by branch managers without prior approval from head office.\n\nThe inquiry has led to the recovery of about $5.5 million from a Chinese casino boss and junket operator called Kim Wong, who received a total of almost $35 million through his casino company and Philrem, the foreign exchange broker.\n\nWong, who denied any involvement in the heist, promised to pay back another 450 million pesos ($9.7 million) of the stolen money, but said a portion of what he had received had already been spent on gambling chips for clients.\n\nWong said a further $17 million remained with Philrem, whose husband-and-wife representatives came under fire at Tuesday's inquiry.\n\nPhilrem distributed the stolen $81 million to Bloomberry Resorts Corp, which owns and operates the upmarket Solaire casino in Manila; to Eastern Hawaii Leisure Company, which is owned by Wong; and to an ethnic Chinese man believed to be a junket operator in Manila.\n\nPhilrem president Salud Bautista said the suspected Chinese junket operator was paid more than $30 million in six tranches.\n\nBut Wong, who said he witnessed four of the transactions, has disputed the sum, saying in a previous Senate session that only about $14 million changed hands.\n\nThis led senators to believe Philrem still holds a portion of the unaccounted stolen funds, which its treasurer Michael Bautista denied.\n\n\"But we are not keeping money. There is no money with us,\" he told the inquiry.\n\nSenator Recto, who led the questioning, appeared exasperated by the conflicting testimony. \"There seems to be double dealing here. That is how it appears,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry continues on April 12.\n\n(Writing by Andrew R.C.
