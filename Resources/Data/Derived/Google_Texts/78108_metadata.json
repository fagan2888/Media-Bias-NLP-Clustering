Greg Abbott will be in Tyler on Thursday, signing his new book \u201cBroken but Unbowed\u201d at Hastings, 5015 S. Broadway Ave. The signing begins at 11 a.m.\n\nHis book is part autobiography, part policy treatise on what the Constitution means to a nation still slogging through the after-effects of the Great Recession. Instead of functioning properly - with powers enumerated and clearly separated, the three branches of government are actively seeking to increase their own power, Abbott contends.\n\n\u201cEach branch of government bustles around creating pages of legal wallpaper, trying to cover up the endless number of cracks,\u201d Abbott wrote. \u201cThey sure look busy. But in reality nothing\u2019s accomplished.\u201d\n\nHe cites the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he refers to as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare law was a direct assault on the Constitution and on liberty as we knew it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe proposed law contorted the Constitution beyond where it had ever been stretched.\u201d\n\nAs Texas attorney general, Abbott was one of 12 state attorneys generals who sued the Obama administration over the law.\n\nBut it was a doomed effort.\n\n\u201cThis was like The Little Engine That Could chugging up the mountain, with everyone watching from below insisting there was no way the engine would make it over,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAbbott also outlines some strategies for returning the nation to its constitutional roots - such as a Convention of States. This is something Abbott has been calling for since taking office.\n\n\u201cThe increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,\u201d Abbott said in 2015. \u201cWe are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that, I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution itself offers a way to do this in Article V. That portion of the Constitution says states can amend the Constitution, without action from Congress. Any amendment would require two-thirds of state legislatures approval, so it would be a high hurdle. But it could be the nation\u2019s best shot at reining in the federal government, Abbott says.\n\nIn his book, Abbott also includes a poem, to help illustrate his point:\n\nLittle Miss Muffet\n\nSat on a tuffet (On her property),\n\nEating her curds and whey (Just eating, not selling),\n\nAlong came a spider,\n\nFederal agents beside her,\n\nAnd frightened Miss Muffet away.\n\nThe Tyler Paper\u2019s Roy Maynard will tweet from the event Thursday morning.\n\nTwitter: @tmt_roy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "Gov.
