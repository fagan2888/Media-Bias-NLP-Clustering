(Associated Press/Elise Amendola)\n\nIn a conversation with Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban, who is also a major Clinton backer, she essentially backed the president wherever possible and avoided saying anything controversial about Israel or Iran. Shocking, it was not, to conservatives. But it does suggest Saban and other Democratic donors are a cheap date when it comes to Israel. They expect very little from their inevitable nominee and that is exactly what she gives them.\n\nAccording to news reports, she backed the extension of the P5+1 talks and insulted critics of the administration, insisting, \u201cForget about the press coverage and the back and forth. Nobody can argue with the commitment of this administration to Israel\u2019s security.\u201d Really \u2014 no one legitimately can observe that the administration\u2019s scurrilous comments about the prime minister (and bragging it is now too late for Israel to strike) damages Israel; that accusing sanctions proponents of being \u201cwar mongers\u201d undercuts the military option and may inhibit Israel if it needs to act in self-defense; that making concession after concession to Iran is cosigning Israel to live with a nuclear-capable genocidal state; that seeking detente with the country that pines for Israel\u2019s destruction is injurious to Israel\u2019s survival; that backing Hamas patron Qatar\u2019s truce in the Gaza war and condemning Israel\u2019s conduct of the war make it harder for the Jewish state to defend itself; that insisting negotiations with the Palestinians beginning from the unsustainable 1967 borders is a recipe for Israel\u2019s insecurity; and that publicly blaming Israel for the collapse in peace talks feeds international efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state? Heck, Democrats have done all that.\n\nMore ominously, she suggests that none of those things are a problem for Israel\u2019s security. So she could do the same and still claim to \u201chave Israel\u2019s back\u201d?\n\nThe rest of Clinton\u2019s spiel was predictable:\n\nClinton also defended the administration\u2019s negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program, a key issue for Israel. Critics say Obama has not been tough enough on Iran, and criticized his decision to extend talks with Tehran until July, but Clinton said sanctions against the country have succeeded in their objectives. \u201cThe extension of the agreement until July will most likely be a period in which the sanctions will hold,\u201d she said. \u201cMy assessment is that the international sanctions have been effective.\u201d Still, she said that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d and insisted that \u201call options\u201d must be left on the table, including, presumably, military strikes. She also declined to criticize the administration\u2019s handling of the terrorist militia known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying \u201cwe\u2019re in for a long struggle\u201d against the group.\n\nSaban, playing the political lap dog, did not press her on sanctions, did not ask if Congress should have a final vote on the plan and did not query her about U.S. concessions reported in the media. She was not asked what a \u201cgood deal\u201d would look like and whether we must insist on dismantling, not just disconnecting, centrifuges. The furthest she would go was to repeat prior observations that the administration could have done more to aid protesters during the Green Revolution. (Someone not investing in her presidency should ask why the administration did not. Had she and the president by then already decided on a course of appeasement?)\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s reported remarks on Iran at the Saban conference were disappointing in that she missed a big opportunity to distance herself from Obama\u2019s policy and relied instead on mostly irrelevant platitudes,\u201d says the CEO of the pro-Israel JINSA, Michael Makovsky. Yes, she reeled off the platitudes about \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d but of course Susan Rice and John Kerry say that. \u201cIndeed, she reportedly did not indicate support for any concrete relevant steps that the U.S. should take to pressure Iran to negotiate in good faith, such as tough new sanctions or ways to boost the credibility of our military option, or support for Israel\u2019s military option.\u201d He reminded me, \u201cWhen he ran for the presidency and then for reelection Obama used a lot of tough-sounding rhetoric when speaking about Iran, which turned out to be no more than meaningless platitudes, and Hillary\u2019s remarks at Saban suggests more of the same.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s performance raises a number of questions.\n\nFirst, she met with the president at the White House earlier in the week, and certainly Iran must have come up. Did she promise not to publicly criticize him, or worse ask \u201cpermission\u201d and was denied the leeway to show she would have a different sort of relationship with Israel than he? If she wanted to show she had views of her own and/or thought his conduct toward Israel was problematic she might have used the opportunity to explain to the president why she could not support further sanctions relief, did not think it was productive to harp on Israeli building and had real concerns about the U.S. being \u201cplayed\u201d in negotiations.\n\nSecond, her failure to put some distance there on a relatively easy issue when a large number of the U.S. Senate Democrats may wind up breaking with the president suggests great political weakness, even cowardice on her part. A GOP congressional staffer remarked that, apparently, \u201cwhile some months ago she was distancing herself from President Obama\u2019s single-minded efforts to bribe Iran with a slew of short-sighted nuclear capitulations, she\u2019s now decided to embrace it.\u201d Is she so afraid of a challenge from the left that on an issue this big she won\u2019t inch away from Obama?\n\nThird, as in past Israel speeches, she was lackluster and boring. One attendee told me, \u201cOne listener said the air went out of the room. Some people \u2014 admittedly there were jet lagged Israelis there \u2014 nodded off.\u201d Trying so very hard not to make news, she aims to say nothing interesting and in that regard succeeds. This has been her problem since the book tour roll-out.\n\nShe might want to listen to David Axelrod, who helped orchestrate her defeat in 2008. In an MSNBC interview he reiterated his view that at \u201cthe end of the day you have to stand for something, fight for something.\u201d Apparently, preventing a nuclear threshold state in Iran isn\u2019t on the list.\n\nFourth, there is now not a dime\u2019s worth of difference among Susan Rice, John Kerry, Obama (and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, for that matter) when it comes to Iran negotiations. All oppose new sanctions. None seem alarmed by the stream of concessions. None has any problem with yet another extension and the progress Iran continues to make (e.g. on its ICBM program). None seem to be concerned that we have frittered away leverage and therefore that the chance of a good deal is now next to nil. None appear to grasp that we need to apply more pressure to Iran or face the Hobson\u2019s choice of war or a nuclear-ready Iran.\n\nIn polling, voters have consistently said they want a tougher Iran policy and that Obama has been too weak. If they want something different, they\u2019ll have to find someone other than Hillary Clinton. She either does not believe there is much wrong with Obama\u2019s approach or she lacks the nerve to say it. Either way, as the congressional staffer put it, \u201cWhat she\u2019s telegraphing to the world is that if you liked Obama\u2019s failing foreign policy, you\u2019ll love hers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not a dime's worth of difference between the two on Iran.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Not a dime's worth of difference between the two on Iran.", "title": "Hillary Clinton whiffs on Iran, embraces Obama\u2019s policy", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/12/07/hillary-clinton-whiffs-on-iran-no-real-difference-with-obama/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/05/National-Enterprise/Videos/Images/Hillary_Clinton_Women_0a652.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/12/07/hillary-clinton-whiffs-on-iran-no-real-difference-with-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hillary and iran, haim saban and israel, saban forum and israel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hillary and iran, haim saban and israel, saban forum and israel"}, "article_summary": "Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston on Thursday.\nIn polling, voters have consistently said they want a tougher Iran policy and that Obama has been too weak.\nNone appear to grasp that we need to apply more pressure to Iran or face the Hobson\u2019s choice of war or a nuclear-ready Iran.\nShe either does not believe there is much wrong with Obama\u2019s approach or she lacks the nerve to say it.\nIf they want something different, they\u2019ll have to find someone other than Hillary Clinton."}
