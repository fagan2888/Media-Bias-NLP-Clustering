Casey Foundation.\n\nWhile Florida was ranked 37th in overall child well-being, the state showed improvement in measures of health over a five-year period from 2008 to 2013:\n\n\u00b7 Low-birthweight babies: 8.5 percent in 2013; 8.8 percent in 2008\n\n\u00b7 Children without health insurance: 11 percent in 2013; 18 percent in 2008\n\n\u00b7 Child and teen deaths per 100,000: 25 in 2013; 31 in 2008\n\n\u00b7 Teens who abuse alcohol or drugs: 6 percent in 2012-13; 7 percent in 2007-08\n\n\u201cI would say that while we do have some bright spots, in terms of teen deaths, improvement in the teen birth rate, I think there needs to be continued effort to give these children access to health care,\u201d said Dr. Norin Dollard, who co-directs Florida KIDS COUNT at the University of South Florida in Tampa. \u201cWe are improving in terms of getting kids health insurance. We still need to maximize the public sources of insurance.\u201d\n\nA look of the type of health insurance Florida children are enrolled in showed about 40 percent in 2011 had coverage through a parent\u2019s employer, while 32 percent had Medicaid, CHIP (Florida KidCare and Florida Healthy Kids) or another type of public coverage.\n\nNationwide, 7 percent of children lacked health insurance in 2013, while in Florida, it was 11 percent, according to the report.\n\nDollard said it\u2019s difficult to point to one issue that needs to be fixed first, as all of the indicators work together to impact child well-being. She noted that the factors that have done the most to influence Florida\u2019s lower ranking are the economic well-being indicators, including children in poverty (24 percent) and those whose parents lack secure employment (33 percent).\n\n\"We still have substantial proportions of parents who do not have a steady employment income, and not only\u2026steady employment, but having the types of jobs that bring in adequate income and that would provide that health insurance component as well,\u201d Dollard said.\n\nWhile there is new job growth occurring at all wage levels, the reports says, the growth is disproportionate in low-wage sectors.\n\n\u201cThose lower-income jobs, there\u2019s not first of all the economic support to give kids the kind of chances that we want,\u201d Dollard said. \u201cBut they also are the jobs that don\u2019t come with insurance.\u201d\n\nIn the family and community category, the report notes a dramatic decline in teen births, both nationwide (from 40 per 1,000 in 2008 to 26 per 1,000 in 2013) and in Florida (from 40 per 1,000 in 2008 to 25 per 1,000 in 2013).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually been cut in half in about the last 20 years. It\u2019s the lowest rate on record for as long as we\u2019ve been tracking the teen birth rates,\u201d said Laura Speer, associate director of policy reform and advocacy with the Casey Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe know that young people are choosing to abstain from having sexual intercourse for longer. They\u2019re waiting until their adults \u2026 and when they do, they\u2019re more likely to use birth control, so it really is kind of a combination of abstinence and the use of birth control,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kids Count has been ranking states on measures of child well-being since 1990.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
