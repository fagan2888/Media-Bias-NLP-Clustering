In November, the world watched in horror as the Philippines was pounded by Typhoon Haiyan. While the outcry for aid has been met by an incredible response, there are still families and communities dealing with the effects of the devastation.

Filipino viral marketing company Green Mango called on some the country's talented singers residing all over the world to raise awareness for the continuing need for aid and relief.

The touching tribute combines more than a dozen Filipino YouTube stars for a beautiful rendition of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's "The Prayer."

As the company puts it: "Filipinos have become renown the world over for their freakishly good singing ability, so it only made sense to put their vocal talents to use for the good of a country."

The video layers the powerful vocals together, blending them in perfect harmony and ending with a solo by the country's most recent viral sensation â€” 11-year-old Joyce Jimenez, the blind little girl who touched hearts everywhere with her cover of Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball" last month.

It's impossible to not be moved by the incredible voices.
