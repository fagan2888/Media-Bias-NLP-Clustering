Potential profits are high, but pot's federal status remains unchanged: It's illegal under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nCourtesy of The Chronicle While standing inside his large warehouse, Brandon Milton, a Seattle developer, points to a portion of the land he owns in Vader, Wash., on a recent Saturday afternoon.

Buy this photo Brandon Milton stands inside the large warehouse on his 30 acres on the west side of Vader, Wash., where he hopes to grow marijuana for Washington state\u2019s recreational marijuana market.\n\nSeattle businessman Brandon Milton has no experience as a farmer, but he figures he can make millions of dollars growing marijuana.\n\nSmall farmer Nicholas Pouch has been growing medical marijuana for years, and the possibility of growing recreational marijuana stirs his passion for what he sees as a \u201cbeneficial product.\u201d\n\nMarijuana has been grown illegally across the U.S. Now that Washington state and Colorado have legalized the recreational use of pot, growing it legally is a brand-new prospect, both for entrepreneurs like Milton and farmers like Pouch.\n\nCall it agri-juana or mari-culture, growing marijuana is becoming part of the American farming landscape. Growers see before them a crop that is both high value and high risk. At one end of the spectrum, they could net millions of dollars an acre. At the other, they could lose their entire investment. Despite pot being legal in Washington and Colorado, it\u2019s still illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act.\n\nOn Aug. 29, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to outline the federal government\u2019s stance on legalized marijuana. Holder listed the federal government\u2019s priorities that in Washington have been addressed by the state\u2019s Liquor Control Board, which has jurisdiction over the new industry. Holder insisted the states keep pot away from minors, prevent criminals from selling it, prevent it from going to other states, prevent driving under its influence and prevent growing pot on public land and possessing it on federal property.\n\nHolder\u2019s statement does not change federal law, nor does voter-approved Initiative 502 pre-empt it. In fact, the department reserved its right to challenge the state laws at a later time. Washington residents involved in marijuana production or retailing could also be subject to prosecution if the federal government changes its position, for example, under a new president\u2019s administration. One of the enforcement options available to federal authorities is the confiscation of assets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not blind to that risk,\u201d said Milton, who hopes to grow marijuana on a large scale near the small town of Vader, in southwestern Washington. \u201cBut there\u2019s a movement underway to add places making it legal, like Oregon and Alaska and Portland, Maine.\u201d\n\nThe will of the people is moving toward more legalization, he said, and he believes it\u2019s unlikely a new administration would take a different path.\n\nWhen the Liquor Control Board held public hearings across Washington, project implementation director Randy Simmons said he heard similar words of optimism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a lot to fear. There\u2019s the possibility of a change in federal approach, but other states have medical marijuana and are moving to legalize recreational,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-the-genie\u2019s-out-of-the-bottle mentality.\"\n\nHow permits work\n\nWashington\u2019s new marijuana industry is open to anyone who has lived in the state at least three months, passes a background check and raises money within the state.\n\nThe state began accepting applications Nov. 18, and within a week the Liquor Control Board had received more than 400 applications to grow pot, more than 250 to process it and more than 150 to retail it. No specific number has been set on how many permits will be issued, but retail permits will take into account the local population and safety and security issues. The application period ends Dec. 19.\n\nPermits will be issued starting in February or March, Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith said, with priority given to producers and processors so a crop can be ready for retail sales in late spring.\n\nCosts include a $250 application fee, a $1,000 annual renewal fee and additional fees for a background check and filing for a local business license.\n\nLicenses will be granted for three sizes of growing operations:\n\n\u2022 Tier 1: Less than 2,000 square feet.\n\n\u2022 Tier 2: 2,000-10,000 square feet.\n\n\u2022 Tier 3: 10,000-30,000 square feet.\n\nThe maximum amount of space for marijuana production in the state is limited to 2 million square feet, or 46 acres \u2014 about one-quarter the size of the Washington State Fairgrounds in Puyallup.\n\nThat acreage could potentially produce $276 million of marijuana, making it the eighth highest value crop in the state, between nursery and greenhouse production and grapes. The top crop is apples, which brought in $2.2 billion last year.\n\nThe 25 percent excise tax imposed at the production, processing and retail levels could earn the state as much as $2 billion over five years, Smith said.\n\nAll funds from marijuana excise taxes will be deposited in the Dedicated Marijuana Fund, Simmons said. The money will be disbursed to the Liquor Control Board for administering the program, to Washington State University and the University of Washington for research and to agencies dealing with drug abuse prevention.\n\nThe initiative directed the bulk of the money go to the Washington Basic Health Plan. That agency is defunct under the federal Affordable Care Act, Simmons said, so it will fall to the Legislature to decide where the money will go.\n\nState business and occupation taxes will apply to the production and local retail sales.\n\nThe plans\n\nMilton has applied for three state permits to grow marijuana on 30,000-square-foot areas, each slightly less than 0.7 acre. He has been aiming to develop 30 acres, including a warehouse he owns south of Vader, and the legalization of marijuana opened the door for new opportunities, he said.\n\nHe estimated each grow site has the potential to produce about 7,000 pounds of marijuana worth $8.4 million each year. He also says the community will benefit from the creation of 25 jobs and an added $6,700 a year in property taxes from each site.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been plenty of support, and some who don\u2019t want it to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t require a vote.\u201d\n\nMilton\u2019s background is in used car parts, and he has neither experience in agriculture nor knowledge of marijuana.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a Catch-22,\u201d he said. \u201cSome say you don\u2019t have experience (in growing marijuana), but if I did, I\u2019d be a criminal, guilty of a felony.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new industry, so there\u2019s plenty to figure out.\u201d\n\nMilton and other prospective large-scale growers will invest their own money, Simmons said.\n\n\u201cThe banking issue is one of the largest challenges facing the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nBanking on marijuana\n\nBanking and access to working capital are problematic, since banks are regulated under federal law and would put themselves at risk of prosecution on racketeering and money-laundering charges. However, the Justice Department wants to address that problem, Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Cole told a congressional committee in September. He said his agency and federal banking regulators will help clear the way for financial institutions to transact business with the legitimate marijuana industry without fear of prosecution, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Washington Bankers Association and Northwest Farm Credit Services did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not cheap\u201d to get started, Simmons said. \u201cBig operations have their own money, and smaller growers can move over very easily. But the mid-range grower has no place to get capital.\u201d\n\nAt the small end of the production scale are people like Pouch, who owns and operates a farm on Washington\u2019s Olympic Peninsula. As a registered medical marijuana patient, he already grows it for his own needs and is \u201cheavily entertaining\u201d the option of seeking a license to grow for the recreational market.\n\nHis farm is small, but he wants as big an operation as he can accommodate.\n\n\u201cIn business, bigger is better,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re all gonna be millionaires \u2014 but not really. I\u2019m a farmer anyhow, and I have a deeper passion than making a bunch of money. Instead of \u2018Now I can get rich,\u2019 I want to produce a beneficial product.\u201d\n\nBefore he dives in, he said, he needs to make sure he feels secure about the federal legal aspects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily an activist, but willing to take risks for what I believe in,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capital Press", "description": "Seattle businessman Brandon Milton has no experience as a farmer, but he figures he can make millions of dollars growing marijuana.Small farmer Nicholas Pouch has been growing medical marijuana for years,\u00a0and the possibility of growing recreational marijuana stirs his passion for what he sees a", "title": "Pot attracts different kinds of farmers", "url": "http://www.capitalpress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131206/ARTICLE/131209931", "image": "http://EOR-CPwebvarnish.newscyclecloud.com/storyimage/CP/20131206/ARTICLE/131209931/AR/0/AR-131209931.jpg&MaxW=600", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/capitalpress"}, "description": "Read Pot attracts different kinds of farmers from Capital Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1925\"", "article_summary": "Seattle businessman Brandon Milton has no experience as a farmer, but he figures he can make millions of dollars growing marijuana.\nMilton is one of hundreds of Washington state residents who hope to obtain state permits allowing them to grow marijuana.\nDespite the risks involved, hundreds of people are eager to step into Washington state's new recreational marijuana industry.\nCall it agri-juana or mari-culture, growing marijuana is becoming part of the American farming landscape.\n\u201cSome say you don\u2019t have experience (in growing marijuana), but if I did, I\u2019d be a criminal, guilty of a felony."}
