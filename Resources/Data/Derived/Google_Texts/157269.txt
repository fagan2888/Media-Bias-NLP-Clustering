What words represent the top choices that respondents associate with Hillary Clinton in the latest Quinnipiac poll (full results here)? Let’s play the Feud. Survey says the top three choices are “liar,” followed by “dishonest” and “untrustworthy.” This is one survey that represents the wisdom of crowds, at least as to Madam Hillary.

I found this result a bit of a surprise: “bitch” was about as popular as “trustworthy.”

Donald Trump? Survey says the top three choices are “arrogant,” followed by “blowhard” and “idiot.”

Jeb Bush? Survey says the top choice is “Bush” (followed by “family” and “honest”). I read this result as negative, confirmed by these results that include Clinton, Biden, Rubio, Trump, and Sanders:

Jeb Bush has a negative 32 – 41 percent favorability rating among all voters, with Clinton getting a negative 39 – 51 percent score, her worst ever. Ratings for other top contenders are 48 – 39 percent for Biden; Negative 36 – 54 percent for Trump; 41 – 27 percent for Rubio; 32 – 28 percent for Sanders. Trump and Clinton have the worst scores among top candidates on honesty. Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, voters say 61 – 34 percent, her lowest score ever; Trump is not honest and trustworthy, voters say 54 – 38 percent.
