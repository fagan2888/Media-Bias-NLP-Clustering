However, critics say it\u2019s a means of disenfranchising voters, particularly minority groups and the poor, who can be less likely to have the government-issued identification required by the law.\n\nWhile the Court left its decision over the law unexplained, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a dissent criticizing the voter ID rules, calling them \u201ca purposefully discriminatory law\u201d that undermines \u201cpublic confidence in elections.\u201d Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Ginsburg\u2019s dissent, the New York Times reports.\n\n\n\nA report released this month by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office showed that voter ID laws similar to those in Texas contributed to lower voter turnouts in two states in 2012\u2014between about 2.2 and 3.2 percentage points in Tennessee and 2 percentage points in Kansas. Those declines were greater among younger and black voters.\n\nCritics of the Texas law say it would disenfranchise 600,000 registered voters in Texas, disproportionately affecting blacks and Hispanic or Latino voters. Texas officials have countered by saying that estimates of the number of people who could be deterred from voting by the law are unfounded.\n\nAfter many months of legal wrangling, the Texas law, first passed in 2011, was blocked earlier this month by Texas Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the Federal District Court in Corpus Christi. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturns Gonzales\u2019 injunction against the law, allowing it to be applied.\n\nIn the absence of an official explanation of the Court\u2019s decision, some observers are speculating the justices allowed the law to stand to prevent confusion so close to the November\u2019s elections. Those observers feel that reluctance to disturb the status quo as voting looms near has been the single common thread tying together several of the Court\u2019s seemingly discordant decisions regarding voter ID laws in recent weeks.\n\n[New York Times]", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Some justices issued a dissent calling the law \"purposefully discriminatory\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Three justices issued a dissent calling the law \"purposefully discriminatory\"", "title": "Supreme Court Allows Texas Voter ID Law to Stand Ahead of Midterms", "url": "http://time.com/3519389/texas-voter-id/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/texas-voter-id.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/texas-voter-id.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Supreme Court Allows Texas Voter ID Law to Stand Ahead of Midterms", "description": "Three justices issued a dissent calling the law \"purposefully discriminatory\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "civil rights, justice", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "texas, voter id, supreme court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b08\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court decided Saturday that Texas can enforce its controversial voter identification law in November\u2019s midterm elections, despite recently blocking several similar laws in other states.\nCritics of the Texas law say it would disenfranchise 600,000 registered voters in Texas, disproportionately affecting blacks and Hispanic or Latino voters.\nAfter many months of legal wrangling, the Texas law, first passed in 2011, was blocked earlier this month by Texas Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the Federal District Court in Corpus Christi.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturns Gonzales\u2019 injunction against the law, allowing it to be applied.\nThe law, which requires Texas voters to show photo identification like a driver\u2019s or gun license, a military ID or a passport, is championed by some who argue that it reduces voter fraud."}
