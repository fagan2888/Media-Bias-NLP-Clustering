The House passed the temporary spending bill in a 230-189 vote largely along party lines, but the legislation has slim chances of survival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. President Obama has repeatedly vowed to veto any legislation that would end his landmark health care law, leaving Congress few options before the federal government grinds to a halt when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThink about that,\u201d Obama said in his address. \u201cThey\u2019d actually plunge this country back into recession\u2013all to deny the basic security of health care to millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe legislation heads to the Senate next week, where lawmakers could consider either stripping the provision to defund Obamacare out of the bill, or sending back a new budget for both chambers to hash out a compromise. But with just nine days before the fiscal year ends, the clock is ticking. Earlier this week, Boehner said \u201cThere\u2019s no interest on our part on shutting the government down.\u201d Instead, he is punting the heat to conservatives in the Senate to take up the anti-Obamacare campaign.\n\nWhite House officials tell NBC News that President Obama spoke on the phone with Boehner Friday evening to reiterate to the speaker that \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States should not and will not be subjected to negotiation.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-my9hVoGv2M", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If the government shudders to a halt at the end of the month, blame far-right factions of the Republican Party, President Obama said Saturday in his weekly add", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-the-us-not-deadbeat-nation-0", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If the government shudders to a halt at the end of the month, blame far-right factions of the Republican Party, President Obama said Saturday in his weekly add", "title": "Obama: The US is not a deadbeat nation", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-the-us-not-deadbeat-nation-0", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/09/rtx13sr6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-the-us-not-deadbeat-nation-0", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/09/rtx13sr6.jpg?itok=8uIlYwYc", "height": 553}, "title": "Obama: The US is not a deadbeat nation", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If the government shudders to a halt at the end of the month, blame far-right factions of the Republican Party, President Obama said Saturday in his weekly add"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-21T11:56:37-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "amandasakuma", "tags": "democrats,economy,republicans,tea-party", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/09/21/obama-the-us-is-not-a-deadbeat-nation/", "title": "Obama: The US is not a deadbeat nation", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-the-us-not-deadbeat-nation-0", "date": "09/21/2013 11:56:37 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "If the government shudders to a halt at the end of the month, blame far-right factions of the Republican Party, President Obama said Saturday in his weekly add", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Economy, Republicans, Tea Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5e5\"", "article_summary": "If the government shudders to a halt at the end of the month, blame far-right factions of the Republican Party, President Obama said Saturday in his weekly address.\n\u201cThe United States of America is not a deadbeat nation,\u201d Obama said.\nPresident Obama has repeatedly vowed to veto any legislation that would end his landmark health care law, leaving Congress few options before the federal government grinds to a halt when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.\n\u201cThink about that,\u201d Obama said in his address.\nWhite House officials tell NBC News that President Obama spoke on the phone with Boehner Friday evening to reiterate to the speaker that \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States should not and will not be subjected to negotiation.\u201dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-my9hVoGv2M"}
