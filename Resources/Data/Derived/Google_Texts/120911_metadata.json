This is good news, because it means the treatments patients got at the hospitals were more effective and had fewer adverse events, like healthcare-associated infections.\n\nThe amount of people hospitalized over that time period fell by 23%.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing hospitalization rates and costs are going down, because more and more people are getting in on Medicare. Between the Affordable Care Act and Baby Boomers turning 65, more people than ever are enrolled in Medicare \u2014 55 million to be exact.\n\nPlus, Americans are going to be spending way more money on personalized health care treatments than they ever have before. The introduction of hepatitis C cures may just be the start of higher cost medicine that\u2019s more effective. The benefit of these new drugs, experts say, is that they can potentially fend off more costly treatments that require hospitalization down the line, such as surgery.\n\nThe study\u2019s data came out the same day as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a report that showed the US will be spending almost a fifth of the economy on health spending by 2024.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Lydia Ramsey", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Medicare is working.", "creator": "lydiaramsey125", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/is-medicare-working-2015-7", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55b92cbe371d2215008baec9-506-253/4-big-ways-the-uss-longest-running-health-care-program-is-changing-lives.jpg", "title": "4 big ways the US's longest-running health care program is changing lives", "site": "BI_Science", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "science,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Medicare, Health Care, Pharmaceutical, Health, Medicine, Hospitals, Hospital Bills, Elderly, Lydia Ramsey", "description": "Medicare is working.", "author": "Lydia Ramsey", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-29", "sailthru.title": "4 big ways the US's longest-running health care program is changing lives", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/55b92caf371d2254008baeff-50-50/4-big-ways-the-uss-longest-running-health-care-program-is-changing-lives.jpg", "news_keywords": "Medicare, Health Care, Pharmaceutical, Health, Medicine, Hospitals, Hospital Bills, Elderly, Lydia Ramsey", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55b92caf371d2254008baeff/4-big-ways-the-uss-longest-running-health-care-program-is-changing-lives.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-07-29", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/lydia-ramsey"}, "sailthru.description": "Medicare is working.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Medicare is working.", "title": "4 big ways the US's longest-running health care program is changing lives", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/is-medicare-working-2015-7", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55b92cbe371d2215008baec9-1190-625/4-big-ways-the-uss-longest-running-health-care-program-is-changing-lives.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "4 big ways the US's longest-running health care program is changing lives", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55b92caf371d2254008baeff/4-big-ways-the-uss-longest-running-health-care-program-is-changing-lives.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "science"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b3e\"", "article_summary": "Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans aged 65 and older, is turning 50 this week.\nIn honor of that milestone, Yale researchers crunched the numbers to see how well Medicare has fared since 1999.\nIt\u2019s a good thing hospitalization rates and costs are going down, because more and more people are getting in on Medicare.\nBetween the Affordable Care Act and Baby Boomers turning 65, more people than ever are enrolled in Medicare \u2014 55 million to be exact.\nThe study\u2019s data came out the same day as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a report that showed the US will be spending almost a fifth of the economy on health spending by 2024."}
