It fits into her broader campaign strategy to provide concrete solutions for ordinary, middle-class families, particularly through targeted tax credits that could play well in a general election. It\u2019s unclear how much low-income families will benefit, as Clinton hasn\u2019t indicated whether she\u2019ll make the tax credits refundable, or how she\u2019ll ultimately pay for the plan. But she has been raising the issue with frequency: In July, she spoke about the \u201ccaregiving crisis\u201d at a New Hampshire town hall, responding to a woman who was caring for her husband and mother, who both had Alzheimer\u2019s. At the time, Clinton was vague about specific solutions but tried to make a personal connection. \u201cMy late mother lived with us until she passed away, she was thankfully in good health, but she had some real beginnings of deterioration physically,\u201d Clinton said, though she didn\u2019t specify whether she was personally caring for her mother at the time.\n\nClinton\u2019s caregiving plan is also designed to appeal to women, who make up about two-thirds of family caregivers. \u201cIt\u2019s more economic security for older women who\u2019ve taken time out of the workforce for caregiving,\u201d says Heather Boushey, executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and an outside economic policy adviser to Clinton. \u201cOlder women are more likely to be poor than men and live longer. They don\u2019t earn as much and have as much in Social Security.\u201d\n\nThe underlying message is that this unpaid labor has a real value: Clinton pegs the value of family caregiving work at $470 billion per year, which is the AARP\u2019s estimate. Caregiving costs those who are 50 and older to lose an average of $303,880 in wages, pensions, and Social Security due to reduced hours or leaving the workforce early to care for a parent, according to a 2011 study by MetLife and New York Medical College. A majority of family caregivers say their responsibilities have affected their work performance, and 30 percent say they miss six or more days of work because of their caregiving duties, according to a 2011 Gallup survey. Another AARP survey finds that 9 percent have given up work entirely to devote their time to caregiving.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why advocates for family caregivers are lobbying for a more inclusive form of paid leave that includes caring for adult relatives, as well as young children. Both Clinton and Bernie Sanders support paid family leave that includes taking time off for chronically ill relatives. But the topic of elder care rarely comes up in the broader debate around paid leave, which continues to be fixated on working mothers\u2014rather than working parents of both genders, or working children-of-ailing-parents.\n\n\u201cPeople still talk about it as paid parental leave\u2014we really need to be talking about paid family leave,\u201d says Julie Kashen, senior policy adviser at Make It Work, which advocates for progressive family policies. \u201cNot everyone \u2019s going to become a parent, but most people are going to grow old.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of reasons why we\u2019d prefer to think about caregiving for the young rather than the old. The welfare of children is a full-blown national pastime; they\u2019re a status symbol, a celebrity accessory, and a tabula rasa for the nation\u2019s future. An ailing adult is a reminder of not only our own end, but the entire process of decline, of losing our hard-fought autonomy.\n\nThe larger problem, though, is the failure to recognize that there is a need for care in the first place. Many Americans don\u2019t realize that while Medicare covers rehab and short-term nursing stints after a serious illness, the program doesn\u2019t pay for long-term care\u2014and only a small fraction of Americans sign up for private long-term care insurance. If they do need help, it comes at a steep cost: The median nursing home costs $77,380 per year, while home health services cost $45,188 per year, according to one 2014 survey. And most Americans have saved hardly anything for retirement in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s the bigger reason that family members are shouldering the personal and financial burden: There is no safety net for care\u2014the assistance required for day-to-day living\u2014unless you\u2019re poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act originally included a long-term insurance program called the CLASS Act, but it wasn\u2019t financially viable, partly because it failed to attract enough participants.\n\nA real solution would mean either creating a robust private market for long-term care, or creating a mandatory new public benefit, perhaps within the Medicare program itself, according to a blue-ribbon commission that Congress convened after ending the CLASS Act. But either option would come with a big price tag, and even the Long-Term Care Commission ultimately deadlocked over the toughest part\u2014how to pay for it.\n\nNone of the Democratic candidates appear ready to make the leap either. Even Senator Sanders, who supports Medicare for all to make health coverage universal, has yet to roll out a sweeping solution for long-term care. (Denmark, unsurprisingly, has universal, publicly financed long-term care.) But advocates for long-term care insurance acknowledge that a comprehensive solution is still a long way off, politically speaking. They welcome the mere fact that the Democrats, particularly Clinton, have made the issue part of the campaign conversation. Clinton\u2019s proposal \u201cdoes not give us a system for providing long-term services and support, so we need to buck up what we got,\u201d says Judy Feder, a fellow at the Urban Institute and Georgetown professor. But \u201cthe issue isn\u2019t so much whether it goes far enough, but that it\u2019s a start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "America's \"invisible workforce\" of family caregivers desperately needs help\u2014and Democratic proposals are a start, at least.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "America's \"invisible workforce\" of family caregivers desperately needs help\u2014and Democratic proposals are a start, at least.", "title": "How Hillary Clinton Is Making Aging Parents a 2016 Issue", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/bf26497b56b6236b79c1a68b240ce88f02b7e8e8.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/124806/hillary-clinton-making-aging-parents-2016-issue", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's \"invisible workforce\" of family caregivers desperately needs help\u2014and Democratic proposals are a start, at least.", "title": "How Hillary Clinton Is Making Aging Parents a 2016 Issue", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/bf26497b56b6236b79c1a68b240ce88f02b7e8e8.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@SuzyKhimm", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/bf26497b56b6236b79c1a68b240ce88f02b7e8e8.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How Hillary Clinton Is Making Aging Parents a 2016 Issue\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/124806/hillary-clinton-making-aging-parents-2016-issue\",\"section\":\"Election 2016\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-01T15:39:29.000Z\",\"post_id\":124806,\"author\":\"Suzy Khimm\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Election 2016\",\"Democratic Party\",\"Hillary Clinton\",\"elderly\",\"Paid Leave\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Election 2016", "published_time": "2015-12-01"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Clinton is making the most concerted effort to turn family caregiving into a 2016 issue.\nBoth Clinton and Bernie Sanders support paid family leave that includes taking time off for chronically ill relatives.\nBut advocates for long-term care insurance acknowledge that a comprehensive solution is still a long way off, politically speaking.\nEven Senator Sanders, who supports Medicare for all to make health coverage universal, has yet to roll out a sweeping solution for long-term care.\nThey welcome the mere fact that the Democrats, particularly Clinton, have made the issue part of the campaign conversation."}
