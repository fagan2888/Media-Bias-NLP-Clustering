He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years\u2019 probation. It was not immediately clear whether he would be required to report to a rehab facility to complete his six-month sentence, which was expected to end in July.\n\nBrent crashed his Mercedes sedan on a suburban Dallas highway on the way back from a nightclub. Brown was in the passenger\u2019s seat. Witnesses recalled seeing Brent trying to pull Brown from the wreckage of the vehicle.\n\nTests later showed Brent to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.18 percent, more than twice the legal limit for drivers in Texas.\n\nBrent faced up to 20 years in prison for intoxication manslaughter, and prosecutors pressed hard for prison time, saying his case would send a message to other would-be drunken drivers.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s mother, Stacey Jackson, testified she had forgiven Brent and that \u201cyou can\u2019t go on in life holding a grudge.\u201d\n\nBrent and Brown were college teammates at the University of Illinois and roommates in Texas, where Brown was a practice squad linebacker for the Cowboys.\n\nBrent was a defensive tackle for the Cowboys. He retired from the NFL months before his January trial, though he could attempt to be reinstated now that he has been released. It\u2019s unclear whether the NFL will suspend him before he can play again.\n\nAt least one Cowboys player, linebacker Sean Lee, attended part of Brent\u2019s trial, and owner Jerry Jones has said he is supportive of Brent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 26-year-old Brent was convicted in January of intoxication manslaughter for the December 2012 crash that killed Jerry Brown, a Cowboys practice squad player.
