An influx of more than 1.1 million migrants to Germany last year has put a question mark over whether Germany will have to abandon its cherished "schwarze null" or balanced budget to pay for the costs of accommodating and integrating the new arrivals.

The finance ministry document shows the government plans to increase spending by 30.9 billion euros to 347.8 billion euros by 2020. But since tax revenues are expected to keep rising it does not foresee the need for net new borrowing.

For 2017, the government expects to hike spending by 8.6 billion to 325.5 billion euros this year, of which about 33.7 billion will be spent on investment.

The German cabinet is expected to approve the draft 2017 budget and financing plan up to 2020 on July 6.
