Kurtz professor of entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of \u201cWhite House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Sheila Bair, then the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, fought to retain a rule that would limit the amount of leverage, i.e., the amount that could be borrowed, particularly by the largest American financial companies. Among her most difficult opponents were key people at the Federal Reserve and most of the international community involved with bank regulation. (The details are in Chapter 3 of her book, \u201cBull by the Horns.\u201d)\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nThe financial crisis made a big difference. Ms. Bair was proved right. Her critics in the United States and in Europe had insisted that a sophisticated \u201crisk-weighted\u201d approach to measuring the adequacy of bank equity capital would suffice. But the risk-weights used, by regulators and the industry, proved repeatedly wrong. Complex derivatives based on mortgage-backed securities and European sovereign debt were rated as AAA (the safest possible); both turned out instead to be highly risky and prone to fall rapidly in value.\n\nThis week, Ms. Bair and the people who agree with her on the need to restrict leverage at our largest banks won a major victory.\n\nIn the 18th or 19th century, a victory on this scale would have been become clear in flowery speeches or perhaps an act of Congress. We live in an age of specialists and complex terminology, so this week\u2019s victory was appropriately enough wrapped in technical language of modern bank regulation.\n\nThe new rule is the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio,\u201d and it limits how much the largest banks can borrow relative to their overall assets. You need \u201cmore than $700 billion in consolidated total assets\u201d or \u201cmore than $10 trillion in assets under custody\u201d in order to be covered by this rule. (The link above is to the summary news release; the full rule is 54 pages long.)\n\n\n\nBy 2018, the eight largest financial companies will need to fund their overall activities with at least 5 percent equity (so they can still have up to 95 percent debt, relative to their total balance sheet size).\n\nAs the Fed puts it, in official-speak, \u201cA perception persists in the markets that some companies remain \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 posing an ongoing threat to the financial system.\u201d\n\nThomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a longstanding proponent of more effective capital regulation, issued a clear and powerful statement regarding why leverage should be limited in this way: \u201cBanks with stronger capital positions are in a better position to lend, to compete favorably in any market and to achieve satisfactory results for investors. Without sufficient capital, the opposite is true.\u201d\n\nOpinion in official circles more broadly has shifted, in part because of strenuous efforts by some individuals.\n\nMr. Hoenig, for example, has long argued for more emphasis on the leverage ratio:\n\nFor example, in the period 2006-8, there was no binding leverage ratio on the largest institutions. It is evident now that during that period banks increased their leverage and took on excessive risks to meet targeted returns. It was the reliance on and manipulation of a risk-based capital framework that allowed risk to build up to a point that nearly brought the global financial system to collapse.\n\nBanks with more equity capital (meaning less leverage) were better able to sustain credit than banks that were in danger of becoming insolvent (i.e., having their equity wiped out by large losses.)\n\nThese new rules represent a vindication for Ms. Bair, Mr. Hoenig and others who have played a leadership role on this topic, including Jeremiah Norton, a member of the board at the F.D.I.C. (see his statement this week). I\u2019m a member of the independent and nonpartisan Systemic Risk Council, founded and led by Ms. Bair, and we have also written comment letters urging higher capital requirements.\n\nWhile this aspect of the broader debate on financial stability is not over, people who argue in favor of even stronger capital requirements are increasingly gaining the upper hand. (For an entertaining and insightful analysis of the current academic debate, see this paper by Paul Pfleiderer.)\n\nThe consensus among officials is shifting. Perhaps not enough and definitely not fast enough, but it is definitely moving in the right direction.\n\nAs Mr. Hoenig says at the end of his statement,", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140410000157, "twitter": {"description": "Progress is being made by advocates of stricter bank regulation, an economist writes.", "title": "Heroes of Banking Reform", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/heroes-of-banking-reform/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002817670, "CLMST": "Simon Johnson", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "_featured", "published_time": 1397102517, "modified_time": "2014-04-10T04:02:00-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Bair Sheila C,Dudley William C,Geithner Timothy F,Hoenig Thomas M,Banking and Financial Institutions,United States Economy,Federal Deposit Insurance Corp,Federal Reserve System,Systemic Risk Council,Today's Economist,Uncategorized,_featured", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Heroes of Banking Reform ( 20140410 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Simon Johnson", "SCG": "Economy", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "per": "Bair, Sheila C;Dudley, William C;Geithner, Timothy F;Hoenig, Thomas M", "byl": "Simon Johnson", "BN": "economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "description": "Progress is being made by advocates of stricter bank regulation, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 10, 2014", "org": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corp;Federal Reserve System;Systemic Risk Council", "utime": 20140410040200, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140410, "pdate": 20140410, "des": "Banking and Financial Institutions;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Progress is being made by advocates of stricter bank regulation, an economist writes.", "title": "Heroes of Banking Reform", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/heroes-of-banking-reform/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/heroes-of-banking-reform/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Heroes of Banking Reform", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 10, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde36e\"", "article_summary": "Ms. Bair was proved right.\nThis week, Ms. Bair and the people who agree with her on the need to restrict leverage at our largest banks won a major victory.\nThe new rule is the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio,\u201d and it limits how much the largest banks can borrow relative to their overall assets.\nI\u2019m a member of the independent and nonpartisan Systemic Risk Council, founded and led by Ms. Bair, and we have also written comment letters urging higher capital requirements.\nIt is evident now that during that period banks increased their leverage and took on excessive risks to meet targeted returns."}
