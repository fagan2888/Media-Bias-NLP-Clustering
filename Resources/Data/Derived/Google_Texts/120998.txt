Police arrested an El Reno woman on Wednesday, accused in the death of a toddler who died after being in the woman’s care in November 2015.

Officers arrested Lesley Hendrix after a months’ long investigation into the case. It started back on Nov. 18 when emergency crews were dispatched to a home in the 700 block of S. Miles Dr., in El Reno, for a call about an unresponsive toddler.

The young girl was taken to Mercy Hospital in El Reno and then transferred to Children’s Hospital in OKC, where medical personnel discovered that the child had bleeding on the brain. The girl later died as a result of those injuries. The Medical Examiner’s officer soon determined the cause of death to be a Homicide caused by a head injury.

Investigators began putting the pieces together and learned that Hendrix was babysitting the child on the day she was rushed to the hospital.

Based on their investigation, officers arrested Hendrix for one count of First-Degree Murder by Child Abuse. She was taken into custody and transported to the Canadian County Jail without incident. Details on a possible bond were not immediately available.
