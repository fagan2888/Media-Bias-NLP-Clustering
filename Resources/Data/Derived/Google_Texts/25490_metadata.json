Fishermen will be limited to a statewide harvest of 11,749 pounds, a 35 percent reduction from the amount caught in Maine last year. Some in the room called out that making individual quotas will be unfair toward the fishermen who have been working this fishery long before the price shot up as demand in Japan and China has increased. But state officials were unmoved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay within our quota this year,\u201d Terry Stockwell of the Maine Department of Marine Resources said during the first meeting of the Maine Elver Fishermen Association at the Samoset Resort. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to demonstrate to the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries] Commission that we\u2019re not a renegade fishery.\u201d\n\nCol. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Marine Patrol then told the assembly of fishermen that they could all help make or break the lucrative fishery. In the last few years, the average price fishermen have received for the catch has skyrocketed from less than $100 per pound to more than $1,800 per pound in 2012 and 2013, making it the state\u2019s second most valuable fishery.\n\n\u201cAnybody that\u2019s helping poachers could shut this fishery down,\u201d he cautioned them.\n\nSome of the fishermen in the room told officials that they would take those words seriously. Very seriously.\n\n\u201cEvery fishery has unwritten rules. This year, they\u2019re going to be enforced,\u201d Perry Cloak, an opinionated elver harvester from Trenton, said. \u201cIf the lobstermen have unwritten rules \u2014 why can\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nBut even though he hastened to say he didn\u2019t mean anyone would get hurt during the enforcement, Commissioner Patrick Keliher of the Department of Marine Resources said that he preferred a different type of self-policing.\n\n\u201cThe guys in the green coats are the best ways and the fairest ways to enforce this law,\u201d he said.\n\nState officials suggested fishermen take photographs of license plates of people they believed were illegally harvesting the lucrative elvers, and send those pictures to the Maine Marine Patrol. They also encouraged fishermen to call and report suspicious activity to law enforcement agents.\n\nElver harvesters also asked for more information regarding how officials will divvy up the statewide quota. After tribal allocations are made, other harvesters in the state will be limited to catching about 8,710 pounds of the tiny eels. Keliher told the fishermen he cannot announce his final decision until the Maine Legislature regulates this spring\u2019s harvest, but did say he is leaning strongly toward taking an average of two out of three years of fishing to determine individual quotas. He also said that he has a lot of faith that the new swipe card system will work to track daily landings around the state, but added that there\u2019s no way that every fisherman will feel satisfied with the process.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the conversation, I heard a lot about fairness,\u201d Keliher said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we\u2019re going to do that\u2019s not going to feel fair.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ROCKPORT, Maine \u2014 With big money changing hands over tiny glass eels, Maine\u2019s elver fishermen have developed a bad reputation in other Atlantic states as renegades.
