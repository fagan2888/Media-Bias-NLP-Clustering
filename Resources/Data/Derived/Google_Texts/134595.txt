Now that our president has “fixed” our health-care system with the Affordable Care Act, he seems to have set his sights on resolving another big social issue in 2014. Obama and other progressive (they don’t like to use the unpopular term “liberal” anymore) crusaders now have the problem of “income inequality” squarely in their cross hairs and we should probably all be afraid. Very afraid.
