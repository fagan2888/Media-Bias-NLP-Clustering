Now, providers are now responsible for both providing information about insurance coverage and health management. Patients often ask their doctors about what's covered and what's not in their insurance plans, only to find out that their physician has no way of knowing without calling the insurer, Keckley notes.\n\nWhile this new idea of cross-breeding physician and insurer would seemingly cause more headaches than help, any provider organization's core operating model already relies on physicians being well-versed in insurance risk, Keckley argues. In the long run, he says, insurance risk will come from an integrated team of doctors, hospitals, allied health professionals, pharmacists and post-acute facilities that will be responsible for both cost and quality. This scenario is nothing new to private insurers, as most will offer to rent out their data capabilities in order to partner with integrated systems of health in shared-risk arrangements.\n\n\"Some are buying integrated delivery systems themselves, bolting them onto their insurance chassis,\" Keckley writes. \"And all are carefully navigating their course to new markets, new services and leveraging their data to maintain a prominent role in the U.S. system going forward.\"\n\nPolls show that Americans generally trust their doctors and hospitals more than they trust their insurers. Yet the line between payer and provider is increasingly blurring.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the blog post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nConsumers, providers have trust issues with health insurers\n\nHealth insurers, providers don't have to settle for 'frenemy' status\n\nHow insurers can make transparency tools more consumer-friendly\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare in America is undergoing massive change, and that will ultimately alter how payers and providers define their roles, according to a recent\u00a0blog post\u00a0by Paul Keckley, managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Healthcare in America is undergoing massive change, and that will ultimately alter how payers and providers define their roles, according to a recent\u00a0blog post\u00a0by Paul Keckley, managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "title": "Future of healthcare will alter roles of both payers and providers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/future-healthcare-will-alter-roles-both-payers-and-providers/2015-11-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Healthcare Delivery,Healthcare Payers,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient trust", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "In the past, insurance companies and health providers worked in parallel--insurers took care of the payment part and providers took care of the health delivery.\nTo learn more:- read the blog postRelated Articles:Consumers, providers have trust issues with health insurersHealth insurers, providers don't have to settle for 'frenemy' statusHow insurers can make transparency tools more consumer-friendly\nHealthcare in America is undergoing massive change, and that will ultimately alter how payers and providers define their roles, according to a recent blog post by Paul Keckley, managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.\nWhile this new idea of cross-breeding physician and insurer would seemingly cause more headaches than help, any provider organization's core operating model already relies on physicians being well-versed in insurance risk, Keckley argues.\nPolls show that Americans generally trust their doctors and hospitals more than they trust their insurers."}
