However, in the case of Pedro Celis, those rectangles of cardboard on stakes may have been all-important.\n\nThe former Microsoft engineer came out on top in a field of four Republicans, beating his nearest competitor by fewer than 1,000 votes. The main thing he had going for him was the \u201cVOTE FOR PEDRO (Celis for Congress)\u201d signs, a reference to the movie Napoleon Dynamite.\n\n\u201cPedro was given a \u2018Vote for Pedro\u2019 t-shirt shortly after the movie came out. When he was discussing running for office, the \u2018Vote for Pedro\u2019 slogan was frequently brought up at various events and social functions with friends and family,\u201d wrote campaign spokesman Gray Delany in an email. \u201cThe idea really took hold when Pedro wore a \u2018Vote for Pedro\u2019 t-shirt to a parade shortly after declaring his candidacy. \u2026 The slogan certainly grabs people\u2019s attention especially among people that do not normally get engaged in the political process.\u201d\n\nCatchy slogan or no, Celis faces an uphill battle against Democrat Suzan Delbene.\n\nReal Clear Politics ranks Washington\u2019s First Congressional District race as competitive, but only just. DelBene got just over 50% of the vote in the state\u2019s top-two primary to Celis\u2019s 16.5% and she\u2019s already won the district twice in 2012, first in a special election and then in a general.\n\nHowever, in 2010, she lost an election in the Eighth Congressional District against Republican Dave Reichert.\n\nDelBene enjoyed two advantages in 2012\u2019s race, the first following post-Census redistricting. First, she has a personal fortune from working as a Microsoft executive, which she dipped into to help fund her campaign. Second, she faced John Koster, a candidate who managed to get snagged up in that year\u2019s media obsession known as \u201crapegate.\u201d\n\nIn a normal election year in Washington state, DelBene would likely squeak by. Celis\u2019s team hopes this isn\u2019t a normal election year and that the anti-Democratic \u201cwave\u201d will sweep DelBene away.\n\nTo that end, they emphasize Celis\u2019s biography, his conservatism, and the Democrats\u2019 lack of results.\n\nCelis, like his Dynamite inspiration, is an immigrant from Monterrey, Mexico. He both looks and sounds the part. \u201cI am the candidate with the charming accent,\u201d Celis said in the \u201cMicrosoft Debate\u201d last week. An intro video on his campaign website sounded the same note: \u201cI\u2019m the guy with the heavy accent.\u201d\n\nCelis left his whole family behind to head north, first to Canada at the University of Waterloo, and then to America as a computer science professor and engineer.\n\nThis was \u201cone of the hardest decisions of his life,\u201d according to his website. Delany says Celis later tried to sponsor a brother to come to the United States, but said sibling found a faster way in.\n\nImmigration is the one tripwire that could hurt his chances with Republican voters. He calls citizenship \u201ca privilege, not a right\u201d and calls for \u201csecure borders.\u201d However, he\u2019s also supported Washington\u2019s version of the DREAM Act and in the past flirted with a grand bargain that would include some sort of limited amnesty.\n\nOther than that, he\u2019s in lock-step with the conservative base.\n\nCelis wants an amendment to balance the budget, Obamacare\u2019s repeal, and to keep the minimum wage right where it is. He called oil production and a new proposed coal exporting port in Whatcom County good for the environment. He thinks the Hobby Lobby case was rightly decided and is against gay marriage, but for civil unions.\n\nAn internal Celis poll conducted by the firm Moore Information in mid-September found that though DelBene lead Celis in name recognition 78 to 43 percent, she only led him among likely voters by 43 to 34 percent, with 23 percent of voters yet to decide.\n\nFor Team Pedro to win it, late deciders have to break overwhelmingly for Celis. In Napoleon Dynamite, the young Pedro is an exchange student from Mexico who overcomes long odds to win election for class president with the promise that if the rural Idaho high school students will vote for him, \u201cAll your wildest dreams will come true.\u201d\n\nSo I had to ask the campaign: If folks in the First District vote for Celis and he wins, will all of their wildest dreams come true?\n\n\u201cThat is a promise that Pedro cannot make,\u201d Delaney said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "LYNDEN, Wash.\u2014Political scientists don't put much stock in the persuasive power of political yard signs.
