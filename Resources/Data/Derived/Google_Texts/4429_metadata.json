Mr. Carter said his \u201cfundamental starting point\u201d was the desire \u201cto make our conditions and experience of service as attractive as possible to our best people in our country.\u201d He added that he was \u201copen-minded\u201d about \u201cpersonal lives and proclivities\u201d provided service members \u201ccan do what we need them to do for us. That\u2019s the important criteria.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Carter\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpersonal lives and proclivities\u201d was unfortunate, since it suggests that being transgender is a lifestyle choice. And it\u2019s too early to know whether Mr. Carter will follow up his remarks with a prompt review of the ban that prevents the estimated 15,500 transgender service members now in uniform from serving openly. The ban keeps many from seeking hormone treatment or other medical care for fear of being discovered and tossed out of the military.\n\nMr. Carter\u2019s predecessor, Chuck Hagel, said last May that he was \u201copen\u201d to reviewing the unjustified policy against transgender service \u2014 but then failed to follow up.\n\nOn a more encouraging note, Mr. Carter did not reflexively trot out the standard excuse for continuing discrimination, as Mr. Hagel did: Namely, the idea that complex medical issues make it impossible for transgender people to serve in \u201caustere\u201d combat conditions.\n\nThat excuse was debunked last year by a panel of former military officers and experts on gender and health. It concluded that \u201cthere is no compelling medical rationale for banning transgender military service,\u201d and \u201celiminating the ban would advance numerous military interests, including enabling commanders to better care for their service members.\u201d\n\nWill the rules preventing transgender service members from serving openly go the way of \u201cdon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u201d?Context counts. In December, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James said it was \u201clikely\u201d the ban on transgender troops would be evaluated \u201cin the next year or so.\u201d And, similar to Mr. Carter, she said that \u201canyone who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve.\u201d\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s a faction within the Pentagon that\u2019s willing to give transgender troops the respect they deserve.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150223180557, "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/the-next-big-military-civil-rights-issue-transgender-service/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said he was \u201copen-minded\u201d about \u201cpersonal lives and proclivities.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "The Next Big Military Civil Rights Issue: Transgender Service"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003531349, "CLMST": "Dorothy J.
