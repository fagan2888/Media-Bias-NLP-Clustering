Swedish researchers from Linkoping University looked into whether there was a link between environmental factors during childhood and type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe study, published in Diabetologia, the journal of European Association for the Study of Diabetes, is the first to narrow down the conflicts of children who were already diagnosed. Family conflicts, unemployment problems, changes within their family structure, or interventions from social services were such impactful childhood events that they had the power to increase these kids' risk of type 1 diabetes.\n\nMore than 10,000 families with children between the ages of 2 and 14 were analyzed for any stress markers, and compared to the 58 type 1 diabetes diagnoses in the pool of child participants. The research team found if the life event or psychological stress occurs within the first 14 years of a child\u2019s life, their risk of developing childhood diabetes increases three times.\n\n\u201cThe current study examined serious life events experienced at any time before diagnosis,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote, \u201cfurther studies are thus needed to determine when in the autoimmune process psychological stress may contribute, and in association with which other factors, such as genetic factors, infections, or other periods of pronounced beta cell stress.\u201d\n\nType 1 diabetes is caused by unknown factors, but just before it develops, the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to the Mayo Clinic. Researchers believe stressful events in a childhood\u2019s life could contribute to cell stress by increasing levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This happens as the pancreas produces more insulin in response to cortisol, eventually leading to insulin resistance.\n\n\u201cThe causes of type 1 diabetes are highly complex and involve an autoimmune attack brought on by a combination of inherited genes and environmental triggers, such as early diet or viral infection, which are still not fully understood,\u201d Richard Elliott, a research communicator at Diabetes UK, told The Guardian.\n\nOnly five percent of people diagnosed with diabetes have type 1 diabetes, and it\u2019s usually diagnosed in children and young adults, according to the American Diabetes Association. Researchers hope statistics will change with a higher understanding of the abnormal immune system response. In the meantime, parents can watch out for symptoms of stress in their children. Kids and teens may have a difficult time recognizing and verbalizing their own stress, which can manifest in different types of behavior, according to the American Psychological Association. The Association notes children may say they have stomach aches, headaches, or just feel sick in general when a stressor affects their young lives.\n\n\u201cThis research adds to our understanding of the potential role of psychological stress during childhood as one of these triggers,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIt is important to note that, while instances of stress might coincide with or even contribute to a diabetes diagnosis, it is highly unlikely that such events would be the only cause, and having a history of type 1 diabetes in your family is still a much more important risk factor.\u201d\n\nSource: Elliott R.
