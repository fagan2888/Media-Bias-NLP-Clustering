(AP) - A 9-year-old boy who was fatally beaten over a missing birthday cake had been handcuffed for up to three hours a day for a week before the deadly assault, according to court records released Tuesday in Maryland.\n\nA doctor who examined Jack Garcia before the boy died concluded his head injuries and extensive bruising came from numerous beatings and were consistent with torture, police said.\n\nJack Garcia\u2019s mother, Oriana Iris Garcia, 26, approved of her boyfriend and brother handcuffing her son because \u201cshe was trying to teach Jack not to steal,\u201d Hagerstown Police Detective Shane Blankenship wrote in charging documents.\n\nThe boyfriend, Robert Leroy \u201cRoy\u201d Wilson, 30, also disciplined Jack by slapping him in the head, boxing with him with padded gloves and hitting him in the leg with a bamboo sword, Garcia\u2019s brother Jacob Andrew Barajas told police.\n\nBarajas, 23, said all three adults also made Jack eat food he had stolen \u201cuntil he was sick of it,\u201d and \u201cused exercise to help Jack focus better,\u201d the court records say.\n\nThey all lived in the apartment where Jack was assaulted June 30. He died July 5.\n\nThe documents detail second-degree murder and first-degree child-abuse charges against Garcia and Barajas. They were arrested Monday by police who say they had been preparing to leave town. Bail for each is set at $5 million. Neither has a defense attorney listed in court records.\n\nThey told investigators that Wilson inflicted the fatal injuries after Barajas had handcuffed Jack because he was suspected of stealing a cake belonging to Wilson\u2019s 2-year-old daughter.\n\nWilson is being held on assault and child-abuse charges that were leveled before the boy died. His bail is set at $1 million. Wilson\u2019s public defender, Joshua Street, didn\u2019t immediately return a phone call Tuesday from The Associated Press.\n\nJack\u2019s uncle told police that after the boy went unconscious from the beating, he placed him in a seated position on the floor and handcuffed him behind his back to a dining-room chair, using a bicycle lock as an additional restraint. Then, after Wilson went to get Garcia from her job at a Ross Dress for Less store, Barajas called 911 to say Jack was having trouble breathing.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Garcia sent them away, saying the boy was only \u201ccongested\u201d and didn\u2019t need medical attention - even though he was still unconscious, police say.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother told police Jack began \u201cfading in and out\u201d but not talking, so she tried to give him water. But she became alarmed when he started gurgling with every breath, so Wilson called 911 at 10:37 p.m., more than five hours after the first 911 call.\n\nParamedics wanted him airlifted to Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington but foul weather delayed the flight. He was taken to a local hospital and transferred to the Washington hospital sometime after midnight.\n\nThe allegation that Garcia was complicit in Jack\u2019s beating didn\u2019t ring true to her former boyfriend, Daniel Fletcher.\n\n\u201cShe was a loving mother,\u201d Fletcher said in an interview outside the apartment.\n\nHe said Garcia favored time-outs over corporal punishment when they were together because she had read that physical punishment can make a child more aggressive.\n\nFletcher suggested Garcia must not have known how seriously Jack was hurt when she sent the ambulance away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second she would have sent them away, knowing that he was in peril, that he was injured the way he was,\u201d he said.\n\nFletcher, 35, a market researcher now living in Orem, Utah, said he lived with Garcia and Jack for five years in Arizona and in Goleta, California, before she met Wilson online and moved in late February to Davis\u2019 apartment in Hagerstown.\n\nFletcher said he flew to Maryland Saturday for Jack\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my boy but he was pretty much the only son I had,\u201d Fletcher said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 9-year-old boy who was fatally beaten over a missing birthday cake had been handcuffed for up to three hours a day for a week before the deadly assault, according to court records released Tuesday in Maryland.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A 9-year-old boy who was fatally beaten over a missing birthday cake had been handcuffed for up to three hours a day for a week before the deadly assault, according to court records released Tuesday in Maryland.", "title": "Police: Birthday cake beating followed week of handcuffing", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/14/2-more-charged-in-death-of-boy-beaten-for-eating-c/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/cbc2e2d7642b2b1f7c0f6a7067008d61.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/cbc2e2d7642b2b1f7c0f6a7067008d61.jpg", "description": "A 9-year-old boy who was fatally beaten over a missing birthday cake had been handcuffed for up to three hours a day for a week before the deadly assault, according to court records released Tuesday i", "card": "summary", "title": "Police: Birthday cake beating followed week of handcuffing"}, "Author": "DAVID DISHNEAU", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The boy\u2019s mother told police Jack began \u201cfading in and out\u201d but not talking, so she tried to give him water.\nA doctor who examined Jack Garcia before the boy died concluded his head injuries and extensive bruising came from numerous beatings and were consistent with torture, police said.\nWilson is being held on assault and child-abuse charges that were leveled before the boy died.\nThey told investigators that Wilson inflicted the fatal injuries after Barajas had handcuffed Jack because he was suspected of stealing a cake belonging to Wilson\u2019s 2-year-old daughter.\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Garcia sent them away, saying the boy was only \u201ccongested\u201d and didn\u2019t need medical attention - even though he was still unconscious, police say."}
