The thought that his wrist might be fractured did initially run through Jameer Nelson’s mind.

But a clean MRI alleviated any worry.

Still, Nelson said he is having “mobility issues” in his left wrist and remains a question mark to play in the Nuggets’ game on Tuesday against Oklahoma City.

“It was one of those freakish accidents, things that happen,” Nelson said. “It’s just part of the game. It’s gotten better, swelling is going down a little bit. Just got to continue to get treatment on it.”

Nelson missed Sunday’s game against the Pacers and is day-to-day with a sprained left wrist. He’d been playing a ton of minutes in the games leading up to the injury, so the days off should help not only his wrist, but his entire body.

But the wrist is of most concern. That’s why he was relieved when the MRI came back showing no structural damage.

“So that allows me to feel a little better about it, knowing that nothing is broken or fractured,” Nelson said. “That was the initial thought when I first did it.”
