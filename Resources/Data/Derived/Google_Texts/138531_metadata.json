Recall that Mitt Romney pledged to repeal the whole magilla if he became president. Romney didn\u2019t win, of course, and it\u2019s no more likely that President Obama would ever sign a repeal of Dodd-Frank than it is that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Republicans don\u2019t need an alternative financial-reform agenda, especially considering that the U.S. has averaged a financial crisis every half-dozen years the past few decades. So far for the GOP, it\u2019s pretty much been about the three \u201cFs\u201d: Fannie, Freddie, and \u201cFeddie\u201d \u2014 to prevent future bubbles, shutter the two government mortgage giants and shackle the U.S. central bank.\n\nYet it\u2019s hard to see what that approach does to reform a Too Big to Fail financial system of growing size, concentration, and complexity. As analysis from the Dallas Fed recently pointed out, fewer than a dozen megabanks \u2014 just 0.2 percent of all banking organizations \u2014 control two-thirds of the assets in the U.S. banking industry. And if international accounting rules \u2014 which count a wider range of derivatives \u2014 were applied to U.S. banks, over half of all bank assets would be held by just three institutions: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. These megabanks, as Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher puts it, are each capable \u201cthrough a series of missteps by their management of seriously damaging the vitality, resilience, and prosperity that has personified the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nThat was true before Dodd-Frank, and it\u2019s still true today. There is no reason to think that the next time a megabank finds itself in a financial pinch, government won\u2019t find a way to come riding to the rescue in the name of systemic stability and panic prevention. \u201cThe history of big bank failure is a history of the state blinking before private creditors,\u201d notes the Bank of England\u2019s Andrew Haldane. But extraordinary measures by scared lawmakers may not even be necessary: Dodd-Frank allows a failed megabank, through the law\u2019s \u201corderly liquidation authority,\u201d to be kept alive for years by special U.S. Treasury financing.\n\nThere are several options that reform-minded Republicans and Democrats should consider. FDIC director and former Kansas City Fed president Thomas Hoenig has proposed a sort of super Volcker rule, which would ban banks with FDIC-insured deposits from any sort of trading or market-making, as well from owning complex securities such as the collateralized debt obligations that played a starring role in the financial crisis. Banks would be limited to well-understood activities such as commercial lending, asset management, and stock and bond underwriting. Banks would become smaller, simpler, and blessedly boring.\n\nThe Dallas Fed\u2019s Fisher is also in favor of downsizing the megabanks and would add two additional provisions. First, limit the federal safety net \u2014 deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window \u2014 to traditional commercial banks only. Their parent companies and non-bank affiliates would be excluded. Second, customers, creditors, and counterparties of all non-bank affiliates would have to sign a simple form acknowledging there is no federal backstop available to them.\n\nFinally, banks should be required to finance their lending with far more shareholder equity, as opposed to money borrowed from creditors. This is how it worked in the pre-deposit-insurance era of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig argue in The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes: What\u2019s Wrong With Banking and What to Do About It, requiring banks to have an equity cushion \u201con the order of 20\u201330 percent of their total assets would make the financial system substantially safer and healthier.\u201d\n\nReining in Fannie, Freddie, and Feddie is an incomplete, although ideologically comfortable, financial-reform agenda for the GOP. Next year would a good time to add ending Too Big to Fail to that list.\n\n\u2014 James Pethokoukis, a columnist, blogs for the American Enterprise Institute.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "A Conservative Volcker Rule", "sailthru.author": "James Pethokoukis", "description": "Republicans generally don\u2019t like the now-adopted Volcker rule, which prevents banks with federally insured deposits from trading for their own profit \u2014 or much else about the Dodd-Frank financial-reform law, for that matter.
