SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Officials at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City say one of their elephants has died at the age of 55.

Zookeepers say they euthanized Dari on Saturday after her health had been declining for months and after she was found lying on the ground in the morning.

Hogle Zoo officials say she was the oldest African elephant in North America, and had outlived the average life expectancy of African elephants in the wild, which is 42 years. Senior veterinarian Dr. Nancy Carpenter said Dari had been receiving treatment for arthritis and other conditions associated with old age.

Zoo officials say Dari came to the Hogle Zoo in 1967 and did not have any calves.

Hogle Zoo still has two other elephants, including 26-year-old Christie and her 6-year-old calf, Zuri.
