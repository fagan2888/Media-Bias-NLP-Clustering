But there\u2019s no satisfaction in it either.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Ariel Castro \u2013 the man who in July was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison in connection with the abductions and rapes of three Cleveland women \u2013 was found hanging from a bed sheet in his cell. The circumstances of Castro\u2019s death raise a number of questions \u2013 though the 53 year-old was not on suicide watch, he was in protective custody. Ohio corrections spokeswoman JoEllen Smith told reporters Tuesday that Castro had been \u201cin a cell by himself,\u201d with guards required to check in on him \u201cevery 30 minutes at staggered intervals.\u201d Smith says, \u201cA thorough review of this incident is under way.\u201d\n\nHow was a man whom prosecutors revealed last spring had left a suicide note in his home, a man whose attorney says he was repeatedly \u201cdenied and thwarted\u201d in his attempts to obtain psychological evaluation for him, apparently given both the time and the tools by which to end his life? On the Shrink Rap blog Wednesday, ClinkShrink wrote eloquently about prison suicide, noting that \u201cThe general public \u2014 and even some physicians \u2014 are going to instinctively give you a \u2018Who cares? He\u2019s just a criminal\u2019 response even if they don\u2019t know the person or what he was locked up for\u201d and revealing, \u201cThere\u2019s even a recent study to suggest that being charged with a crime increases one\u2019s risk of suicide, even if that person is never incarcerated.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to Castro\u2019s victims \u2014 Michelle Knight, Georgina DeJesus and Amanda Berry \u2013 to decide whether death or a life in jail would be the greater retribution for his crimes. Knight\u2019s attorney has said the women will not be making a statement. But Castro\u2019s swift demise does seem an abrupt and unsatisfying end to his tale. His family member Maria Castro-Montes told CNN Tuesday that her reaction to the news \u201cwas just shock\u2026 Part of it was even relief in hopes that now this will just end all of it, and that his name will not be out in the spotlight for years and years to come. I just hope the victims can move past this now.\u201d And on NBC Wednesday, psychologist Dr. Linda Papadopoulos said that Castro \u201cdecided his fate, something they were never ever able to do for themselves. He had ultimate control. To some extent this was in a way his last slap to their faces \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ve got this over you.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cleveland kidnapper's apparent suicide is a failure of justice -- and the prison system", "title": "Don\u2019t be glad Ariel Castro is dead", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Cleveland kidnapper's apparent suicide is a failure of justice -- and the prison system", "title": "Don\u2019t be glad Ariel Castro is dead", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/04/dont_be_glad_ariel_castro_is_dead/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/castro_suicide.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Cleveland kidnapper's apparent suicide is a failure of justice -- and the prison system", "title": "Don\u2019t be glad Ariel Castro is dead", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/castro_suicide.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amanda Berry, Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapping, Editor's Picks, Georgina DeJesus, Michelle Knight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd112c\"", "article_summary": "The circumstances of Castro\u2019s death raise a number of questions \u2013 though the 53 year-old was not on suicide watch, he was in protective custody.\nTopics: Amanda Berry, Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapping, Editor's Picks, Georgina DeJesus, Michelle Knight, Life NewsThere are no tears to be shed, no grief to be found, in the death of a monster.\nTo some extent this was in a way his last slap to their faces \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ve got this over you.\nOn Tuesday evening, Ariel Castro \u2013 the man who in July was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison in connection with the abductions and rapes of three Cleveland women \u2013 was found hanging from a bed sheet in his cell.\nBut Castro\u2019s swift demise does seem an abrupt and unsatisfying end to his tale."}
