FireKeepers Casino Hotel, owned and operated by the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, proudly announced its five years of operation this August.

In honor of the milestone, a month-long celebration will feature a Porsche Boxster giveaway, Harley-Davidson giveaway, and a $250,000 cash giveaway as well as an event where guests can sign up for a special $5 hotel room rate. FireKeepers Casino opened in August 2009, and the hotel and conference center were added in December 2012. In 2014 the property continued to expand on its business model with the launch of the new Online Gaming and mobile app in April, and the complete remodel of Kabaret Lounge in May while increasing its impact on the local community with the inaugural FireKeepers Casino Hotel Championship golf tournament in June. The year also saw numerous accolades recognizing tribal and casino leadership, with Tribal Chairman Homer A. Mandoka being awarded the 2013 NAFOA Tribal Leader of the Year, and Vice Chair Jamie Stuck, Secretary Dorie Rios, and Senior Vice President & Assistant General Manager Brian D. Decorah being named to multiple “40 under 40” lists.

FireKeepers Casino and Hotel has also contributed greatly to the state and local economies. In addition to providing jobs and economic development in the area, the property has paid $58 million to the State of Michigan and donated $21.9 million to the FireKeepers Local Revenue Sharing Board since 2009, both as part of the NHBP’s compact. In August, 2014, FireKeepers Casino Hotel will surpass $250 million in cumulative paid labor costs that include: total wages, health insurance, 401 (k), and incentives to the 1,700 full and part time team members since opening. The tribe’s commitment to local spending has resulted in awarding contracts in excess of $93.1 million since opening across the state.
