We want to hear them, and we will not shy away from contentious issues because you speak frankly about these issues.\n\nHowever, recently, the conversation has coarsened, especially on our Facebook page, the focal point of many of the debates we host.\n\nWhen we post articles about crime, full blown battles have broken out. Some have engaged in a frankly sickening game of one-upmanship, trying to outdo each other in the graphic punishments they would mete out against the accused. It foments a lynch mob mentality. Suggesting that someone accused of a crime be hanged or shot, for example, does little to move the discussion forward..\n\nAdd to these disgusting comments the outraged response from friends and family members of the accused, and we suddenly find ourselves at HTR Media in the middle of profane, deeply personal arguments.\n\nWe understand that Facebook postings can often be written in the heat of a moment. Some crimes just get under our skin and, quite frankly, make us angry, but many of the comments we have been receiving on these stories offend us and, we believe, the vast majority of our readers.\n\nIt is not only with crime stories that we notice this shift in our Facebook fare. Personal attacks against the subjects of stories \u2014 or against those who write the stories \u2014 also are on the rise. Name calling and threats have no place in a civil discourse, yet we find them on the increase.\n\nWe work to provide our HTR Media print and online readers with the best possible experience. We value your communication with us and provide a number of avenues to accomplish that, including Facebook reaction to local stories.\n\nHowever, many of these recent comments would never be printed in our newspaper. If they were broadcast on radio or TV without being \u201cbleeped\u201d out, the stations would face fines from the FCC. We will not have a different policy for our Facebook page than for our newspaper.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make your point without swearing, then we\u2019ll hide it or delete it. If you write about the violent punishment you would carry out against a person accused or convicted of a crime, we will hide or delete that comment.\n\nCensorship? No, it\u2019s our community policy. We\u2019re not stopping you from venting like this. Share the story on your Facebook page and write whatever you want, but on our Facebook, we expect you to respect our rules. We\u2019ll be publishing those guidelines soon so everyone knows our house rules.\n\nWe are evaluating the way readers interact with us on Facebook, and we will be making changes to what we post on our Facebook page and how we can foster positive, productive conversations and debates. In the meantime, we ask that readers remain \u2014 or become \u2014 respectful in what they post in reaction to our stories and photos. If necessary, take a few moments before writing that post to think about the impact it will have on those directly involved, and how it will be received by readers in general.\n\nWe value your comments, and we take them seriously and use them to help evaluate the effectiveness of what we do in seeking to provide what readers want.\n\nAs we look at how we use Facebook, try to keep things as civil and positive as possible. It will make a better experience for everyone involved.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1p3imyO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our Facebook page is not the place to use violent, profane language and foment a lynch mob mentality.", "og": {"site_name": "HTR Media", "description": "Our Facebook page is not the place to use violent, profane language and foment a lynch mob mentality.", "title": "Please keep social media postings positive", "url": "http://www.htrnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/08/23/please-keep-social-media-postings-positive/14495145/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/htrnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our Facebook page is not the place to use violent, profane language and foment a lynch mob mentality.", "title": "Please keep social media postings positive", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14f3caf2afbbd6820e3bd9d49d7b26050177c792/c=700-0-2500-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Manitowoc/2014/08/23/facebookimage.jpg", "creator": "@htrnews", "site": "@htrnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883325026", "fb": {"app_id": 179306802094584}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "However, recently, the conversation has coarsened, especially on our Facebook page, the focal point of many of the debates we host.\nWe will not have a different policy for our Facebook page than for our newspaper.\nShare the story on your Facebook page and write whatever you want, but on our Facebook, we expect you to respect our rules.\nWe work to provide our HTR Media print and online readers with the best possible experience.\nAs we look at how we use Facebook, try to keep things as civil and positive as possible."}
