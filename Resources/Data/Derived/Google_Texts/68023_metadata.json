The 22nd District is in Jefferson County, while the 24th stretches across a large area of central and west St. Louis County.\n\nThe 24th District pits state Rep. Jill Schupp, D-Creve Coeur, versus Republican attorney Jay Ashcroft.\n\nIt\u2019s the type of state Senate race that\u2019s become fairly common in recent years: A Democratic state representative with a lengthy voting record squares off against a Republican neophyte making an inaugural run for office.\n\nIn the 22nd District, the contest is a rematch of two longtime rivals: state Reps. Paul Wieland, R-Imperial, and Jeff Roorda, D-Barnhart.\n\nBoth seats are open because the incumbents are leaving office. In the 22nd, Democrat Ryan McKenna of Crystal City left early to take a post in Gov. Jay Nixon\u2019s administration. In the 24th, Republican John Lamping of Frontenac is leaving after one term.\n\nBoth parties see opportunities for victory, although the results won\u2019t dramatically affect the veto-proof majority that the Senate Republicans already enjoy.\n\nSchupp has proven to be a formidable fundraiser, racking up more than $1 million for the race since she announced last year. She\u2019s received help from the Missouri Democratic Party, as well as fundraising help from U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Attorney General Chris Koster and Gov. Jay Nixon.\n\nBut Ashcroft, too, has received a generous stream of money from his party\u2019s campaign committees. He recently netted a $250,000 donation from the Missouri Senate Campaign Committee. The Missouri Club for Growth also has launched an independent $250,000 TV ad campaign attacking Schupp\u2019s record in the Missouri House.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the same heavy-hitters in both parties have assisted Roorda and Wieland. Both also have gotten a significant amount of financial help from their respective parties and party leaders.\n\nThe combined fundraising by Roorda and Wieland is close to $1.2 million, excluding their parties\u2019 help.\n\nOn Friday, the GOP's state Senate arm gave $250,000 to Wieland.\n\n24th District\n\nAfter working in the advertising business and as a teacher, Schupp eventually ran for and won a seat on the Ladue School Board. She later served on the Creve Coeur City Council before winning a hard-fought state representative race in 2008.\n\nSchupp spent her three terms in the Missouri House in the minority, and she often stood up to oppose some House Republican priorities \u2013 including efforts to cut taxes, relax gun regulations and restrict abortion rights. She said she\u2019ll try to strike a balance in the Missouri Senate between working with her Republican counterparts and fighting against what she sees as bad ideas.\n\n\u201cFinding solutions to the problems we face and working with people across the aisle have always been the way that I\u2019ve worked best,\u201d Schupp said on a recent edition of the Politically Speaking podcast. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also seen the past six years that I\u2019ve been in the legislature, the extremists have set the agenda. And the things coming out of Jefferson City are very extreme pieces of legislation.\n\n\u201cSometimes playing defense is the most important thing we can do and the best thing we can do,\u201d she added.\n\nSchupp also is a strong supporter of expanding Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. And if she wins, the fact that she\u2019ll be replacing a major opponent of that move \u2013 Lamping \u2013 could help get a plan across the finish line.\n\nAshcroft, who earned an engineering and law degree, is making his first run for political office. But he\u2019s not a stranger to politics, as his father John Ashcroft ran for and won numerous statewide offices before becoming U.S. attorney general.\n\nIn previous interviews with St. Louis Public Radio, Ashcroft said he was prompted to run for the seat because he felt a calling to represent his friends and neighbors in the Missouri Senate. He promised to take a different mindset than other lawmakers in Jefferson City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to be a career politician,\u201d Ashcroft said. \u201cI really want to be someone that\u2019s taking the voices of the district to Jefferson City, instead of being the voice in Jefferson City that\u2019s dictating to the district. There\u2019s 160,000 to 170,000 people in the district. It doesn\u2019t matter how smart our legislators are in Jefferson City. The people of the district know more.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, Ashcroft has tended to veer away from promising specific policy goals. But he has said, in line with other GOP candidates, that he wants to focus on removing regulatory hurdles for individuals and businesses.\n\n\u201cWe need to be willing to take the general principle that the purpose of government is to protect individual liberty \u2013 the liberty of individuals to live their lives how they choose to as long as they\u2019re not hurting someone else,\u201d Ashcroft said.\n\n\u201cAnd with that in mind, find the best solution for that area or whatever the problem is: Be it education. Be it creating an environment that\u2019s conducive for more jobs. Be it just creating better transparency so the people have a better idea what\u2019s going on in Jefferson City.\u201d\n\n22nd District\n\nWieland defeated Roorda in a 2010 contest for the Missouri House. But in 2012, thanks to redistricting, the two ran and won different House seats in Jefferson City.\n\nThe two have similar conservative voting records in the state House. Both also are pro-union and oppose right-to-work proposals to restrict union rights.\n\nEach says he\u2019s focusing primarily on economic issues. Each also accuses his rival of actually pressing other issues.\n\nRoorda accuses Wieland of being \u201cin lockstep with a radical agenda in Jefferson City.\u2019\u2019 Wieland says he\u2019s more in tune with the district, portraying Roorda as not conservative enough, especially on social issues.\n\nBoth men have been in the news a lot lately, and for reasons not directly tied to their contest.\n\nWieland, who owns an insurance company, has attracted national attention over his suit against the federal Affordable Care Act's provisions requiring insurers to cover contraception.\n\nWieland and his wife, who are staunch Catholics, say they don't want such coverage available for their three daughters. The family is insured under the state of Missouri's insurance covering state employees, and he is suing because there isn\u2019t an opt-out provision for contraceptive coverage.\n\nRoorda is a former police officer and currently business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. Roorda also sits on the board of directors of Shield of Hope, the charitable arm of the Fraternal Order of Police. Shield of Hope is a 501C3 group, meaning that it is a nonprofit and must report its finances to the IRS.\n\nShield of Hope has raised money to assist Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager. The shooting has triggered months of unrest and protests. Roorda emphasizes that he\u2019s not taking a stand on whether Wilson acted appropriately or not. But he adds that Wilson deserves a fair investigation and an adequate defense.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "The St. Louis area is home to Missouri\u2019s arguably most competitive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 state Senate contests on the Nov. 4 ballot.
