(WANE) \u2013 A Kokomo baseball stadium is the reason FEMA has stopped millions of federal dollars from coming to Indiana, including nearly $2 million dollars earmarked for Fort Wayne and Allen County.\n\nFEMA has suspended hazard mitigation grants worth $5.5 million because Kokomo officials built the stadium on a part of a floodplain. FEMA officials told developers in late 2014 to not build the stadium on the part of the floodplain.\n\nFort Wayne was earmarked for $1.1 million to buy homes in flood-prone areas. Rodney Renkenberger, Maumee River Basin Commission\u2019s executive director, spent most of his Monday morning talking to homeowners who have been waiting for a few years for their homes to be bought out with those federal dollars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my morning so far trying to call the people who are participants in the Fort Wayne grant application and letting them know that this is what\u2019s happening,\u201d Renkenberger said.\n\nRenkenberger said the timeline on when homeowners could get their money is still uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt may be six months, it could be a year. We don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part and because a lot of these flood victims have been waiting for two plus years to be bought out.\u201d\n\nThe city also applied for part of a more than $1.5 million FEMA grant for more property acquisition.\n\nAs far as the $1.1 million, those funds could still be available depending on how long the issue with Kokomo continues. When it comes to the partial $1.5 million grant, if the issue isn\u2019t resolved by April 1, those funds will no longer be available.\n\nNewsChannel 15 reached out to Kokomo officials about the issue. They released the following statement:\n\n\u201cWe firmly dispute FEMA\u2019s assertions that the eight parcels in question are not in compliance. We believe that the redesign plans are fully compliant with the deed restrictions placed on the parcels; that is why we filed suit against IDHS on January 26.\n\nFEMA has not provided the City of Kokomo with any actionable, specific instructions for how to align the design with their demands. We have offered several alternative designs yet they provide no guidance for how we can address their concerns. They offer no explanation for their position.\n\nWe are in continued talks with IDHS regarding this issue and our related lawsuit. We know the state understands the overreach of the federal government; Governor Pence and his departments have actively fought, or filed suit against, federal government overreach on the Affordable Care Act, Immigration Reform, Education Policy and other issues. IDHS has indicated a willingness to concur and support Kokomo\u2019s position in recent discussions.\n\nWe are evaluating FEMA\u2019s current position and are open to discussing what change, if any, is needed to the project in order to bring finality to it. This political and bureaucratic interference may cause a delay, but we are committed to completing Kokomo Municipal Stadium.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "FEMA has suspended mitigation grants for all 92 Indiana counties because Kokomo's baseball stadium is not compliant.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "FEMA has suspended mitigation grants for all 92 Indiana counties because Kokomo\u2019s baseball stadium is not compliant.", "title": "Kokomo stadium responsible for FEMA suspending grants statewide", "url": "http://wane.com/2015/03/02/kokomo-stadium-responsible-for-fema-suspending-grants-statewide/", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/kokomo-baseball-stadium1.jpg", "height": 286}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FEMA has suspended mitigation grants for all 92 Indiana counties because Kokomo\u2019s baseball stadium is not compliant.", "title": "Kokomo stadium responsible for FEMA suspending grants statewide", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/kokomo-baseball-stadium1.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wane15", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16", "application-name": "WANE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2015-03-03T00:06:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-03T13:20:09+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1cb\"", "article_summary": "FEMA has suspended hazard mitigation grants worth $5.5 million because Kokomo officials built the stadium on a part of a floodplain.\nThis political and bureaucratic interference may cause a delay, but we are committed to completing Kokomo Municipal Stadium.\u201d\nFEMA officials told developers in late 2014 to not build the stadium on the part of the floodplain.\nNewsChannel 15 reached out to Kokomo officials about the issue.\nWhen it comes to the partial $1.5 million grant, if the issue isn\u2019t resolved by April 1, those funds will no longer be available."}
