The state got highest marks for providing health coverage to children under the Affordable Care Act, as well as relatively high ones in other areas such as linking the high school curriculum to career pathways, introducing Common Core academic standards and Next Generation Science Standards, after-school and summer learning, and targeting state funds at children with the highest needs.\n\nThe report card, released annually for more than two decades, issued letter grades (A through F) for how the state is doing in 31 key education, health and child welfare areas that are aimed at the neediest student populations. The goal is to encourage state lawmakers and educators to increase investments in these areas.\n\nThe grades are not based on any standardized assessments, but reflect the views of the organization based on its interpretation of data and reports from a wide range of sources.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a wealthy state, with more assets than most to devote to its children\u2019s well-being,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put more of our resources to work for kids, by investing in quality programs to help lift them out of poverty and set them on the road to success.\u201d\n\nNearly half of the state\u2019s 9 million children come from poor or low-income families. Yet many don\u2019t have comprehensive access to services that can lead to an improved quality of life, the report charged.\n\nRelated Injunction would require trauma training for Compton Unified staff\n\nChildren Now President Ted Lempert said the one of the report card\u2019s most troubling findings shows the state continues to do little to promote healing for the more than 1 million children experiencing trauma, a category that earned a D- grade. Research has shown that children suffering from abuse, neglect and those witnessing violence at home can experience serious long-term consequences, including health problems like diabetes and mental health challenges like depression, he said.\n\n\u201cTrauma can impede emotional well-being, impact school performance and set kids up for a lifetime of health problems,\u201d Lempert said in a news release. \u201cCalifornia must do more to assess children for trauma and find them the help they need to heal.\u201d\n\nThe highest grade Children Now awarded was an A minus for health insurance coverage of children, largely as a result of the state\u2019s positive response to the federal Affordable Care Act, which has caused the rate of insured children to climb to 95 percent statewide.\n\nHere is a sampling of the grades it awarded in eight of the 31 areas the report examined:\n\nInfant and toddler care, grade D: Children Now noted that \u201cCalifornia is taking small but important steps toward improving access and ensuring affordable, quality care for the families that need it most,\u201d but families of infants and toddlers are least likely to receive help to pay for childcare, and the quality of care can vary widely. The report says the majority of the over 300,000 infants and children who meet eligibility requirements still don\u2019t have access to subsidized care.\n\nPreschool, grade B-: After years of budget cuts to preschool services, the report praises the state making \u201csignificant new investments in preschool access, affordability and quality. But it notes that California still does not provide universal preschool, and access and cost sets up barriers to preschool for many children.\n\nK-12 funding, grade C-: California has increased public school spending in recent years ( by $3,000 per child since just four years ago, according to one EdSource report). But it continues to lag behind in national comparisons of per pupil spending, with the state spending an average of $10,120 annually compared to the $17,777 average spent annually by the top ten spending states.\n\nAcademic standards, grade B-: The state gets high marks for moving aggressively the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards. But the report says it should be doing more to fully implement these standards, and also update standards for other subject areas.\n\nTeacher training and evaluation, grade D: Taking on one of the most controversial issues in the state, the Children Now report asserts that \u201cmost districts fail to provide teachers with the feedback they need to improve\u201d and that \u201cmany districts don\u2019t include measures of student achievement in evaluations of teachers.\u201d\n\nOral health, grade D+: While 55 percent of California children are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the report says fewer than half have received any dental services during the previous year. Each year, there are more than 25,000 children\u2019s dental-related emergency room visits.\n\nObesity prevention and nutrition, grade C-: Each year, about 3.4 million school children are eligible for free and reduced-priced meals, but 1.1 million do not receive those meals. The report says that \u201cCalifornia has taken steps to help give children access to drinking water and healthier food at school. But much more must be done, including reducing the consumption of sugary beverages and increasing access to nutritious meals and snacks during the summer and in after school programs.\u201d\n\nFoster youth education, grade D+: Under the Local Control Funding Formula, schools now receive extra funds to serve foster youth, and a recent state law requires that they receive additional educational assistance and supports. But about one in three foster youths miss at least a month of school every year, and the report concludes that too few of them \u201care getting the education they need to succeed in life.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that several groups and agencies statewide have launched initiatives to target many of these issues. Also, the improved economy has allowed the state to target additional dollars to fill in some of the gaps in services noted in the report. Still, the state\u2019s policy makers need to do much more to ensure more children students from high need backgrounds succeed, Lempert said. \u201cState investment in these critical areas will save money in the long term,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report also includes a \u201cscorecard\u201d for each of the state\u2019s 58 counties on more than two dozen indicators of a child\u2019s health and well-being.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A non-profit journalism website reporting on key education issues in California and beyond.", "tags": "education news, california education, non-profit news, common core, local control funding formula, k-12 education", "og": {"url": "http://edsource.org/2016/report-gives-childrens-services-in-california-more-low-grades-than-high-ones/92939", "image": "http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/06.preschool.jpg", "site_name": "EdSource", "title": "Report gives children\u2019s services in California more low grades than high ones"}, "twitter": {"site": "@edsource", "description": "A non-profit journalism website reporting on key education issues in California and beyond.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report gives children\u2019s services in California more low grades than high ones"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b7e\"", "article_summary": "Academic standards, grade B-: The state gets high marks for moving aggressively the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards.\nThe 2016 \u201cCalifornia Children\u2019s Report Card\u201d also gave low marks to state services for infant and toddler care, teacher training and evaluation, obesity prevention and nutrition, and foster youth education.\nThe report says that \u201cCalifornia has taken steps to help give children access to drinking water and healthier food at school.\n\u201cCalifornia is a wealthy state, with more assets than most to devote to its children\u2019s well-being,\u201d the report said.\nYet many don\u2019t have comprehensive access to services that can lead to an improved quality of life, the report charged."}
