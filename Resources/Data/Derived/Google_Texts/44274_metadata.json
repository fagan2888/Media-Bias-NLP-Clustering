The hospital released a statement on the situation, saying:\n\n\"Hospitals only collect a small percentage of our charges, or \u2018list prices.\u2019 We are required to give Medicare one level of discount from list price, Medicaid another, and private insurers negotiate for still others. \u2026 If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation. \u2026 Our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients. In some cases, Lake Norman Regional\u2019s charge is considerably higher than other local hospitals.\"\n\nAfter the Blue Cross' discount, Lake Norman Regional dropped the price to the not-so-cheap grand total of $20,227 and the couple STILL had to pay $5,400 to cover their deductible!\n\nLuckily, Eric was able to pay the bill and even says the treatment he received was \"beyond phenomenal,\" however, Laura still questions whether the prices are totally ethical:\n\n\"What if it was someone that didn\u2019t have the resources to research and didn\u2019t have insurance? What is fair and equitable here?\"\n\nStarting in June, North Carolina hospitals are going to have to make their procedure prices available to the public, which will hopefully make things a bit easier for the consumers, or in this case, the snake-bitten!\n\nUntil then, residents might want to avoid snakes at all costs!\n\nTags: anti venom, blue cross, emergency room, eric ferguson, gifs, health, hospital, icky icky poo, lake norman regional medical center, laura ferguson, north carolina, overcharged, price, slithering snakes, snake bite", "article_metadata": {"description": "A North Carolina man found himself facing a HUGE bill after being treated for a snake bite!", "title": "Man Charged More Than $89,000 For $750 Worth Of Snake Venom And 18-Hour Hospital Stay!", "og": {"url": "http://perezhilton.com/fitperez/2014-02-02-man-overcharged-eighty-nine-thousand-dollars-for-snake-bite-venom", "image": {"width": 575, "identifier": "http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/man-charged-81000-dollars-for-snake-bit-venom.gif", "type": "image/gif", "height": 324}, "type": "article", "description": "A North Carolina man found himself facing a HUGE bill after being treated for a snake bite!", "title": "Man Charged More Than $89,000 For $750 Worth Of Snake Venom And 18-Hour Hospital Stay!"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PerezHilton", "description": "A North Carolina man found himself facing a HUGE bill after being treated for a snake bite!", "card": "summary", "title": "Man Charged More Than $89,000 For $750 Worth Of Snake Venom And 18-Hour Hospital Stay!"}, "botify-site-verification": "f4noNRNmylRngbEW7tfdgZWcCimPVmeG", "p": {"domain_verify": "1236f683124f133aa3dbeb8727141b29"}, "fb": {"app_id": 519028218124180}, "msvalidate.01": "7194517B76439A893EB37CE8733FCBAE", "google-site-verification": "qglU8HAcnf57Vs2kL70RP4fzNl6V7Wwhk-5Imy9jeOU", "news_keywords": "eric ferguson, laura ferguson, lake norman regional medical center, emergency room, north carolina, snake bite, anti venom, overcharged, price, hospital,", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 2 Feb 2014 14:02:48 EST"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccce7\"", "article_summary": "Tags: anti venom, blue cross, emergency room, eric ferguson, gifs, health, hospital, icky icky poo, lake norman regional medical center, laura ferguson, north carolina, overcharged, price, slithering snakes, snake bite\nLast year, Eric Ferguson and his wife Laura rushed to the Lake Norman Regional Medical Center after he suffered a snake bite on his foot!\n\u2026 If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation.\nIn some cases, Lake Norman Regional\u2019s charge is considerably higher than other local hospitals.\"\nAfter the Blue Cross' discount, Lake Norman Regional dropped the price to the not-so-cheap grand total of $20,227 and the couple STILL had to pay $5,400 to cover their deductible!"}
