Shopping, cooking, managing finances or providing transportation are referred to as assisting with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs.)\n\nNow we know that almost half of family caregivers are doing all of these things and more. They are doing things that make nursing students nervous before lots of training.\n\nRELATED: AARP\u2019s Caregiving Resource Center\n\nA recent report, Home Alone: Family Caregivers Providing Complex Chronic Care tells us, for the first time, all the daily tasks these caregivers accomplish each day.\n\nThey\u2019re giving medications \u2013 not just one pill in the morning \u2013 many different kinds of medications, several times a day \u2013 pills, eye drops, inhalers, injections, even infusion pumps. They\u2019re checking for side effects and worry about making mistakes. Some are caring for different types of wounds while others are preparing special diets, or using incontinence equipment, glucometers, and telehealth devices. The list goes on: oxygen, tube feedings, home dialysis equipment, ventilators and more.\n\nBlog continues after infographic\n\nIf that is not amazing enough, these family caregivers tell us they have gotten virtually no training to do any of this.\n\nSix out of 10 learned about at least some of the medications on their own.\n\nFour out of 10 doing wound care had to learn at least partly on their own.\n\nThis is simply not acceptable.\n\nFamily caregivers who take on these complex \u201cmedical/nursing tasks\u201d need and deserve clear, written instructions, training and practice, and encouragement to call professionals who can answer questions and offer more support \u2013 along with a contact number.\n\nAt AARP, we are raising the expectation that all health care professionals need to offer or arrange for this training and support. We are working with many partners to get new training opportunities in place to make it easier for family caregivers to get the help they need to do this complicated job \u2026 the whole job.\n\nWhat family caregivers can do is expect and demand more from their doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others.\n\nDo not sign the pharmacy form that says you have been counseled on the prescription if you really don\u2019t understand the medication, or how to give it and what to expect.\n\nAsk for help.\n\nDon\u2019t tell the hospital that you and your family member are ready for discharge if you do not feel safe to do the tasks you have been told you need to do.\n\nTell the nurse or social worker that you need more instructions.\n\nAsk for a referral to home care for follow-up teaching.\n\nTell the doctor you are worried and need more support.\n\nOur research shows that family caregivers are doing more than ever before. Now we need to make sure we help them do this crucial work. For information, try Next Step In Care.\n\n\u2013 Susan Reinhard, PhD\n\nSusan C. Reinhard heads AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute.
