( Camera file photo )\n\nEditor's note: This article has been changed to include the University of Colorado's International Film Series as one of the art house cinema options in Boulder.\n\nThe Boulder Public Library plans to turn the Canyon Theater on the north side of the Main Public Library into an art house movie theater three nights a week.\n\nThe movie theater, which is scheduled to open in early 2016, is the result of more than a year of discussions between the library and Downtown Boulder Inc., which will manage ticket sales, alcohol service and marketing.\n\n\"We've been trying for years to get an independent arts cinema downtown,\" said Sean Maher, executive director of Downtown Boulder. \"We've been close a few times, but it's never happened. And it came to us: The library has a 200-seat theater that sits unused most of the time.\"\n\nDavid Farnan, Boulder's director of library and arts, said he hopes to bring more activity to the north building of the library and to the surrounding Civic Area, and the library has hired a curator with expertise in independent films to choose movies for the cinema.\n\n\"The curation of the cinema is crucial,\" he said. \"I think if we have the right films, we'll draw the right audience, and then we need to create the right experience so they want to come back.\"\n\nThe library has obtained a liquor license to serve beer and wine at the cinema, and Seeds Library Cafe, run by the Boulder County Farmers' Market, will provide food service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The whole idea behind it is to create an awesome experience for the public,\" Farnan said. \"It's a nice space, but it's a little outdated, so we're going to play up the nostalgia effect.\"\n\nProfits will fund other library programs\n\nThe theater will open at 6 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. On Thursdays, when the library is open later, the library will be closed from the theater side to reduce disruption to library patrons.\n\nThe Canyon Theater will remain available for library programs and community groups the rest of the time.\n\nWhile Farnan said he has high hopes for the movie theater, it's not a cheap venture. The digital projector alone costs $25,000, and other startup costs, such as coordinating the sound system with the projector, could bring the capital costs above $50,000. Those costs are being paid with donations to the library's gift fund and from savings in other areas of the library budget. The operational costs will probably be around $100,000 a year, Farnan said.\n\nTo break even, the theater needs to average 30 percent capacity across six shows a week, though Farnan hopes for much better attendance. Unlike other library programs, there will be a fee for the movies. That fee has not been determined, but it likely will be similar to or slightly less than regular movie tickets, Farnan said.\n\nIf the project makes money, the profits will be put into other library programs, including free matinees for children, Farnan said.\n\nFarnan said the project carries some risk.\n\n\"All the indicators are that there is demand, but I am a show-me guy, and I'll believe it when I see it,\" he said. \"I have spent as much time thinking about how we dissolve this as how to make it successful. We will see some bumps.\"\n\n'We need some alternatives'\n\nAt the same time, the cinema project \u2014 which will go by Boulder Arts Cinema, taking the name of an old downtown theater \u2014 won't have the expenses of a private cinema, particularly rent, Farnan said.\n\nThe only other art house theaters in Boulder are the 60-seat Boedecker Theater at the Dairy Center for the Arts and the International Film Series at the University of Colorado, which shows movies in the Muenzinger Auditorium.\n\nLandmark Theatres closed its Crossroads Cinema on Pearl Street in 2007. The six-screen theater showed mainstream Hollywood movies as well, but on any given night, several screens were dedicated to independent fare.\n\nMaher said he doesn't see the new theater competing with the Boedecker theater because each has just one screen, while most art house theaters have several screens. In fact, the lack of space for a multi-plex has been a barrier to bringing a private art house theater to the downtown area, Maher said.\n\nBill Obermeier, executive director of the Dairy, could not be reached Friday afternoon.\n\nMaher said an art house cinema has been a goal of downtown Boulder boosters for a long time.\n\n\"We need some alternatives,\" he said. \"We have great live music venues. We have great restaurants. But we're limited in other entertainment options. It gives people another reason to come downtown, and once here, they'll patronize our restaurants and enjoy the mall.\"\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29148703/boulder-library-launch-art-house-cinema", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29148703:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-22T09:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The Boulder Public Library plans to turn the Canyon Theater on the north side of the Main Public Library into an art house movie theater three nights a week.", "title": "Boulder library to launch art house cinema in Canyon Theater", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29148703/boulder-library-launch-art-house-cinema", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1123/20151123_064337_F1024BOOK14.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1123/20151123_064337_F1024BOOK14_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-11-23T14:16:02-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-21T11:07:34-0700", "description": "The Boulder Public Library plans to turn the Canyon Theater on the north side of the Main Public Library into an art house movie theater three nights a week.", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-11-21T11:10:33-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-22T09:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder library to launch art house cinema in Canyon Theater", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29148703/boulder-library-launch-art-house-cinema", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Boulder Public Library plans to turn the Canyon Theater on the north side of the Main Public Library into an art house movie theater three nights a week.", "title": "Boulder library to launch art house cinema in Canyon Theater"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1123/20151123_064337_F1024BOOK14.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The Boulder Public Library plans to turn the Canyon Theater on the north side of the Main Public Library into an art house movie theater three nights a week.\nBoulder plans to use the theater as an art house cinema three nights a week beginning in early 2016.\n\"We've been trying for years to get an independent arts cinema downtown,\" said Sean Maher, executive director of Downtown Boulder.\nMaher said an art house cinema has been a goal of downtown Boulder boosters for a long time.\n( Camera file photo )Editor's note: This article has been changed to include the University of Colorado's International Film Series as one of the art house cinema options in Boulder."}
