While the opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, was narrowly tailored to only apply to the cases before the court, others warned of a slippery slope.\n\n\"Today it's birth control,\" said NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue in a statement. \"Tomorrow it could be any personal medical decision, from starting a family to getting life-saving vaccinations or blood transfusions.\"\n\nIndeed, even the justices bickered over the scope of the decision.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asks whether the ruling extends to employers \"with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions, antidepressants, medications derived from pigs including anesthesia, intravenous fluids and pills coated with gelatin, and vaccinations?\"\n\nIn the majority opinion, Alito responds to that critique. \"Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fail if it conflicts with an employer\u2019s religious belief.\" He adds, rather poignantly, that the administration provided \"no evidence to substantiate this prediction\" that overruling the birth control mandate could lead to similar challenges against blood transfusions or vaccines.\n\nSo is this a narrow ruling, as Alito hopes, or does it open the door to future successful challenges?\n\nWe spoke with a number of constitutional and insurance industry experts. The unsatisfying answer is a resounding: We don\u2019t know.\n\n\"Sometimes the question of who was right must await subsequent decisions,\" said Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. \"Justice Alito may want the precedent to be limited to the insuring of contraceptives, but it is not at all clear why it would not apply to other claims like those raised in Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent.\"\n\nWhile some future challenges are likely, the historical evidence suggests there will be relatively few. And they face an uphill battle getting a court to apply Alito\u2019s rationale to their complaint, experts said.\n\nLet\u2019s explain why.\n\nHistory\n\nIn her dissent, Ginsburg wondered if Jehovah's Witnesses, who oppose blood transfusions on religious grounds, might similarly challenge the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo far, \"no business has made such a claim about any other medical treatment,\" said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nWhile the court\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t close the door on those challenges, if history is any indication, there won\u2019t be many, said Robert Laszewski, president of the health consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, employers were free to drop blood transfusions or any other medical procedures from policies they provided (as long as the state didn\u2019t mandate coverage). In 40 years working in the employee benefit business, Laszewski said he has \"never heard of an employer who ever did anything like not cover vaccines or blood transfusions.\"\n\nInsurance companies, too, might be very hesitant to even allow a company to make those exemptions on a policy. Laszewski recalls in the 1990s, an employer wanted his health insurance to exclude AIDS coverage.\n\n\"We refused to do so,\" Laszewski said. \"And, after I called the employer personally and explained our position, the employer agreed to cover it.\"\n\nThe uniqueness of Hobby Lobby\n\nThe majority\u2019s case highlights the strong religious backgrounds of Hobby Lobby and the two other businesses that contested the birth control mandate.\n\nFor example, Alito notes that while Hobby Lobby is a for-profit corporation with more than 500 stores, it remains \"closely held\" by the Green family and their children, who have signed a pledge to run the business \"in accordance with the family\u2019s religious beliefs.\" They close on Sundays and support Christian ministries.\n\nThis is not common in businesses, especially among large companies of 50 or more employees that would fall under the health care law\u2019s employer mandate, our experts said. It\u2019s unusual to have corporate structures or mission statements committed to certain religious beliefs and an executive leadership that is unanimous in their faith.\n\nIn other words, \"This is the perfect plaintiff,\" said Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University. \"They really did run a religious company. It was an extension of the family\u2019s religious concerns and beliefs.\"\n\nClosely held corporations that challenge the law in the future may not be able to convince the court they, too, possess such clear religious convictions.\n\n\"It\u2019s not too hard to see how the decision can be read literally\" and only apply to Hobby Lobby, Bloch said. \"But people will try to read it broadly and courts will grapple with that.\"\n\nAlito\u2019s fix\n\nThe court relies on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to strike down the contraceptive mandate as it applies to this case.\n\nThis law, passed in 1993 under President Bill Clinton, says the government cannot burden a person\u2019s ability to exercise religion unless there\u2019s a compelling government interest and the burden is the \"least restrictive means\" for the government to accomplish its goal.\n\nAlito says it\u2019s pretty obvious this is not the least restrictive means for the government to get contraceptives to every woman without interfering with religious belief. Why? Because the Obama administration is already doing it.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services allows religious nonprofits to exempt themselves from the contraceptive requirement. In these cases, the insurance company still provides the employees with free birth control, but the employer does not pay for it.\n\nAlito asks why this workaround couldn\u2019t also be used by closely held private companies that object to the birth control mandate.\n\nThe fact that a workaround existed for birth control helped Hobby Lobby\u2019s case. But there probably won\u2019t be existing workarounds for other medical procedures.\n\n\"In future cases, if the government has not provided a similar exemption to other parties, it will be easier to convince the court there is good reason to deny the claimed exemption,\" said Kurt Lash, director of the Program on Constitutional Theory, History and Law at the University of Illinois.\n\nThe administration\u2019s fix for religious groups that don\u2019t want to cover birth control has one other very important element to it: It doesn\u2019t cost anything extra to insurance companies or employees to provide contraceptive coverage. Insurance companies, the administration said, actually save money by providing birth control versus paying for pregnancies. That may not be the case for other procedures.\n\n\"It\u2019s not clear to me that this would be so for blood transfusions and immunizations; and if it isn\u2019t so, then the proposed alternative means might be too difficult to implement,\" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA.\n\n\"Generally speaking,\" he added, \"the harder your religious objection is to accommodate, the easier it is for the government to persuade courts that the government doesn\u2019t need to accommodate it.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "First birth control, next blood transfusions?
