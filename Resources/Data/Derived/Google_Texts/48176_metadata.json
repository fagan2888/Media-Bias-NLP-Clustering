In reality, however, the letter was a kind of prank that state officials played on HHS, according to one official who signed onto the letter. The letter, in other words, was not actually a request for information. It was an attempt to \u201cspoof\u201d a similar request that HHS made of the states.\n\nThe letter came up during a panel sponsored by the insurance industry group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which concerned the Supreme Court\u2019s pending decision in King v. Burwell. The plaintiffs in King claim that the Affordable Care Act does not permit the federal government to provide tax credits that help millions of people pay for health insurance in states that elected not to set up their own health exchange. During the panel, however, the Center for American Progress\u2019s Neera Tanden stated that no state questioned the legality of these tax credits during an Internal Revenue Service rulemaking process which concluded that the tax credits are authorized by the law.\n\nThat claim by Tanden prompted Michael Carvin, the attorney for the plaintiffs in King, to cite the states\u2019 letter to HHS. That letter includes, among many other inquiries, a request that HHS identify the specific legal authority that permits it to \u201cadminister premium tax credits\u201d in the federally-run exchanges that HHS is required to set up in states that elect not to operate their own exchange. Thus, if the letter is read as an earnest request for information, it seems to suggest that the state officials who signed it had doubts about whether these tax credits are authorized by law.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: the letter wasn\u2019t an earnest request for information. According to Tim Jost, a health policy expert and law professor at Washington and Lee University, the letter was a \u201cjoke.\u201d The states, Jost explains, \u201cgot what they thought was an unreasonable demand from the feds and they sent back a letter that mirrored the request they got from the federal government.\u201d\n\nA state official who signed the letter, who spoke to ThinkProgress on condition of anonymity, confirmed Jost\u2019s understanding. The letter, which is seven pages long and consists almost entirely of a list of requests for information from the federal government, was written to mock a similar request that HHS sent the states in earnest. \u201cWe weren\u2019t spoofing a letter from the Feds exactly,\u201d the state official explains, \u201cbut we were very much spoofing their proposed documentation requirements of states that wanted to set up a state-based exchange by restating these in a form that would apply to the Feds.\u201d He adds that letter was drafted \u201cpurely to illustrate the inanity of the federal requirements \u2014 and their own inability to provide anywhere near close to the same information to the states.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress obtained a copy of the \u201cspoof\u201d letter described by this state official, as well as a document laying out many of the \u201cproposed documentation requirements\u201d that the federal government sought to impose on states. When the two documents are laid next to each other, it is immediately obvious that one document was written to emulate the language of the other.\n\nIn 2011, as states were deciding whether to set up their own exchange or to have the federal government operate an exchange for them, HHS produced a draft \u201cApplication for Approval of an American Health Benefit Exchange,\u201d which is formatted similarly to the states\u2019 letter and which uses much of the same language as the satirical letter from the states. Here, for example, is a section of HHS\u2019s draft application:\n\nAnd here is the section of the satirical letter from 2012 which Carvin claims is evidence that state officials questioned the legal basis of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits:\n\nNotice any similarities between the two?\n\nYou can read the entirety of HHS\u2019s draft application at this link, and you can read the entire satirical letter from the states at this link. The former is 14 pages long, and it does consist of an especially burdensome list of requests. It is not hard to see why state officials reacted to it with mocking indignation.\n\nBut a satirical letter from the states does not help Mr. Carvin\u2019s case any more than a \u201cnews\u201d report from The Onion does.\n\nIf anything, Carvin\u2019s attempt to bolster his case by unwittingly citing a practical joke is a microcosm for King v. Burwell as a whole. The central premise of Carvin\u2019s argument is that a few words of the law can be read out of context in a way that sabotages much of the rest of the law. Once those words are read in their proper context \u2014 a context that includes a passage defining the word \u201cExchange\u201d so that state-run and federally-run exchanges will be treated identically under the law \u2014 Carvin\u2019s entire argument falls apart.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "When reading laws and when trying to understand the origin of practical jokes, it is important to understand the full context before you open your mouth and make a joke of yourself.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "When reading laws and when trying to understand the origin of practical jokes, it is important to understand the full context before you open your mouth and make a joke of yourself.", "title": "Lawyer Attempting To Cripple Obamacare Cites Satirical Letter To Support His Supreme Court Case", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/03/16/3633684/oops-anti-obamacare-lawyer-cites-satirical-letter-evidence-supporting-supreme-court-case/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When reading laws and when trying to understand the origin of practical jokes, it is important to understand the full context before you open your mouth and make a joke of yourself.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin-321x214.jpg", "title": "Lawyer Attempting To Cripple Obamacare Cites Satirical Letter To Support His Supreme Court Case", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michael-Carvin.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-16T08:02:25+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Lawyer Attempting To Cripple Obamacare Cites Satirical Letter To Support His Supreme Court Case CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak This man cannot take a joke.\nThat claim by Tanden prompted Michael Carvin, the attorney for the plaintiffs in King, to cite the states\u2019 letter to HHS.\nBut a satirical letter from the states does not help Mr. Carvin\u2019s case any more than a \u201cnews\u201d report from The Onion does.\nIn reality, however, the letter was a kind of prank that state officials played on HHS, according to one official who signed onto the letter.\nThe letter, in other words, was not actually a request for information."}
