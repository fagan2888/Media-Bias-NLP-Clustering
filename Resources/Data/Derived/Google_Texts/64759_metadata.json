Gabbay, MD, PhD, FACP, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and editor-in-chief of Evidence-Based Diabetes Management, a publication of AJMC, will serve as meeting chair.\n\nDr. Reisman, who was formerly the chief medical officer at Aetna, recently authored a commentary, which was part of the AJMC 20th anniversary guest commentary series in, titled, \u201cClinical Efficacy: A Cost-Containment Weapon for the 21st Century.\u201d\n\nThe unique format of Patient-Centered Diabetes Care brings together providers, payers, and leaders from the world of policy, pharmaceutical manufacturing, academia, quality measurement, patient education, and advocacy. Over two days, healthcare leaders who might not typically cross paths are asked to share ideas on care delivery, reimbursement, and other \u201creal-world\u201d issues in diabetes care. The hope is that the conversations continue after the meeting ends.\n\n\u201cA meeting like Patient-Centered Diabetes Care has never been more important,\u201d said Brian Haug, president of AJMC Managed Markets Network. \u201cReimbursement will be more focused on alternate payment models in 2016, and those who fail to engage patients in their own care will suffer the consequences. Diabetes management is ground zero for the new reality. This meeting provides a critical forum to share strategies to help patients and providers navigate the new landscape.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 meeting will feature new sessions on obesity and the use of technology in health management, Haug said.\n\nAbout the Journals and AJMC.com\n\nThe American Journal of Managed Care celebrates its 20th year in 2015 as the leading peer-reviewed journal dedicated to issues in managed care.
