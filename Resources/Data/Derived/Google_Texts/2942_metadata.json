Business-people seem particularly prone to believe that they can bring solutions that no one has ever contemplated before, and now Carly Fiorina is showing that she has some truly innovative policy ideas, after hearing from a veteran having trouble navigating the VA health system:\n\n\u201cListen to that story,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cHow long has [VA] been a problem? Decades. How long have politicians been talking about it? Decades.\u201d Fiorina said she would gather 10 or 12 veterans in a room, including the gentleman from the third row, and ask what they want. Fiorina would then vet this plan via telephone poll, asking Americans to \u201cpress one for yes on your smartphone, two for no.\u201d \u201cYou know how to solve these problems,\u201d she said, \u201cso I\u2019m going to ask you.\u201d\n\nI guess it took someone with Fiorina\u2019s business savvy to come up with the idea to address complex policy challenges with a focus group followed by an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-style telephone vote. If only we had thought of that before.\n\nSeriously, this episode tells us a lot about the state of Republican populism these days.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously important to understand the experience veterans have with the system if you\u2019re going to determine where its biggest problems are. But the inane idea that that would be all you need to solve the problems of an enormous agency that spends billions of dollars and has thousands of employees is characteristic of a particular kind of conservative populism, one that seems to be expanding now that Donald Trump has taken control of the entire presidential race.\n\nBoth parties are drawn to populist appeals, but they come in different variants. The Democratic version tends to be both performative and substantive \u2014 they\u2019ll rail against the top one percent, but also offer policy ideas like upper-income tax increases and minimum wage hikes that are intended to serve the interests of regular people. Democratic populism says that the problem is largely about power: who has it, who doesn\u2019t, and on whose behalf it\u2019s wielded.\n\nRepublican populism, on the other hand, is aimed against \u201celites\u201d that are decidedly not economic. It\u2019s the egghead professors, the Hollywood liberals, the government bureaucrats whom they tell their voters to resent and despise. And part of that argument is that despite what those know-it-all experts would have you believe, all our problems have simple and easy solutions. All you need is \u201ccommon sense\u201d to know how we should reform our health care system, fix the VA, or control undocumented immigration. Understanding how government works isn\u2019t just unnecessary, it\u2019s actually a hindrance to getting things done.\n\nThere may be no candidate who has ever sung this tune with quite the verve Trump does, but he\u2019s following in a long tradition. Ronald Reagan used to say, \u201cthere are no easy answers, but there are simple answers\u201d \u2014 all it takes is the courage to embrace them. George W. Bush trusted his gut more than his head, and saw a world where there are only good guys and bad guys; once you know who\u2019s who, the path forward is clear and only a wuss would worry about the unintended consequences that might arise from things like invading foreign countries.\n\nIn its somewhat less extreme version, this belief in the simple truths that only regular folks can see is what drives the common belief that whatever\u2019s wrong in Washington can be solved by bringing in someone from outside Washington. So Ted Cruz proudly trumpets the fact that all of his colleagues in the Senate think he\u2019s a jerk. And Scott Walker criticizes his own party\u2019s congressional leaders, saying, \u201cWe were told if Republicans got the majority there\u2019d be a bill on the president\u2019s desk to repeal ObamaCare. It is August. Where is that bill? Where was that vote?\u201d\n\nWell, the answer is that there\u2019s this thing called a filibuster, which Democrats used to stop that bill from getting to the president\u2019s desk, where it would have been vetoed anyway (the real problem is that those leaders promised their constituents something they knew they could never deliver). But in this particular populist critique, the way institutions work is irrelevant, and a straight-talking, straight-shooting Washington outsider can come in and clean the whole place up wielding nothing more than the force of his will, some common sense, and good old fashioned American gumption.\n\nThe real mystery is why voters would fall for this kind of claptrap again and again. If the Obama years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that policy problems are \u2014 guess what \u2014 complicated. Understanding policy doesn\u2019t get you all the way to solutions \u2014 you need a set of values that guides you and creativity in imagining change, among other things \u2014 but you can\u2019t do without that understanding, at a minimum. Yet a significant chunk of voters continues to believe that everything is simple and easy, no matter how many times reality tells them otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just keep telling the voters that all problems have easy solutions.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Just keep telling the voters that all problems have easy solutions.", "title": "The simple-minded populism that controls the GOP", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/21/the-simple-minded-populism-that-controls-the-gop/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-10-29/AP/Kentucky_Senate_McConnell-02b0a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/08/21/the-simple-minded-populism-that-controls-the-gop/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "carly fiorina, populism, republican populism, 2016 gop presidential primary, 2016 presidential race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "carly fiorina, populism, republican populism, 2016 gop presidential primary, 2016 presidential race"}, "article_summary": "If the Obama years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that policy problems are \u2014 guess what \u2014 complicated.\nDemocratic populism says that the problem is largely about power: who has it, who doesn\u2019t, and on whose behalf it\u2019s wielded.\nSeriously, this episode tells us a lot about the state of Republican populism these days.\nRepublican populism, on the other hand, is aimed against \u201celites\u201d that are decidedly not economic.\nAnd part of that argument is that despite what those know-it-all experts would have you believe, all our problems have simple and easy solutions."}
