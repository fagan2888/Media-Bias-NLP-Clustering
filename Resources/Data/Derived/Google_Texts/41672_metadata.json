That figure, shared with a select group of deep-pocketed donors on Monday\u2014and quickly and not-so-quietly leaked to reporters\u2014is staggering. In the words of Politico\u2019s big-money reporter, Ken Vogel, it\u2019s \u201ca historic sum that in many ways would mark Charles and David Koch and their fellow conservative megadonors as more powerful than the official Republican Party.\u201d\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe numbers back that up: The fundraising target is more than twice the $407 million the Koch network spent on the 2012 election, and $232 million more than the Republican National Committee and the GOP\u2019s two congressional committees spent combined that cycle. It\u2019s also in line with the $1 billion that observers predict will be the magic fundraising number for each of the two parties\u2019 eventual presidential nominees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly when, where, and how the network plans to dole out the cash, but history suggests it\u2019s a safe bet that a big chunk of it will be reserved to fund attack ads targeting both the Democratic front-runner (Hi, Hillary!) and the specific policies\u2014EPA climate regulations, Obamacare, campaign disclosure laws\u2014that the Kochs and their friends hate with a passion.\n\nPerhaps the most-pressing question now is whether the group will look to spend some of that money in the GOP primaries\u2014something the network is said to be debating but appears unlikely to follow through on anytime soon. \u201cAt this point,\u201d the Washington Post reports, \u201csome contributors have said they have little interest in putting money into a bloody internal fight, and many others are not yet set on a candidate.\u201d\n\nThat lack of a consensus isn\u2019t a surprise. The network isn\u2019t quite as monolithic as it might first appear. It is believed to include several hundred donors, who presumably share a disdain for big government but don\u2019t necessarily agree on which candidate will be the best vehicle for that worldview. Even the brothers themselves appear to have slightly different tastes when it comes to picking favorites. GOP sources with ties to the network, for instance, told the New York Times last week that Sen. Rand Paul is considered \u201cideologically close\u201d with Charles, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u201chas long ties to David.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not a two-horse race\u2014something the guest list at the recent Koch summit makes clear. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz joined Paul at the retreat. Jeb Bush also reportedly received an invite, but took a pass, citing a scheduling conflict.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason for the Kochs to stay on the sidelines for now: They can win even without playing. The shock-and-awe campaign they launched Monday means that the brothers can\u2014and, to some degree, already have\u2014set the terms of the Republican debate without having to hand-pick their candidate. The fact that they hypothetically could go big in the primary will likely serve as a deterrent for deep-but-not-that-deep-pocketed donors who might otherwise have backed a candidate who doesn\u2019t make it on the brothers\u2019 short list. (Alternatively, the Koch machine could wait until the primary field narrows and then deliver a swift knockout blow to any candidate they don\u2019t like that\u2019s still standing after the first few contests.)", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "What the Kochs\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary", "sailthru.author": "Josh Voorhees", "description": "The dark-money political machine run by the Koch brothers hopes to spend $889 million in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential and congressional electio ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The dark-money political machine run by the Koch brothers hopes to spend $889 million in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential and congressional electio ...", "title": "What the Kochs\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans/131426372-americans-for-prosperity-foundation-chairman-and-koch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The dark-money political machine run by the Koch brothers hopes to spend $889 million in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential and congressional electio ...", "title": "What the Kochs\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans/131426372-americans-for-prosperity-foundation-chairman-and-koch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@JoshVoorhees", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-27T13:25:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "What the Kochs\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary", "sailthru.headline": "What the Kochs\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"What the Kochs\\u2019 $889 Million Promise Means for the GOP Primary\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans/131426372-americans-for-prosperity-foundation-chairman-and-koch.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"227150127004\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-27T13:25:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"briefing\",\n  \"author\": \"Josh Voorhees\",\n  \"tags\": [\"politics\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "What the #Koch Bros.' $889 Million Promise Means For the GOP Primary", "keywords": "Charles Koch, David Koch, GOP primary, Koch primary", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Charles Koch, David Koch, GOP primary, Koch primary", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshua.marc.voorhees"}, "sailthru.description": "The dark-money political machine run by the Koch brothers hopes to spend $889 million in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential and congressional electio ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2015/01/27/koch_brothers_2016_plans_charles_and_david_koch_s_dark_money_machine_plans/131426372-americans-for-prosperity-foundation-chairman-and-koch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc900\"", "article_summary": "Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe dark-money political machine run by the Koch brothers hopes to spend $889 million in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential and congressional elections.\nThat figure, shared with a select group of deep-pocketed donors on Monday\u2014and quickly and not-so-quietly leaked to reporters\u2014is staggering.\nChris Christie \u201chas long ties to David.\u201dIt\u2019s also not a two-horse race\u2014something the guest list at the recent Koch summit makes clear.\nand the specific policies\u2014EPA climate regulations, Obamacare, campaign disclosure laws\u2014that the Kochs and their friends hate with a passion.\nThere\u2019s another reason for the Kochs to stay on the sidelines for now: They can win even without playing."}
