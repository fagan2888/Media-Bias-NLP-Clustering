In Minnesota, where ticks are among several factors that have cut the population by more than half in less than a decade, there will be no moose hunting season at all.\n\nThousands of ticks are sometimes found on a single moose, and the parasites can bleed the animals and cause anemia and death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really that they bleed them dry,\u201d said Lee Kantar, Maine\u2019s moose biologist. \u201cIf you have 10,000 ticks on you, that surface area makes it so you are removing more blood from that particular animal.\u201d\n\nThe largest wild animal in the northeast, moose can tip the scales at more than 1,000 pounds and are prized for their meat as well as their enormous antlers. Maine\u2019s moose season kicks off Monday but the state is coming off a peak year for winter ticks, which have helped reduce the moose herd from 76,000 in 2012 to between 65,000 and 70,000, state officials said.\n\nMaine reduced its number of moose permits from 4,110 in 2013 to 3,095 this year for a season in which more than 50,000 people \u2014 a typical number \u2014 applied for a permit. New Hampshire officials issued 124 permits \u2014 less than half the 275 awarded in recent years \u2014 for the state\u2019s October season in the face of a decline in moose population from 7,600 in 1996 to about 4,400 now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "author": "Patrick Whittle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "title": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/moose_populations_down_as_winter_ticks_cull_herd/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/moose-hunt.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/moose-hunt.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Moose populations down as winter ticks cull herd", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c5f\"", "article_summary": "Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont are all issuing fewer moose hunting permits this year, citing the impact of winter ticks on their moose populations.\nMaine\u2019s moose season kicks off Monday but the state is coming off a peak year for winter ticks, which have helped reduce the moose herd from 76,000 in 2012 to between 65,000 and 70,000, state officials said.\nIn Minnesota, where ticks are among several factors that have cut the population by more than half in less than a decade, there will be no moose hunting season at all.\nThousands of ticks are sometimes found on a single moose, and the parasites can bleed the animals and cause anemia and death.\nMaine reduced its number of moose permits from 4,110 in 2013 to 3,095 this year for a season in which more than 50,000 people \u2014 a typical number \u2014 applied for a permit."}
