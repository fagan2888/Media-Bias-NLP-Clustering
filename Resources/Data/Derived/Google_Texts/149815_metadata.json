There are a record 40 bowl games this year.\n\nOne year from now, Tommy McQueeney plans to settle into a seat at Johnson Hagood Stadium and watch his dream come true \u2014 a traditional college football bowl game played in Charleston.\n\nSun Belt The Sun Belt is a likely target for Medal of Honor Bowl affiliation. The Sun Belt\u2019s current bowl game tie-ins: Bowl Site Payout (per team) Cure Bowl Orlando $1.35 million GoDaddy Bowl Mobile $750,000 New Orleans Bowl New Orleans $500,000 Camellia Bowl Montgomery $100,000 Sun Belt members TeamRecord Arkansas State9-3 Appalachian State10-2 Georgia Southern8-4 Georgia State6-6 South Alabama5-7 Troy 4-8 New Mexico State3-9 Idaho4-8 Louisiana Lafayette4-8 Texas State3-9 Louisiana Monroe2-11\n\n\u201cWe are moving full steam ahead,\u201d said McQueeney, chairman of the Medal of Honor Bowl, the former all-star game that plans to debut as a bowl game on Dec. 18, 2016.\n\nLosing bids With 40 bowl games this year, three bowls have had to take losing teams to fill out the schedule: Bowl Matchup Date TV Site Cure Georgia State (6-6) vs. San Jose State (5-7) Dec. 19 CBS Sports Network Orlando Foster Farms Nebraska (5-7) vs. UCLA (8-4) Dec. 26 ESPN Santa Clara, Calif. Quick Lane Central Michigan (7-5) vs. Minnesota (5-7) Dec. 28 ESPN2 Detroit\n\nBut the bowl-game landscape has shifted even since the Medal of Honor Bowl announced its new format in August. With a record 40 bowl games on the slate this year \u2014 matching up 80 of the 127 FBS teams \u2014 there are not enough teams with winning records (or even .500 marks) to go around.\n\nThree bowl games will have to field teams with losing records \u2014 Nebraska, Minnesota and San Jose State, all at 5-7\u2014 and the new Arizona Bowl was forced to take two teams from the same conference. Colorado State and Nevada, both from the Mountain West Conference, will play each other in the Dec. 29 bowl in Tucson.\n\n\u201cClearly, the system is broken,\u201d said Mountain West commissioner Craig Thompson.\n\n\u2018Deep dive\u2019\n\nEnough of college football\u2019s movers and shakers agree with Thompson\u2019s assessment that an NCAA task force will study the bowl system this off-season. This season, 63 percent of FBS teams will earn bowl bids, up from less than 50 percent 10 years ago. As recently as 1995, there were just 18 bowl games.\n\n\u201cThe members are going to have to figure out, what\u2019s the purpose of bowl games,\u201d NCAA president Mark Emmert said at a recent forum. \u201cIs it a reward for a successful season, or is it just another game that we\u2019re going to provide an opportunity for?\u201d\n\nBig 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby will lead the NCAA task force.\n\n\u201cI think the fact is we do have too many bowl games and we have more bowl games waiting in the wings,\u201d Bowlsby told reporters. \u201cBut you can\u2019t fault the communities from going ahead and doing something if they want to. We\u2019re going to have to do a deep dive on it and figure it out.\u201d\n\nPossible solutions include raising minimum payouts for bowl games, or not playing some games if there are not enough bowl-eligible teams in that particular season. The smallest payout this year is from the Camellia Bowl in Montgomery, Ala., at $100,000 per team.\n\nMcQueeney, a Charleston businessman and Citadel graduate, has been working to bring a bowl game to Charleston for more than 10 years, and knows it\u2019s a difficult time to break into the bowl business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern,\u201d he said of the current climate. \u201cAnd I think maybe it is time they do look at how they are spreading this thing out. But I am confident we will have a game in Charleston, despite the landscape.\u201d\n\nSurplus or shortage?\n\nThe NCAA has largely taken a hands-off approach to the bowl business, leaving it up to communities, conferences and TV networks \u2014 mostly ESPN \u2014 to start and run the games.\n\nESPN owns 11 bowl games, including the second-year Camellia Bowl. Two new bowl games were approved for this year \u2014 the Cure Bowl in Orlando, set for Saturday, and the Dec. 29 Arizona Bowl in Tucson. A bowl game in Austin, Texas, is set to debut in 2016. If the Medal of Honor Bowl also is approved, there could be at least 42 bowl games next year.\n\nMcQueeney points out that last season, there were not enough bowl berths to satisfy all the bowl-eligible teams. Temple, for example, was 6-6 last year, but was left without a bowl bid. Georgia Southern (9-3) and Appalachian State (7-5) were not eligible for bowl games last year as they made the transition from the FCS to the FBS Sun Belt Conference, even though their records were good enough.\n\n\u201cLast year, there was a surplus of bowl teams, and this year there is a shortage,\u201d McQueeney said. \u201cBut there is such an upsurge in teams leaving the FCS to join FBS conferences, I think this situation may be temporary. Conferences are building up, like with Coastal Carolina joining the Sun Belt.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Belt, which currently includes 11 football teams, is a likely target for the Medal of Honor Bowl. It currently has affiliations with four bowls \u2014 the New Orleans Bowl; the GoDaddy Bowl in Mobile, Ala.; the Camellia Bowl; and the Cure Bowl. A record-tying four Sun Belt teams \u2014 Georgia Southern, Arkansas State, Appalachian State and Georgia State \u2014 will go to bowl games this year.\n\n\u2018Phenomenal interest\u2019\n\nMcQueeney said he has had discussions with seven conferences, and said the goal is to land a Power 5 conference \u2014 the ACC, SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 or Pac 12 \u2014 along with another FBS league.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that all this is going on now with the bowl games,\u201d said McQueeney, who expects to sign contracts with conferences in January or February. \u201cBecause the interest in Charleston has been phenomenal.\u201d\n\nAfter the Medal of Honor Bowl secures conference affiliations, the next step is to land a television contract. ESPN or its affiliates (ABC, ESPN2) broadcast almost all of the bowl games; the Dec. 26 Sun Bowl is on CBS, Saturday\u2019s Auto Nation Cure Bowl is on CBS Sports Network, and the Dec. 29 Arizona Bowl is on the American Sports Network.\n\n\u201cThe better your affiliations, the better the TV contract,\u201d McQueeney said.\n\nWhen conference affiliations and a TV contract are in hand, the Medal of Honor Bowl will makes its case for NCAA certification in March. McQueeney remains confident that the Medal of Honor Bowl will find its place in the bowl system, whatever that looks like in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think with what we have to offer in Charleston, with the committee we have in place and the success of the all-star game we\u2019ve had here, we are a very attractive situation for conferences to look at,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Medal of Honor Bowl seeks place in \u2018broken\u2019 system, Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, College football,Medal of Honor Bowl", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "One year from now, Tommy McQueeney plans to settle into a seat at Johnson Hagood Stadium and watch his dream come true \u2014 a traditional college football bowl game played in Charleston.", "title": "Medal of Honor Bowl seeks place in \u2018broken\u2019 system", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151219/151219340/medal-of-honor-bowl-seeks-place-in-x2018-broken-x2019-system", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151219/PC20/151219340/AR/0/AR-151219340.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151219/PC20/151219340/AR/0/AR-151219340.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One year from now, Tommy McQueeney plans to settle into a seat at Johnson Hagood Stadium and watch his dream come true \u2014 a traditional college football bowl game played in Charleston.", "title": "Medal of Honor Bowl seeks place in \u2018broken\u2019 system", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151219/PC20/151219340/AR/0/AR-151219340.jpg?201512190812", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151219340}}, "keywords": "Medal of Honor Bowl seeks place in \u2018broken\u2019 system , Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, College football,Medal of Honor Bowl", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T08:12:00Z", "author": "Jeff Hartsell"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "One year from now, Tommy McQueeney plans to settle into a seat at Johnson Hagood Stadium and watch his dream come true \u2014 a traditional college football bowl game played in Charleston."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think the fact is we do have too many bowl games and we have more bowl games waiting in the wings,\u201d Bowlsby told reporters.\nMcQueeney remains confident that the Medal of Honor Bowl will find its place in the bowl system, whatever that looks like in 2016.\nIf the Medal of Honor Bowl also is approved, there could be at least 42 bowl games next year.\nSun Belt The Sun Belt is a likely target for Medal of Honor Bowl affiliation.\nA record-tying four Sun Belt teams \u2014 Georgia Southern, Arkansas State, Appalachian State and Georgia State \u2014 will go to bowl games this year."}
