But he wasn\u2019t looking only for more money. He wanted to play for a winner too.\n\nThe Broncos signed the 335-pound lineman early in free agency because they figured he would help protect quarterback Peyton Manning and open lanes for their running backs. Denver gave Vasquez a four-year contract worth $23.5 million.\n\nHe responded with an all-pro season and helped the Broncos (15-3) advance to their first Super Bowl in 15 years.\n\nVasquez, with his Mexican-American heritage, was a big hit with Spanish-speaking reporters who attended Super Bowl media day.\n\nQ: Why did you choose the Broncos?\n\nA: I just was looking for where the team was headed, what kind of chemistry we\u2019d have throughout the team, and overall where the location was. It was a no-brainer for me. Going from San Diego to Colorado, it\u2019s a big difference, but (it\u2019s) two different beauties, I\u2019d say. You have the mountains and the landscape in Colorado, and the beaches in San Diego. For me it\u2019s just a different beauty, and I\u2019ve been loving it ever since.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your relationship like with center Manny Ramirez? You seem tight.\n\nA: We call each other brothers. We played with each other two years at Texas Tech. Once I got here, he was one of the first teammates I called. I was like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re teammates again.\u201d We kind of picked back up where we left off in college, and he made my transition that much easier from San Diego to Denver.\n\nQ: You\u2019re in the Super Bowl now. That must be kind of surreal.\n\nA: It is. Just waking up every morning and telling myself, \u201cHey, we\u2019re here.\u201d We haven\u2019t accomplished what we want to accomplish just yet, but just to know that this is Super Bowl week, and we\u2019re actually playing in it, has been one of the most surreal things that I\u2019ve had to deal with.\n\nQ: Your Mexican-American heritage seems very important to you. Is that accurate?\n\nA: It\u2019s everything for me and Manny as well. To have everybody like you watching this Sunday, it\u2019s an amazing feeling.\n\nQ: What does it mean to be representing the Latino community in the Super Bowl?\n\nA: I actually spoke with Manny about it. It can be overwhelming, but we\u2019re taking it for what it is, and it\u2019s awesome to know that we have such a large group, especially the youth out there watching us. Hopefully it opens their eyes to say anything is possible, no matter what it is.\n\nQ: How are you dealing with this week? Keeping your focus on the big game?\n\nA: Just trying to keep my emotions in check. There\u2019s a lot going on, this being Super Bowl week and all. Being in the biggest city in America already, and the Super Bowl being here, there\u2019s so much going on. Just to mentally keep yourself focused on the goal you have at hand. That\u2019s probably my biggest challenge right now, just keeping everything in order, everything small-focused, and preparing for the ultimate game.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nAbout Vasquez\n\n2001-04: Considered one of the best offensive linemen in Texas while attending Corsicana High School.\n\n2005-2008: Vasquez was a four-year letterman at Texas Tech, where he started 34-of-39 career games and received all-Big 12 Conference recognition after his final three seasons.\n\n2009: Selected by the Chargers in the third round (78th overall) of the NFL draft.
