1. Obama administration manages Healthcare.gov expectations

The Obama administration will consider the new federal insurance marketplace a success if 80 percent of users can buy health-care plans online, according to officials. The measure is the first concrete performance standard in the three and a half years since the government began to design the health exchange. It is now guiding the work of government employees and contractors racing to repair the faulty website by the Nov. 30 deadline. Administration officials acknowledge that until recently, they had no concrete definition for how well Healthcare.gov should work, but they say one would not have made sense before the site went live Oct. 1.

4. Woodward says ObamaCare rollout isn't Obama's Watergate

President Obama's mishandling of the Affordable Care Act rollout has been incompetent, Bob Woodward said on Fox News Sunday, but it doesn't rise to past president-dooming scandals. "What this is, it's a mess, clearly, but what it isn't, and I think you have to look at the question of motive. And the president's motive here, even though there were deep problems with the implementation, he wants to do something good for 30 million people and get them health insurance," Woodward said. "So this isn't Watergate, this isn't Clinton and Monica Lewinsky." Woodward did say the ACA rollout is a harbinger of bad things to come for Obama's White House. [Politico]
