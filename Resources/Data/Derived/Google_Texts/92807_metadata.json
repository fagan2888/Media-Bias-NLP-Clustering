Many of these folks are my friends, and have been supporters, and we interact all the time.\u201d\n\nConsider the facts about how exceptionally integrated Google has become with the U.S. government on most all of the commercial matters critical to Google\u2019s business success.\n\nMegan Smith has served as U.S. chief technology officer and assistant to the president since September. Smith served as a senior Google executive from 2003-2014.\n\nAlexander Macgillvray has served as deputy U.S. chief technology officer for intellectual property & privacy since September. Macgillvray served as Google\u2019s deputy general counsel for intellectual property from 2003-2009.\n\nMikey Dickerson has served as deputy U.S. chief information officer and administrator of the U.S. digital service since August. Dickerson served as a Google Senior Engineer from 2006-2013.\n\nMichelle Lee has served as the head of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office since November of 2012. Lee served as Google\u2019s deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy from 2003-2012.\n\nRenata Hesse has served as deputy assistant attorney general for criminal and civil operations of the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice since May of 2012. Hesse served as an outside counsel to Google during the DOJ\u2019s opposition to the proposed Google-Yahoo ad agreement.\n\nDavid Gelfand has served as deputy assistant attorney general for litigation of the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice since August of 2012. In that capacity Gelfand also has served as the DOJ\u2019s antitrust litigation liaison to the European Commission\u2019s Directorate of Competition. Gelfand represented Google in the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s 2010 antitrust review of the Google-Admob transaction.\n\nJoshua Wright has served as one of five U.S. Federal Trade Commission Commissioners since January of 2013. Wright did antitrust-related academic consulting work for Google and formally recused himself from all Google matters before the FTC until January of this year.\n\nSeven former employees and consultants to Google, all conveniently and simultaneously positioned perfectly as potential \u201cGoogle guardians,\u201d and eyes and ears in every single major federal policy or law enforcement area of interest to Google.\n\nThis creates at least an appearance of a conflict of interest problem that Google enjoys partial and extraordinary special treatment within the United States government at the highest level.\n\nThis exceptionally tight U.S. government-Google relationship is highly relevant to the European Commission\u2019s current antitrust investigation of Google, and to the EC\u2019s plans to update its data protection, copyright and tax laws as part of the creation of a European Digital Single Market.\n\nThat\u2019s because Google\u2019s competition, privacy, copyright and tax policy positions are antithetical to the EC\u2019s.\n\nGiven that the U.S. government has apparently embraced Google as America\u2019s de facto national champion worthy of economic protection in the U.S. and abroad, the U.S. sadly has lost any potential moral, political, or rhetorical high ground here, because it has adopted a hypocritical \u201cdo as we say, not as we do\u201d stance when it comes to protectionism.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s apparent mountain-view, seven-sided, Google glass house makes it particularly perilous for the U.S. to throw \u201cprotectionist\u201d stones at the EC\u2019s sovereign decision making.\n\n[ This first posted in the Daily Caller]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/03/how-america-protects-national-champion-google-in-the-eu/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/google3.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "How America Protects National Champion Google In The EU"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf616\"", "article_summary": "Lee served as Google\u2019s deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy from 2003-2012.\nMacgillvray served as Google\u2019s deputy general counsel for intellectual property from 2003-2009.\n\u201cIn defense of Google and Facebook, sometimes the European response here is more commercially driven than anything else,\u201d Obama told Re/Code.\nWright did antitrust-related academic consulting work for Google and formally recused himself from all Google matters before the FTC until January of this year.\nMikey Dickerson has served as deputy U.S. chief information officer and administrator of the U.S. digital service since August."}
