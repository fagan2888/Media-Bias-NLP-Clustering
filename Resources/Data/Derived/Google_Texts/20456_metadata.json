Bill Posey voted against the $1.1 trillion spending bill that cleared Congress on Friday because he viewed it as a combination of excessive debt and bad policy.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the massive, catch-all measure came up just days before the government was facing a shutdown.\n\n\u201cWith our national debt about to reach $19 trillion, it\u2019s past time for Washington to get serious about fixing our broken budget process,\u201d said Posey, R-Rockledge. \u201cDespite the steady funding levels for our space program, the omnibus bill continues the irresponsible trend of rushing to pass another \u2018too big to read\u2019 spending bill at the eleventh hour. This must change.\u201d\n\nPosey liked that the bill gives NASA $19.3 billion, or about $1.3 billion more than the administration requested. But he was irked it didn\u2019t include GOP provisions approved earlier this year to block full federal funding for Planned Parenthood and to block President Obama\u2019s plan to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees in the U.S.\n\nPassage of the fiscal 2016 spending bill and package of tax breaks avoided a year-end showdown over the budget.\n\nThe House passed the spending bill 316-113, with 150 Republicans in favor and 95 opposed. On Thursday, the House passed the tax package, which includes a provision making permanent the state sales tax deduction for Florida and other states that have no income tax.\n\nThe Senate approved both the spending and tax breaks as one bill on Friday, 65-33.\n\nFlorida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson voted for the bill, noting that it included money for home-state priorities including NASA and combating a disease affecting citrus trees.\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio didn\u2019t like the bill, but he was on the presidential campaign trail and was one of only two senators to miss the vote.\n\nFlorida GOP Rep. Rooney, who sits on the Appropriations Committee that helped write the bill, said it includes plenty of victories for conservatives, including partial defunding of Planned Parenthood. He also was happy with the tax breaks that were paired with the spending measure when the legislation was sent to the Senate.\n\nScrapping the bill, Rooney said, would have reopened negotiations with the White House and congressional Democrats, who might have tried to wrest more concessions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to negotiate with (House Democratic leader Nancy) Pelosi to keep the government funded because we didn\u2019t have enough people on our own side that were happy with the Republican work product,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio misses vote on spending bill\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio would have voted against the catch-all spending bill Congress passed Friday \u2013 had he been here.\n\n\u201cWashington's leadership has created another massive spending bill in secret and rammed it through Congress, hoping that the American people don't notice or have become numb to this kind of business as usual,\u201d Rubio said in a statement released by his office. \u201cThis is what a broken Washington looks like under President Obama and what Congress reverts to without conservative presidential leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Republican was on the campaign trail in Iowa Friday and decided not to return to Washington to vote on the spending bill and a package of tax breaks, both of which passed the House and Senate by solid majorities.\n\nAs the only Republican to skip the vote, Rubio\u2019s absence was notable. All four other senators running for the White House showed up: Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nRubio has said his time is usually better spent on the campaign trail, but he\u2019s willing to return for roll call votes where his choice would be meaningful to the outcome.\n\nPaul lampooned Rubio\u2019s absence, tweeting a photo of Rubio on a milk carton with the phrase, \u201cHave you seen me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have any information, please contact the American taxpayers,\u201d Paul\u2019s tweet said. \u201cThey would like to know why Marco Rubio refuses to show up to oppose reckless spending in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe vote on the Senate bill, which included $1.1 trillion in spending with $622 billion in tax breaks, included a Rubio-authored provision that prevents the government from compensating insurance companies that incur large losses on health exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNelson wants relief for Puerto Rico\n\nSen. Bill Nelson had hoped a provision allowing Puerto Rico the right to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy would be included in the catch-all spending and tax bill Congress approved Friday.\n\nIt was not, leaving the issue to be litigated in next year\u2019s session.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Congress is going to go home without having done the bare minimum for Puerto Rico,\u201d the Florida Democrat said on the Senate floor Thursday. \u201cHow in the world can we fail our fellow Americans like this?\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico owes about $70 billion to bondholders, and opponents of allowing the U.S. territory to declare bankruptcy are concerned those bondholders will lose money.\n\nEarlier this year, Nelson and several other senators introduced a bill giving Puerto Rico the right to declare bankruptcy, a right that, Nelson noted, all 50 states enjoy.\n\nHe also joined three fellow senators in introducing legislation to improve the treatment of Puerto Rico under Medicare and Medicaid. And earlier this month, he filed a bill to help the island\u2019s low-income seniors afford the cost of their prescription drugs.\n\nNelson, who met with government officials in Puerto Rico\u2019s capital of San Juan last month, said the problem already is spilling into Florida. Thousands of Puerto Ricans are moving to the Sunshine State to escape an uncertain economy back home.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Puerto Rico is going to start the New Year on the verge of default, as the governor faces the troubling choice of \u2026 paying for essential public services \u2026 or that he makes a billion-dollar debt payment to Wall Street creditors.\u201d Nelson said. \u201cPublic services \u2014 health, fire, police, water, et cetera \u2014 versus paying the bonds that are coming due.\u201d\n\nBipartisan Bob Graham\n\nOver the past two decades, no senator from Florida can claim the mantle of bipartisanship more than Bob Graham.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a just-released analysis by the Lugar Center, led by former Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.\n\nGraham, a Democrat and popular ex-governor, ranked 35th out of the 227 senators who have served since 1993.\n\nThe Bipartisan Index is designed to measure how much senators work across party lines. It gauges how often members co-sponsor bills introduced by the opposite party, and how often their own bills attract co-sponsors from the other party.\n\nLugar, a Republican know for reaching across the aisle, said the index used bill sponsorships and co-sponsorships for two reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst, they allowed us to construct a highly objective measure of partisan and bipartisan behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, sponsorship and co-sponsorship behavior is especially revealing of partisan tendencies.\n\n\u201cMembers\u2019 voting decisions are often contextual and can be influenced by parliamentary circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cSponsorships and co-sponsorships, in contrast, exist as very carefully considered declarations of where a legislator stands on an issue.\u201d\n\nHere are the rankings for the other five senators who represent Florida now or did at one time: Republican George LeMieux (67th), Republican Connie Mack III (82nd), Democrat Bill Nelson (83rd), Republican Mel Martinez (84th), and Republican Marco Rubio (170th).\n\nContact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com; Twitter: @ledgeking\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1YsKgB8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Rubio on campaign trail and misses vote", "og": {"site_name": "Florida Today", "description": "Rubio on campaign trail and misses vote", "title": "Posey votes against spending bill despite NASA hike", "url": "http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/12/19/posey-votes-spending-bill-despite-nasa-hike/77638174/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/floridatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio on campaign trail and misses vote", "creator": "@Florida_Today", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6dae1800e3b002f1358516e448b845b708861559/c=0-63-250-313&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/19/Brevard/B9320185892Z.1_20151219162738_000_G0KCTNBCE.1-0.jpg", "title": "Posey votes against spending bill despite NASA hike", "site": "@Florida_Today", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=811359748", "fb": {"app_id": 133451750049911}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "politics,marco rubio,ledyard king,bill posey,spending bill,NASA"}, "article_summary": "Bill Posey (Photo: File)WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep.
