The first-term Republican is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nWhen asked what word he would associate with Hillary Clinton, the presumed 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, Rubio replied, \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nIn addition to acknowledging his rocky history with immigration reform, Rubio stressed his opposition to \u201ca national school board imposing a national curriculum on our country,\u201d otherwise known as the Common Core, which fellow Floridian and likely 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush supports.\n\nThe senator drew heavy applause when he criticized President Obama\u2019s foreign policy and touted American exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d said Rubio, \u201cwhen was the last time you heard about a boatful of American refugees landing on the shores of another country?\u201d\n\nHe slammed the White House for embracing a foreign policy that \u201ctreats the ayatollah in Iran with more respect than the prime minister of Israel.\u201d And he called for a stronger challenge to the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to defeat (ISIS) militarily, we could do it.\u201d\n\nObama does not have a military strategy in place, said Rubio, \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t want to upset Iran. In his mind, this (nuclear) deal with Iran is going to be the Obamacare of his second term,\u201d and sending military forces to the Middle East would upset Iran\u2019s sense of authority in the region.\n\nAs a religiously Sunni group, said Rubio, ISIS needs \u201cto be defeated on the ground by a Sunni military force with air support from the United States. \u2026 Put together a coalition of armed forces from regional governments to confront them on the ground with U.S. operations support, and then provide them logistical support, intelligence support, and the most devastating air support possible and you will wipe ISIS out.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Rubio said, we need \u201can American foreign policy that tells the world very clearly it is bad to be our enemy and good to be our friend.\u201d\n\nRed-meat speeches, references to the Islamic State, and calls for a strong foreign policy have been popular at this year\u2019s CPAC.\n\nCarly Fiorina received the first standing applause, reports National Journal, when she thundered that Netanyahu \u201ctravels here next week not to offend our president, but to warn the American people that our president\u2019s insistence on a deal with Iran at all costs is a danger to the world.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal spent his entire speech lambasting Obama for avoiding calling ISIS a group of Islamic terror. And even Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker noted that his battle with unions in his home state prepared him to tackle ISIS.\n\nRubio continued the theme, possibly in the hope that his rookie-of-the-year energy and Senate credentials can earn him a shot at the White House.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Marco Rubio knocked what he called the \u201cObama-Clinton foreign policy\u201d in a well-received, forward-looking appearance at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning.", "title": "Marco Rubio: Hillary is 'Yesterday' - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 566, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/02/GOP-2016-CPAC-Rubio_Deat-566x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/02/27/marco-rubio-hillary-yesterday/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "sunni", "published_time": "2015-02-27T12:43:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T12:43:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc968\"", "article_summary": "Marco Rubio knocked what he called the \u201cObama-Clinton foreign policy\u201d in a well-received, forward-looking appearance at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning.\nThe senator drew heavy applause when he criticized President Obama\u2019s foreign policy and touted American exceptionalism.\nAs a religiously Sunni group, said Rubio, ISIS needs \u201cto be defeated on the ground by a Sunni military force with air support from the United States.\nRubio continued the theme, possibly in the hope that his rookie-of-the-year energy and Senate credentials can earn him a shot at the White House.\nThe Florida senator, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, is trailing other GOP contenders and has tried to distance himself in the governor-heavy field by stressing his experience with foreign policy."}
