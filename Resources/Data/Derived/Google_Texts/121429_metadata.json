Some homes have been accused of tolerating drug use and participating in insurance fraud.\n\n\u201cThe ones that are good are fantastic,\u201d said Pam Rodriguez, CEO of Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities, an Illinois nonprofit working to reduce prison time for nonviolent drug offenders. But the rapidly expanding field also includes \u201cpeople exploiting the vulnerability of the population and their desperation to find a safe place to live,\u201d she said.\n\nSober homes are based on an idea that has been around since at least the 1970s, when many communities had halfway houses \u2014 group homes reserved for the most desperate alcoholics with nowhere else to turn. These new houses cater increasingly to people who have become addicted to opiates. In recent years, the epidemic has touched more families who can afford to pay for care.\n\nThe facilities range from former single-family houses in residential neighborhoods to apartment complexes. The residents include people recently released from prison or residential treatment and others who see a counselor regularly or get no treatment. They must observe rules and curfews and participate in 12-step meetings.\n\nThe homes are often run by former drug users who have remained clean after rehabilitation, rather than by doctors or therapists. Residents typically pay rent ranging from $75 to $150 per week.\n\nThere is no nationwide estimate on the number of sober homes, but experts say the growth is apparent.\n\nFor instance, Prescott, Arizona, a city of 40,000, has 169 homes. That\u2019s one home for every 237 people, with more on the way.\n\n\u201cWe have houses opening up two or three a week here,\u201d said Mary Beth Hrin, a Prescott resident who supports a bill to allow cities to regulate the homes.\n\nOne large network of homes, Oxford House, now has almost 2,000 houses in about 500 cities, up 20 percent in the last three years.\n\nFamilies are seeking guidance in choosing a home and pressing for accountability for the money they spend there.\n\nSome of the laws under consideration would require sober homes to be inspected and certified and subject to ethical codes and consumer protections.\n\nAfter a scam involving inflated insurance claims for sober home residents, the Florida Legislature last year adopted a law effectively requiring certification of homes that receive patients from licensed rehab centers. Florida has an estimated 1,200 homes housing 12,000 to 13,000 people.\n\nMassachusetts recently set up a voluntary certification process, and bills are pending before lawmakers in Maryland and Arizona. Some proposals would require owners to undergo background checks, to refund money in some circumstances and to make inspection reports available to consumers. In New Jersey, a new law requires sober homes to notify a family member when a resident is evicted, unless the resident chooses to keep the matter private.\n\nFor now, most homes have little to no governmental oversight.\n\n\u201cIn most states, there is not a regulatory body because recovery residences aren\u2019t considered treatment,\u201d said Amy Mericle, a scientist at Alcohol Research Group, a California nonprofit that studies alcohol and drug addiction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Addiction epidemic fuels runaway demand for \u2018sober homes\u2019", "author": "Carla K.
