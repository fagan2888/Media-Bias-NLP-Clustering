The Illinois Autism Task Force has appointed DiCianni insurance lead to help clear up red tape and make it easier for families to cope medically and financially with a child\u2019s autism diagnosis as ACA goes into effect in 2014.\n\n\n\nMany states adopted autism insurance reform after Illinois passed landmark legislation back in 2008. DiCianni, the law\u2019s champion and author, fought for the rights of more than 10,000 Illinois children suffering from the disorder. Currently 33 states follow Brianna\u2019s Law, named after DiCianni\u2019s daughter, who is now a high-functioning 10-year-old thanks to early diagnosis and intensive therapy intervention made more affordable and accessible through insurance reform.\n\nBut until a national mandate is passed, many self-insured families or those with out-of-state plans go uncovered because they are exempt from state law. It is still unknown if the new exchanges being implemented under the Affordable Care Act will have to comply with state law or if they only have to abide by the federal law, which would exempt the vital autism coverage. A federal fix would also cover the 17 remaining states that have not adopted Brianna\u2019s Law.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to this challenge, as we have nearly a third of about 20,000 children in Illinois without important insurance tools thanks to gaps in insurance coverage,\" DiCianni said in a prepared statement. \"My goal is to bring this matter to key federal officials, such as Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk, then build a bi-partisan coalition as I did in Illinois to include Brianna\u2019s Law in the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nWhen he was the former mayor of Elmhurst, DiCianni authored two additional autism-related laws that passed with bipartisan support. James\u2019 Law, a 911 legislation, passed in 2011, and the Autism Insurance Protection Act of 2012, which grandfathered in children who would otherwise lose their diagnosis based on changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).\n\nAutism is the country\u2019s No. 1 diagnosed medical condition for children. According to the Centers for Disease Control, one in every 50 children is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A decade ago, that number was 1 in 150.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am proud to be the champion for children and families, and for being the voice for those who often do not have one,\u201d DiCianni said. \u201cEvery child should have access to the tools to deal with autism, which can be extremely debilitating if gone untreated. We know too much, and shame on us if we do not address these issues head on.\u201d\n\nSource: DuPage County Board member Pete DiCianni\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Elmhurst, IL Patch", "description": "\"I am looking forward to this challenge.\"\u2014Pete DiCianni, DuPage County Board Dist. 2", "title": "DiCianni Asked to Help Align Autism Law With Affordable Care Act", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/37725/2013/11/T800x600/6059559e31ac974795da1d8f99d5fd68.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/illinois/elmhurst/former-elmhurst-mayor-charged-with-aligning-autism-law-with-affordable-care-act", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2013-11-27T00:42:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T10:55:58-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Elmhurst, IL - \"I am looking forward to this challenge.\"\u2014Pete DiCianni, DuPage County Board Dist. 2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee0d\"", "article_summary": "Many states adopted autism insurance reform after Illinois passed landmark legislation back in 2008.\nDiCianni, the law\u2019s champion and author, fought for the rights of more than 10,000 Illinois children suffering from the disorder.\nThe Illinois Autism Task Force has appointed DiCianni insurance lead to help clear up red tape and make it easier for families to cope medically and financially with a child\u2019s autism diagnosis as ACA goes into effect in 2014.\nIt is still unknown if the new exchanges being implemented under the Affordable Care Act will have to comply with state law or if they only have to abide by the federal law, which would exempt the vital autism coverage.\nOf the 20,000 pages in the Affordable Care Act, key provisions addressing autism have been overlooked and omitted, according to a press release from DuPage County Board Commissioner Pete DiCianni of Elmhurst."}
