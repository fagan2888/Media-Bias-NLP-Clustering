Photography by Collin Richie)\n\nBaton Rouge is leading the way in addressing community health needs by taking a simple box-checking activity to satisfy IRS requirements and creating unprecedented collaboration among the city\u2019s hospitals, businesses and community organizations.\n\nTo retain tax-exempt status under the Affordable Care Act, every hospital must develop a Community Health Needs Assessment every three years and implement a strategy for addressing the community\u2019s most pressing health priorities.\n\nBut instead of each hospital creating its own needs assessment, four of the city\u2019s not-for-profit hospitals\u2014Baton Rouge General Medical Center, Lane Regional Medical Center, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center and Woman\u2019s Hospital\u2014worked jointly to identify those health needs, write the assessment and develop an implementation strategy for addressing the issues.\n\nIn addition to the four hospitals, representatives from Ochsner Health System-Baton Rouge, Surgical Specialty Center of Baton Rouge, LSU, Pennington Biomedical Research Center and the city\u2019s Healthy BR initiative also helped develop and write the assessment.\n\nFor their first CHNA in 2012, the hospitals participated in a collaborative assessment, one of two types of CHNAs that can be done for multiple institutions. Although minimizing costs initially played a role in the collaboration, the hospitals quickly realized the benefits for the community overall from approaching the CHNA in unison. The result was one collective assessment for all the hospitals that identified the parish\u2019s most urgent health needs. Each hospital then developed its own plan for implementing the goals identified and published its needs assessment separately.\n\n\u201cEach hospital took the goals we\u2019d collectively developed and then tailored it for their own needs,\u201d says Coletta Barrett, vice president of mission for OLOL. \u201cThat approach laid the foundation for what we did in 2015.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when it came time to update the needs assessment last year, the hospitals took their efforts further, becoming the first community in the United States to do a joint Community Needs Health Assessment\u2014the other type of CHNA available for multiple institutions\u2014as well as a joint implementation plan.\n\nCITY HALL SUPPORTED\n\nThe joint process was initiated and facilitated by Healthy BR, also known as the Mayor\u2019s Healthy City Initiative, which comprises more than 70 health care organizations, city and state agencies, for-profit businesses, educational institutions, faith-based organizations and nonprofit agencies. Mayor Kip Holden established Healthy BR in 2008 to harness the efforts the groups were doing to improve health citywide.\n\nWorking through Healthy BR, the hospitals jointly published one document that identifies the community\u2019s top health priorities, covers the role each hospital will play in addressing the needs and detailing the tasks each will do to implement the strategies outlined the assessment. The result is a plan that maps out a communitywide, holistic approach to tackling the city\u2019s greatest health issues.\n\n\u201cA joint needs assessment and implementation plan allows us to address specific needs on a communitywide basis,\u201d says Donna Bodin, vice president of employee and wellness services at Woman\u2019s Hospital, who worked on the 2015 assessment.\n\nAs a result, the collaboration extended well beyond the four hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to make an impact on the community\u2019s significant needs, it\u2019s not just going to involve our hospitals\u2014it\u2019s going to take involvement from community organizations and businesses as well,\u201d says Andy Allen, outreach coordinator for the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of doing the Community Health Needs Assessment through the Healthy City Initiative\u2014when we get to the implementation plan, there are pieces specific to health care and pieces specific to the community.\u201d\n\nThe CHNA includes 10 top health priorities for East Baton Rouge Parish. From this list, four significant needs were chosen: HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases; mental health and substance abuse; obesity; and overuse of emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cIf we improve [the] overall health of [our] community, then we are addressing these health issues before they become chronic,\u201d Bodin says.\n\nTo determine the top 10 priorities, including the four significant needs, the CHNA workgroup reviewed data from a variety of sources, including government agencies and nonprofit organizations. The statistics included social determinants of health, such as household income, education level, and race and ethnicity, as well as the Community Needs Index, which identifies the severity of health disparities for every ZIP code in the United States. Parish health rankings measuring how long people live and their quality of life and input from community organizations also were used. The data were supplemented with what the hospitals observed at their own facilities.\n\n\u201cEach of us can see a pattern in our hospitals,\u201d Bodin says. \u201cAs a group we could identify a trend.\u201d\n\nFROM PAPER TO PRACTICE\n\nTurning this research into a readily understandable document was not a simple task. \u201cThe biggest challenge was turning a data-driven document into something the community can read and relate to, while trying to provide an educational message,\u201d Bodin says.\n\nThe four significant needs remained the same in the 2015 CHNA as were identified in the 2012 document. \u201cThese are big-ticket items,\u201d Allen says. \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress, but we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve gotten to the point where we can take them off or where we can say we\u2019ve done enough.\u201d\n\nWhile 10 health priorities were identified, many of them have a national or statewide support system or a strong organization with a track record of success in addressing the issue. The four priorities designated as having the greatest need in Baton Rouge don\u2019t have that level of support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single volunteer-based, national organization leading efforts on obesity. You\u2019ve got 50,000 people doing 40,000 things, but overall we were not seeing the progress,\u201d Barrett says.\n\nInstead of being an insular document prepared in-house, the joint CHNA is a community plan. As such, Barrett says, every local resident can identify with some aspect of the needs assessment. \u201cOur community members can see their needs in these strategies,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone can have a role in this.\u201d\n\nFor example, through the Eat Healthy BR initiative, partners\u2014including restaurant owners and chefs\u2014commit to offering healthy meal items for all customers. Among other things, they agree to include fruits and vegetables with all kid\u2019s meals, make water or low-fat milk the default beverage and train waitstaff to promote healthier options.\n\nFor their ground-breaking collaborative efforts and the impact it\u2019s expected to have on addressing health needs in the city, Healthy BR and the four hospitals received the NOVA award from the American Hospital Association in 2015. The award is given to no more than five recipients each year for \u201cimproving community health by looking beyond patients\u2019 physical ailments, rooting out the economic and social barriers to care and collaborating with other community stakeholders.\u201d\n\nBarrett, who worked on both the 2012 and 2015 assessments, says working under the umbrella of Healthy BR was critical to successfully addressing the parish\u2019s most urgent health priorities identified in the CHNA.\n\n\u201cThis was a hospital-led and hospital-driven endeavour,\u201d she says. \u201cBut hospitals can\u2019t do it on their own. There has to be a broader approach and a broader range of partners.\u201d\n\nBodin agrees. \u201cA collaborative effort reaches many more people,\u201d she says. For example, Bodin says, the number of individuals screened for HIV in Baton Rouge has increased by 28% since 2014. \u201cOne organization couldn\u2019t possibly reach all these people,\u201d she says. Further, Bodin notes, the value of produce sold at farmers markets, including mobile farmers markets, increased 8%, \u201cso we know that those programs are impacting child and adult obesity through community strategies from partner organizations outside the hospital.\u201d\n\nBoth Barrett and Bodin say having citywide support was essential to the joint process working, as well as to the potential for success.\n\n\u201cDoing the assessment under the Mayor\u2019s Healthy City Initiative shows the value added of collaboration,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cYou have to have that third party to lead it. You need that leadership to get people talking and working together and to look beyond their own four walls.\u201d\n\nAs a neutral third party to developing the needs assessment and implementation plan, \u201cthe mayor provided a common table, with no competitive aspect, where the hospitals could come,\u201d Allen says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to overstate how important it is to have all the hospitals on the same page. These are such gigantic issues. But, if we align all the organizations, we are able to start making community-level change in those. That in itself is a huge win communitywide.\u201d\n\nHIGH PRIORITY\n\nThe top 10 health priorities for East Baton Rouge Parish as identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment, listed in alphabetical order and beginning with the top four Healthy BR priority areas:\n\nHIV and other STDs\n\nMental health and substance abuse\n\nObesity\n\nOveruse of emergency rooms\n\nBarriers to health care\n\nCancer\n\nDiabetes\n\nHeart disease and stroke\n\nNegative lifestyle/behaviors\n\nVulnerable populations", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baton Rouge Business Report", "description": "(Employees and community members look over produce at a mobile farmers market at the Our Lady of the Lake Urgent Care Clinic at 5439 Airline Hwy.
