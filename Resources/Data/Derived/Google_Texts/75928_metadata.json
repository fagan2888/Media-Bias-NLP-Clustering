Among other things on the agenda, the Florida committee will consider a bill that would repeal \"stand your ground.\" But you shouldn\u2019t hold your breath waiting for the bill to pass. It\u2019s highly unlikely that HB 4003 will get through the committee, and if you want to know why, you need to get to know the fellow who will chair the committee hearings.\n\nMeet Matt Gaetz, who, depending on your point of view, is either one of the country\u2019s bravest or most appalling state legislators. Gaetz, a 31-year-old attorney from northwest Florida, has been in the Florida House of Representatives since 2010, and has quickly developed a reputation for pugnacity. He runs a lively Twitter feed, posting in a voice the Miami Herald recently described as \u201cpart commentary, part GOP and FSU fanboy, and part insult comic.\u201d The insults are generally directed toward former governor Charlie Crist and random poor people, as in this gem from October: \u201cYesterday I saw a lady at Publix use her \u2019Access\u2019 welfare card. Her back was covered in tattoos. RT if u support entitlement reform.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHis legislative record is just as blunt. As Michael Van Sickler recently wrote in a piece jointly published by the Herald and the Tampa Bay Times, Gaetz \u201chas sponsored (and passed) some of the most conservative legislation in a conservative-dominated Legislature. His bills have fined local governments $5 million if they impose any restrictions on guns, banned insurance policies created through Obamacare from offering abortion coverage, and expedited death row cases so executions could be moved up.\u201d Gaetz appeared especially proud of that last bill, which has helped put Florida on pace to execute seven convicts in 2013\u2014the second-highest yearly total in state history. \u201cOnly God can judge, but we sure can set up the meeting,\u201d Gaetz said at the time. If that\u2019s not on a bumper sticker yet, it should be.\n\nAs you may have guessed from the rest of his political positions, Gaetz is an avowed fan of \"stand your ground.\" In August, he informed the media that he opposed \u201cchanging one damn comma\u201d of the existing statutes. He went on to say that \u201cthe only voices on \u2018stand your ground\u2019 are coming from the radical left,\u201d and that he welcomed \u201can opportunity to give a full-throated defense of the law.\u201d\n\nWhile Gaetz insists that HB 4003 will get a fair hearing, putting this guy in charge of the \"stand your ground\" hearings is sort of like appointing Jenny McCarthy to chair a committee on childhood vaccinations. Indeed, Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford\u2019s decision to put Gaetz in charge here seems like a deliberate maneuver aimed at those presumptuous outsiders who would dare to tell Floridians how to run their state.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s \"Stand Your Ground\" Hearings", "sailthru.author": "Justin Peters", "description": "On Thursday afternoon, the Florida House Criminal Justice Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on the applications and consequences of the state\u2019s  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "On Thursday afternoon, the Florida House Criminal Justice Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on the applications and consequences of the state\u2019s  ...", "title": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s \"Stand Your Ground\" Hearings", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/11/07/matt_gaetz_meet_the_aggressive_ideologue_who_s_chairing_florida_s_stand.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/11/gaetz.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Thursday afternoon, the Florida House Criminal Justice Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on the applications and consequences of the state\u2019s  ...", "title": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Hearings", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/11/07/matt_gaetz_meet_the_aggressive_ideologue_who_s_chairing_florida_s_stand.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/11/gaetz.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@justintrevett", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-07T16:16:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s \"Stand Your Ground\" Hearings", "sailthru.headline": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s \"Stand Your Ground\" Hearings", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\\u2019s \\\"Stand Your Ground\\\" Hearings\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/11/07/matt_gaetz_meet_the_aggressive_ideologue_who_s_chairing_florida_s_stand.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/11/gaetz.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"230131107001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-07T16:16:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Justin Peters\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"crime\",\n    \"florida\",\n    \"stand your ground laws\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Meet the Uncompromising Ideologue Chairing Florida\u2019s \"Stand Your Ground\" Hearings", "keywords": "matt gaetz florida, matt gaetz stand your ground, will weatherford matt gaetz, stand your ground hearing, matt gaetz twitter, matt gaetz guns, stand your ground florida, hb 4022 stand your ground", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "matt gaetz florida, matt gaetz stand your ground, will weatherford matt gaetz, stand your ground hearing, matt gaetz twitter, matt gaetz guns, stand your ground florida, hb 4022 stand your ground", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "On Thursday afternoon, the Florida House Criminal Justice Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on the applications and consequences of the state\u2019s  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/11/gaetz.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf3d\"", "article_summary": "Among other things on the agenda, the Florida committee will consider a bill that would repeal \"stand your ground.\"\nAs you may have guessed from the rest of his political positions, Gaetz is an avowed fan of \"stand your ground.\"\nGaetz, a 31-year-old attorney from northwest Florida, has been in the Florida House of Representatives since 2010, and has quickly developed a reputation for pugnacity.\nMeet Matt Gaetz, who, depending on your point of view, is either one of the country\u2019s bravest or most appalling state legislators.\n\u201cOnly God can judge, but we sure can set up the meeting,\u201d Gaetz said at the time."}
