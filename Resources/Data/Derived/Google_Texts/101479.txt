It was a fluke injury.

Broncos cornerbacks were working through a routine ball drill Saturday when Kayvon Webster twisted his ankle. The drill usually calls for the defensive backs to work on footwork and turn as a coach tosses them the ball. Webster, who has been starting at right cornerback while Chris Harris continues to recover from knee surgery, caught it and was tiptoeing near the back of the end zone when his ankle gave way.

An MRI exam was negative and there is hope Webster will only miss two or three days of practice next week, when the Broncos match up against the Houston Texans.

In his place, Bradley Roby will start today against the San Francisco 49ers. Nothing against 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his receiver group of Anquan Boldin, Michael Crabtree, Stevie Johnson and Brandon Lloyd. But they can’t be any tougher than going up against Peyton Manning and Demaryius Thomas every day in practice.

With Aqib Talib starting at left corner, expect Omar Bolden to play some nickel back today.
