Brandy Barnes is a student at MCC. This Batavia resident isn't sure who she'll vote for.

Lynette Adams: "What would help make that decision for you?"

Barnes: "I'm looking for someone who really cares about developing jobs and presenting new career opportunities for younger college graduates who really have gotten their feet into the marketplace."

Then some people -- like Rochester resident Mark Sample -- came because they don't like what they've heard Cruz say.

"He has been saying how President Obama is wrong for using executive orders in certain situations," says Sample. "How Obamacare is really wrong and that if he becomes president on his first day he's going to sign an executive order to get rid of Obamacare. I don't know how you can say that 'Obama is wrong and they're unconstitutional in this situation' but you can do it in your own situation."

Cruz rally in Brighton didn't last all that long. The candidate was on and off stage in about 30 minutes.
