His word was gold. Incredibly generous, creative and intelligent, Phil cared about people, his family, and above all, Christ. Though our hearts are hurting, we know so many families around the world are affected just as much as us by this terrible tragedy. We ask for your prayers, not only for ourselves, but for all involved during this difficult time.\n\nAs a family, we are sticking together through Christ to get through this.
