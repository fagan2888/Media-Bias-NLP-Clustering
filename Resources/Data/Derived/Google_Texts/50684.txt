One male is in serious but stable condition and another is in custody after an early morning shooting in Denver’s Lower Downtown.

The shooting happened in the 1500 block of Market Street around 2 a.m., said Denver police spokesman Doug Schepman.

Officers who were in the area at the time heard a shot fired and came upon the scene, Schepman said.

A male, whose age is unknown at this time, got out his vehicle and approached a pick-up truck, Schepman said. The male shot inside the truck, that contained three males, and hit one of them.

The pick-up truck then took off until police stopped the vehicle and located the victim at 19th and Lawrence streets.

The suspect was taken into custody at the scene.

“We don’t know why the shooting occurred,” Schepman said. “We suspect it was some kind of altercation between the people in the vehicles.”
