Prior to that limit, employers typically allowed employees to contribute between $3,000 and $5,000 to their FSAs, said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants at Xerox in Secaucus, New Jersey.\n\nAnother provision specified that starting in 2014, the new limit would increase to match the rise in CPI at the close of a 12-month period ending on Aug. 31, with the increase rounded down to the nearest $50.\n\nIn the first 12-month period, ending in August 2013, the rise in CPI resulted in an indexed amount of $2,542, which, when rounded down to the nearest $50, resulted in no increase in the maximum FSA contribution limit in 2014.\n\nLast year, inflation rose just enough to boost the limit to $2,550 for 2015. With the CPI barely rising since August 2014, it would take a big hike in inflation this month \u2014 unlikely given falling energy prices, for example \u2014 to boost the CPI enough to trigger a rise in the maximum FSA contribution limit for 2016, Mr. Stover said.\n\nWhile FSAs are still a part of many employers' benefit programs, employee contribution and participation rates have been falling. According to benefit consultant Aon Hewitt, the average FSA contribution per participant fell to $1,342 in 2015, down from $1,405 in 2014, while 17% of employees working for employers offering FSAs made contributions in 2015, down from 20% the prior year.\n\nAon Hewitt says a likely reason for decreases are the increased popularity of consumer-driven health care plans linked to health savings accounts or health reimbursement arrangements.\n\nLast year, according to a Mercer L.L.C., survey, 23% of employees were enrolled in CDHPs, up from 18% in 2013, the biggest one-year increase since Mercer began to track CDHP enrollment about a decade ago.\n\nThe reasons for those increases are many. The maximum amount of salary employees can contribute to HSAs is much higher than for FSAs, while unused HSA contributions remaining at the end of a year can be rolled over for use in succeeding years. By contrast, unused FSAs must be forfeited by the March 15 of the following year. The IRS does allow \u2014 for employers who have adopted the provision \u2014 unused FSA contributions to be rolled over, but only up to $500.\n\nAnother factor that could further erode the prevalence of FSAs is a provision in the ACA that, starting in 2018, imposes a 40% excise tax on the portion of health care premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. The ACA counts FSA contributions towards that excise tax trigger, a key reason some employers will eliminate their FSAs, Mr. Stover said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "With inflation running low, the maximum contribution employees will be able to make to their flexible spending accounts in 2016 is expected to remain unchanged, according to the latest government statistics.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that through the 12-month period...", "title": "Maximum FSA contributions expected to stay the same for 2016 - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150819/NEWS03/150819825", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150819/NEWS03/150819825/AR/0/maximum-fsa-contribution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "With inflation running low, the maximum contribution employees will be able to make to their flexible spending accounts in 2016 is expected to remain unchanged, according to the latest government statistics.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that through the 12-month period...", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Maximum FSA contributions expected to stay the same for 2016 - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceabb\"", "article_summary": "With inflation running low, the maximum contribution employees will be able to make to their flexible spending accounts in 2016 is expected to remain unchanged, according to the latest government statistics.\n\u2022 UPDATE: MAX FSA CONTRIBUTION STAYS AT $2,550 for 2016\u2022 'Cadillac' tax complicates open enrollment\u2022 Benefits enrollment season opensThe maximum FSA contribution limit and how that limit can increase are mandated by provisions in the 2010 health care reform law.\nOne Affordable Care Act provision set a $2,500 annual limit on FSA contributions effective in 2013.\nThe ACA counts FSA contributions towards that excise tax trigger, a key reason some employers will eliminate their FSAs, Mr. Stover said.\nThe IRS does allow \u2014 for employers who have adopted the provision \u2014 unused FSA contributions to be rolled over, but only up to $500."}
