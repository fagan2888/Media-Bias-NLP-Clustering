The reality is that people with mental health conditions are still frequently locked up and isolated in institutions, WHO said; many patients are subjected to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as deprived of the right to make their own decisions. So for this year\u2019s World Mental Health Day, observed annually on Oct. 10, the organization is dedicated to raising awareness of what can be done to ensure mental health patients \"live with dignity.\"\n\nIt would be easy to blame it all on the health care system, if only because studies continue to show that mental health care is still not equal to physiological medical care \u2014 at least in the eyes of advocates. And while WHO does point out that the health care system can provide more community-based services and better respect people\u2019s autonomy, as well as ensure access to good quality care, there\u2019s work to be done within the actual community, too.\n\nOn the community level, WHO said people can better support those with mental health conditions, as well as encourage them to participate more and \"acknowledge the value of their contribution.\" Community members should also respect patients\u2019 autonomy, which allows them to make their own decisions as to where and how they live, in addition to ensuring they have access to employment, education, and housing.\n\nMental health around the world\n\nToday, nearly 1 in 10 people have a mental health disorder, among which there is a 10-25 year life expectancy reduction, WHO reported. When compared to the general population, the risk of premature death is even higher among patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. The latter disorder is a leading risk factor for suicide \u2014 a major public health concern in its own right, especially among certain populations.\n\nThe thing is there's more to it than recognizing mental health is worthy of equal care and respect; there needs to be greater access to those working in the field. According to WHO, only 1 percent of the global workforce is working in mental health, which means nearly half of the world\u2019s population lives in a country where there is less than one psychiatrist per 100,000 people; In India, there are a reported 3 psychiatrists (fewer psychologists) for every 1 million people living with mental disorders. Then there are countries like China where mental illness affects millions of people, but this population remains \u201ckind of invisible.\u201d\n\nWhat's more is that half of WHO member states have a stand alone mental health law, and two-thirds have a stand-alone policy or plan. These policies are often \"not fully in live with international human rights covenants and implementation is weak,\" WHO recently shared on its Twitter account. Its these inequalities that are largely preventing dignified and respectful care.\n\n'You have to treat them as individuals'\n\nIndia is actively fighting against its poor mental health care facilities: In 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Guharat and the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy at the Indian Law Society (supported by WHO) implemented the Quality Rights Project (QRP). The QRP reportedly \"goes beyond conventional treatment,\" in that it advises \"service users and caregivers on how to access social grants and giving career guidance.\"\n\nAdditionally, through the project, Indian citizens have access to facilities and peer support groups, like Saathi. In fact, the latter peer group is what finally brought Mohammad Yusuf Mansuri and his family \"hope\" for his daughter who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, Shamma.\n\n\u201cI have felt a lot of discrimination in life, but Saathi is a space where people are sharing their difficult experiences,\u201dMansuri said.. \u201cThere has been a shift in the way I think. I find myself taking more time for my daughter and talking about her life, feelings and needs.\u201d\n\nNot only do access and choice benefit the family, but those with the disorders themselves \"start to feel better about themselves.\" Granted, India isn't the only country that recognizes mental health problems and challenges \u2014 it's simply a recent example of how projects of this magnitude are starting to benefit patients and their families.\n\nThat said, challenges remain \u2014 both in India, and everywhere else.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part of this project is changing the attitudes of health workers and the community towards people with mental illness,\u201d psychiatrist Dr. Soumitra Pathae, the project coordinator of the QRP and coordinator of the Indian Law Society\u2019s Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy, said in a statement. \u201cTo provide holistic care, you must see the person and not just their illness. You have to treat them as individuals with hopes and dreams.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, mental, health, day, 2015, who, wants, ensure, people, mental, disorders, are, treated", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization dedicates this year's World Mental Health Day to dignity, and what health care systems and communities across the world can do to offer mental health patients dignified care.", "title": "WHO Wants To Restore Human Dignity In Mental Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-mental-health-day-2015-who-wants-ensure-people-mental-disorders-are-treated-356718", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/10/mental-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization dedicates this year's World Mental Health Day to dignity, and what health care systems and communities across the world can do to offer mental health patients dignified care.", "title": "WHO Wants To Restore Human Dignity In Mental Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-mental-health-day-2015-who-wants-ensure-people-mental-disorders-are-treated-356718", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/10/mental-health.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/10/mental-health.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-10T13:49:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-10T13:57:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization dedicates this year's World Mental Health Day to dignity, and what health care systems and communities across the world can do to offer mental health patients dignified care."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc3a\"", "article_summary": "Mental health around the worldToday, nearly 1 in 10 people have a mental health disorder, among which there is a 10-25 year life expectancy reduction, WHO reported.\nSo for this year\u2019s World Mental Health Day, observed annually on Oct. 10, the organization is dedicated to raising awareness of what can be done to ensure mental health patients \"live with dignity.\"\nIt would be easy to blame it all on the health care system, if only because studies continue to show that mental health care is still not equal to physiological medical care \u2014 at least in the eyes of advocates.\nOn the community level, WHO said people can better support those with mental health conditions, as well as encourage them to participate more and \"acknowledge the value of their contribution.\"\nThe thing is there's more to it than recognizing mental health is worthy of equal care and respect; there needs to be greater access to those working in the field."}
