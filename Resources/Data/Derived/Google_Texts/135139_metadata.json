They also disagree on the role of the office.\n\nOlens, whose legal career focused on businesses before his election as Cobb County Commission chairman, has made his contributions to economic development a cornerstone of his campaign to a second term. Among the accomplishments he lists are fights against environmentalists over the deepening of the Savannah River shipping channel, against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, against neighboring states over water, and against the Affordable Care Act in which he won a Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of Medicaid expansion. He\u2019s also proud of legislation he pushed against gambling, prescription-drug abuse and sex trafficking.\n\nHe\u2019s won the endorsement of gun-owner-rights groups and the majority of district attorneys of both parties.\n\nHecht has the backing of organized labor, and he announced Friday that 37 sheriffs had switched allegiance from Olens to him.\n\nHecht, a onetime legislator and former assistant prosecutor, has attacked Olens on several fronts. First, he said the attorney general shouldn\u2019t have offered a court defense of the state\u2019s law banning same-sex marriage. He notes that 25 courts in other parts of the country have ruled similar laws unconstitutional.\n\nSecond, Hecht accuses Olens of not being aggressive enough about prosecuting child abuse and neglect, noting the number of children who died within five years of their families\u2019 contact with state social workers.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be doing is fundamentally protecting citizens in need, such as the 400 children who passed away between 2011 and 2013 when that man was wasting time on unconstitutional laws,\u201d Hecht said of Olens during a debate organized by the Atlanta Press Club.\n\nOlens responded that none of the courts with jurisdiction over Georgia have ruled on the issue, requiring him to continue backing the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to state my personal opinion on same-sex (marriage),\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually contrary when you are the attorney general to do so because, once again, my primary job is not to replace the courts but to defend Georgia law.\u201d\n\nHecht also attacks the incumbent\u2019s integrity because a county judge has ruled the state should have turned over to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys a memo written by the then-head of the state ethics commission. Her predecessor was suing the commission \u2014 eventually winning \u2014 alleging the staff of Republican Gov. Nathan Deal interfered in an investigation, and the memo alleged similar interference.\n\nThe judge sanctioned Olens\u2019 office $10,000 for withholding a relevant document.\n\n\u201cHow can you actually tell officials that you can actually check and balance on corruption?\u201d Hecht asked.\n\nOlens contends an appeal will show the memo wasn\u2019t required to be turned over, and he said the problems within the ethics commission are not his doing.\n\n\u201cOnce again, we don\u2019t operate the agency; we represent the agency,\u201d Olens said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to defend Georgia\u2019s ethics law, because I, too, believe they need to be much stronger.\u201d\n\nIf he is elected, Hecht would most likely be up against a majority GOP legislature with most state posts held by Republicans. He has signaled he would use the attorney general\u2019s office to root out wrongdoing by the rest of state government.\n\nOlens, on the other hand, has shown that he\u2019ll fight for Republican goals, like thwarting Obamacare. That put him in sync with most Georgia voters four years ago, and it may again, depending on who shows up to vote Nov. 4.\n\nFollow Walter Jones on Twitter @MorrisNews and Facebook or contact him at walter.jones@morris.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Election, Local News, Walter C.
