A 21-year-old Topeka man who drowned earlier this month at a state wildlife area was a loving son and a soon-to-be, first-time father, according to his mother.

Anthony Bernard Strange Jr., a 2011 Highland Park High School graduate, on Aug. 2 traveled to Pillsbury Crossing with his girlfriend and her family, said Strange’s mother, Tessa Strange. Pillsbury Crossing is located in Riley County, about seven miles east of Manhattan.

Strange was trying to swim across a creek there when he started to have trouble. Witnesses tried unsuccessfully to find Strange after he went under near a sharp bend in the creek, according to previous articles. Authorities were dispatched to the area about 7:30 p.m. Strange’s body was recovered about an hour later.

Strange was “always a happy kid,” Tessa Strange said. He grew up in Topeka with two older sisters and one older brother. Strange loved to play football and worked at Alorica. He was looking forward to returning to Washburn, Tessa Strange said.

Anthony Strange’s fiancee, Mercedes Miles, will give birth to the couple’s child — a baby girl — in September.

Tessa Strange and her husband, Anthony Strange Sr., had traveled to St. Louis, Mo., by way of train for Tessa’s birthday. They were notified while in St. Louis that their son was in an accident. They returned home by plane only to find out he was dead. Anthony Strange Jr. died two days before Tessa’s birthday.

“I miss his hugs and kisses,” Tessa Strange said. “It’s not the same.”

His family members and friends are getting by “day by day,” Tessa Strange said.

“Yesterday, I didn’t want to get up out of bed,” she said. “It’s hard.”

The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism said in a statement it doesn’t appear alcohol was a factor in Strange’s death.

Strange was buried Aug. 8. A memorial fund — called the Anthony Strange Memorial Fund — has been established at Envista Credit Union. The money will be used to help Strange’s unborn child, Tessa Strange said.
