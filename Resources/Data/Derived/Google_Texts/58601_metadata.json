Burwell ruling, an emboldened President Obama reminded people that the Affordable Care Act is \u201cnow helping tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Not only that, he said he\u2019s heard that the health law has \u201cchanged their lives for the better.\u201d\n\nA new National Public Radio/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that only 15 percent say they\u2019ve personally benefitted, however. While 56 percent of Americans said the law hasn\u2019t directly affected them, among those who have been affected by it, more people said it has done greater harm than good.\n\nVia The Hill:\n\nTwenty-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been personally harmed by the healthcare law since its passage \u2014 a fraction that likely reflects those in the poll who said they have noticed rising healthcare costs in the last several years. And while the majority of adults said they believed their healthcare costs were \u201creasonable,\u201d many said those costs were becoming less affordable over time. [\u2026] Twenty-six percent of Americans say the cost of healthcare has been a serious strain on their finances in the last two years. About 40 percent of those facing financial struggles because of their medical bills said they have spent all or most of their savings accounts on large bills. About one in five people said they\u2019ve been forced to forgo prescriptions because they can\u2019t afford them.\n\nThe national poll included 1,002 responses and has a margin of error of 3.8.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not good. .05/27/2016 7:58:26AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Poll: Among Those Affected By Obamacare, More Americans Say They've Been Hurt Than Helped", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/02/29/poll-more-americans-say-theyve-been-hurt-by-obamacare-than-helped-n2126692", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/94/aac6f15b-5c30-4cb6-928f-04d31fb9c68c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Poll: Among Those Affected By Obamacare, More Americans Say They've Been Hurt Than Helped", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/02/29/poll-more-americans-say-theyve-been-hurt-by-obamacare-than-helped-n2126692", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/94/aac6f15b-5c30-4cb6-928f-04d31fb9c68c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Among Those Affected By Obamacare, More Americans Say They've Been Hurt Than Helped , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The national poll included 1,002 responses and has a margin of error of 3.8.\n[\u2026] Twenty-six percent of Americans say the cost of healthcare has been a serious strain on their finances in the last two years.\nAnd while the majority of adults said they believed their healthcare costs were \u201creasonable,\u201d many said those costs were becoming less affordable over time.\nWhile 56 percent of Americans said the law hasn\u2019t directly affected them, among those who have been affected by it, more people said it has done greater harm than good.\nAbout one in five people said they\u2019ve been forced to forgo prescriptions because they can\u2019t afford them."}
