Ted Cruz is getting close to announcing his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. The Texan is spending almost as much time in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does on Fox News; he has hired a staff and collected a long list of fiercely conservative supporters.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one hitch: Ted Cruz was born in Calgary, in the Canadian province of Alberta. His mother was a U.S. citizen, born in Delaware; his father was a Cuban refugee working in Canada\u2019s oil fields. Thanks to his mother, Cruz was a U.S. citizen at birth.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t clear up a legal muddle that\u2019s as old as the Constitution: Is a U.S. citizen born abroad qualified to serve as president?\n\nI don\u2019t agree with Cruz on most issues. He wants to repeal Obamacare, abolish the Internal Revenue Service and pass a constitutional amendment allowing states to outlaw gay marriage, just to take the top of his list. But I still hope he runs \u2014 because it\u2019s high time we established the right of Canadian-born Americans to serve as president.\n\nCanadian Americans are perhaps our most underappreciated minority. Their contributions to U.S. culture range from hockey to comedy to, well, hockey. It\u2019s an impressive list: Wayne Gretzky, William Shatner, Lorne Michaels, Jim Carrey, Pamela Anderson, Alex Trebek. And now Ted Cruz.\n\nAt this point I should confess a personal stake: My oldest daughter was born in Toronto. Like Ted Cruz, she inherited U.S. citizenship through one of her parents. But we assured her that she could grow up to be president of the United States. (Proud of her dual citizenship, she says she\u2019d like to serve as prime minister of Canada, too.)\n\nCanada is a wonderful country \u2014 wilderness on top, oil and gas underneath, plus universal healthcare and sensible gun control laws. All those good things, alas, are not an argument for a Cruz presidency. He has promised not to import any Canadian virtues to the U.S. homeland (except, perhaps, more Alberta oil) if he is elected to the White House.\n\n\u201cCanadians are so polite, mild-mannered, modest, unassuming, open-minded,\u201d Cruz joked last year. \u201cThank God my family fled that oppressive influence before it could change me.\u201d\n\nCruz hasn\u2019t simply renounced Canadian moderation; last year, he formally renounced the Canadian half of his dual citizenship.\n\nBut even that doesn\u2019t settle the constitutional issue \u2014 at least not to the satisfaction of some of the \u201cbirthers\u201d who charged that President Obama was born outside the United States. \u201cClearly there is an issue of eligibility,\u201d chief birther Orly Taitz told U.S. News a while ago. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same issue as Obama.\u201d\n\nExcept that in Cruz\u2019s case, he really was born in a foreign country.\n\nSurprisingly, some legal scholars agree \u2014 not that Cruz is unqualified, but that the question isn\u2019t a slam-dunk. The Constitution says only a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d can serve as president, but it isn\u2019t clear whether the Founding Fathers intended that to include U.S. citizens born abroad.\n\n\u201cThe consensus (among constitutional lawyers) is that it means citizens at birth,\u201d said Gabriel Chin, a professor at UC-Davis. \u201cBut people are not 100 percent confident.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my view, it does merit a test,\u201d agreed Sarah Helene Duggin, a professor at the Catholic University of America. Indeed, she argued, if Cruz were to win the Republican nomination, it would be in the nation\u2019s interest to get the question settled early.\n\n\u201cIf we ever get to the point where we have a presidential candidate with this issue, we will need a clarification,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the candidate were elected and then disqualified, that would be a serious constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) faced a similar issue in 2008 but argued that his birthplace, the Panama Canal Zone, was U.S. territory at the time he was born; the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan resolution endorsing his eligibility.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy to get a once-and-for-all decision. Somebody has to get the question into the courts through a lawsuit. But as the birthers discovered in 2008, most judges don\u2019t think voters have legal standing to sue over a candidate\u2019s qualifications. (To have standing, a plaintiff has to show that he or she is suffering concrete injury from a defendant\u2019s conduct.)\n\nOne of Cruz\u2019s competitors in the race could sue, but that might not play well as a campaign issue. That leaves the matter in Cruz\u2019s hands. As an \u201coriginalist\u201d who believes in the literal meaning of the Constitution, he ought to be the first to want that murky phrase in Article II cleared up.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution matters \u2014 all of the Constitution,\u201d Cruz said in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s not pick and choose. It\u2019s not take what part you like and get rid of the parts you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nIf Cruz runs, he should ask a friendly state official to challenge his candidacy. Most legal scholars think he\u2019d win, or at least not lose. (The courts might leave it to the voters to decide.) Win or lose, he would have the satisfaction of making constitutional history. Besides, my daughter wants to know if she can start thinking about 2024.\n\nReach Los Angeles Times columnist Doyle McManus at doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The foreign-born Texas senator isn\u2019t, technically, eligible to run for president, the columnist says.", "og": {"description": "The foreign-born Texas senator isn\u2019t, technically, eligible to run for president, the columnist says.", "title": "Doyle McManus: Ted Cruz could birth another birther controversy", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150226-doyle-mcmanus-ted-cruz-could-birth-another-birther-controversy.ece", "image": {"width": 997, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150226-cruz_0819nat_32638724.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CRUZ_0819NAT_32638724.JPG", "height": 827}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-27T22:33:41Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-02-26T19:03:24Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Doyle McManus: Ted Cruz could birth another birther controversy\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150226-doyle-mcmanus-ted-cruz-could-birth-another-birther-controversy.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150226-cruz_0819nat_32638724.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CRUZ_0819NAT_32638724.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2196661\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-26T19:03:24Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"DOYLE MCMANUS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20150226-cruz_0819nat_32638724.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/CRUZ_0819NAT_32638724.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-02-26T19:03:24Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40d5\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
