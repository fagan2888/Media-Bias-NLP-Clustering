Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s comments about Megyn Kelly “bleeding,” conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, who will be asking questions of the GOP hopefuls during the next debate in September, said Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be president.

When asked if Donald Trump has the temperament to be president, Hewitt said, “No. no, he doesn’t. The disappointing part of this debate was it was a 9/10 debate in a 9/11 world. We have the Iran deal coming up, the most consequential deal facing probably the next 30 to 40 years in the world. It got very little attention. The Russian cyber attack on the Pentagon got very little attention … Donald stepped on a lot of important stories. The New York Times has a story on Hillary Clinton’s server. Only Scott Walker brought up Hillary Clinton’s server. So I thought to build the audience, it was enormous, at the same time I wanted a different issue set talked about so the Republican primary voter lost.”

He added, “The loser was the GOP.”
