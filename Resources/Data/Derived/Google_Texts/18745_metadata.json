(Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson attended services Sunday at Corinthian Baptist Church to meet with parishioners and discuss the religious climate in the country.\n\nCarson, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, spoke to the congregation about how his own faith influenced his career as a doctor.\n\n\u201cSuccess is taking talent God has given you to elevate other people,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAddressing Rev. Jonathan Whitfield\u2019s questioning of Carson\u2019s venture into politics, he said, \u201cLord opened those doors and pushed me that way.\u201d\n\nCarson has been visiting several churches in Iowa in the lead-up to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses and has been candid about his faith with the audiences.\n\nHe spoke about growing up poor in Detroit and his lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.\n\nReferencing the current $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot, Carson said he was already lucky. He said, \u201cI already won the lottery because I was born in the United States of America and I know Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nWorshipers at Corinthian Baptist responded enthusiastically to Carson\u2019s presence and a story about a surgery he performed in South Africa while he was a pediatric neurosurgeon for Johns Hopkins Children's Center.\n\n\"I am interested not in his politics, but his policy for life,\" said Whitfield. \"He didn't find perfection. He found success.\"\n\nHis success, Carson said, is thanks to a hard-working mother who \"refused to be a victim\" and his fellowship of Jesus Christ. Carson opened and ended his speeches with prayer that was met enthusiastically by the crowd.\n\nAmong the worshipers was a crowd of newcomers to Corinthian Baptist, eager to hear from the presidential hopeful.\n\nBryan Bray, student at the University of Oklahoma, drove to Iowa from Missouri after receiving an email regarding Carson\u2019s appearance. Familiar with Carson after watching the movie, \u201cGifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,\u201d in his anatomy class, Bray said he made the trip even though he knew he would vote for Carson the moment he announced his candidacy. He felt the atmosphere inside Corinthian Baptist felt \"very emotional and different.\"\n\n\u201cFor people my age, I think Donald Trump takes up a lot of public space,\u201d Bray said, referencing Trump\u2019s controversial remarks on social media. \u201cI feel like he distracts my generation from candidates like Ben Carson and his uplifting message.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Republican presidential candidate and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson answered questions in Pleasant Hill.
