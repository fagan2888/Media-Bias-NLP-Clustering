Roll out the red carpet for the year’s most glamorous gongs! Revealed here for the first time: the winners of the CEW Beauty Awards

Can over 700 women be wrong? Most definitely not, when it comes to judging the CEW Beauty Awards 2015. That was the number of attendees at a key night in the beauty-world calendar, when CEW – the beauty industry’s networking organisation – staged its product demonstration evening.

It was a chance for everyone from CEOs to beauty editors via bloggers to dip, dab, sample and listen as the experts and entrepreneurs explained the virtues of their entries. Attendees then took home a bulging goody bag – coordinated by beauty-box leader Latest in Beauty – to test and ponder their scores across 25 categories and over 300 product entries. Weeks later their votes were cast and then counted by a leading firm of accountants with a hush-hush secrecy that MI5 would be proud of.

Because who better to judge beauty classics and innovations than the industry’s own? Who is most qualified to decide which brands belong in the beauty hall of fame? Who’s got a more informed perspective on the beauty universe than its own movers and shakers? That’s why these awards are so influential – and here’s how those insiders voted in 2015.

OOH LA ECO

THE ECO BEAUTY AWARD SPONSORED BY GIVAUDAN

MELVITA APICOSMA UHT SOOTHING CREAM

Melvita’s commitment to sustainable beauty earned this French brand (a ‘sister’ to L’Occitane) a CEW Eco Beauty Award in 2013.

But it was the packaging innovation that impressed the judges: a clever pump which prevents air from getting into the multitasking ‘three-honey nectar balm’.

Beyond that, this certified-organic winner – which triumphed over a haircare range by O’Right that uses waste coffee grounds, and British-based Pai skincare – for the first time harnesses UHT technology (yes, just like milk).

The result? No need for preservatives. It happens to be hypoallergenic and suitable for sensitive skins, but its gentle-on-the-planet credentials swung it for Apicosma.

£30 for 40ml, uk.melvita.com.
