But observers believe that the presidential candidate\u2019s claim of Kenyan ancestral roots and his planned visit to Africa later in December are part of efforts to revive his floundering political fortunes believed to be due partly to public perceptions that he is inexperienced in foreign policy issues and international relations.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon claims he has traced his ancestry to the Turkana tribe, a semi-nomadic pastoralist group in modern day Kenya. He first made the claim in July while defending comments he made in the past about President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), comparing it to slavery.\n\nCarson said earlier in the year that the Affordable Care Act was the \u201cworst thing since slavery.\u201d\n\nHe defended the controversial comments, saying that his family also experienced the pains and horrors of slavery. He claimed that two of his ancestors were separated and sold to different slave owners.\n\n\u201cThe pain and the heartache associated with that era\u2026 There is nothing that compares to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my roots traced back, all the way up to my great great great great-grandfather who came from the Turkana tribe, which is migratory tribe, even today in Kenya and Tanzania,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 64-year-old African American also said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on December 7 that he is scheduled to begin a week-long tour to Africa on December 27.\n\nHe plans to visit Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia.\n\nSpeaking on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s show, he said, \u201cMy ancestors are from the Kenya-Tanzania region, the Turkana tribe. I\u2019ve had all of that traced back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of our policy in the future is going to affect Africa, but those three in particular because my ancestors are from the Kenya-Tanzania region, the Turkana tribe. I\u2019ve had all of that traced back,\u201d he added.\n\nThe statements come after costly slips that raised doubts about his preparedness to lead the country on the international stage. He blundered gravely when he suggested recently that China was involved militarily in Syria.\n\nThe White House responded to the claim with derision.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, said, \u201cMaybe it violates my job description as a spokesperson to be speechless. But I think in this case, I am.\u201d\n\nAnother Kenyan (Turkana) descendant running for US President!! https://t.co/mEusved4S5 \u2014 Simiyu Tete (@SimiyuTete) December 8, 2015\n\nIf Obama is from luo land and Ben Carson from Turkana then am from an aboriginal tribe somewhere in Australia \u2014 ERROR;MENYE DETECTED (@mosesmenye) October 28, 2015\n\nBen Carson if u mentioned that your ancestry lies in Kenya then u automatically become the POTUS \u2014 Esha Duke Mainga (@DeeKenya) December 8, 2015\n\nHeard Ben Carson is visiting Kenya soon.. I can\u2019t wait to meet him & tell him how much I did not read his books,. \u2014 mayore (@bwrca) December 8, 2015\n\nThe Kenyan Daily Nation notes that Carson\u2019s claim that the Turkana ethnic group are found in the \u201cKenyan-Tanzania\u201d border is yet another example of his confusion of issues on the foreign front. The Kenyan news site explains that the Turkana are found in northwest Kenya, close to the country\u2019s borders with South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda, far from Tanzania.\n\nBut critics are saying Carson\u2019s latest pronouncements are part of a strategy to revive his faltering political fortunes. Critics also say that his scheduled trip to Africa later in the month, ostensibly a \u201chomecoming,\u201d is part of campaign efforts to boost public perception of his foreign policy experience and his ability to manage international relations as president.\n\nThe GOP presidential aspirant has admitted that public perception that he is inexperienced in foreign policy matters and international affairs may have caused his recent drop in national polls.\n\nThe 64-year-old GOP presidential aspirant rose briefly to front-runner status in the 2016 GOP presidential field, but slipped in recent polls from first to third position. A recent Quinnipiac poll placed his support at 16 percent, a drop of seven percentage points compared with last month.\n\nUS presidential candidate Ben Carson to visit Kenya https://t.co/pYgGzz26An \u2014 NTV Kenya (@ntvkenya) December 8, 2015\n\nBREAKING NEWS: @RealBenCarson says he will visit his ancestral homeland of #Kenya https://t.co/5VZXEMP0EQ >@qzafrica \u2014 Calestous Juma (@calestous) December 8, 2015\n\nSo Ben Carson wants the world to know he really has his roots in Kenya?

Well all right then. \u2014 Wambura (@rombokins) December 8, 2015\n\nRepublican Party candidate for the US presidency Dr Ben Carson: \u201cMy ancestors are from the Kenya-Tanzania region\u201d. \u2014 WeAreAllHuman (@MalcolmMusiime) December 8, 2015\n\nHis closest rival, billionaire business man Donald Trump, regained his front-runner status polling 27 percent, a three percent increase compared with last month\u2019s Quinnipiac poll.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz tied Carson for third place by polling 16 percent, a three percentage point increase compared with last month\u2019s poll.\n\nCarson plans to travel to Kenya in Africa \u2014 with stops in Nigeria and Zambia \u2014 on December 27 and return a week later as part of efforts to mend damage to his presidential campaign due to perceptions of his weakness in the foreign policy and international relations department.\n\nExplaining why he is visiting Nigeria, Carson said, \u201cTo Nigeria, I want to get an idea from the people what the effects of Boko Haram are, what people are thinking, to see what the economic situation is there, and also there\u2019s a medical school there named after me which I want to visit.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ben Carson is popular among Nigerian school children. He name is often mentioned by Nigerian school children listing their role models.\n\nHe also explains why he plans to visit Zambia.\n\n\u201cThe Banda twins (Joseph and Luka Banda) are there. We separated them. They were joined at the top of the head facing in opposite directions almost 18 years ago, and this is the year they graduate from high school,\u201d he said.\n\nA team of surgeons led by Carson separated the conjoined twins in a surgical operation in 1997.\n\n\u201cThey were joined at the top of the head facing in opposite directions almost 18 years ago and this is the year they graduate from high school,\u201d he said.\n\nBen Carson is taking this African ancestry joke way too far\u2026. Turkana people on the Kenya-Tanzania border? \u2014 mmnjug\u2122 (@mmnjug) December 8, 2015\n\nSo Ben Carson\u2019 ancestors came from Turkana in the Kenya-Tanzania region? https://t.co/mD76UZYYvl \u2014 Jimnah Mbaru (@JimnahMbaru) December 8, 2015\n\nAfter Obama And The Pope Here Is The U.S. Presidential Candidate Who Is Coming To Kenya Soon https://t.co/9FfUuLXLiu \u2014 Mpasho News (@MpashoNews) December 8, 2015\n\nBen Carson to visit Kenya and two other countries this December https://t.co/RmFafyqmEt \u2014 News Kenya (@NewsKenya_) December 8, 2015\n\nUSA Presidential Aspirant.. Dr. Ben Carson to visit Kenya this Month. Is he trying to see the BIG PICTURE to follow in Obamas Footsteps?? \u2014 gladwell karangi (@KananaGK) December 8, 2015\n\nCarson\u2019s latest effort to reclaim his \u201cAfrican roots\u201d could also be part of a strategy to curry the favor of African American voters, among whom he has very little political support despite having once been a popular figure and role model icon.\n\nHis ardent espousal of Tea Party conservatism with criticisms of the African American community that haven\u2019t gone down very well have alienated him from majority of black voters who see him as pandering to white conservative voters at the expense of the black community.\n\nEmphasizing his alleged Kenyan roots at this time could provide opportunity to contrast himself in a favorable light with President Barack Obama.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is the son of a Kenyan father, Barack Obama, Sr., from the Luo ethnic group in Kenya, and an American mother, Ann Dunham, of English ancestry, native of Wichita, Kansas.\n\nReactions to Carson\u2019s latest claim on social media, both in the U.S. and Africa, have been a mixture of skepticism, sarcasm, hilarity, and occasionally acceptance.\n\nKenyans has reacted on Twitter with comments such as, \u201cyet another Kenyan export to the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol. I guess you can\u2019t be president of the US unless you claim Kenyan ancestry!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if there ever were slaves taken from East Africa to America in the Trans-Atlantic slave Trade; Middle East and Asia, maybe, but America? I thought they were taken from the West side of Africa, Senegal down to Angola, Congo being the deepest inwards.\u201d\n\nSome skeptics pointed out that the vast majority of slaves exported from Africa to the U.S. as part of the Transatlantic Slave Trade came from the West African coast as far as Angola, and that most of the trade in slaves in East Africa where the Turkanas live was linked to the Trans-Saharan Slave Trade that exported Black African slaves to markets in the Middle East.\n\n[Photo by Rainier Ehrhardt/AP]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson has claimed African roots in Kenya, where President Barack Obama has close family links.
