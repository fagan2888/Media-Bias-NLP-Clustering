But the notion that they need to assemble these ideas into a single Washington-centric reform plan that can be plugged into the void left by Obamacare\u2019s demise is a puzzling one.\n\nAccording to Mike Allen, in the new insider account of ObamaCare, America\u2019s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, Steve Brill writes: \u201cNearly five years later, President Obama would tell me \u2026 \u2018In hindsight, \u2026 there should have been one central person in charge, a CEO of the Marketplace.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat does a contrived \u201cmarketplace\u201d built on cronyism, coercion, and rent seeking, paid for by tax subsidies and governed by a regulatory structure that makes any genuine competitive pricing impossible need to be successful? More top-down bureaucratic management, of course.\n\nThe president\u2019s comment reflects his inability to grasp what a marketplace actually is, but it\u2019s also a reminder that one of the most distasteful aspects of ACA is its centralized structure\u2014which, for most liberals, was the point of the project. Even voters who aren\u2019t directly hurt by ObamaCare tend to dislike the idea of DC dictating what their coverage looks like. For many voters, ObamaCare represents every problem with health care in the United States. Gallup\u2019s recent polling found that Americans now say that the \u201cbiggest problem\u201d in America is \u201cthe government.\u201d And they\u2019re talking about federal government.\n\nI only bring this up because as the GOP Congress starts work, the media is already asking why conservatives haven\u2019t been able to cobble together a national health-care reform platform with a catchy name. Here\u2019s Politico reporting on the GOP\u2019s inability to bridge its differences:\n\nThe GOP conversations so far are preliminary, and a breakthrough isn\u2019t imminent. Various Republican proposals have been put forth over the years, but forging agreement requires bridging deep ideological differences among Republicans about the scope of a plan, the role and responsibility of the federal government in health care, and how much to money to spend.\n\nThey don\u2019t need a breakthrough. The fact is, Republicans have offered a number of plans with varying levels of free-market reforms, but Americans aren\u2019t in the mood for another wide-ranging effort from Washington. There\u2019s almost no chance of Congress coming together on a set of ideas anyway. There\u2019s even less of a chance that Congress can accomplish anything on the issue while Barack Obama is still president, anyway.\n\nBut even if they could create some consensus, the argument for deregulating ObamaCare is far more powerful than trying to sell \u201cmeans-tested tax credits\u201d \u2014and another few dozen compelling ideas\u2014at the same time. What\u2019s more important is freeing states and allowing them to implement these ideas when possible on their own. If Vermont\u2019s experiment with single-payer reform crashes and burns, it won\u2019t take the entire country with it. Republicans may have some terrible ideas, as well. Let\u2019s see how they work elsewhere.\n\nObamaCare may well survive King v. Burwell, the legal challenge that could sink ACA by forcing the administration to follow the law and cut subsidies from government \u201cmarketplaces\u201d in states that didn\u2019t surrender to White House inducements. Only 13 states have their own marketplaces. If it doesn\u2019t, though, Republicans will have a glorious chance to deregulate and open up markets. You know, fix our broken health care system. If not Burwell, they\u2019ll have other shots at it. The chance of ObamaCare\u2019s popularity growing over the next few years is slim. Most of the painful taxes were designed to be implemented during Obama\u2019s second term, once the law had already turned into a giant welfare program that would be almost impossible to dislodge.
