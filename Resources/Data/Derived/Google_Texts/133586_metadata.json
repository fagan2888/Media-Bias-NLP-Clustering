Here are three of them:\n\nIdentify clinicians committed to outcomes measurement: In many cases clinicians are already collecting outcomes data unofficially, so it's important to ally with them to drive organization-wide interest. For example, the post points to the Mayo Clinic's Jacksonville, Florida, location, where neurologist Ryan Uitti, M.D., tracked outcomes for Parkinson's patients using a spreadsheet for more than 10 years before the clinic's Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery enlisted him to help implement a larger measurement program.\n\nCommit long-term resources and time: Leaders must not abandon outcomes measurement investments simply because they don't pay off immediately, according to the authors. For example, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in Wales made major investments in outcomes measurement amid financial austerity, focusing largely on information technology development, after leaders decided it was the best long-term strategy for clinical and financial improvement.\n\nAdapt and scale early successes for the entire organization: For example, at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, CEO Barbaro Frid\u00e9n, M.D., initially focused the hospital's outcome measurement efforts on areas with particular room for improvement, such as arthroplasty, but after developing tools for measurement, was able to apply them to issues such as falls, nausea and post-surgical mobility as well.\n\n\"Innovative organizations are still paving the way for value transformation, and the keys to success are not all known,\" the post states. \"But by taking these early steps, healthcare leaders can begin moving in the right direction for long-term success.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhy hospitals should use broader measures to track care quality\n\nWhy healthcare quality measures don't go deep enough\n\nValue-based payment initiative raises questions about how to measure quality\n\nFeds speed plans for value-based payments\n\nAHA supports NQF's proposed quality measure recommendations", "article_metadata": {"description": "As part of\u00a0the push to transition from volume-based care models to value-based care, hospitals and other providers increasingly monitor their performances on outcomes measures, but leaders need to take an active role to make sure \u00a0their organizations truly measure quality,\u00a0according to\u00a0a blog post from the\u00a0Harvard Business", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As part of\u00a0the push to transition from volume-based care models to value-based care, hospitals and other providers increasingly monitor their performances on outcomes measures, but leaders need to take an active role to make sure \u00a0their organizations truly measure quality,\u00a0according to\u00a0a blog post from the\u00a0Harvard Business", "title": "3 steps healthcare leaders must take to measure care quality", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-steps-healthcare-leaders-must-take-measure-care-quality/2015-12-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Healthcare Investment,hospital leadership,Operations & Business Management,outcomes measures,outcomes monitoring,Patient Care & Outcomes,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4fb1\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the postRelated Articles:Why hospitals should use broader measures to track care qualityWhy healthcare quality measures don't go deep enoughValue-based payment initiative raises questions about how to measure qualityFeds speed plans for value-based paymentsAHA supports NQF's proposed quality measure recommendations\nLeaders who successfully factor outcomes measurement into their organizations identify several essential strategies, according to the post.\n\"But by taking these early steps, healthcare leaders can begin moving in the right direction for long-term success.\"\nCommit long-term resources and time: Leaders must not abandon outcomes measurement investments simply because they don't pay off immediately, according to the authors.\nHere are three of them:Identify clinicians committed to outcomes measurement: In many cases clinicians are already collecting outcomes data unofficially, so it's important to ally with them to drive organization-wide interest."}
