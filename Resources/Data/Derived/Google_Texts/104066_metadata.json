(Photo: Megan McCormick/News-Herald Medi)Buy Photo\n\nFor years, central Wisconsin health care systems and hospitals have worked with each other to form mutually beneficial arrangements \u2014 even while competing over patients and their money.\n\nIn that context, it's no surprise that Marshfield Clinic recently announced that it might partner with Wausau-based Aspirus Inc. to build a $175 million hospital facility in Marshfield.\n\nAs each new partnership is formed, however, the relationships among these major local health care providers have become even more complex and harder to grasp.\n\nTo help bring these connections into clearer focus, Gannett Central Wisconsin Media compiled a list of notable partnerships among the area's hospitals and health systems. Here's how they work together to deliver medical care in our communities:\n\nMarshfield Clinic and Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital\n\nFor more than 80 years, Marshfield Clinic and Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital, part of the Ministry Health Care system, have engaged in a working relationship, said Brian Kief, president of Saint Joseph's.\n\nMarshfield Clinic, a health care system based near the hospital in Marshfield, is chiefly an ambulatory and financial services health system and Saint Joseph's is currently the city's only hospital.\n\nThe two organizations share a medical campus and most Saint Joseph's patients see physicians who work for Marshfield Clinic, said Dr. Sue Turney, chief executive officer of Marshfield Clinic.\n\n\"Nearly all of the active positions on our medical staff are employed by the Marshfield Clinic,\" Kief said.\n\nMarshfield Clinic and Saint Joseph's have other close ties. For instance, Saint Joseph's contracts for lab services with the Clinic's Marshfield Labs. Also, the Clinic and Ministry Saint Michael's Hospital, in Stevens Point, established a partnership to form the Stevens Point Cancer Center at Saint Michael's.\n\nBuy Photo Aspirus Inc. of Wausau will soon become the owner of Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 hospital.

However, the Clinic announced in late February it planned to create a $175 million-plus \"hospital of the future\" facility near its Marshfield complex and is in \"active discussions\" with Aspirus for partnerships. Still, some in Marshfield are concerned about how the new facility will affect Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital.\n\nSo far, Marshfield Clinic has ownership of two hospitals: it owns Lakeview Medical Center in Rice Lake and co-owns Flambeau Hospital in Park Falls with Ministry Health Care.\n\nBuy Photo Marshfield Clinic is looking to build a $175 million-plus health care facility in Marshfield. (Photo: Megan McCormick/News-Herald Medi)\n\nAspirus Inc. and Riverview Medical Center\n\nIn the next week, Aspirus Inc. and Wisconsin Rapids' Riverview Hospital Association are expected to finalize an affiliation, resulting in Aspirus' ownership of the city's only hospital. In the past, the two affiliations had joined forces on the creation of a hospitalist program and the UW Cancer Center Riverview, among other ventures.\n\nBefore the acquisition deal was reached, Aspirus announced in the summer of 2014 that it would create its own \"hospital of the future\" in Wisconsin Rapids. Later it rescinded those plans in favor of affiliating with Riverview.\n\nRiverview officials have said they expect more health care services and more jobs at the hospital as a result of the affiliation.\n\nAccountable care organizations: abouthealth and Integrated Health Network\n\nAccountable care organizations, also known as ACOs, might also affect the reasons various organizations partner with each other, said Matt Heywood, Aspirus chief executive officer.\n\nIn Wisconsin, there are two ACOs: abouthealth, which is less than a year old, and Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin, also known as IHN. ACOs \u2014 a result of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are partnerships among health care systems that seek to consolidate clinical services to cut health care costs, while also making care accessible to more people, Kief said.\n\nMembership in an ACO is beneficial because the health systems share technology, services and information, Heywood said. If they're able to cut their own costs, the logic goes, the medical providers will be able to reduce patients' and insurers' expenses.\n\n\"If we get together in an ACO, we get the benefits of being in a bigger entity, but we don't necessarily have to merge,\" he said.\n\nAspirus belongs to abouthealth, while Ministry Health Care belongs to IHN. Marshfield Clinic is seeking membership in abouthealth.\n\nBecause of the collaboration and integration that occurs within an ACO, partnering with other health care systems that have memberships within the same ACO is a \"logical\" choice, Heywood said.\n\n\"Aspirus, as a system, is partnering with abouthealth members,\" Heywood said.\n\nMelanie Lawder can be reached at mlawder@cwnews.net or 715-423-7200.
