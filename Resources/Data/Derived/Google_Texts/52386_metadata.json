Instead, it\u2019s the subject of a video featuring Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who, after wrapping bacon around the barrel of an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, cooks it to ammo-crisped perfection using the heat of his shooting.\n\nSen. Cruz isn\u2019t the only candidate who fired off a weaponized YouTube video in recent weeks. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) uploaded a video in which, using fire, a chainsaw, and a wood chipper, he destroyed the 70,000-page U.S. tax code.\n\nAnd Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) used a sword, cinder block, and blender, among other weapons, to destroy his cell phone in a video after fellow candidate Trump announced Graham\u2019s cell phone number during a campaign rally.\n\nWhich brings us back to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s original question: Would these outrageous videos exist if the candidates weren\u2019t playing catch-up to such an outrageous candidate?\n\nWith 17 candidates, the Republican primary field is so large that tonight\u2019s Fox News debate will be split into two parts, forcing nationally recognizable politicians like Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to woo voters at 5 p.m. instead of at 9 p.m. with the top 10 candidates.\n\nAnd of the 17 candidates, Trump has stood out. Early polls reflect that, with Trump holding a double-digit lead over the second and third place candidates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, in most surveys.\n\nThough no major publications give Trump any chance of winning the nomination \u2014 one writer on election forecasting website FiveThirtyEight.com projected his chances at a very unscientific -10 percent \u2014 the media can\u2019t stop covering him.\n\nGoogle Trends shows how frequently Trump is mentioned compared to other candidates.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump is dominating Google searches of #Republicans ahead of the #GOPDebate http://t.co/Uue39QyzF4 pic.twitter.com/IYUQPzKZsD \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) August 4, 2015\n\nBy grabbing headlines when candidates like former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore and former New York Gov. George Pataki are fighting for air, Trump has trumped the opposition.\n\nWhen the U.S. announced a recent nuclear deal with Iran, each candidate looked to condemn it in the most vehement way possible. Cruz said that \u201cthe Obama Administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world\u201d; Graham called it \u201ca death sentence for the State of Israel\u201d; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the deal was \u201cmarching Israelis to the door of the oven,\u201d a statement he stood by even after criticism from Jewish groups.\n\nTell Congress to do their constitutional duty & reject the Obama-Kerry #IranDeal \u2013> http://t.co/SaIyuq4w01 pic.twitter.com/2rFJgdDHhV \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) July 26, 2015\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Trump is in the headlines for doing things like calling Mexican immigrants rapists or ridiculing Rick Perry for wearing glasses to look smart and Lindsey Graham for polling at zero percent in under a minute \u2014 Trump is talking, America is listening, and everyone else is playing catch-up.\n\nBut can Trump\u2019s early lead be directly correlated with the subsequent attention-grabbing candidate videos?\n\nGraham and Cruz\u2019s videos were both produced by the Independent Journal Review, a site that has been called the \u201cConservative Upworthy.\u201d In comments to BDCwire, IJ creative director Benny Johnson \u2014 who previously worked at BuzzFeed before being fired for plagiarism \u2014 said that the videos reflected the appetites of new media consumers.\n\n\u201cA socially native audience expects to see the personal side of these candidates,\u201d Johnson told BDCwire. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing. On a basic level, that\u2019s what social is built on, giving others access to your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt IJ, we set out to develop a deeply human brand of political journalism, so our readers can connect to the human side, as well as the policy side, of the candidate running for president.\u201d\n\nJohnson also said that Trump has not had an effect on their videos or their content, and promised more would be coming soon.\n\n\u201cWe would be creating this content with or without Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThough Trump\u2019s inclusion in the race has certainly provided the opportunity for the mass destruction of flip phones.\u201d\n\nThe concept of reaching audiences through newer digital platforms isn\u2019t exclusive to Republicans, either. When President Obama looked to encourage young people to sign up for health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, he appeared on Funny or Die\u2019s talk show \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d and made a video with BuzzFeed full of mirror poses and selfie sticks.\n\nThese moves make sense. In terms of traffic, BuzzFeed and IJReview rank 36th and 64th in the U.S., respectively, according to web traffic company Alexa. Some forecasters are even taking a strong digital presence and engagement with social media into account when looking for signs of a successful campaign.\n\n\u201cThey have good ads, they are good on Snapchat, on Instagram,\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Katherine Miller said of Gov. Walker\u2019s campaign in a discussion with FiveThirtyEight. \u201cIt seems like a very adept campaign. Those are small things, but they indicate something to me.\u201d\n\nAn opinion piece by Grant Nicholas in The Boston Globe raises a similar point, hypothesizing that because 64 percent of Americans now own smartphones, the emphasis on digital campaign techniques is analogous to the rise of television in the 1960 election.\n\nThe last time this kind of technological shift occurred, it had a profound effect on the electoral process. In the decade leading up to the 1960 election, the percentage of American households with a television jumped from 11 to 88. John F. Kennedy took advantage of this shift in the first televised presidential debate: Famously, those who heard the debate on the radio thought Nixon won, while those who watched on television favored the more dashing Kennedy.\n\nIn all likelihood, we\u2019ve reached a tipping point where social and digital are major components for any politician to secure voter attention. Circling back to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s original question, Maddow reaches the same conclusion.\n\n\u201cI want to say yes,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cI want to say that the arc of the moral universe bends toward machine-gun bacon and we just get there by 2016.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include Benny Johnson\u2019s response to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the end of a recent episode of The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, fellow MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell posed a seemingly absurd question to Maddow: \"Would we", "og": {"site_name": "BDCWire", "description": "At the end of a recent episode of The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, fellow MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell posed a seemingly absurd question to Maddow: \"Would we have machine-gun bacon in this campaign were it not for Donald Trump?\"  Machine-gun bacon sounds like a continental breakfast menu item at the NRA convention.
