An early-morning earthquake that shook parts of southern Kansas has been downgraded to a magnitude 3.8.

Saturday's temblor was originally reported as a 4.2 by the U.S. Geological Survey . It occurred just before 4:20 a.m., two and a half miles northwest of Anthony. That's about 60 miles southwest of Wichita.

The quake was felt by a viewer who said some items fell from inside her home in Harper.
