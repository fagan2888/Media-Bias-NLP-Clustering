SEATTLE — Bartell Drugs announced Monday that its flu vaccination program had begun at its 64 locations and its off-site flu clinic program serving businesses and retirement centers in the area. Customers can show up during pharmacy hours without an appointment to get vaccinated — children ages 5 to 17 must have parent or guardian.

“Getting vaccinated prevents or minimizes the effects of the flu. It’s important to get started before the onset of flu activity, since it takes two weeks for the body to develop influenza antibodies following the vaccine administration,” Billy Chow, Bartell Drugs VP pharmacy operations and clinical services, said.

Bartell drugs offers the standard 2015-2016 trivalent vaccine, as well as a quadrivalent vaccine (which is also available as FluMist nasal spray) and Fluzone High-Dose for those 65 years of age and older.
