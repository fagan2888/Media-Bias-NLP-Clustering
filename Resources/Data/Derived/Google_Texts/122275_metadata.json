Two years ago, Republicans refused to raise the debt limit unless they got concessions like spending cuts, spending caps, and a strict balanced budget amendment. Two years ago, Democrats negotiated, then walked away. An impasse that made everyone look like idiots ended with a compromise that made them look like \u2026 well, idiots. A select committee\u2014nicknamed \u201cthe supercommittee\u201d\u2014was empowered to stop the next crisis.\n\nThat plan did not work.\n\nWashington is now careening into another fight over the debt limit, with Republicans and Democrats basically at their old battle stations. The deficit\u2019s shrinking, so Republicans talk less about debt than about delaying or defunding Obamacare. President Obama was re-elected, so Democrats are less fearful than they were in 2011. Otherwise, this showdown is playing out precisely the way it did last time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s make a game of it. The bingo card below will let you check off 24 (of 32) of the various clich\u00e9s, events, threats, and failures that inevitably will define Debt Limit II.
