I am not doing this for fun,\u201d Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. \u201d Washington is totally broken and it\u2019s not going to get fixed unless we put the right person in that top position. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has flirted with running for president numerous times, including in 2012 before he ultimately threw his coveted endorsement behind inevitable nominee Mitt Romney. However, when push comes to shove, pageants and reality TV shows always consume the Don\u2019s time.\n\nEven though he has a long track record of generating media buzz and publicity each presidential election cycle \u2014 only to disappoint his fans in the end \u2014 Mr. Trump has never been quite as dismissive of the critics as he was Friday. His speech left many wondering if this cycle would be different.\n\nTrump has been very vocal about Mitt Romney\u2019s mistakes and over his brief consideration of whether to run for president for a third time in 2016. Romney has since backed out, a move that many say has paved the way for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nThat possibility doesn\u2019t sit well with Donald Trump, who sources say believes he may be the best candidate to block another Bush from running for the presidency given the amount of resources he has available.\n\n\u201cThe last thing this country needs is another Bush,\u201d Trump said earlier in February. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it with the Bushes, and the last Bush did not do a great job. He gave us Obama, he gave us\u2014as you know\u2014Justice [John] Roberts [of the Supreme Court] who approved Obamacare. He\u2019s got a second shot at it but who knows what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s not as good as the first one. But he [George W. Bush] gave us Justice Roberts who approved Obamacare. We\u2019re all saddled with Obamacare, the country is saddled with it. And it really kicks in in 2016. It\u2019s going to be a disaster for the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Trump CPAC, Trump CPAC 2015, Trump running for president", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Speaking Friday at CPAC 2015, billionaire Donald Trump tried to put an end to criticisms that he is never really serious about running for president.", "title": "Donald Trump: \u2018I Am Not Doing This For Fun,\u2019 We Can\u2019t Fix U.S. \u2018Unless We Put Right Person\u2019 In WH", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/donald-trump-cpac-2015.jpg", "height": 354}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T18:40:47-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/02/28/donald-trump-i-am-not-doing-this-for-fun-we-cant-fix-u-s-unless-we-put-right-person-in-wh/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaking Friday at CPAC 2015, billionaire Donald Trump tried to put an end to criticisms that he is never really serious about running for president.", "title": "Donald Trump: 'I Am Not Doing This For Fun,' We Can't Fix U.S. 'Unless We Put Right Person' In WH | People's Pundit Daily", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/donald-trump-cpac-2015.jpg", "creator": "@PPDNews", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/02/28/donald-trump-i-am-not-doing-this-for-fun-we-cant-fix-u-s-unless-we-put-right-person-in-wh/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/23011", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/23011", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "robots": "noodp", "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "headlines", "published_time": "2015-02-28T05:00:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T18:40:47-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "Speaking Friday at CPAC 2015, billionaire Donald Trump tried to put an end to criticisms that he is never really serious about running for president."}, "article_summary": "I am not doing this for fun,\u201d Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\u201cThe last thing this country needs is another Bush,\u201d Trump said earlier in February.\n\u201d Washington is totally broken and it\u2019s not going to get fixed unless we put the right person in that top position.\nBut he [George W.
