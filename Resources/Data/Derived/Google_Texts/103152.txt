SANTA FE, N.M. — Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Deputies arrested two people on Christmas who admitted burglarizing a Nambe area home to support their heroin habits, according to documents filed to support their arrest.

According to a statement of probable cause, Matthew Gomez, 26, and Ashley Roybal, 27, of Santa Fe were arrested after a caller in the Arroyo Negro area told a police dispatcher that a man was carrying a TV to an older, white Honda Accord.

Two deputies responded and one saw a white Accord westbound on NM 503 and saw the TV on the north side of NM 503 where moments before there was no TV.

After stopping the Honda a deputy saw a black electrical cord apparently from a TV on the floor board and was given a consent to search the car by the occupants. The deputy recovered the cord and a black hat that the male burglar was said to be wearing.

Gomez and Roybal were detained and Gomez told deputies the two had woken up sick on Christmas morning because they had not had heroin since the night before, the court documents said. They devised a plan to burglarize homes by first knocking on doors to see if people were home. Gomez said when they saw a deputy, Roybal pushed the TV out of their car because “they did not want to get caught with the television,” the documents said. Deputies are investigating a second burglary in the area allegedly involving the twosome.
