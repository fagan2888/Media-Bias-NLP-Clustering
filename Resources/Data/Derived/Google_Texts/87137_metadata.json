That would appear to be the sorry state of affairs in the land of Bitcoin, a crypto-currency, if recent press coverage is to be believed. On March 6th Newsweek reported that it had tracked down Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator. And on March 11th Mt Gox, the Japanese online exchange that had long dominated the trade in the currency before losing $490m of customers\u2019 Bitcoins at today\u2019s prices, once more filed for bankruptcy protection, this time in America.\n\nIn reality, things are rather different. Evidence is mounting that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, whom Newsweek identified as Bitcoin\u2019s father, is not the relevant Satoshi. More importantly, Bitcoin\u2019s best days may still be ahead of it\u2014if not as a fully fledged currency (see article), then as a platform for financial innovation. Much as the internet is a foundation for digital services, the technology behind Bitcoin could support a revolution in the way people own and pay for things. Geeks of all sorts are getting excited\u2014including a growing number of venture capitalists, who know a new platform when they see one.\n\nTo understand the enthusiasm in this modern currency, it helps to think about a very old one. Until the early 20th century the people on Yap, an island in the Pacific Ocean, used large stone disks (pictured) as money for big expenses, such as a daughter\u2019s dowry. Being very heavy, they were rarely moved when spent. Instead, they simply changed owners. Every transaction became part of an oral history of ownership, which allowed islanders to know the proprietor of each stone and made it difficult to spend the same stone twice.\n\nBitcoins also don\u2019t move around when they are transferred. They are best understood as entries in a giant ledger, the \u201cblockchain\u201d, which contains the transaction history for every Bitcoin in circulation. It is kept up to date with the help of cryptography and copious computing power, provided by a global network of tens of thousands of computers. Again, openness helps the system remain secure: the blockchain is public so every participant can check whether a transfer comes from the rightful owner.\n\nThis set-up is the first workable solution to one of the more nagging problems of the digital realm: how to transfer something of value from one person to another without middlemen having to make sure that the item is not copied or, in the case of money, spent more than once? And Bitcoin does the trick while being open (unlike conventional payment mechanisms, which aim for security by shielding themselves from outsiders). This means that third parties can make use of Bitcoin\u2019s features without having to ask anyone for permission\u2014as is the case with the internet.\n\nSuch \u201cpermissionless innovation\u201d, in the jargon, should in time result in a cornucopia of applications. Bitcoin\u2019s technology could be used to transfer ownership both in other currencies and of any kind of financial asset. This, in turn, would allow the creation of decentralised exchanges which let asset holders trade directly. And money could be \u201cprogrammed\u201d to come with conditions: for instance, it might be released only if a third person agrees.\n\nSome want ownership of devices\u2014a car, say\u2014to be represented by a Bitcoin, or a tiny fraction of it. The car would work only when turned on with a key that includes the Bitcoin token. This would make managing ownership of and access to physical assets much easier: the token could be sold or rented out temporarily, enabling flexible peer-to-peer car-rental schemes. Such \u201csmart property\u201d would turn the blockchain into a global registry of ownership in physical assets.\n\nAll that may sound like science fiction, but a growing number of startups are working on bringing such applications to market. Coloured Coins and Mastercoin will soon release software that enables trade in other financial assets, including stocks and bonds. The most ambitious project is Ethereum: it will launch a new blockchain, similar but unrelated to Bitcoin, with a programming language to encode financial instruments and other contracts.\n\nAlthough banks have mostly steered clear of Bitcoin as a currency, they too have started exploring how they could use the technology in other ways. They are unlikely to move fast, but there are plenty of possibilities. Global banks could, for instance, use Bitcoin-like systems to move money between subsidiaries. They could even issue their own crypto-currencies.\n\nBut turning Bitcoin into a platform comes with risks. Some geeks fret that the network will reach its maximum capacity of 300,000 transactions per day as new applications come online. Another worry is that as the blockchain, which has already trebled in size to 15 gigabytes over the past year (see chart), continues to grow, fewer of the network\u2019s participants will store it.\n\nYet if history is any guide, the blockchain will be fine. Two decades ago, when millions went online after the invention of the web browser, pundits predicted the internet\u2019s collapse. Technical fixes repeatedly saved the day. And even if Bitcoin were to break down, another similar system would most likely take its place.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Bitcoin\u2019s future", "description": "How the crypto-currency could become the internet of money", "pubdate": 20140315, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "How the crypto-currency could become the internet of money", "title": "Hidden flipside", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21599054-how-crypto-currency-could-become-internet-money-hidden-flipside", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "How the crypto-currency could become the internet of money", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-13 16:45:13", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "FINANCE", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "articleid": 21599054, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140315_FNP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Bitcoin\u2019s future", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Bitcoin\u2019s future"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfac1\"", "article_summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s technology could be used to transfer ownership both in other currencies and of any kind of financial asset.\nColoured Coins and Mastercoin will soon release software that enables trade in other financial assets, including stocks and bonds.\nEvidence is mounting that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, whom Newsweek identified as Bitcoin\u2019s father, is not the relevant Satoshi.\nMuch as the internet is a foundation for digital services, the technology behind Bitcoin could support a revolution in the way people own and pay for things.\nTwo decades ago, when millions went online after the invention of the web browser, pundits predicted the internet\u2019s collapse."}
