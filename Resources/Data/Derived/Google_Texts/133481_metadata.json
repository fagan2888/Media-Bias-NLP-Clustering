The tax imposes a 40 percent tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nMcKechnie pointed out that HSAs differ from traditional employer-funded health plans in several ways\u2014namely, that HSA owners have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d since they are spending their own money, and as a result, tend to make more cost-conscious health care choices. \u201cOver time, HSA owners become better savers, achieve better health outcomes and come to the gates of Medicare with cash in their account, instead of empty handed like the subscribers to traditional health plans,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Health Savings Account Act of 2016\u2014proposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Sen. March Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.)\u2014includes provisions that would exempt HSAs from the tax, streamline the HSA administration process, and make HSAs more widely available to more Americans. It would also allow Medicare Part A beneficiaries to continue contributing to their HSA accounts after age 65.\n\n\u201cThese provisions will collectively improve and expand the ability of Americans to use their Health Savings Accounts by promoting control, choice and personal responsibility in health insurance,\u201d McKechnie added.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ABA Banking Journal, community banking, compliance, cybersecurity, economy, payments, mortgage, policy, retail banking, marketing, agricultural lending, bank directors, mutual institutions, leadership, risk management, corporate social responsibility, policy, tax and accounting, wealth management, technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "description": "ABA Banking Journal, the American Bankers Association\u2019s flagship magazine, provides insights on critical business and policy challenges and trends to help banking leaders succeed in the competitive financial services market."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThese provisions will collectively improve and expand the ability of Americans to use their Health Savings Accounts by promoting control, choice and personal responsibility in health insurance,\u201d McKechnie added.\nThe tax imposes a 40 percent tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans.\n\u201cOver time, HSA owners become better savers, achieve better health outcomes and come to the gates of Medicare with cash in their account, instead of empty handed like the subscribers to traditional health plans,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Health Savings Account Act of 2016\u2014proposed by Sen.
