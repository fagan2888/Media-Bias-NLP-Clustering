(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Colorado voters will get a chance on March 1 during party caucuses to weigh in on the presidential race -- or at least some of them will. Only Democrats will tally their preferences for president that night-- and even then, the selection is non-binding. We look into that process, as well as political ad dollars pouring into the state, the impact of millennials, and the health care battle, below\n\nWhat you should expect if you want to caucus: The University of Denver's Peter Hanson tells Colorado Matters about what it's like to participate in a caucus, why Colorado has a caucus system in the first place, and how the parties differ in their process and outcomes. There's a full explainer on how the system works in Colorado here.\n\nWhy Colorado critics think the caucuses aren't democratic: If you're a registered Democrat or Republican in Colorado, you'll be able to caucus.

That means the bulk of ad dollars streaming into the state -- and TV and radio station coffers -- is on the Democratic side.
