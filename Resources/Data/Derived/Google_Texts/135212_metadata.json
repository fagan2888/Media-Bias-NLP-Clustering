That's like a sonic landscape, a two-year painting. That song I played has been a year and a half in the making and it may be still a year from being complete,\" West continued. \"But it was to let people get a glimpse of the painting.\"\n\nYEEZY SEASON2 #NUDES A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 16, 2015 at 5:23pm PDT\n\nSwish isn't on a fast-track for release, the artist said. In fact, it's not precisely clear when the project will be completed at all. \"I'm not sure. I'm not worried about the years,\" Yeezy said. \"I'm worried about the life and the body of the work that I can put out while I'm breathing.\"\n\nWest also didn't dismiss the announcement of his decision to run for the 2020 presidential election which he made during this year's Video Music Awards. Instead, he told the magazine he's taking it very seriously.\n\n\"I sit in clubs and I'm like, 'Wow, I've got five years before I go and run for office and I've got a lot of research to do, I've got a lot of growing up to do,'\" West said. \"My dad has two masters degrees. My mom has a PhD, she used to work at Operation PUSH. Somehow the more and more creative I get, the closer and closer I get to who I was as a child...I think it's time.\"\n\nThe musician explained he would have to stay creative as he ran for the highest position in the land. \"The whole point is to have someone [in office] that's creative, that's around amazing creatives. This is my theory,\" he added. \"I think the world can be helped through design, so it's very important that I stay around creative forward thinkers.\"\n\n\"I'm not a politician at all,\" West said, referencing his VMA speech. \"I care about the truth and I just care about human beings. I just want everyone to win, that's all I can say, and I think we can.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kanye West is in deep with his fashion collection and other ventures, so the rapper says he's taking his time with his next musical project.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Kanye West is in deep with his fashion collection and other ventures, so the rapper says he's taking his time with his next musical project.", "title": "Kanye West on new album: 'I'm not worried about the years'", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2015/09/24/Kanye-West-on-new-album-Im-not-worried-about-the-years/2681443118809/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2681443118809/2015/3/5568565316f63593507e24c6093e25de/v2.1/Kanye-West-on-new-album-Im-not-worried-about-the-years.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2681443118809/2015/upi/1ea20c8af1665b8dfa150eb461ade9b0/v2.1/Kanye-West-on-new-album-Im-not-worried-about-the-years.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Kanye West is in deep with his fashion collection and other ventures, so the rapper says he's taking his time with his next musical project.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kanye West on new album: 'I'm not worried about the years'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Entertainment, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West"}, "article_summary": "\"I'm worried about the life and the body of the work that I can put out while I'm breathing.\"\n\"The whole point is to have someone [in office] that's creative, that's around amazing creatives.\nI'm not worried about the years,\" Yeezy said.\n\"I'm not a politician at all,\" West said, referencing his VMA speech.\nThe rapper premiered a new song, \"Fade\" alongside the live streaming event of his Yeezy Season 2 fashion show at New York Fashion Week, but West says it's not finished yet either."}
