Four of the top poultry manufacturing companies in the United States \u2014 Tyson, Perdue, Pilgrim\u2019s, and Sanderson Farms \u2014 have been not-so-quietly profiting off of America\u2019s demand for chicken, while the backbone of the industry, chicken farmers, live at or below the poverty line. Last Week Tonight host John Oliver says enough is enough.\n\n\"At this point, you may be angry at the chicken industry, but careful,\" Oliver said. \"You need to save a little room, because you're about to get even angrier.\"\n\nContracted chicken farms, which account for around 97 percent of America\u2019s chicken production, utilize their own land, facilities, and equipment. In fact, the companies who employ chicken farmers are only responsible for providing chickens. Unfortunately, since chicken farmers are responsible for their land and equipment, they are also responsible for making sure everything is up to code. If a certain piece of machinery requires an upgrade, they are expected to foot the bill.\n\nNot only are these farmers forced to spend most of the money they make off of poultry production, but they also put their health at risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people working at poultry processing jobs are at an increased risk for work-related injuries or illnesses, such as carpel tunnel syndrome, asthma, bronchitis, and allergic reactions.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "john, oliver, takes, us, chicken, industry, arguing, companies, profit, while, farmers, suffer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "John Oliver confronts chicken companies, like Tyson and Purdue, who are profiting off of the hard work of chicken farmers who remain at or below the poverty line.", "title": "John Oliver Offers Support For Exploited Chicken Farmers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/john-oliver-takes-us-chicken-industry-arguing-companies-profit-while-farmers-suffer-333858", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/18/john-oliver-takes-us-chicken-industry-arguing-companies-profit-while-farmers-suffer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Oliver confronts chicken companies, like Tyson and Purdue, who are profiting off of the hard work of chicken farmers who remain at or below the poverty line.", "title": "John Oliver Offers Support For Exploited Chicken Farmers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/john-oliver-takes-us-chicken-industry-arguing-companies-profit-while-farmers-suffer-333858", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/18/john-oliver-takes-us-chicken-industry-arguing-companies-profit-while-farmers-suffer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/john-oliver-takes-us-chicken-industry-arguing-companies-profit-while-farmers-suffer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-18T14:47:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T14:47:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "John Oliver confronts chicken companies, like Tyson and Purdue, who are profiting off of the hard work of chicken farmers who remain at or below the poverty line."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd359a\"", "article_summary": "Contracted chicken farms, which account for around 97 percent of America\u2019s chicken production, utilize their own land, facilities, and equipment.\n\"At this point, you may be angry at the chicken industry, but careful,\" Oliver said.\nAmerica\u2019s growing love affair with protein has been lucrative for people at the top of the chicken industry, but not the bottom.\nIn fact, the companies who employ chicken farmers are only responsible for providing chickens.\nUnfortunately, since chicken farmers are responsible for their land and equipment, they are also responsible for making sure everything is up to code."}
