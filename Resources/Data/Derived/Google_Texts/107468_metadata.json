It\u2019s the first time in more than two decades that global banks have admitted to wrongdoing on such a scale.\n\n\u201cFor more than five years, traders in \u2018The Cartel\u2019 used a private electronic chat room to manipulate the spot market\u2019s exchange rate between euros and dollars, using coded language to conceal their collusion,\u201d Ms. Lynch said. \u201cThey acted as partners \u2014 rather than competitors \u2014 in an effort to push the exchange rate in directions favorable to their banks but detrimental to many others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cartel\u201d traders coordinated their currency trades to manipulate the benchmark rates set at the two major daily snapshots of the eurodollar exchange rates, known as \u201cfixes,\u201d which take place at 1:15 p.m. and 4 p.m., said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer. Those fixes are supposed to be reported by unbiased third parties, Mr. Baer said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Court refuses to rehear Obamacare contraception case\n\nThe group also hatched plans in the chat room to protect themselves at other times during the day by agreeing to hold off buying or selling dollars and euros, he said.\n\nAnalysts said the penalties marked a victory for the government and reflect a broader effort by the Justice Department, long criticized as reluctant to prosecute big banks, to tackle financial misconduct.\n\nThe banks blamed the currency manipulation scheme on a few bad actors.\n\n\u201cThe lesson here is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or of even a single employee, can reflect badly on all of us,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nCiti Chief Executive Michael Corbat said nine employees had been fired and others disciplined in the wake of the settlement.\n\n\u201cThe behavior that resulted in the settlements we announced today is an embarrassment to our firm, and stands in stark contrast to Citi\u2019s values,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2026 We will learn from this experience and continue building upon the changes that we have already made to our systems, controls, and monitoring processes.\u201d\n\nThe four banks will pay a combined $2.5 billion in criminal penalties to the Justice Department for illegal manipulation of currency rates between 2007 and 2013. The Federal Reserve is imposing an additional $1.6 billion in fines, as the banks\u2019 chief regulator.\n\nBritain\u2019s Barclays is paying an additional $1.3 billion to British and U.S. regulators for its role in the scheme, and Switzerland\u2019s UBS has agreed to plead guilty to manipulating key interest rates and will pay a separate criminal penalty of $203 million.\n\nFederal prosecutors called out UBS in Wednesday\u2019s press conference as a chronically bad actor.\n\nUBS has a \u201crap sheet\u201d that cannot be ignored, said Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell.\n\n\u201cWithin the past six years, the department has resolved criminal investigations of UBS three times, resulting in non-prosecution or deferred prosecution agreements,\u201d she said. \u201cUBS also has entered into civil and regulatory settlements on multiple occasions within the past few years. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Justice officials say the banks have each agreed to a three-year period of corporate probation, which will require regular reporting to authorities and cessation of all criminal activity. All banks are to continue cooperating with the government\u2019s ongoing criminal investigations, and the plea agreements do not prevent the Obama administration from prosecuting culpable individuals for related misconduct.\n\n\u201cThe penalty all these banks will now pay is fitting considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Ms. Lynch said. \u201cIt is commensurate with the pervasive harm done.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Brennan Weiss contributed to this report, which was based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They called themselves \"The Cartel\" and used secret chat rooms to plot strategy and manipulate prices on the world's trillion-dollar currency markets.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "They called themselves \u201cThe Cartel\u201d and used secret chat rooms to plot strategy and manipulate prices on the world\u2019s trillion-dollar currency markets.", "title": "Citicorp, JPMorgan, Barclays fined $5B for currency rigging", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/20/citicorp-jpmorgan-barclays-fined-5b-for-currency-r/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/20/5_202015_bank-settlements-38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/20/5_202015_bank-settlements-38201.jpg", "description": "They called themselves \"The Cartel\" and used secret chat rooms to plot strategy and manipulate prices on the world's trillion-dollar currency markets.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Citicorp, JPMorgan, Barclays fined $5B for currency rigging"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Law Crime, Department Of Justice, Barclays Plc, Bill Baer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf20e\"", "article_summary": "They called themselves \u201cThe Cartel\u201d and used secret chat rooms to plot strategy and manipulate prices on the world\u2019s trillion-dollar currency markets.\nIt\u2019s the first time in more than two decades that global banks have admitted to wrongdoing on such a scale.\n\u201cThe penalty all these banks will now pay is fitting considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.\nThe banks blamed the currency manipulation scheme on a few bad actors.\nFederal prosecutors called out UBS in Wednesday\u2019s press conference as a chronically bad actor."}
