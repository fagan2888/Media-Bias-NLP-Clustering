According to an anonymous U.S. officials who spoke with the Associated Press, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — the former POW of the Taliban who was traded recently for five Taliban leaders, sparking Republican outrage — has told government authorities that he was tortured and beaten during his nearly five years of captivity.

The official said Bergdahl’s claims are difficult to verify, but relayed that the soldier, who has been accused by many on the right of being a deserter, traitor and possible jihadist, has recounted being punished for attempting to escape with beatings as well as being trapped inside a small metal cage.

According to a report from the New York Times, Bergdahl said he was kept in the cage, in the dark, for weeks at a time. Doctors say that while he is physically healthy enough to make the military hospital in Germany where he’s currently recovering, he is still not emotionally or psychologically prepared to more fully integrate himself back into the wider world.

“Physically, he could be put on a plane to the U.S. tomorrow, but there are still a couple of mental criteria to address: the family unification piece and the media exposure piece,” an American official aware of the sergeant’s condition told the New York Times.
