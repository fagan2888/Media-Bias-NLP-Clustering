A majority are expected to vote in favor of the union.\n\nHamilton Nolan, the Gawker writer leading the unionization drive, hopes Gawker Media CEO Nick Denton\u2019s decision not to fight the WGA East vote will serve as a model for other online media companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for Nick\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s good for Nick as a leader. It\u2019s something good that Nick could do, I think, for the whole industry,\u201d Nolan told Capital New York.\n\nAFL-CIO president Richard Trumka \u2014 who was paid $322,131 by the union coalition last year \u2014 would love to see mass unionization in online media. WGA East is an AFL-CIO affiliate.\n\n.@Gawker writers are voting next week to join @WGAEast & win their right to bargain w/ one voice http://t.co/QKD896tADF #1u #GoodLuck \u2014 Richard L. Trumka (@RichardTrumka) May 29, 2015\n\nEmployers more concerned than Denton about unionization are grappling with new National Labor Relations Board \u201cambush election\u201d rules making it easier for unions to recruit members.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s NLRB, stacked with labor union supporters, aims to reverse a trend of declining union membership by limiting the time businesses have to inform workers about the potential downsides of joining a union.\n\nUnder NLRB\u2019s new rules, employers will have as little as two weeks before a union election to warn workers about restrictive union rules or questionable use of union dues.\n\nRELATED: America\u2019s top labor union bosses raked in millions in 2014\n\nIn 2014, WGA East\u2019s 3,718 members paid an average of $81 each to cover executive director Lowell Peterson\u2019s $300,000 salary and $1,015 in other expenses, based on the union\u2019s annual filing with the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nThe union paid assistant executive directors Ruth Gallo and Marsha Seeman $191,985 and $170,018, respectively, and paid senior counsel Ann Burdick $169,950. WGA East organizing director Justin Molito was paid $166,190.\n\nThis means WGA East members paid, on average, $269 in annual dues just for the compensation of five union executives.\n\nLast year WGA East spent more money on union overhead and administration than on member representation. The union spent $1.57 million on representational activities, $1.65 million on overhead and $1.58 million on administration.\n\nWGA East overhead spending included an average of more than $60,000 a month in rent and utility costs for the union\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. This doesn\u2019t appear to be a concern for Gawker Media staff encouraging coworkers to vote in favor of unionizing.\n\nGawker Media editor Tommy Craggs declined to comment on WGA East compensation and overhead spending when contacted by Watchdog via email.\n\nInstead, Craggs replied to Watchdog\u2019s inquiry by citing payroll figures from a financial disclosure for Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, the publisher of Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cBy the way, if you have any concerns about your compensation levels relative to those of your bosses at the Franklin Center for etc. etc., we\u2019d be happy to put you in touch with an organizer at the Writers Guild of America, East,\u201d Craggs wrote.\n\nFranklin Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and is not, unlike WGA East, funded with union dues taken from workers\u2019 paychecks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gawker Media staff may soon start chipping in for $300,000 union boss salaries in the name of \"solidarity.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Gawker Media staff may soon start chipping in for $300,000 union boss salaries in the name of \"solidarity.\"", "title": "Do Gawker writers want to help pay union bosses $300,000? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/RichardTrumka-AFL-CIO.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T08:10:09+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/221917/gawker-union-boss/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Gawker Media staff may soon start chipping in for $300,000 union boss salaries in the name of \"solidarity.\"", "title": "Do Gawker writers want to help pay union bosses $300,000? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/RichardTrumka-AFL-CIO.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-06-02T04:00:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T08:10:09+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "lowell peterson, gawker media, tommy craggs, wga east, writers guild of america, nick denton, hamilton nolan"}, "article_summary": "The union paid assistant executive directors Ruth Gallo and Marsha Seeman $191,985 and $170,018, respectively, and paid senior counsel Ann Burdick $169,950.\nWGA East overhead spending included an average of more than $60,000 a month in rent and utility costs for the union\u2019s Manhattan headquarters.\nLast year WGA East spent more money on union overhead and administration than on member representation.\nFranklin Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and is not, unlike WGA East, funded with union dues taken from workers\u2019 paychecks.\nHamilton Nolan, the Gawker writer leading the unionization drive, hopes Gawker Media CEO Nick Denton\u2019s decision not to fight the WGA East vote will serve as a model for other online media companies."}
