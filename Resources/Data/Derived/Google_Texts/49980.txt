WASHINGTON -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is not backing away from a conspiracy theory he recently floated about the Obama administration somehow coordinating the surge of immigrants coming over the border for some unknown reason.

Perry recently suggested on Fox News that the Obama administration might be "in on this somehow" and helping move immigrants over the border. Asked about that statement on Sunday, Perry didn't back away.

"I have to believe that when you do not respond in any way, that you are either inept, or you have some ulterior motive of which you are functioning from," Perry said on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday.

Perry didn't elaborate on what that "ulterior motive" might be or how the Obama administration would be politically helped by more immigrants coming over the border. Perry also said he wanted the Federal Aviation Administration to allow for drones to be used on the border.
