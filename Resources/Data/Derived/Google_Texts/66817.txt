CHE Trinity Health, a multi-institutional Catholic healthcare delivery system, announced Thursday it will partner with a leading health and wellness engagement platform provider to give consumers and patients a personalized local engagement platform across the 20 states that have organizations within the health system. In addition to engaging consumers in wellness with information and digital content, the health systems will also have avenues for patient acquisition and online physician profiles. The platform will allow the health system to "connect people with their health and wellness in their daily lives," said Scott Nordlund, executive vice president for growth, strategy and innovation development for the system.

The platform will allow consumers to create a central health profile and gain personalized access to health risk assessments, individualized programs for weight loss, smoking cessation, stress management and diabetes prevention. In addition, consumers will have access to tools to locate a CHE Trinity Health physician, schedule an appointment and communicate with the physician.

Nordlund told FierceHealthcare after the announcement that the system's strategic plan is to be people-centered, which means offering a high-quality, efficient traditional episodic, acute care model as well as managing patient populations and contributing to its communities' health and well being. "We want to manage their health even if they aren't coming to our facility," he said. Announcement
