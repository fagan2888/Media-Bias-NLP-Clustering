Yet what will remain when the applause fades is the experience of crafting, with the guidance of Visiting Assistant Professor Paulo Gomes, an answer to a vexing problem: How can a traditional healthcare facility leverage excellent patient care as a competitive advantage?\n\n\u201cIt was a great team effort working with fellow students and our faculty advisor,\u201d said Maureen Lillis, who lead the team.\n\nThe Student Case Competition, put on by the South Florida forum, a chapter of the American College of Healthcare Executives, is an annual event where teams are invited to craft a solution to a particular healthcare issue. Barry University, Florida Atlantic University and FIU fielded teams this year. The presentations and judging were held April 9 at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale. Along with Lillis, the winning team included Annette Alexis, Germa Clarke, Julia Martinez and Orlando Soto.\n\nGomes\u2019 input was key, said Lillis, a registered nurse and senior executive with a managed care plan. \u201cHe challenged us to go back and look at the mission [of the organization],\u201d she said. The team pursued an analytical approach, Lillis noted, delving deeply into the data: \u201cIt was a perfect use of what we were learning in school.\u201d\n\nAiding the group were mentors from Cleveland Clinic Florida: CFO Keith Nilsson and Finance Director Joanna Dutton.\n\nThe case study involved a real North Carolina healthcare center with excellent patient care that wanted to help control revenue by providing health insurance, or partnering with an insurer. While the case and data were archival, the students applied current and emerging healthcare funding models to the problem, including those under evaluation by Medicare and Affordable Care Act regulators and participants.\n\nMaking the most of what is best.\n\nThe FIU team offered four alternatives. The one that made the most sense for the center is called \u201cvalue-based purchasing\u201d where the funding entity provides a financial incentive for good patient outcomes. This let the health center \u201cstick to its knitting,\u201d as Lillis put it, by focusing on what it does best \u2014 patient care \u2014 while partnering with an insurer. Federal agencies and the private sector are scrutinizing the method as a way to make the most of healthcare dollars.\n\nGomes, who teaches technology operations management in the HCMBA program, said he wanted students to focus on the health center\u2019s vision, administrative abilities and viability from an operational and financial viewpoint.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure this is something that can be implemented \u2014 they have the financial resources to do it and get an adequate payback,\u201d Gomes said.\n\nGomes noted that he learned as much from the students, who have various backgrounds in healthcare and related sectors, as they did from him.\n\n\u201cThey know the industry in great detail,\u201d he said.\n\nThat seemed to be the secret sauce in the winning entry.\n\n\u201cI think it shows the students have the ability to analyze a problem and figure out a solution in the real world,\u201d said Mercedes Bradley, director of Health Management Programs at the FIU Chapman Graduate School of Business. \u201cInstead of just having an idea, they were able to put those ideas into a solution that was financially feasible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Left to right: Annette Alexis, Germa Clarke, Orlando Soto, Maureen Lillis and Julia Martinez\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinning first place in the prestigious South", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.3.9", "og": {"url": "https://news.fiu.edu/2016/05/fiu-hcmba-team-takes-top-honors-in-south-florida-healthcare-challenge/100219", "site_name": "FIU News", "image": "http://news.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/FIUNews-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "FIU HCMBA team takes top honors in South Florida healthcare challenge"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": "floridainternational"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Winning first place in the prestigious South Florida Healthcare Executive Forum\u2019s case challenge was a thrill for the five FIU Healthcare MBA students on the victorious team.\nThe FIU team offered four alternatives.\n\u201cIt was a great team effort working with fellow students and our faculty advisor,\u201d said Maureen Lillis, who lead the team.\nAlong with Lillis, the winning team included Annette Alexis, Germa Clarke, Julia Martinez and Orlando Soto.\nBarry University, Florida Atlantic University and FIU fielded teams this year."}
