Texas Democrat and Obamacare supporter Rep. Gene Green is openly admitting that Obamacare has doubled his family’s health insurance cost.

During a House Rules Committee hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Green revealed in an exchange with House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions that purchasing health coverage on an Obamacare exchange has doubled both his health insurance premiums and his deductible. (RELATED: Obamacare Pledge To Lower Costs Abandoned)

“I’m not going to ask you about your coverage, but I’m on Obamacare,” Rep. Sessions began.

“I am too,” Rep. Green interjected. “I have an exchange company here in the D.C. that we had to make sure they could cover our doctors in Houston and our hospitals in Houston.”

Rep. Sessions went on to note that when he moved to Obamacare exchange coverage, his health insurance plan became twice as expensive and his deductible doubled as well.

“That’s my experience also,” Rep. Green agreed.

“So your insurance doubled under Obamacare and your deductible doubled?”

“That’s true,” Rep. Green confirmed.

Green supports Obamacare and strongly opposed a GOP bill that would issue several fixes to Obamacare, which the Rules Committee considered Tuesday, saying it would “put insurance companies back in the driver’s seat.” (RELATED: WH Says It’ll Veto GOP Obamacare Bill That Would Make Obama’s ‘Administrative Fix’ Law)
