Her skin, according to [family attorney Christopher] Dolan, remains warm and soft.\n\n\n\nIn addition to quoting the family's attorney, the story quotes various experts. The sources seem to have been chosen with care, and the reporter has made a good effort to provide balance. All in all, it's a fine report, save for this factoid that dangles in the air like an unanswered question -- or, to put it in GetReligion terms, a religion ghost:\n\nSince January, Jahi has been in New Jersey, where a state law allows families to reject a brain-death diagnosis on religious grounds. But the family says they want to bring her home to her native Oakland.\n\nWhat, pray tell, are these \"religious grounds\"? The Mercury News gives no indication, and they're not alone. Reuters used the same vague language when covering the story. Why are journalists omitting giving specific information about the family's faith, when their faith is the very reason they're rejecting Jahi's brain-death diagnosis?\n\nThis media avoidance of the religion angle in the McMath case is not new. Tamie Ross observed in this space last January that, despite the family's using social media to request prayers for their daughter and express their hopes for a miracle, no news outlet offered information as to where the family worshiped.\n\nCould it be that the McMath family really only has some vague, generalized, nonspecific religion?\n\nNo -- at least, not according to The New York Times, whose San Francisco bureau chief, Norimitsu Onishi, appears to be the only reporter during the whole 11-month case to have asked Jahi's mother specifics about her faith. Onishi paid due attention to the religion angle when covering the story back in January, providing the needed depth missing from the rest of the media's reports:\n\nNailah Winkfield, the girl\u2019s mother, said she was hopeful that Friday\u2019s agreement would facilitate her daughter\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cI believe in God, and I believe that if he wanted her dead, he would have taken her already,\u201d Ms. Winkfield, a Baptist, said by phone. \u201cHer heart is beating, her blood is flowing. She moves when I go near her and talk to her. That\u2019s not a dead person.\u201d\n\nJahi was admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital last month, and underwent three surgical procedures that included removing her tonsils and adenoids. She subsequently \u201csuffered serious complications\u201d that resulted in her death, according to court documents submitted by the hospital. The family\u2019s lawyer said in a court filing that Jahi suffered \u201clarge blood loss and, as a result, she suffered a heart attack and a loss of oxygen to her brain.\u201d\n\nThe hospital determined two days later that the girl was legally dead, and later sought to remove the ventilator. The family objected, asserting that the heartbeat was proof that she remained alive. In a document filed in Federal Court, the family\u2019s lawyer stated that the girl\u2019s parents are \u201cChristians with firm religious beliefs that as long as the heart is beating, Jahi is alive.\u201d\n\nGot that, media folk? Jahi's mother's Baptist faith -- and her understanding of what it requires -- forms the foundation of her religious grounds for fighting to keep her daughter on life support. It also tells us something about her faith in the power of prayer, which comes through in a recent post she made on Facebook:\n\nThank you all for your donations, kind words of encouragement and PRAYER. Please keep praying for Jahi that is the most important thing you could ever give her. I believe more than anything it is the positive thoughts and faithful prayers that have been keeping her going. We will pray for you all as well, thank you.\n\nImage via Keep Jahi McMath on Life Support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jahi McMath -- the teenage girl from California whose family is fighting to \r\nkeep her alive against a hospital's brain-death diagnosis -- is back in the \r\nheadlines. \u00a0Yet, even as Jahi's family says she is showing new signs of \r\nbrain activity, \u00a0there is little sign that mainstream journalists feel the \r\nneed to exercise their brains when describing the family's faith.
