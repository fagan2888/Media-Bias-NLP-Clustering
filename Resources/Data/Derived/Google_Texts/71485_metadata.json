Arizona\u2019s House members followed suit, with all five Republicans in favor and all four Democrats opposed.\n\nRep. Matt Salmon, R-Mesa, said in a prepared statement that the House was using \u201cthe power of the purse \u2026 to rein in an executive who has clearly demonstrated his unwillingness to acquiesce to the will of the people.\u201d\n\nIn remarks on the floor of the House, Salmon, who sponsored one of several GOP amendments to the bill, called Obama\u2019s action the \u201cunconstitutional and illegal executive order of last year.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats called Wednesday\u2019s vote little more than political theater: The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, they said, and the president has vowed to veto it if it reaches his desk.\n\n\u201cThis is a way for them to be able to pound their chest to their constituents and say, \u2018See how mean we are,\u2019 and \u2018See how fierce we were,\u2019\u201d said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Phoenix, after Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe bill would do more than block the president\u2019s November actions \u2013 it would also reverse the administration\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That program, which defers deportation of immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children, has allowed 600,000 people to come forward, pass background checks and get authorized to work and pay taxes, said White House Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Munoz.\n\nGallego said that reversing DACA now is \u201cgoing to push people back into the shadows and that\u2019s not something we need.\u201d\n\nObama announced the latest actions just after November\u2019s elections. His orders would expand eligibility for DACA, include parents of DACA immigrants in the deferrals, increase the number of border patrol agents, streamline the visa process and focus deportation efforts on \u201cfelons, not families.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s orders followed months of congressional inaction on comprehensive immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan measure \u2013 co-sponsored by Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, among others \u2013 in June 2013, but the measure never came up for a vote in the House.\n\nMunoz said in a conference call Wednesday that the president believed he was \u201cwell within his legal authority\u201d to take the actions he did in November, and she said he would veto the House legislation blocking his actions should the bill reach his desk.\n\nMunoz said \u201cthe priority is to fund the department\u201d with a clean bill. That was echoed by Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Tucson, who said Republicans were holding the department\u2019s budget hostage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd and irresponsible to hold this budget hostage, and to once again threaten a partial government shutdown,\u201d Grijalva said in a statement released by his office. \u201cThese funds are intended to keep Americans safe \u2013 not serve the ideological agendas of politicians with axes to grind.\u201d\n\nBut McCain applauded the House vote, saying in a prepared statement that \u201cCongress has a responsibility to respond and push back on his illegal power-grab. Immigration is clearly an issue that must be debated and decided by the representatives of the people, not by executive fiat.\u201d\n\nSalmon\u2019s amendment to the Homeland Security bill focused on another popular GOP target \u2013 the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nHis amendment said that immigrants enrolled in DACA are exempt from requirements of Obamacare, and businesses may choose to hire immigrants over citizens to avoid paying for workers\u2019 insurance. The amendment says the executive branch \u201cshould refrain from pursuing policies\u201d such as DACA \u201cthat disadvantage the hiring of United States Citizens and those in a lawful immigration status in the United States.\u201d\n\nSalmon said on the floor that his amendment \u2013 which was approved 253-171, also along mostly partisan lines \u2013 and others are \u201cprotecting the American worker.\u201d\n\nGallego disagreed.\n\n\u201cThis is, again, just more gamesmanship and just playing political games by the Republican Party,\u201d Gallego said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/09/11-ISIS-salmon-front.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona\u2019s delegation split down party lines Wednesday on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security while stripping funding for President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.
