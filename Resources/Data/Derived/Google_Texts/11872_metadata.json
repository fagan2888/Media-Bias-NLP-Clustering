However, their voice is falling on deaf ears in the state\u2019s Republican-led legislature.\n\nRepublican State Representative Nate Walker, of Kirksville, says that to expand Medicaid without any reform will not happen.\n\n\u201cThe leadership in both the house and senate has said the Medicaid expansion is not a priority,\u201d Walker said.\n\nRyan Silvey is a Republican senator from Clay County.\n\n\u201cThe way that Obamacare proposes to solve the problem is just throw everyone on Medicaid,\u201d Silvey said. \u201cFinancially unsustainable there\u2019s no way the state can afford to do that moving forward.\u201d\n\nSen. Silvey has created legislation that will expand Medicaid for veterans and their families up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. A second bill would convert MO HealthNet, a division under the Missouri Department of Social Services that administers Medicaid, to a block grant system.\n\nBlocks grants were created in 1966 as a means to provide services while reducing federal obligations by limiting the amount of federal dollars entering the state. Furthermore, there\u2019s no provision to increase the federal allotment of the block grants during natural disasters, an economic downturn or pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people saying it\u2019s a great deal, the feds pay so much and the state only has to pay a little bit,\u201d Silvey said. \u201cThe 10 percent the state has to pay is still $200 million of general revenue. So regardless of what the percentage is, we don\u2019t have an extra couple hundred million dollars lying around with nothing to obligate it too.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the Missouri Budget Project, expanding Medicaid will save the state $81 million the first year and more than $100 million annually thereafter.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Kentucky approved expansion of its Medicaid rolls in accordance with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2013. Gov. Steve Beshear ordered the expansion by executive decision and Circuit Judge Philip Shepherd later upheld the order.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Deloitte Consulting LLC and the University of Louisville\u2019s Urban Studies Institute, reality was better than projected. In 2014, 375,000 Kentuckians received healthcare access under the Medicaid expansion, 12,000 jobs were created, there was more than $1 billion in new revenue to health care providers, a 55 percent reduction in uncompensated care, and more than a $500 million offset in general fund savings. Medicaid expansion is projected to add 40,000 jobs and $30 billion to the Kentucky economy through 2021.\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin said he will overturn the Medicaid expansion in Kentucky if elected in 2015. The other gubernatorial candidates, James Comer, Hal Heiner and Will Scott said they will eliminate the state run marketplace; eliminating subsidized health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn March 11th Gov. Jay Nixon spoke at the Springfield Career Center advocating for Medicaid expansion with reforms based upon four principals. They include protecting taxpayers, rewarding work, helping small business and promoting personal responsibility. He also believes Medicaid recipients should contribute to health care costs via co-pays and cost sharing.\n\nCurrently Missouri adults with no children don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, and a mother with two children must make no more than $10 a day to qualify. Some advocates of the Medicaid expansion believe it\u2019s a moral obligation.\n\n\u201cI think that we all need to realize that people need people,\u201d Loux said. \u201cRich or poor, atheist or Christian, we all need each other.\u201d\n\nThe two remaining organizations that oppose Medicaid expansion in Missouri are the Republican Party\n\nand the Missouri Century Foundation, a fiscally conservative 501(c)(4).\n\nSilvey\u2019s legislation was referred to the Veterans\u2019 Affairs and Health Committee. However, it is unlikely that Medicaid will be expanded this legislative session.\n\nDemocratic State Senator Paul LeVota offered an amendment to Senate Bill 210 on Tuesday to expand Medicaid to Missourians with incomes at or below138 percent of the federal poverty level. The amendment failed on a party line vote.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Five years following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, roughly 300,000 Missourians still don\u2019t have proper access to health care. \u201cIn my current", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ksmu.org/post/covering-gap-uphill-battle-medicaid-expansion-missouri", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ksmumain/files/styles/medium/public/201504/DSC_0006_0.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Five years following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, roughly 300,000 Missourians still don\u2019t have proper access to health care. \u201cIn my current", "title": "Covering the Gap: The Uphill Battle for Medicaid Expansion in Missouri"}, "story_id": 397294913, "twitter": {"site": "@ksmu", "card": "summary", "creator": "@sfines"}, "author": "Steve Fines", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Covering the Gap: The Uphill Battle for Medicaid Expansion in Missouri"}, "nid": 23253, "datePublished": "2015-04-03", "keywords": "Medicaid Expansion, Ryan Silvey, Nate Walker, Rep.
