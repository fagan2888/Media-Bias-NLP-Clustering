Unpopularity is perhaps the only thing Obama can\u2019t claim to have inherited from his predecessor. No, he\u2019s earned this all by himself (via Dan Doherty).\n\nIn January 2009, as President George W. Bush was days away from leaving the White House, the unpopular President\u2019s favorable rating stood at 35% in a CNN/ORC International survey. The man who was succeeding him, Barack Obama, was fresh from his historic 2008 presidential election victory and had a 78% favorable rating among Americans. But a new CNN/ORC International pollreleased Thursday indicates a milestone of sorts: Obama is now as unpopular as Bush. Fifty-one percent have an unfavorable view of Bush; 51% feel the same way about Obama. Obama\u2019s favorable rating is now at 47% \u2013 a new low for him, and virtually identical to Bush\u2019s 46% favorable rating, a significant improvement over his 2009 numbers\u2026\u201dThis marks the first time in a CNN poll that a majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Obama,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \u201cAnd, at 51%, his unfavorable his higher than his favorables for the first time as well.\u201d As for Bush, his numbers have gradually edged up over the years since he left the White House, and is now on par with Obama.\n\nThe CNN survey also confirmed Gallup\u2019s numbers on Hillary Clinton, which Ed wrote up yesterday:\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s favorable ratings have steadily dropped since she left the State Department, from 67% in March of 2013 to 59% last fall, 57% in March of this year, and now 55%\u2026\u201cSecretary of State is often seen as a non-political, non-partisan kind of job, and that showed in Clinton\u2019s favorable ratings while she ran the State Department,\u201d Holland said. \u201cIn 2011, her favorable rating was as high as 47% among Republicans. Now that she seems to be running for office again, her favorables among Republicans have plummeted to 18%.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Fox News poll out this week shows continued sharp disapproval of President Obama\u2019s signature domestic \u201caccomplishment,\u201d with a sizable majority expressing the opinion that they wish the 2010 healthcare law had never passed. (Some vulnerable Democrats may privately agree, based on their panicked reaction to voting on Obamacare-related amendments):\n\nBloomberg\u2019s latest national survey reflects an electorate resigned to economic stagnation, at best. Just three in ten believe the overall economy is improving, with large majorities recognizing negative trends on the national debt and health costs:\n\nThe same poll showed that \u201cfifty-eight percent of poll respondents they\u2019re unhappy with Obama\u2019s handling of the health-care issue.\u201d On foreign affairs, respondents say the US is \u201cin decline,\u201d as opposed to \u201con the rise\u201d by a six-to-one margin. Kudos, all around.\n\nWe\u2019ll only print this if enough people vote for it \u2013 add your name: http://t.co/M55LY7QXnl pic.twitter.com/okRaRk8rPk \u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) May 23, 2014\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Like a boss.", "title": "CNN poll: Obama now as unpopular as Bush", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/12/cnn-poll-obama-now-as-unpopular-as-bush/", "image": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5072/14427693293_987c973773.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, George W.
