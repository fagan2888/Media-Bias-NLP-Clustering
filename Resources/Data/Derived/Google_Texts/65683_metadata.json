Their return, like their disappearance, is a bit of a mystery. But it\u2019s welcome.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s 30, 40 \u2014 one day we counted 51. That\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen at Folly Beach since, I don\u2019t know when,\u201d said Marty Morganello of the Surfrider Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s been, in fact, 10 years since large numbers of pelicans abandoned their nesting ground on Bird Key Stono, the sand bank at the mouth of Stono River between the island and Kiawah Island. But they\u2019re back.\n\nBeachgoers had been so accustomed to the seemingly endless streams of pelicans that they were nicknamed \u201cThe Folly Beach Air Force.\u201d Then, abruptly, the numbers fell to only a few at a time.\n\nNow they have returned in force, along with royal and sandwich terns.\n\nLast year there were more than 200 pelican nests on Bird Key; this year there might be twice as many, said Janet Thibault, wildlife biologist with the S.C. Department of Natural Resources.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a periodic, if sometimes puzzling, shift among nesting islands by shorebirds and a big reason why a half-dozen or so of the banks are preserved and protected along the length of the coast by state or federal managers, most closed to the public during nesting season.\n\nThe birds flock to the slivers of uninhabited, isolated sand where they, their eggs and offspring are more protected from predators and disturbances that include raptors, ticks, raccoons, dogs and man.\n\nThe problem is, the tiny islands erode, the high ground gets overwashed or the inlet dynamics change drastically enough to allow predators to close in. Even bobcats have swum to some islands, said Nathan Dias of Cape Romain Bird Observatory.\n\n\u201cThat is just the name of the game for coastal beach nesting species,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nThe return of pelican nesting to Bird Key is reassuring because of fears that it would be lost after a groin was built in 2013 to protect renourished sand at the Charleston County park on the Stono edge of Folly. Groins stop the sand flow down the surf line, and conservationists worried that Bird Key would be robbed of the needed supply.\n\nBut by 2014 it was clear that wasn\u2019t happening. Sand, in fact, was building up.\n\n\u201cThis time of year every inch of Bird Key Stono is being used by multiple coastal species such as American oystercatchers, tri-colored herons, glossy ibis, snowy egrets, as well as royal and sandwich terns and brown pelicans,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nWhat exactly chased away the pelicans is hard to tell.\n\n\u201cThere are threats that we often can\u2019t perceive,\u201d said Felciia Sanders, DNR wildlife biologist. But they and other shorebirds that are a signature of the Lowcountry coast, returned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just pelicans,\u201d Morganello said. \u201cYou see a constant stream of terns flying.\u201d\n\nReach Bo Petersen at 937-5744, @bopete on twitter or Bo Petersen Reporting on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Folly gets its big beaks back, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Bird Key Stono,Critters,environment,Folly Beach,Lowcountry,pelicans,terns", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "FOLLY BEACH \u2014 The \u201cair force\u201d is overhead again, long lines of pelicans gliding by, like the Edge of America used to see.
