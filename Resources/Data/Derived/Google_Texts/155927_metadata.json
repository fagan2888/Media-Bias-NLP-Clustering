Along with March, it ranks as baseball\u2019s most deceiving month. Matchups are mishmashes of aspiring prospects, veterans and a battery of players who will never see the big leagues again.\n\nThere was a moment Friday that created multiple blinks, an astonishing feat that sparked a five-run rally in the Rockies\u2019 7-5 win at Chase Field.\n\nRockies outfielder Corey Dickerson hit a pitch that bounced. Not just a short hop. Will Harris\u2019 slider hit 3 feet in front of the plate, and the rookie swatted it into the right-field corner for a double. By itself it was remarkable, the kind of bat flick reserved for Vladimir Guerrero or Ichiro.\n\nThat the trick mattered made it mean a little more. Dickerson scored, helping shove the Rockies to only their seventh road victory in 22 games since the all-star break.\n\nColorado flipped the script, watching the opposition\u2019s bullpen dissolve for a refreshing change. Troy Tulowitzki belted out three hits, and plated a run in the decisive seventh. And Wilin Rosario tied his career high with four RBIs, giving him 78 on the season.\n\nThe Rockies were in position to win because their own wobbly relief corps regained its balance. With the outcome in doubt after Adam Ottavino\u2019s game-tying wild pitch, Josh Outman made a big pitch.\n\nWild and ineffective of late, Outman ran the count to 2-2 before getting a lazy popup from left-handed hitter Eric Chavez for the final out in the sixth.\n\nIt was a tough outing for starter Tyler Chatwood, who didn\u2019t make it through the fifth inning.\n\nHe gave up seven hits and six walks in 4 \u2154 innings, yet allowed only two earned runs.\n\nArizona starter Brandon McCarthy also struggled, allowing 11 hits in his six innings of work. Yet he also only allowed two earned runs.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez\u2019s injury has provided a stage for Dickerson. He has made a solid impression. Whether he is in the mix to start next season depends on several scenarios, but his speed and bat make him an effective weapon. He delivered three hits.\n\nOne will be remembered. Regardless if it came in September.\n\nCarGo could be done for season. Manager Walt Weiss conceded that Carlos Gonzalez might not hit again this season.\n\nThe all-star hasn\u2019t homered since July 20, his power and swing undermined by a painful and annoying sprained right middle finger.\n\nGonzalez has been reduced to an overqualified defensive replacement since returning from the disabled list earlier this month.\n\nHe has visited multiple specialists who have confirmed the sprained ligament in his right middle finger.\n\nSurgery is not a consideration at this point because there is no fracture involved. It\u2019s likely CarGo will see another hand specialist at season\u2019s end or if and when he\u2019s shut down.\n\nFootnotes. Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s Monday start might be pushed back after his left thumb didn\u2019t respond well to a side session Friday. He underwent an MRI on the thumb, revealing a sprain. He admitted that his thumb is more sore than it has been in weeks. He\u2019s scheduled to face the Cardinals at Coors Field \u2026 Center fielder Dexter Fowler (knee) is expected to start a game in this series, possibly Saturday. \u2026 Drew Pomeranz (biceps tendinitis, forearm tightness) threw a two-inning, 30-pitch simulated game Friday, showing good arm action and mechanics. Weiss said it\u2019s possible that Pomeranz will pitch in a game this month, and it could be as a starter or a reliever.\n\nTroy E. Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or twitter.com/troyrenck\n\nLooking ahead: Colorado at Arizona\n\nRockies\u2019 Roy Oswalt (0-5, 8.57 ERA) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Wade Miley (9-10, 3.73), 5:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nThis isn\u2019t what Roy Oswalt had in mind when he signed with the Rockies in May and reported to Scottsdale, Ariz., to build arm strength. The former ace right-hander has appeared in five games for the team. The Rockies have lost all five. Oswalt, after relieving Chad Bettis last weekend, makes his first start since pulling his left hamstring while covering the plate on a wild pitch against the Diamondbacks on July 7. Oswalt is interested in returning to the Rockies, but how he performs this month could go a long way in determining the team\u2019s interest. Troy E.
