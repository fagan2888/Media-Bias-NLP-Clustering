In New Jersey, Republican incumbent Chris Christie is considered a solid favorite.\n\nCuccinelli, the state's attorney general, stressed problems with the health care rollout during a conference call with reporters ahead of Obama's remarks. He cited an inoperable website and complaints about canceled policies, despite Obama's past promise that people could keep their insurance if they want.\n\n\"He lied when he said you can keep your doctor,\" Cuccinelli said. \"I've heard from job creators and health care providers about the negative impact Obamacare is already having across our economy.\"\n\nCuccinelli also said that the \"stunning failure of HealthCare.gov\" should not hide that \"the law itself is broken.\"\n\nHis younger brother \u2014 Kevin Cuccinelli, a family doctor in Colorado \u2014 led a protest of the Obama appearance outside of the Arlington high school. Among the chants: \"Hey, hey, ho ho, Obamacare has to got to go.\"\n\nObama referenced the health care plan only in passing at the McAuliffe rally, saying at one point that health costs are slowing.\n\nA year after his own re-election, Obama \u2014 also under fire for the Oct. 1 shutdown and government surveillance policies \u2014 has seen his approval ratings fall. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week said only 42% approved of Obama's performance, his lowest number in that survey.\n\nIt was Obama's second candidate campaign rally in this political off-year. He spoke June 12 for then-candidate Ed Markey, who won a special election for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts.\n\nIn Arlington, about 100-150 people stood across the street from the high school's entrance, many carrying signs such as \"liberal women wake up\" and \"McAuliffe and Obama liars.\"\n\nSteve Richardson, a McAuliffe supporter waiting to get inside the rally, called the protest \"desperate.\"\n\n\"McAuliffe has clearly taken the lead and is holding on,\" said Richardson, who is self-employed and lives in Arlington. \"They're trying to do a few Hail Mary passes.\"\n\nRichardson said he is supporting McAuliffe because \"he's got the values I have. He supports gay rights and women's rights. He's in tune with the state.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1hbv0bk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Facing criticism over his health care plan as well as lower approval ratings, President Obama returned Sunday to the friendly confines of the campaign trail.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Facing criticism over his health care plan as well as lower approval ratings, President Obama returned Sunday to the friendly confines of the campaign trail.", "title": "Obama at home on campaign trail for McAuliffe", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/11/03/obama-virginia-campaign-terry-mcauliffe-ken-cuccinelli/3412767/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Facing criticism over his health care plan as well as lower approval ratings, President Obama returned Sunday to the friendly confines of the campaign trail.", "title": "Obama at home on campaign trail for McAuliffe", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a69188bb4de670ddd513236030130e5fc781b9a7/c=414-0-2580-2166&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/76a39ebe52a101c7607ebb8b64ad3bbce6026b84/c=684-0-2310-2160/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f8db28cfa788b7168fc344aad5af3a4e3314f54/c=414-0-2580-2166/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5b6ff9cc5ab26972d140bee6f17d299e7314ad7/c=60-0-2940-2160/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f95f0be722af6bfbd238510b9472d59ead51521/c=0-6-3000-1698&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-11-03T18:23:46-05:00", "shorthed": "Obama campaigns for McAuliffe in Virginia", "articleid": 3412767, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8e0c0ead9ab88a8cf2a022a37d38b25890e956d/c=0-6-3000-1698/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6a7856f7dbb4382b7e3cfbcbf5c674a2ee28b3e8/c=894-0-2106-2160/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/03/1383508471000-AFP-524318903-001.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Obama at home on campaign trail for McAuliffe", "pageclass": "article", "author": "David Jackson and Catalina Camia"}, "news_keywords": "Cuccinelli, Virginia, governor, election, McAuliffe"}, "article_summary": "Obama, McAuliffe and other Democratic speakers sought to link Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli to the recent federal government shutdown, while Cuccinelli and Republicans hammered Obama and McAuliffe over problems with the president's health care law.\nObama referenced the health care plan only in passing at the McAuliffe rally, saying at one point that health costs are slowing.\nPresident Obama and Terry McAuliffe (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights Terry McAuliffe squares off against Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia's gubernatorial electionObama attacks Republicans over last month's federal government shutdownGOP criticizes Obama and McAuliffe over rollout of the new health care lawARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Facing criticism over his health care plan as well as lower approval ratings, President Obama returned Sunday to the friendly confines of the campaign trail.\n\"I've heard from job creators and health care providers about the negative impact Obamacare is already having across our economy.\"\nObama told a boisterous crowd of more than 1,500 who gathered in a high school gym on behalf of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe."}
