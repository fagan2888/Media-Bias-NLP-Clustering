To help you make sense of it all, Frank Lalli, former editor of Money magazine and author of an upcoming book on finding affordable healthcare, will answer questions through the month of October in his daily blog.\n\nQ: Where can I check out Obamacare insurance, and how can I decide which plan might be right for me?\n\nA: The government has set up new insurance marketplaces\u2014called public exchanges\u2014in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. And all of them are scheduled to begin enrolling people in Obamacare health insurance today for 2014.\n\nThese exchanges, staffed by counselors called Navigators, are making it easier than ever for uninsured people and those who buy health insurance on their own to shop for the right health plan.\n\nThe first thing to realize is that all the plans sold on the new exchanges offer the law\u2019s full set of essential health benefits, from maternity to mental health counseling and more. So, with one exception I\u2019ll explain later, whichever health plan you choose, you\u2019ll be getting comprehensive insurance that includes a range of preventive care services at no extra cost.\n\nSecond, the plans are rated side-by-side for easy comparison on the online exchange according to what Consumer Union\u2019s Lynn Quincy calls the plan\u2019s \u201crelative generosity.\u201d That\u2019s a fancy way of saying how much the plan figures to pay out to cover your actual medical costs, beyond what Lallyou shell out to cover your monthly premiums and annual deductible.\n\nSo it\u2019s pretty simple to compare plans with the same \u201cgenerosity\u201d level, based on factors such as what you would pay in premiums, specific co-pays, and the plans\u2019 different doctor networks.\n\nAlso called the metal ratings, these \u201cgenerosity\u201d levels range from platinum plans, which figure to pay for around 90 percent of your approved medical expenses, to gold at 80 percent, silver 70 and bronze 60. Those are all decent plans, in my opinion.\n\nBut the government also is allowing people under 30 to buy cheaper, bare-bones catastrophic plans that figure to payslightly less than 60 percent on average. Young people buying those catastrophic plans will essentially be betting they won\u2019t get hurt or sick. That\u2019s not real insurance to me. Plus those plans will only be a few bucks cheaper a month than bronze, and the buyser will not be eligible for government subsidies.\n\nAll in all, the government expects many middle-class people to settle on sensible silver plans, covering around 70 percent of out of pocket costs.\n\nAs you shop, focus on the metal ratings, rather than premiums alone. Since the metal names reflect how much the insurer will pay on average to help cover your medical bills. (The premium is the amount you pay each month for coverage. The deductible is what you must pay for medical services before the insurer begins paying.)\n\nIn general, the higher the metal value, the higher the monthly premium\u2014but the less you are likely to have to pay out of your pocket if you need medical care, prescriptions or, worse, costly hospitalization.\n\nThe lower the metal value, the lower the premium\u2014but the more you\u2019ll have to pay to cover your health bills. A lower premium may seem attractive. But keep in mind that these days, if your health insurer doesn\u2019t have your back, you can get hit with an emergency room bill topping $15,000 for a sprained ankle.\n\nHealth insurance is supposed to protect you from a catastrophic illness that could ruin your finances. Yet people often don\u2019t protect themselves. Some 650,000 people will file for bankruptcy next year because of medicals bills. Don\u2019t risk being one of them.\n\nAsk your Navigator to walk you through some worse case scenarios, and then calculate your likely total health costs, including premiums, deductibles\u2014and with some bad luck\u2014your maximum out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nNever pick a plan only because the premiums are low. Pick the plan you can afford that offers you and your loved ones the protection you need.
