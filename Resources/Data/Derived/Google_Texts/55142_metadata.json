(The Washington Post)\n\nThe Fix\u2019s Chris Cillizza breaks down how close the battle for the Senate really is. (The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Ted Cruz spent the final weekend of the midterms on the far edge of the country trying to help fellow Republican Dan Sullivan win a race the GOP is counting on in its effort to retake the Senate.\n\nIt\u2019s a team-player role the tea party firebrand from Texas has filled a handful of times this fall \u2014 but one he plans to abandon if Republicans win control of both congressional chambers.\n\nIn an interview at the Hotel Captain Cook here between campaign stops for Sullivan, Cruz made it clear he would push hard for a Republican-led Senate to be as conservative and confron\u00adtational as the Republican-led House.\n\nPiggybacking on what House leaders have done, Cruz said the first order of business should be a series of hearings on President Obama, \u201clooking at the abuse of power, the executive abuse, the regulatory abuse, the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this administration.\u201d\n\n(Live coverage: On the campaign trail)\n\n1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 New faces to Washington?

Caption An eclectic group is coming to Congress \u2014 or moving across the Capitol from the House to the Senate. Here are a few. Mia Love \u2014 Utah Love, a former small-town Utah mayor and fitness instructor from Brooklyn, became the nation\u2019s first black, female, Republican member of Congress. She lost a House race in 2012 to incumbent Democrat Jim Matheson, who is retiring. Rick Bowmer/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nCruz also would like the Senate to be as aggressive in trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act as the House, which has voted more than 50 times to get rid of the law.\n\nRepublicans should \u201cpursue every means possible to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said, including forcing a vote through parliamentary procedures that would get around a possible filibuster by Democrats. If that leads to a veto by Obama, Cruz said, Republicans should then vote on provisions of the health law \u201cone at a time.\u201d\n\nAnd when asked whether he would back Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky for Republican leader, Cruz would not pledge his support \u2014 an indication that there are limits to how much of a partner he\u2019s willing to be.\n\nAt the heart of Cruz\u2019s shift from the insular approach that defined his first year in office is a belief that he can use his popularity with conservatives to expand his influence in the Senate and improve his standing as he considers a 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nCruz\u2019s desire to turn his party further right in the coming months is one of the challenges already facing McConnell should Republicans regain the Senate, with tea party leaders inside and outside the Capitol spoiling for a number of hard-line moves.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz has been rather quiet over the past few months,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for Trent Lott when the Mississippian was the Senate Republican leader. \u201cThat time seems to be coming to an end. I understand why he\u2019s eager to go after Obamacare. But the reality is that it\u2019ll take 60 votes to repeal it and Republicans will have nowhere near that amount. If Obamacare remains the focus, he will certainly get the base jazzed up about what he\u2019s doing, but he won\u2019t get rid of the law.\u201d\n\nCruz has gained some traction in terms of shaping the contours of what a Republican Senate would do, in part because McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) have not offered their own definitive vision of what a Republican-led Congress would look like.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nTwo weeks ago, Cruz wrote an opinion piece in USA Today laying out 10 conservative priorities he thinks Republicans should pursue, including moving toward a flat tax and drawing a hard line on illegal immigrants. In the interview here, Cruz reiterated some of those points, such as approving the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nMcConnell has mostly been coy about what he would like to accomplish other than adding amendments to curb federal regulations to spending bills as a means of putting pressure on the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to tell the other side what the first play is going to be,\u201d McConnell said at an event last month.\n\nCruz is not interested in adding amendments that may put indirect pressure on Obama. He favors direct political combat. That way, either the president gives in, or, Cruz said, \u201cyou have clear accountability. It becomes transparent to everyone that it is the Democrats blocking meaningful progress.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a Long Island moderate, said Republicans should be wary of Cruz\u2019s guidance. \u201cHe is the last one we should listen to,\u201d King said in an interview Sunday. \u201cDon\u2019t forget \u2014 a year ago he brought Republicans over the cliff.\u201d\n\nStill, Cruz\u2019s help on the trail has improved his image among some Republicans, while easing a measure of the anger aimed at him from some of the donors and colleagues he infuriated in October 2013 when he led a shutdown of the government.\n\nCruz should be able to count on a handful of new friends, if not allies, when the Senate convenes next year. In recent weeks, he has campaigned for Senate contenders who beat Cruz-admiring insurgents in Republican primaries, from businessman David Perdue in Georgia and state Sen. Joni Ernst in Iowa to Sullivan and Sen. Pat Roberts, Kansas\u2019s embattled incumbent.\n\nIf she wins, Ernst is poised to be a powerful player in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest in the 2016 race for the GOP presidential nomination. Perdue, who has weak ties to his red state\u2019s GOP base, could hew close to Cruz on some votes to keep conservatives in Georgia at bay. Sullivan, for similar reasons, could do the same.\n\nCruz is not the only conservative Republican with national ambitions who is working to show skeptical Republicans that they can do more than squabble. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has cut ads for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the groups that opposed tea party candidates in Senate primaries, and stumped for moderate former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, who is running for Senate in New Hampshire.\n\nCruz declined to say whether he\u2019s going to run for president, but was dismissive of moderates in his party, particularly those who may challenge him for the 2016 Republican nomination. Of Jeb Bush, for instance, Cruz said he likes and respects him, \u201cbut I think we have seen election after election that when Republicans fail to draw a clear distinction with the Democrats, when we run to the mushy middle, we lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some point,\u201d Cruz continued, \u201cafter Gerald Ford and Bob Dole and John McCain and Mitt Romney . . . we shouldn\u2019t keep making the same mistakes over and over again.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons Republicans have lost elections recently is that we have failed to engage in a meaningful way on the great issues of the day,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played a prevent defense. You don\u2019t win elections that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen. Ted Cruz has been a team player to help Republicans take the upper chamber, but that will change, he says.
