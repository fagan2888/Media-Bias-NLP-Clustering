A mobile home in Southport is completely destroyed after a fire broke out Sunday evening.

Bay County Fire officials responded to a fully involved structure fire at around 7:00 on McKenzie Road.

Fire officials say they were able to contain the fire in less an hour, but the house is considered a total loss.

Authorities say no one was living in the house at the time of the fire.

"At this time, we know the house was unoccupied," said Captain Billy Writch. "The homeowners are on scene with us. It appears the home was not used as a residence full time."

At this time it is unknown how the fire was started and the investigation is ongoing.
