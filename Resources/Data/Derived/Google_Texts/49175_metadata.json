He scored 10 goals last season for the Pittsburgh Penguins and finished with 46 points. A seven-year NHL veteran, Niskanen is still just 27. He began his career with the Dallas Stars, who chose him in the first round of the 2005 draft. His goals and assists (36) last season were both career highs.\n\nBut he is also a right-side defenseman, a position already occupied by John Carlson and Mike Green. Carlson is signed to a long-term contract. Green, however, is a free agent after this coming season. He will make $6.25 million this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big commitment from Washington. That\u2019s no small thing, Niskanen said. \u201cYou start talking a seven-year commitment for a pretty substantial amount of money, I\u2019m very grateful for that opportunity and excited for that challenge to be that guy.\u201d\n\nNiskanen also played a heavy role on the power play for the Penguins, where he totaled 15 points. That is a role where Green saw less time on ice with the top unit last season. That job went to Carlson.\n\n\u201cWe were looking at adding a good two-way guy, a right-shot guy and we went through what was available,\u201d said Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan. \u201cTodd Reirden, our defense coach [formerly with Pittsburgh] had a lot of input on why his game is where it is and why he believed it would stay at that level. We trusted Todd\u2019s opinion on that.\u201d\n\nOrpik, 33, has played 703 NHL games, all of them for the Penguins. He still averaged over 21 minutes per game last season, but was no longer a top-pairing defenseman in Pittsburgh. Orpik\u2019s salary-cap hit with the Penguins was $3.75 million, but he used the open market to garner a pay raise.\n\nGiven Orpik\u2019s age and number of games played, the deal is a risk for MacLellan. But Orpik is a left-side defenseman, a tough character with the size and strength at 6-foot-2, 219 pounds to clear opposing forwards from the crease.\n\nSkating isn\u2019t a strength anymore, however, and he fared better with a puck-moving defenseman like Penguins teammate Paul Martin. In that case, pairing him with Carlson, Green or Niskanen would help. Orpik did have two goals and 11 assists last season.\n\nBut Orpik\u2019s contract is long for a player with lots of mileage over a long career thanks to a physical style of play. It is a deal that MacLellan felt comfortable with given his team\u2019s desperate need for help on the left side.\n\nFor now, Karl Alzner is the experienced veteran at that spot. He generally works with Carlson. The organization is still high on Dmitry Orlov, a young player with upside just coming into his own. But otherwise there is little depth on the left side of the blueline.\n\nVeteran John Erskine struggled to recover from knee surgery last summer and was often left out of the lineup by former coach Adam Oates. Washington needed help and paid heavily for it with Orpik.\n\nPeters, 27, is a career backup goalie, though he has done well in that role with the Carolina Hurricanes playing behind Cam Ward. Peters started 20 games last season and posted a .919 save percentage for Carolina. His goals-against average was 2.50. He has always had success against Washington with a career save percentage of .938 and a 1.67 goals-against average.\n\nThe acquisition of Peters solidifies Braden Holtby, 24, as the organization\u2019s No. 1 goalie going forward. Holtby struggled at times last season trying to play a less aggressive style under Oates.\n\n\u201cA lot of it was just sending the right message to Holtby that we believe in him,\u201d MacLellan said of the Peters signing.\n\nThe move also allows prospect Phillip Grubauer, 22, to remain with AHL Hershey with recalls expected if injury strikes. Grubauer has appeared in 19 games for the Caps over the last two seasons. A revamped roster now has them thinking contention again.\n\n\u201cI set myself up this year with a pretty good year, so I wanted to go to a place where I knew I could be in a good spot and have a chance to win for an extended period of time,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cI really found that with the Caps. I\u2019m excited for that opportunity and I hope to stay for the duration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington took a step toward solving its weaknesses by signing free agent defenseman Matt Niskanen to a seven-year, $40.25 million contract and his former Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Brooks Orpik to a five-year deal worth $27.5 million.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Washington took a step toward solving its weaknesses by signing free agent defenseman Matt Niskanen to a seven-year, $40.25 million contract and his former Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Brooks Orpik to a five-year deal worth $27.5 million.", "title": "Capitals spend big on defense as NHL free agency opens", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/1/capitals-spend-big-defense-nhl-free-agency-opens/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/01/ap855300642454.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/01/ap855300642454.jpg", "description": "Washington took a step toward solving its weaknesses by signing free agent defenseman Matt Niskanen to a seven-year, $40.25 million contract and his former Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Brooks Orpik to", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Capitals spend big on defense as NHL free agency opens"}, "Author": "Brian McNally", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Matt Niskanen, Brooks Orpik, Washington, Justin Peters"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd828f\"", "article_summary": "He scored 10 goals last season for the Pittsburgh Penguins and finished with 46 points.\nSkating isn\u2019t a strength anymore, however, and he fared better with a puck-moving defenseman like Penguins teammate Paul Martin.\nHe still averaged over 21 minutes per game last season, but was no longer a top-pairing defenseman in Pittsburgh.\nWe trusted Todd\u2019s opinion on that.\u201dOrpik, 33, has played 703 NHL games, all of them for the Penguins.\nHe began his career with the Dallas Stars, who chose him in the first round of the 2005 draft."}
