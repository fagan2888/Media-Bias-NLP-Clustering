In his latest, however, inflation has vanished from the argument \u2014 yet he still insists that quantitative easing is bad, bad, bad. And to replace it he suggests an elaborate system of cyclically varying taxes, with tax breaks for investment when the economy is depressed that will be withdrawn when it recovers.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable scheme for a conservative, of all people, to propose; it involves the government trying to muck around with private incentives on a regular basis, with lots of intrusive behavior \u2014 we\u2019ll reward some kinds of spending, but not others \u2014 and obvious opportunities for gaming the system that would promote a lot of employment among tax lawyers. Also, one of Feldstein\u2019s long-standing arguments about what\u2019s wrong with quantitative easing is that we can\u2019t trust the Fed to withdraw it when it\u2019s no longer needed. Um, and we can count on Congress to withdraw tax breaks for corporations promptly when the macroeconomic justification has ended? The mind reels.\n\nThe really remarkable thing, however, is that the animus against QE remains even though the alleged reason for that animus has evaporated. True, Feldstein makes some vague claims about distorted incentives and reaching for yield; it always amazes me how ready conservatives are to assert that investors and markets are irrational when it serves their agenda. But basically at this point the case against QE is levitating in thin air; it was built on a foundation of inflation fears, but is still hovering there now that those fears have been sent down the memory hole.\n\nIt\u2019s a very peculiar thing.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141226153914, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003419406, "DISPLAYDATE": "December 26, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Quantitative Levitation ( 20141226 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Strange policies to respond to forgotten fears.", "title": "Quantitative Levitation", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/quantitative-levitation/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Strange policies to respond to forgotten fears.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 26, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1419626354, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T17:29:54-05:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20141227172954, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141226, "pdate": 20141226, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Strange policies to respond to forgotten fears.", "title": "Quantitative Levitation", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/quantitative-levitation/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/quantitative-levitation/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Quantitative Levitation", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd067c\"", "article_summary": "In his latest, however, inflation has vanished from the argument \u2014 yet he still insists that quantitative easing is bad, bad, bad.\nUm, and we can count on Congress to withdraw tax breaks for corporations promptly when the macroeconomic justification has ended?\nThe really remarkable thing, however, is that the animus against QE remains even though the alleged reason for that animus has evaporated.\nAlso, one of Feldstein\u2019s long-standing arguments about what\u2019s wrong with quantitative easing is that we can\u2019t trust the Fed to withdraw it when it\u2019s no longer needed.\nFeldstein is a permahawk; he has been warning that the Fed\u2019s policies are dangerously inflationary since early 2009."}
