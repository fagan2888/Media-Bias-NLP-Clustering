He was handcuffed and driven in a police cruiser to the District 4 police station at 2100 S. Clay St.\n\nPolice Chief Robert White said at a news conference that somehow, after the cruiser arrived in the station parking lot, the suspect produced a weapon and fired a shot at officers but didn\u2019t hit anyone.\n\nAnother police officer opened fire and hit the suspect, who was taken to Denver Health Medical Center in critical condition, but he is expected to live.\n\nVIDEO: Watch Denver Police Chief Robert White discuss the officer involved shooting at the District 4 Police Station\n\nNo officers were injured.\n\n\u201cIt appears he did absolutely the right thing,\u201d White said of the officer who shot the suspect.\n\nThe suspect was identified late Wednesday night as 32-year-old Isaac Vigil.\n\nColorado court records show Vigil had been arrested April 8 on felony menacing and weapons charges in Adams County. He failed to appear at his preliminary hearing last week, and a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nHis record also shows previous assault and escape charges.\n\nPolice will now investigate how, or even whether, Vigil had been searched or frisked before he was taken to the substation.\n\nSearching is standard procedure, White said, but added, \u201cThis might not have been a typical situation.\u201d\n\nWhite said it is unlikely the suspect took or used the officer\u2019s weapon.\n\nThe name of the officers involved have not been released.\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arrested suspect pulls gun on Denver police, is wounded at station", "title": "Arrested suspect pulls gun on Denver police, is wounded at station", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/14/arrested-suspect-pulls-gun-on-denver-police-is-wounded-at-station/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__SuspectIsaacVigilp1-3.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__SuspectIsaacVigilp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T17:02:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:27:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc95c\"", "article_summary": "He failed to appear at his preliminary hearing last week, and a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.\nA man in custody Wednesday afternoon was shot and wounded by police after he pulled a gun at a Denver police station, police said.\nThe suspect had been arrested about 4:40 p.m. in the 300 block of South Eliot Street on drug charges and an outstanding felony warrant, police said.\n\u201cIt appears he did absolutely the right thing,\u201d White said of the officer who shot the suspect.\nVIDEO: Watch Denver Police Chief Robert White discuss the officer involved shooting at the District 4 Police StationNo officers were injured."}
