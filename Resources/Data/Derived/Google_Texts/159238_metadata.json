He sat on the Taunton City Council before his election as county registrar, then served as Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s deputy chief of staff before becoming a central part of President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, overseeing much of the polling and focus groups.\n\n\n\nFollowing the president\u2019s reelection, Simas joined the White House and in January of 2014 was named to head up its new Office of Political Strategy and Outreach. In addition to coordinating White House political strategy and outreach activities, the office serves as the main point of contact for national, state and local political groups, works with constituent and political groups and plans and crafts big-picture strategies to achieve White House goals.\n\n\n\nInterviewed by BC Law Magazine last year, Simas said his education at the school \u2013 and BC Law\u2019s commitment to public service \u2013 prepared him for his career in politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ability to quickly dive into an issue, make sense of it, and then formulate it into a discussion either advocating or opposing a position...That is absolutely core.\u201d [The article is available online at http://bit.ly/1OiTZEP.]\n\n\n\n\u201cI am very pleased that David has agreed to be our Commencement speaker,\u201d said BC Law Dean Vincent Rougeau. \u201cHe has a long record of service, both locally through Governor Patrick\u2019s office here in Massachusetts and in the White House. His leadership as one of the president\u2019s closest advisors and his work on the Affordable Care Act is something our students will be very interested in hearing more about, and I\u2019m looking forward to welcoming him back to campus.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore information on the Law School Commencement is available at www.bc.edu/lawcommencement.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"robots": "index, follow", "copyright": "2016 (c) Trustees of Boston College"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am very pleased that David has agreed to be our Commencement speaker,\u201d said BC Law Dean Vincent Rougeau.\n\u201cHe has a long record of service, both locally through Governor Patrick\u2019s office here in Massachusetts and in the White House.\nIn addition to coordinating White House political strategy and outreach activities, the office serves as the main point of contact for national, state and local political groups, works with constituent and political groups and plans and crafts big-picture strategies to achieve White House goals.\nFollowing the president\u2019s reelection, Simas joined the White House and in January of 2014 was named to head up its new Office of Political Strategy and Outreach.\nInterviewed by BC Law Magazine last year, Simas said his education at the school \u2013 and BC Law\u2019s commitment to public service \u2013 prepared him for his career in politics."}
