She said she would not vote to approve financial matters until state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale releases his audit of the district, which is expected in mid-May.\n\nThe early retirement incentive, similar to one offered in 2014-15, covers health care benefits for seven years beginning July 1, or until the employee turns 65 or becomes eligible for Medicare.\n\nTo be eligible, employees must have served at least seven years full-time.\n\nThe amendments include extending the deadline for resignations from April 29 to May 31.\n\nSuperintendent Nancy Hines said that change allows staff more time to consult with Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System officials prior to declaring intent to retire.\n\nThe other major change is inclusion of a cash option.\n\nThose who choose to discontinue health-care coverage when separating from employment and can provide proof of insurance effective July 1 through an unaffiliated party will receive a lump-sum benefit annually from the district equal to the amount of district-provided coverage that they discontinue.\n\n\u201cThey added that on their own, which I thought was fantastic,\u201d Penn Hills Education Association President Bob Hoffman said.\n\nHe said the lump sum would be what the employee would have contributed for the year, which on average could be between $7,000 and $8,000.\n\nThe previous retirement incentive agreement only offered health care coverage.\n\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, retirees would have to show proof that they switched coverage to a plan provided by the employer of a spouse, relative, domestic partner, or other,\u201d Hines explained.\n\nDonations\n\n\u2022 Board members unanimously approved the donation of a scoreboard for the Nate Ferraco Memorial Field, a soccer field at Linton Middle School, from the Ferraco family and the Nate Ferraco Memorial Fund.\n\nFerraco played soccer, volleyball and football for Penn Hills. He was the valedictorian last year.\n\nFerraco,18, died Jan. 24 in a car crash in Butler County.\n\n\u201cI think virtually everyone in Penn Hills has been touched by the untimely death of Nate Ferraco,\u201d Hines said. \u201c(He's a) student who loved Penn Hills and who served as a tremendous role model within the community. The district has been happy to work with Nate's family to create a lasting memorial, and we very much appreciate the donation of the scoreboard that will display the new name Nate Ferraco Memorial Field.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The board also voted to accept a $488 donation from Target Take Charge of Education for the elementary school, a $227 donation to Linton from Original Works' art fundraiser, and donation of transportation costs for a high school field trip provided by a Chatham University Eden Hall grant.\n\nMichael DiVittorio is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
