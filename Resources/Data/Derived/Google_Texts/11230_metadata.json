The amended policy could allow male students who identify as female to use girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms, among other changes.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d said former school board member Mychele Brickner. \u201cPeople are very disturbed by what just happened. \u2026 They didn\u2019t take parents into account. The fact that they passed a motion like this and created an additional protected class in the policy, and then they are going to let people see later what this means, that\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s exactly what happened with Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe school board voted 10-1, with one abstention, to approve the policy change during a meeting late Thursday at Luther Jackson Memorial Middle School in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nSEE ALSO: Outraged parents vow to take down school board over gender identity: \u2018We will remember in November\u2019\n\nHundreds of parents and residents attended the meeting, saying the board approved the amendment without studying the implications of such a change. Many said the school board itself should brace for change when it\u2019s time for re-election.\n\n\u201cWe will remember in November!\u201d they shouted as they stormed out of the middle school auditorium.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the vote, board Chairwoman Tamara Derenak Kaufax applauded the measure, calling it a way to \u201cprovide an environment which promotes equality where every student and employee is treated with dignity and respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe School Board has taken this proactive step to protect our students and staff from discrimination,\u201d Ms. Kaufax wrote.\n\nBut Elizabeth Shultz, the only board member who voted against the amendment, chided her colleagues for pushing a political agenda without considering parents\u2019 rights to be a part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cI think it is a sad statement that we can allow those decisions to be entrenched in political ideology or vague understandings of the implications of such policies,\u201d Ms. Schultz said. \u201cWe are an education system, and we didn\u2019t do our homework. We took the final exam and signed our name at the bottom and took some guesses.\u201d\n\nSome board members said the school district was required by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights to add \u201cgender identity\u201d to the policy or else risk losing federal funds.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been very clear that they expect local schools to amend their policies,\u201d said John Foster, division counsel for Fairfax County Public Schools.\n\nMost attendees opposed the measure, but some lauded it as a crucial first step toward protecting transgendered students and faculty.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here tonight may be a big step in making sure that a whole other population doesn\u2019t have to get up in the morning fearing facing harassment,\u201d said Gordon Baer, co-chairman of the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) of Virginia.\n\nMr. Baer said he understood that most people at the meeting opposed the board\u2019s approval of the amendment, but he argued that setting firm gender identity language in the policy would provide support for implementing it.\n\nMs. Kaufax said the school system will hire a consultant to help develop regulations for the amended policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fairfax County Public School board members voted 10-1 with one abstaining on Thursday to add \"gender identity\" to its nondiscrimination policy despite overwhelming opposition from the audience.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fairfax County Public School board members voted 10-1 with one abstaining on Thursday to add \u201cgender identity\u201d to its nondiscrimination policy despite overwhelming opposition from the audience.", "title": "School transgender rights bill passes in Fairfax County, Virginia", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/7/school-transgender-rights-bill-passes-fairfax-coun/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/transgender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/transgender.jpg", "title": "School transgender rights bill passes in Fairfax County, Virginia", "description": "Fairfax County Public School board members voted 10-1 with one abstaining on Thursday to add \"gender identity\" to its nondiscrimination policy despite overwhelming opposition from the audience.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Education, Board Of Education, Tamara Derenak Kaufax"}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of Northern Virginia residents voiced outrage last week when the Fairfax County Public School Board changed its nondiscrimination policy to include \u201cgender identity\u201d without consulting parents.\nMany said the school board itself should brace for change when it\u2019s time for re-election.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d said former school board member Mychele Brickner.\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened with Obamacare.\u201dThe school board voted 10-1, with one abstention, to approve the policy change during a meeting late Thursday at Luther Jackson Memorial Middle School in Falls Church, Virginia.\nMs. Kaufax said the school system will hire a consultant to help develop regulations for the amended policy."}
