(Raven712 / Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThis story first appeared at Labor Notes.\n\nI keep getting these emails from the Laborers union: \u201cThe Keystone XL Pipeline isn\u2019t just a pipeline, but a lifeline to good, family-supporting jobs.\u201d\n\nIn the labor movement we\u2019re supposed to be for anything that creates more paid work. But here\u2019s some heresy for you: I think we need less work.\n\nSenators who voted against the pipeline in November, the union says, threw away a chance to \u201cunlock millions of work hours,\u201d and instead \u201ckilled thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nIs the Senate \u201ckilling jobs?\u201d Maybe. Meanwhile, jobs are killing us.\n\nJobs: Often Awful\n\nExhibit A: the tragic death of New Jersey fast food worker Maria Fernandes last August, napping in her car between shifts. She was cobbling together at least three Dunkin\u2019 Donuts jobs to make ends meet.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just non-union jobs. Exhibit B: Jenny Brown\u2019s story last month on \u201cFighting Fatigue.\u201d Even unionized pilots, train engineers, and bus drivers are working extreme hours that endanger themselves and others.\n\nPart of the problem is bosses imposing awful schedules. And part of it is we\u2019ll take all the hours we can get, because pay is so low and the cost of living so high.\n\nThat means work isn\u2019t shared among all who want it. There\u2019s one 60-hour job instead of two 30-hour jobs, and unemployment stays high.\n\nThen there\u2019s Exhibit C: the Keystone XL pipeline itself. As we near a climate-change point of no return, scientists say we must drastically reduce carbon emissions. The pipeline only worsens the threat.\n\nThese jobs could kill us all. Working less isn\u2019t just a humane goal\u2014it\u2019s a planetary necessity.\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to understand why the Laborers are pro-pipeline. Workers need to put food on the table today. So unions push for more work, however awful it might be.\n\nHow could we reduce the pressure to work so much, for fast-food workers and train engineers alike? One side of the coin is raising wages\u2014something labor\u2019s been building good momentum for, at least at the bottom of the scale.\n\nThe other side, the one we don\u2019t talk about as much, is reducing the cost of living.\n\nLabor for Leisure\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t need to work so hard if the rent (and mortgages) weren\u2019t so damn high. If transit were free, and frequent enough. If we had free health care and higher education.\n\nSound utopian? It shouldn\u2019t. Take the federal money already going to higher ed in loans and grants, hand it straight to public universities instead\u2014and you could have free tuition for all, tomorrow. Same with health care: single-payer would cost less than we already spend on our dysfunctional private system.\n\nIn the Netherlands if you want to reduce your hours to part-time, by law your employer has to let you, unless they show it would be a hardship. Lots of workers have taken advantage. Of course, universal health care helps make this option viable.\n\nIn a recent issue of Jacobin, Daniel Aldana Cohen tells the wonderful story of 1936 France, where workers struck for and won two weeks\u2019 vacation for everyone.\n\nThat summer, \u201cthe sub-minister of leisure and sport mandated 40 percent discounts on train fares for once-a-year trips. Hundreds of thousands took advantage right away, nearly two million the following year. Many visited the beach for the first time, while others traveled to see relatives or camp in the countryside.\u201d\n\nImagine it! For the planet and our health, it\u2019s time to build a labor movement that stands for less labor\u2014not more.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef38\"", "article_summary": "Labor for LeisureWe wouldn\u2019t need to work so hard if the rent (and mortgages) weren\u2019t so damn high.\nWe Need Less Work, Not MoreWorking less isn\u2019t just a humane goal\u2014it\u2019s a planetary necessity.\nBut here\u2019s some heresy for you: I think we need less work.\nThat means work isn\u2019t shared among all who want it.\nWorkers need to put food on the table today."}
