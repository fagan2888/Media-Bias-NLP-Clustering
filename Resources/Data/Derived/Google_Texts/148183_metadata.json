Bush, National security, national security state, Obama administration, President Barack Obama, War on Terror, Politics News\n\nOne of the great mysteries \u2014 and ongoing controversies \u2014 of the Barack Obama presidency has to do with his record on civil liberties and counter-terrorism. In fact, for many former supporters of the president, it\u2019s the alleged continuities between the anti-terror policies of Obama and Bush that first caused them to rescind their support for the former. Charges that Obama is worse than Bush, because he legitimized and gave bipartisan cover to that which was once seen as radical and divisive, are not uncommon.\n\nSo now that Obama is about to entire his final year in the White House, and now that attention is increasingly turning away from him and toward his would-be successors, it seems like an opportune moment to reassess the past seven years and figure out why, exactly, Obama\u2019s record on counter-terrorism issues has been so controversial \u2014 and mixed. Which is where \u201cPower Wars: Inside Obama\u2019s Post-9/11 Presidency,\u201d the new book from the New York Times\u2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Charlie Savage, comes in.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Savage about his book, which is both a deeply reported history of the Obama administration and a look at how bureaucracy, chance, politics and technology have so profoundly shaped its legacy. Alongside discussing what Obama really promised on the campaign trail in 2008, we also talk about the outsized influence of late-2009\u2019s failed \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d and why the president has less control over the prosecution of leaks from his administration than you may suspect.\n\nOur conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into the \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d incident, which you argue was a much, much greater influence on the Obama administration than most people appreciate, I wanted to ask you to set the stage for the first year or so of Obama\u2019s presidency. How did he conceive of these post-9/11 issues before Christmas, 2009?\n\nObama had been a big critic of the Bush administration reaction to the 9/11 attacks, of course, like a lot of Democrats. However, he was primarily criticizing those things like warranted surveillance and military commissions and torture and so forth from a certain vantage point. And kind of what we see now, which was harder to discern at the time of the Bush years, was that there were two very different strands of criticism among Democrats \u2014 and even among libertarians \u2014 of what the Bush administration did.\n\nWhat were they?\n\nThere was the rule of law criticism, which said, \u201cThe president has to obey statutes. He can\u2019t just blow through things like the FISA [warrant] requirements because he thinks it\u2019s necessary and because he\u2019s the Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the civil liberties critique, which was less interested in the legal process by which the policy was put in place and more interested in what is the relative role of the state in the \u201cstate power vs. individuals\u201d [issue]. And these two strands kind of work together during the Bush years.\n\nBut they eventually start to diverge because the Congress in Bush\u2019s second term started to adjust federal law to bring it into alignment with what [the government] was already doing under Bush\u2019s direction. That at least dramatically reduces the rule of law problem; but the sort of individual [liberties] problem \u2014 if there is one \u2014 remains undisturbed by those changes.\n\nAnd where does Obama land in the midst of all of this?\n\nWhat you see when you go back and really parse Obama\u2019s [campaign] speeches, and hear what the people he gathered around him once he went into the White House were saying, [it\u2019s] almost all primarily in the \u201crule of law\u201d faction. So other than torture, his mindset and that of the people he was gathering around him, coming into office, was: A lot of the stuff had been fixed. We had the [telecom immunity bill], which Obama voted for, which authorized a warrantless surveillance program; we had the Military Commission Act, and so forth.\n\nThere were a few more things that needed to be fixed or wound down or put on firmer legal grounding \u2014 and that was their task; to sort of finish the job of normalizing, regularizing and maybe even \u201crightsizing\u201d the government\u2019s response to the ongoing threat of terrorism. This was one of the things that he was going to do.\n\nAll right. So then Christmas Day, 2009, happens; the so-called underwear bomber. You argue that this was a big, big deal within the White House \u2014 bigger than many outsiders appreciate. Why was this failed attack so important?\n\nThat was a turning point for Obama. He\u2019d already had some compromises and encountered things that were sort of harder in the real world than they seemed on the campaign trail, but he was basically on track to be doing what he wanted to do \u2014 or what he thought he wanted to be doing \u2014 coming out of that first year.\n\nAnd then, on Christmas, 2009, an al Qaeda terrorist operative from Yemen \u2014 well, east of Nigeria, but fed by IEC, the mini-affiliate of al Qaeda \u2014 nearly brings down a jetliner above Detroit. It would have killed almost 300 people on American soil, on [Obama\u2019s] watch. And so, number one, that\u2019s a gut-wrenching moment; it was only sheer luck that the bomb didn\u2019t go off. It was not that the system they put in place worked.\n\nAnd then, the fallout from that was also tremendously important. Republican critiques that he was dismantling some of the things that Bush had put into place suddenly got a lot sharper; and the sense was, if there was another attack, and if it succeeded, the blood would be on his hands. And then underscoring all that is that Scott Brown, a Republican, wins Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat in deep-blue Massachusetts.\n\nRight. That usually doesn\u2019t get mentioned in this story. It\u2019s usually seen as a major development in the story of the Affordable Care Act; not counter-terrorism policy. Why did it matter in that latter context, though?\n\nThe media at that time was portraying [Brown\u2019s victory] as a reaction to Obamacare, but inside the Scott Brown campaign, the polls showed that it was really the terrorism issue that he got the most traction on. He was pounding on Obama and on his Democratic opponent for treating terrorists as criminals, for the fact that the underwear bomber had been read his Miranda warning and was being interrogated by the FBI and charged [in civil court] because Obama and Eric Holder wanted to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other 9/11 suspects from Guantanamo to New York and give them a civilian trial.\n\nBrown kept pounding on the idea that these are terrorists and we shouldn\u2019t give them these rights; and even in Massachusetts, at that moment, there was a certain wave of fear from the underwear bomber rolling across the country. It really resonated \u2014 and, suddenly, a Republican had won a Senate seat in Massachusetts. So inside the Obama administration, [it came to be believed that if] there is another attack, and it actually succeeds, Obama will be a failed, one-term president. He\u2019ll lose, just like Jimmy Carter; and everything he came in there to do, including things that have nothing to do with national security, would fail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYT reporter Charlie Savage tells Salon the real reason why Obama has broken less from Bush than many hoped", "title": "\u201cA turning point for Obama\u201d: How the president learned to love the national security state", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYT reporter Charlie Savage tells Salon the real reason why Obama has broken less from Bush than many hoped", "title": "\u201cA turning point for Obama\u201d: How the president learned to love the national security state", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/07/a_turning_point_for_obama_how_the_president_learned_to_love_the_national_security_state/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/bush_obama2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYT reporter Charlie Savage tells Salon the real reason why Obama has broken less from Bush than many hoped", "title": "\u201cA turning point for Obama\u201d: How the president learned to love the national security state", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/bush_obama2.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, charlie savage, Editor's Picks, George W.
