[Iran will] not stop their march towards weapons. Sanctions were the most effective policy our country has had against Iran in 36 years, and this deal lets them go.\u201d\n\nStethem and his colleagues at Veterans Against the Deal have, over the last month, completed a media blitz, appearing in television advertisements, on shows like Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d and at the rallies of 2016 presidential candidates, \u201cbanging the drum,\u201d as Stethem says, \u201cnot towards war, but towards better terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were told, \u2018These terms, this deal, or war,\u2019\u201d Stethem says. \u201cSo when [Iran breaks] the deal, the question is going to be, \u2018Now what?\u2019 To everybody who says they won\u2019t, I want to see their backup plan.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Stethem and Retired Staff Sgt. Robert Barlett, also of Veterans Against the Deal, spent the larger part of the afternoon knocking on the doors of senators and congressmen in Washington, hoping a last-ditch appeal could turn the tide of public opinion.\n\n\u201cThere is no quit in this,\u201d Stethem says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep telling the truth until it makes the difference it should.\u201d\n\nCorrection: September 14, 2015\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated that at the time of his death, Robert Stethem was a college graduate.
