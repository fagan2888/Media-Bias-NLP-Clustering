Professor Steffen Schmidt in his recent Iowa View commentary [July 16] says that "trust in government is crucial."

In order for citizens to trust government, we must first have a trustworthy government. I'll cite just one of myriad examples showing that our government is untrustworthy.

Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, more frequently known as Obamacare. This was to be the legacy legislation of the Obama presidency.

We recall that the bill was so complex that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, warned us that the bill had to be passed so we could know what was in it.

Obama has seen fit to simply ignore or delay implementation of portions of this law, such as large-employer mandates, without any legal basis to do so.

We can't trust Obama to obey the law — even his own proposal enacted by Congress. We certainly can't trust congressional leadership that doesn't know what is in a bill before it is passed.

Thank goodness Pelosi is the former speaker and is no longer leads the House.
