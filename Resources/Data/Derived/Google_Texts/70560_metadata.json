Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) introduced a bill this week that would slash the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 budget in half if the agency does not deposit $4 billion to the U.S. Treasury as part of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reinsurance program.\n\nThe Taxpayers Before Insurers Act would require the agency to deposit funding from the law\u2019s reinsurance program to the Treasury, as was written in the law. Under the reinsurance program, HHS would collect money from insurers between 2014 and 2016, then distribute most of it to insurers that covered the sickest individuals, while $5 billion went to the Treasury as a deficit reduction measure. But when the agency did not collect as much money as expected, the administration through regulations prioritized the money going to insurers.\n\n\u201cHHS must stop cheating taxpayers. The reinsurance program is a clear case of Washington\u2019s cronyism: families are suffering Obamacare\u2019s consequences but Washington bureaucrats are sending billions of dollars to well-connected insurance companies,\u201d Sasse said in a statement. \u201cOur legislation is simple: if HHS ignores the law to reward insurance companies, Congress will slash their operating budget.\u201d\n\nHis legislation was introduced Thursday, one day before a House subcommittee held a hearing on the reinsurance program, where Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Andy Slavitt defended the administration\u2019s policy.\n\nThe bill, however, will almost certainly not become law, let alone see a Senate vote this session. The Senate will soon start the appropriations process, which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the chamber could spend 12 weeks on, wrapping up most of the time the chamber will spend in session before recessing for the party conventions this summer. McConnell is also unlikely to bring a bill to the floor that would force vulnerable incumbents to take a difficult vote this year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Sen.
