A day earlier, Denver lost a 26-20 decision to the Seattle Seahawks when its record-setting offense failed to get on the field following a miraculous fourth-quarter comeback.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to see what Peyton Manning would have done if he\u2019d gotten the football,\u201d Rice said.\n\nRice was the keynote speaker at the annual Korbel fundraiser at the downtown Sheraton hotel, and there were moments when the evening\u2019s participants seemed to be part of the most gussied-up pep rally ever. In his opening remarks, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock welcomed Rice to town, calling her \u201cthe next commissioner of the NFL,\u201d a reference to a job that Rice has expressed a (perhaps) whimsical interest in holding.\n\nHill, at the start of his 30-minute discussion with Rice, confessed that \u201cI should be asking about foreign policy\u201d before veering off into a gridiron chalk talk.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long, however, before the talk indeed moved toward what most would consider Rice\u2019s true bread and butter. Freed from any diplomatic constraints, Rice, currently a professor of political science at Stanford, offered a number of unvarnished opinions.\n\nSpeaking of Russian President Vladimir Putin, for example, Rice said, \u201cI looked directly into his eyes and I didn\u2019t exactly see a soul.\u201d\n\nRegarding ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the role of disenfranchised citizens in the conflict, Rice made a comparison to the American fight for Independence, and the process that saw African-Americans go from being constitutionally regarded as three-fifths of a human being to the day that she swore to uphold that same Constitution as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThat took a long time,\u201d Rice said. \u201cLet\u2019s be a little more patient with people\u201d who are fighting for their rights.\n\nLater, Rice added that she was a big proponent of immigration reform in the U.S. for \u201cthose people who are living in the shadows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the country,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere people are afraid to send their children to the hospital because they\u2019re afraid of being deported.\u201d\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292, acotton@denverpost.com or twitter.com/anthonycottondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Condoleezza Rice talks Broncos, NFL \u2014 and foreign policy \u2014 in Denver", "title": "Condoleezza Rice talks Broncos, NFL \u2014 and foreign policy \u2014 in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/22/condoleezza-rice-talks-broncos-nfl-and-foreign-policy-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922_090206_Condoleezza-Rice-in-Denver-1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922_090206_Condoleezza-Rice-in-Denver-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T20:50:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:49:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "higher education"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI would have loved to see what Peyton Manning would have done if he\u2019d gotten the football,\u201d Rice said.\nFreed from any diplomatic constraints, Rice, currently a professor of political science at Stanford, offered a number of unvarnished opinions.\nHill, at the start of his 30-minute discussion with Rice, confessed that \u201cI should be asking about foreign policy\u201d before veering off into a gridiron chalk talk.\nIt didn\u2019t take long, however, before the talk indeed moved toward what most would consider Rice\u2019s true bread and butter.\nIn a far-reaching conversation Monday night that ranged from Russia to the Middle East to immigration reform, former U.S. Secretary of State and University of Denver graduate Condoleezza Rice also offered her opinion on matters of great local import: the Denver Broncos."}
