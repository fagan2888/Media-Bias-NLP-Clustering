They had $30,000 in liens from the state before pulling out of the program.\n\nIn late 2013, Rose Rayburn signed up for MNsure with help from Yvonne Skelton, an insurance broker with \u2014 and now the owner of \u2014 Davidson Insurance in Moose Lake. There was no paperwork, just a computer screen, said Rick Rayburn, who doesn\u2019t have a computer at home. The only thing that arrived later, he said, was a notice saying they were enrolled in Medical Assistance. \u201cI don\u2019t expect an estate lien because I\u2019m trying to get insurance,\u201d he said. Skelton, who no longer handles applications through MNsure, said she had been left in the dark about the process. The MNsure training, she said, covered things she already knew as a broker. \u201cWe were being tested on, \u2018Do you know what a deductible is? Do you know what a co-payment is,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI thought this was just kind of a joke.\u201d The estate claim provision, Skelton said, \u201cshould have been a bright, bold piece of paper you have to sign that you\u2019re agreeing to it.\u201d\n\nRayburn says had he known his estate would be running a tab, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted the health insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, Killerud, who doesn\u2019t like debt, tried to write a check last week for the $11,000 in claims, but a state official said there\u2019s no mechanism for taking the money until a person dies.\n\nA MNsure spokesperson told the News Tribune none of this should surprise anyone.", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "newscut", "mpr-collection": "Politics", "WT.cg_n": "News Blogs", "WT.z_mpr-site": "news", "description": "A Pine County farmer's plight shows the value of reading the fine print when signing up for health insurance under Minnesota's version of Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance.\r\n\r\nScott Killerud, of Willow River, signed up for health insurance through MNsure, and found out his income qualified him for Medical Assistance, the Duluth News Tribune reports.\r\n\r\nThey've found out since then that the state has placed liens on their estate to pay for it.", "author": "Bob Collins", "og": {"site_name": "NewsCut", "description": "A Pine County farmer's plight shows the value of reading the fine print when signing up for health insurance under Minnesota's version of Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance.\r\n\r\nScott Killerud, of Willow River, signed up for health insurance through MNsure, and found out his income qualified him for Medical Assistance, the Duluth News Tribune reports.\r\n\r\nThey've found out since then that the state has placed liens on their estate to pay for it.", "title": "Liens for health insurance rile Pine County residents", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/02/liens-for-health-insurance-rile-pine-county-residents/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/newscut/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/newscut-opengraph.png?v=2", "type": "article"}, "mpr-site": "news", "twitter": {"description": "A Pine County farmer's plight shows the value of reading the fine print when signing up for health insurance under Minnesota's version of Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance.\r\n\r\nScott Killerud, of Willow River, signed up for health insurance through MNsure, and found out his income qualified him for Medical Assistance, the Duluth News Tribune reports.\r\n\r\nThey've found out since then that the state has placed liens on their estate to pay for it.", "creator": "@newscut", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/02/liens-for-health-insurance-rile-pine-county-residents/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/newscut/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/newscut-opengraph.png?v=2", "title": "Liens for health insurance rile Pine County residents", "site": "@mprnews", "card": "summary"}, "mpr-content-topic": "politics", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "WT.cg_s": "NewsCut"}, "article_summary": "A Pine County farmer\u2019s plight shows the value of reading the fine print when signing up for health insurance under Minnesota\u2019s version of Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance.\nScott Killerud, of Willow River, signed up for health insurance through MNsure, and found out his income qualified him for Medical Assistance, the Duluth News Tribune reports.\nThey\u2019ve found out since then that the state has placed liens on their estate to pay for it.\nRick and Rose Rayburn, also of Pine County, found the same thing, the paper says.\nIn late 2013, Rose Rayburn signed up for MNsure with help from Yvonne Skelton, an insurance broker with \u2014 and now the owner of \u2014 Davidson Insurance in Moose Lake."}
