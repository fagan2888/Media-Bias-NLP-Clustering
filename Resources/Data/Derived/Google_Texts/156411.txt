In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt served as President, Henry Ford developed the first Model T, and the Chicago Cubs won the World Series. But it's also the year Ms. Annie Lynch of Panama City Beach was born.

Four generations of family members came to Panama City Beach Sunday to celebrate Ms. Annie turning 107 years young.

With a life involving stops in North Carolina and Baltimore, Maryland before settling in the Florida Panhandle 13 years ago, Gloria Johnson says her mother lives the life of a giver with an open heart.

"All of the nieces and nephews came through our home," said Johnson. "In addition to them, anyone who needed a meal or a place to stay, they came to our house. Our house was an open door. Her and my father, their life was one of giving."

Jarri Brown says she remembers her Great-Grandmother going the extra mile to help out those closet to her.

"When I came along, she was about 70 years old. So, she had a hand in my upbringing," said Brown. "The school that I went to was down the street from her house, so she would walk from her house when I was younger until I was old enough to ride the school bus and the public bus home from school."

Even fellow church members from Christian International in Santa Rosa Beach came out to celebrate Ms. Annie's milestone.

"God has blessed her with a lot of great health, But overall, she's been healthy," said church member Sarah Fanale.

And while she plans to celebrate many more birthdays to come, she has some simple advice to live a long, sweet life.

"Don't drink and don't smoke. Just don't do nothing like that," said Lynch.

According to family and friends, Lynch goes to church every Sunday, and always enjoys dancing and a dish of chicken and sweet potatoes.

Some of the gifts Lynch received Sunday included a hat, watch, chef's coat, and gift card to Longhorn's Steakhouse, where her family eats every Sunday after church.
