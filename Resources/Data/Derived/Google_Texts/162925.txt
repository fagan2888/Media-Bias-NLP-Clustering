Weeks after MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry and a guest panel gleefully mocked the Romneys for adopting a black grandchild, the network sent out a tweet suggesting that the “rightwing” writhes with rage at the sight of a biracial family.

Imagined conservative hatred of minorities is a favorite theme of progressives. Back in November, Washington Post writer Richard Cohen claimed Republicans — or strangely, people with “conventional views” — “must repress a gag reflex” when they saw New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s multiracial family. Amusingly, he drew the ire of fellow leftists who quickly branded him a racist for calling the tea party racist. (RELATED: MSNBC panel makes Romney’s black grandchild the punchline)

MSNBC’s tweet also comes hot on the heels of Harris-Perry’s sniveling apology for cruelly mocking an innocent child. Before she made a national disgrace of herself, Americans generally recognized her as the woman wearing tampon earrings and claiming Obamacare was “the new n-word.”

Even left-leaning publications took issue with MSNBC’s vitriol.

MSNBC’s broadsweeping assumption that all conservatives hate interracial marriage gives you an indication of what they’re all about. — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) January 30, 2014

MSNBC has not commented on or apologized for their vulgar tweet as of press time.

UPDATE: MSNBC tweeted an apology late Wednesday evening blaming their unruly Twitter feed for spitting hate autonomously. Kids these days!
