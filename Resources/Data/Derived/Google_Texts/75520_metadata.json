Photo by Darren Ornitz/Reuters.\n\nDear Breakfasters,\n\nJust a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from dissents, and concurrences styled as dissents, were read from the bench this term.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.\n\n\n\nYou have doubtless already learned that the main opinion in Glossip v. Gross, the Oklahoma lethal injection case, was read by Justice Samuel Alito, who found, along with the three other conservative justices and Justice Anthony Kennedy, that the use of one of three drugs in Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection protocol, midazolam, does not violate an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights. The drug, involved in multiple botched executions, does not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, Alito said, adding that from now on the burden is on the inmate to identify a known and available alternative method of execution. Alito\u2019s opinion carefully tracks his views expressed at oral argument in this case, including the suggestion that it is \u201canti-death-penalty advocates\u201d who made procuring more effective drugs problematic in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat was notable, and really weird, inside the chamber, was not just that Justice Sonia Sotomayor read from her strong dissent in the case, or that Justice Stephen Breyer read from a lengthy dissent (joined only by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) advocating for the abolition of the death penalty altogether. Breyer and Ginsburg said capital punishment violates the Eighth Amendment based on an elaborate statistical and factual account of the ways in which it cannot and will never be administered fairly. (Breyer quite cheekily references (twice) the DNA exoneration of Henry Lee McCollum, in September, as someone who \u201cdid not commit the rape and murder for which he had been sentenced to death.\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia had once used McCollum as the poster boy for why the death penalty is morally necessary.)\n\nBut in addition to the twin dissents, Scalia announced\u2014after the reading of the dissents\u2014that he was concurring in the majority opinion but had some things to say about the dissents. Since no written summary of his statement was provided, you will need to take my word for it that what he read deviated from his written concurrence in some really odd ways. And while I don\u2019t want to spend too much more time on Scalia acting oddly, this was very odd. He opened his statement\u2014which seemed not to have been written down, and didn\u2019t really track his written opinion\u2014with: \u201cLast Friday five justices of this court took the issue\u201d of same-sex marriage away from the voters based on their \u201cpolicy preferences\u201d and then noted that today two justices sought to do that again, with the call to abolish the death penalty. In case you were wondering, he isn\u2019t over Obergefell.\n\nScalia went on to note that the death penalty is expressly contemplated by the words of the Constitution, and continued with the accusation that maybe it\u2019s a good thing that \u201ctwo justices are willing to kill the death penalty outright rather than just pecking it to death.\u201d\n\nWeirder? He concluded with the oral statement that \u201cnot often in the law is it the case that so few have changed so much.\u201d The latter may not be as pointed an indictment as the zinger at the end of his written concurrence, which accuses Breyer (but not his partner in crime, Ginsburg) of rejecting, well, \u201cthe Enlightenment.\u201d But it\u2019s a deliberate echo of Breyer\u2019s lament in reading his dissent aloud in the 2007 Seattle schools case, that, \u201cIt is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.\u201d This is really a doubly strange accusation since of course the two dissenters\u2014unlike the majority in the schools case\u2014have in fact changed nothing at all, since they are the only two willing to do away with the death penalty. It may simply be a frustrated reference to five justices changing so much doctrine in a few short days. But strange to go after Breyer and Ginsburg on a losing side of a lethal injection drug case for this. All that changed here, really, is their minds on the constitutionality of capital punishment\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s the real sin.\n\nIn any event, the readings of the opinions in the other two cases, the Arizona redistricting and EPA cases, went forward without oral dissents from any justices, or their friends and families, and the court adjourned until October.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Scalia goes off script.", "fb-share": "In case you\u2019re wondering, he\u2019s really not over the same-sex marriage decision.", "sailthru.author": "Dahlia Lithwick", "description": "Dear Breakfasters, Just a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from diss ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Dear Breakfasters, Just a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from diss ...", "title": "Scalia Goes Off Script in a Very Strange Supreme Court Address", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/scalia_in_glossip_v_gross_supreme_court_decision_oklahoma_may_kill_using.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_Scalia.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dear Breakfasters, Just a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from diss ...", "title": "Scalia Goes Off Script in a Very Strange Supreme Court Address", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/scalia_in_glossip_v_gross_supreme_court_decision_oklahoma_may_kill_using.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_Scalia.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@dahlialithwick", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-29T14:16:44Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Scalia Goes Off Script in a Very Strange Supreme Court Address", "sailthru.headline": "Supreme Court Breakfast Table", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Scalia Goes Off Script in a Very Strange Supreme Court Address\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/scalia_in_glossip_v_gross_supreme_court_decision_oklahoma_may_kill_using.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_Scalia.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100150629011\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-29T14:16:44Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Dahlia Lithwick\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"supreme court\",\n    \"death penalty\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Scalia goes off script in a very strange Supreme Court address.", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "supreme court 2015 term, supreme court decisions, scotus end of term, death penalty, Oklahoma death penalty, supreme court lethal injection, glossip decision, glossip cruel and unusual, eight amendment lethal injection, midazolam supreme court", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=805335340"}, "sailthru.tags": "supreme court 2015 term, supreme court decisions, scotus end of term, death penalty, Oklahoma death penalty, supreme court lethal injection, glossip decision, glossip cruel and unusual, eight amendment lethal injection, midazolam supreme court", "sailthru.description": "Dear Breakfasters, Just a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from diss ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_Scalia.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Dear Breakfasters,Just a quick postcard from inside the Supreme Court chamber Monday morning as the last opinions and dissents, and dissents from dissents, and concurrences styled as dissents, were read from the bench this term.\nBut strange to go after Breyer and Ginsburg on a losing side of a lethal injection drug case for this.\nAnd while I don\u2019t want to spend too much more time on Scalia acting oddly, this was very odd.\nAll that changed here, really, is their minds on the constitutionality of capital punishmentBut maybe that\u2019s the real sin.\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus."}
