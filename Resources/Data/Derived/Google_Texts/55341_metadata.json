It can make or break an organization's efforts to improve patient safety. In organizations where the culture is broken or has gone unaddressed for a lengthy period of time, divisions can form among stakeholders. Administration can find itself at odds with frontline caregivers, or departments can squabble amongst themselves. .\n\nThere are a number of ways to address culture within the organization, according to Miller. These include detailed surveys of staff to find out where they feel supported and where they do not, as well as whether they have the resources they need to function efficiently and whether they feel comfortable addressing problems with leaders. Hospital leaders should also listen to patient stories, find out what has worked for other organizations, conduct regular \"walk-arounds\" and visits to workers and to consistently measure workforce safety, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 ways CEOs can actually change hospital culture\n\n8 recommendations for a culture of patient safety\n\n4 ways healthcare leaders can create a culture of safety\n\nHospital leaders: Focus on these areas to improve patient safety", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital and healthcare system administrators must take a \"multi-pronged\" approach to improving hospital culture, a key component to ensure patient safety, according to Becker's Hospital Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital and healthcare system administrators must take a \"multi-pronged\" approach to improving hospital culture, a key component to ensure patient safety, according to Becker's Hospital Review.", "title": "Patient safety efforts must start with hospital culture", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-safety-efforts-must-start-hospital-culture/2016-02-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "healthcare leadership,hospital culture,HR & Workforce Management,Infection Control,organizational culture,patient safety,risk management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "article_summary": "Hospital and healthcare system administrators must take a \"multi-pronged\" approach to improving hospital culture, a key component to ensure patient safety, according to an article at Becker's Hospital Review.\nHospital culture is defined as the shared organizational beliefs of the institution's administration and staff, Miller said.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:5 ways CEOs can actually change hospital culture8 recommendations for a culture of patient safety4 ways healthcare leaders can create a culture of safetyHospital leaders: Focus on these areas to improve patient safety\nIt can make or break an organization's efforts to improve patient safety.\nHospital leaders should also listen to patient stories, find out what has worked for other organizations, conduct regular \"walk-arounds\" and visits to workers and to consistently measure workforce safety, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
