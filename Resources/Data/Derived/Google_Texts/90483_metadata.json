But, it was reported in the press differently. Now, what happened was the CBO \u2014 that\u2019s the Congressional budget office \u2014 they are the arbiters, they are the umpires. We say they are impartial. I\u2019ve quoted them many times, and say, \u2018look, they are the impartial ones.\u2019\n\nOkay, what they said was Obamacare, over 10 years, will reduce employment by 2 million people. Okay, somehow in the media that got to be Obamacare will kill jobs. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. What it means is that because people now, of course, can decouple, and by the way, we should never have coupled employment with healthcare in the first place. We did that during World War II because they throw salaries, so it was a way of giving a worker a benefit.\n\nOkay, now, you know, because they passed that thing which Republicans agree with too, we should not \u2014 if you have a pre-existing condition, you have to cover that. So now people don\u2019t have to stay in their job to get covered. So these are people choosing to leave the workforce because they finally can. Isn\u2019t that a good thing?\n\nALICIA MENENDEZ: Yeah, I mean, it creates opportunity \u2014 it basically is a game of musical chairs where we have the same number of chairs but less people competing to sit in those chairs. So it creates opportunity, and as you said, free people up. So that means: you want to go hang out with your grandkids? You can do that. You want to start a business? You can do that because you\u2019re no longer dependent on your job for your healthcare.\n\nMAHER: Yeah disincentives to work are not always a bad thing. Americans work too much. Americans are over-worked, overstressed. They take less vacation time. They don\u2019t retire when they want to. Not everything is GDP.\n\nBill Maher did something more important than get outraged about the Republicans latest ACA lie. He debunked the moral argument behind the lie. The lie about the CBO report is based on central Republican argument against Obamacare. Republicans believe to their very core that providing better access to healthcare for millions of Americans is immoral.\n\nIn the same segment S.E. Cupp dredged up the work is dignity argument, but Maher replied that not all jobs have dignity. He used the example from his own life of working at Arthur Treacher\u2019s Fish and Chips was not a dignified job. A more modern example would be working at Walmart. The largest retailer in America is a place where employees don\u2019t have access to affordable healthcare, and the wages are so terrible that employees are forced to both work and use programs like food stamps and Medicaid to survive.\n\nReal dignity is having the freedom to leave a bad job, and not have to worry about what will happen if you or a loved gets sick. True liberty is restoration of the ability to move up the economic ladder. Programs like unemployment benefits and the ACA aren\u2019t destroying dignity, they are enabling it.\n\nIt is fun to listen to Maher use humor to take apart Republicans. In this case, it was more important that he drove a stake through the bogus moral argument that is at the heart of the Republican lies about the ACA.\n\nThe best way to combat the Republican lies about the ACA is to destroy the baseless moral argument that their emotional house of cards is built upon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher smashed the Republican lie about CBO report and the ACA killing jobs by destroying the bogus conservative moral argument that is the basis for every Republican Obamacare falsehood.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Bill Maher smashed the Republican lie about CBO report and the ACA killing jobs by destroying the bogus conservative moral argument that is the basis for every Republican Obamacare falsehood.", "title": "Bill Maher Obliterates Republicans For Spreading a New Bogus Obamacare Lie", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/02/08/bill-maher-obliterates-republicans-spreading-bogus-obamacare-lie.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bill-maher-obamacare-cbo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-08T11:22:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Bill Maher,bill maher aca disincentive to work,maher disincentive to work,Real Time,se cupp,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-02-08T11:21:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-08T11:22:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bill Maher, bill maher aca disincentive to work, maher disincentive to work, Real Time, se cupp"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ff7\"", "article_summary": "Bill Maher smashed the Republican lie about CBO report and the ACA killing jobs by destroying the bogus conservative moral argument that is the basis for every Republican Obamacare falsehood.\nThe lie about the CBO report is based on central Republican argument against Obamacare.\nBill Maher did something more important than get outraged about the Republicans latest ACA lie.\nHe debunked the moral argument behind the lie.\nIn this case, it was more important that he drove a stake through the bogus moral argument that is at the heart of the Republican lies about the ACA."}
