On a first-and-10 off a slant route in the fourth quarter, in the Patriots\u2019 final stages of their 43-21 blowout of the Broncos \u2014 in Foxborough, of course \u2014 Gronkowski stretched his 6-foot-6, 265-pound frame to evade the coverage of safety T.J. Ward and grab a bullet pass from Tom Brady with one hand, landing one yard shy of Denver\u2019s end zone. Another pass from Brady put him over the goal line for the final dagger.\n\nThe Patriots didn\u2019t need that highlight catch. The Broncos didn\u2019t need to see the oversized tight end tally another victory against Denver. And they certainly didn\u2019t need a reminder of their 2013 Super Bowl debacle against the Seahawks. But Gronkowski and the Patriots provided it all Nov. 2, 2014, in meeting that Ward said after was \u201cour worst game.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos \u2014 now with the league\u2019s leading defense in yards allowed (284.3) and second-leading in points allowed (18.3)\u2014 hope to not see it again Sunday, when Gronkowski and the 10-0 Patriots roll into Denver. They have a plan, they say, but they don\u2019t claim to have found any definite answer on how to stop the three-time Pro Bowl tight end.\n\n\u201cUh \u2026 triple-team,\u201d said cornerback Aqib Talib, who spent 2012-13 as Gronkowski\u2019s teammate in New England before signing with Denver. \u201cIt\u2019s his size and that speed. And that quarterback.\u201d\n\nSince 2010, when he entered the league, Gronkowski has recorded 523 receiving yards and 46 touchdowns in the red zone in the regular season, both league-highs in the NFL.\n\nIn the regular and postseason combined, Gronkowski is a perfect 5-0 record against the Broncos over his career, recording 428 receiving yards on 34 catches with five touchdowns in those meetings. No tight end has recorded more, all time, against Denver.\n\n\u201cAny coverage can work best on me,\u201d the happy-go-lucky Gronkowski said. \u201c\u2026 Obviously there are some better ones out there, but when you always get doubled a lot it\u2019s definitely hard to get open.\u201d\n\nThe Bills tried it last Monday, and found more success than others, holding him to only two catches and 37 yards as Brady completed only 28.6 percent his pass attempts to Gronkowski, well below his 62.1 percent on the season.\n\n\u201c(Buffalo doubled him) some,\u201d Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t all the time. He\u2019s a great player and you have to be aware of him. Anytime they have a \u2014 they do the same thing defensively against teams they play. If you try to take away what they do best or take away their best player, that\u2019s what you have to try to do. It means doubling him a lot, certainly, but it also means putting enough pressure on the quarterback where the guy doesn\u2019t have time to throw to the guy even when he gets open sometimes. You can\u2019t double-cover him every play, but there are certain things that we will. You have to.\u201d\n\nNew England, already without receiver Julian Edelman (broken foot) and running back Dion Lewis (ACL), lost another, Aaron Dobson, to an ankle injury in the win against Buffalo, prompting the team to place him on the season-ending injured reserve Thursday. Brady still connected with seven different receivers for 271 net passing yards in the victory, but the Patriots\u2019 growing injured list might force them to change their offensive game plan at Denver \u2014 and give the Broncos more incentive to place added pressure on Gronkowski.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got the main pieces and that\u2019s Gronk and Tom Brady,\u201d Denver nose tackle Sylvester Williams said. \u201cAs long as they\u2019ve got those guys, I think they\u2019re going to always be in pretty good shape.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos say they\u2019re expecting the unexpected with the Patriots and Gronk, something Phillips and his players have learned first-hand in years of facing the Patriots and their star tight end.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything works week to week,\u201d Ward said. \u201cGuys change it up and he adapts to different things that defenses do. We\u2019ll have a plan.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\n\nRob Gronkowski vs. the Broncos\n\nRob Gronkowski, the Patriots\u2019 6-foot-6, 265-pound tight end, has faced the Broncos five times in the regular and postseason combined in his career.
