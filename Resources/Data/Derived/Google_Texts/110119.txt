Are you listening, male US Senators? Your colleague, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) wants you to stop mansplaining and "just shut the hell up."

In a refreshing video prepared for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Monday, the first woman elected to the Missouri senate (and consummate badass) explains that while she values the importance of encouraging more women to run for office, it's equally important for men to stop inserting their opinions into every damn issue.

"It's not that women don't value your thoughtsâ€”it's just that we don't value all of them," McCaskill said. "The world doesn't need your opinion on everything."

The senator continued by enumerating a list of topics she'd love to see all men stop talking about. These include: what women do with their bodies, pantsuits, Star Wars (repeated twice), Shonda Rhimes, and #GamerGate.

"If you can control yourselves and hold back from further expressing your opinions on any of these topics, we'll let you keep weighing in on marijuana legalization," she said, offering a reward for their good behavior.

"But," she cautioned. "That's a huge, big 'if.'"
