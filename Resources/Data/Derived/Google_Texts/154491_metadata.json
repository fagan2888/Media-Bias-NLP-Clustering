The cheerleading for this number is deafening. The media loves a comeback story, the White House wants to score political points and Wall Street would like you to stay in the market.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThen Clifton savages such claims. He points out that the Department of Labor simply doesn\u2019t count someone as unemployed if they gave up looking for a job after four weeks of fruitless searching. Adding that as many as 30 million Americans are truly out of work or severely underemployed. Clifton writes bitterly: \u201cTrust me, the vast majority of them aren\u2019t throwing parties to toast \u2018falling\u2019 unemployment.\u201d\n\nBut Clifton doesn\u2019t stop there; he explains exactly how ridiculous the Department of Labor\u2019s standards are, noting that if a worker performs one hour a week and gets paid a minimum of $20, that worker does not count among their number of unemployed workers.\n\nEven that shocking fact does not end Clifton\u2019s litany of Labor Department subterfuges: if an American works part-time but seeks full-time employment, that American does not count as unemployed. He uses the example of someone who has degree in chemistry or math but can only find part-time work because that job is all that\u2019s available.\n\nClifton blasts, \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to say this. The official unemployment rate, which cruelly overlooks the suffering of the long-term and often permanently unemployed as well as the depressingly underemployed, amounts to a Big Lie.\u201d He notes, \u201cGallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck. Right now, the U.S. is delivering at a staggeringly low rate of 44%, which is the number of full-time jobs as a percent of the adult population, 18 years and older.\u201d\n\nClifton concludes with a flourish: \u201cI hear all the time that \u2018unemployment is greatly reduced, but the people aren\u2019t feeling it.\u2019 When the media, talking heads, the White House and Wall Street start reporting the truth \u2014 the percent of Americans in good jobs; jobs that are full time and real \u2014 then we will quit wondering why Americans aren\u2019t \u2018feeling\u2019 something that doesn\u2019t remotely reflect the reality in their lives. And we will also quit wondering what hollowed out the middle class.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gallup's Jim Clifton acknowledges that the official unemployment rate from the Dept. of Labor doesn't reflect the reality of US unemployment.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Gallup's Jim Clifton acknowledges that the official unemployment rate from the Dept. of Labor doesn't reflect the reality of US unemployment.", "title": "Gallup CEO Calls Unemployment Numbers 'A Big Lie' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/looking-for-jobs-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/03/gallup-ceo-calls-unemployment-numbers-a-big-lie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gallup's Jim Clifton acknowledges that the official unemployment rate from the Dept. of Labor doesn't reflect the reality of US unemployment.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/looking-for-jobs-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Gallup CEO Calls Unemployment Numbers 'A Big Lie' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Department of Labor, gallup, Jobs, underemployment, unemployment,Big Government, Data, Economics,unemployment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2015-02-03T18:35:45-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics,Data"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Clifton sardonically notes the \u201ccelebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is \u2018down\u2019 to 5.6%.\nThe official unemployment rate, which cruelly overlooks the suffering of the long-term and often permanently unemployed as well as the depressingly underemployed, amounts to a Big Lie.\u201d He notes, \u201cGallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck.\nAdding that as many as 30 million Americans are truly out of work or severely underemployed.\nThe media loves a comeback story, the White House wants to score political points and Wall Street would like you to stay in the market.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThen Clifton savages such claims.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJim Clifton, the Chairman and CEO at Gallup, has acknowledged the dirty little secret that the Obama administration and their media lapdogs assiduously attempt to hide: the official unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Department of Labor does not accurately reflect the grim reality of American unemployment."}
