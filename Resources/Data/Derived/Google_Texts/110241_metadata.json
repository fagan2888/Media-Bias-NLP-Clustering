I know, totally shocking, right? (via Daily Caller):\n\nThe University of Missouri (MU) is losing about 1500 students and is facing a huge $32 million budget shortfall four months after it attracted national attention as the site of massive race-based campus protests. \u201cI am writing to you today to confirm that we project a very significant budget shortfall due to an unexpected sharp decline in first-year enrollments and student retention this coming fall. I wish I had better news,\u201d said MU interim chancellor Hank Foley in a Wednesday letter to school staff [March 9] that was obtained by Fox Sports. According to Foley\u2019s letter, MU will have about 1500 fewer students in fall 2016 compared to last year, an unexpected drop that is in turn causing a big dip in the school\u2019s tuition income. Because of the abrupt and unexpected nature of the shortfall, Foley is taking immediate and severe steps to fix the situation: The school budget is being cut 5 percent across the board, all hiring is being frozen (barring exceptional circumstances), and annual raises have been canceled. He has also announced a new, more intensive effort to recruit potential Mizzou students by phone, email, and even via Skype. Even with all these measures, Foley anticipates MU having a deficit of about $10 million, which he said would be made up using the school\u2019s reserve funds.\n\nThe professor who was charged with assault, Melissa Click, escaped further legal proceedings when she agreed to a year\u2019s probation and community service. She has since penned piece a piece in The Washington Post about her conduct during the protests, where she wrote \u201cIf you have had any exposure to American media in the last four months, you know the quick decision I made to stand with the students, you\u2019ve seen my inexperience with public protests.\u201d As National Review\u2019s Kat Timpf noted saying that you don\u2019t know how journalism works in a public space, specifically a protest, then that alone should be grounds for dismissal. Click was fired in February. She views herself as the \u201cscapegoat,\u201d being used \u201cto distract from larger campus issues.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, political correctness, besides being mind-numbingly stupid and authoritarianism masked under the guise of diversity, is also incredibly expensive. Has Mizzou learned from this public relations disaster? Nope. They\u2019re requiring \u201cdiversity intensive\u201d courses as a prerequisite for graduation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shocked!
