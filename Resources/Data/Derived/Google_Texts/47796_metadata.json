(Photo: Mike Weaver, Special to the CJ)Buy Photo\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. \u2013 The business that former Kentucky Personnel Secretary Tim Longmeyer allegedly used to obtain kickbacks and political contributions is a low-profile Lexington consulting firm named MC Squared Consulting LLC, the Courier-Journal has learned.\n\nLongmeyer, of Louisville, was charged by federal authorities Friday with bribery in a complaint that alleged he used his authority as head of the cabinet to steer contracts to an unidentified consulting firm and that in exchange the firm kicked back cash and checks for political contributions to Longmeyer.\n\nMC Squared Consulting was organized in 2008 by Sam C. McIntosh, according to its records on the Kentucky Secretary of State\u2019s website, although the website also shows McIntosh had previously operated businesses under a similar name going back to 1991.\n\nMcIntosh did not return phone messages left at MC Squared\u2019s offices Saturday, nor did he reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThough McIntosh worked years ago in Democratic politics, campaign contribution databases do not show McIntosh as a contributor to any political campaigns during the 2011-15 period of the alleged scheme, but some other MC Squared employees did \u2013 including to the campaigns of Democrats Andy Beshear for attorney general and Jack Conway for governor.\n\nTerry Sebastian, Beshear's spokesman, said in a statement that Beshear would consult with others and determine if he needs to take any action related to the contributions to his campaign.\n\n\"Andy is shocked and deeply disappointed by Friday's news. With regards to any contributions, he will seek guidance from the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Kentucky Registry for Election Finance. Both in his campaign and as Attorney General, Andy is firmly committed to following the law,\" Sebastian said.\n\nA spokesman for Conway didn't immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky Kerry Harvey, who announced the charge against Longmeyer on Friday, declined in a phone interview Saturday to provide any further details of the case including the name of the unidentified consulting firm.\n\nThe complaint charges that Longmeyer \u201cabused his authority\u201d as personnel secretary to convince two companies that had contracts to administer the Kentucky Employees\u2019 Health Plan \u2013 originally Humana and later Anthem \u2013 to hire the unnamed company for \u201cconsulting services that included focus group testing and telephone surveys.\u201d\n\nLongmeyer steered more than $2 million in business from Humana and Anthem to this unidentified firm, which in turn kicked back more than $200,000 to Longmeyer, the complaint alleges.\n\nHarvey said Friday he has no reason to believe Humana and Anthem officials ever knew about the allegedly illegal activity.\n\nLongmeyer is a longtime Democratic operative and past chairman of the Jefferson County Democratic Party. He has a history of giving to political causes and helped former Gov. Steve Beshear and former Attorney General Jack Conway raise money.\n\nSince 1998, he and his wife, Geralyn, have contributed more than $52,000 to political candidates and causes, according to databases maintained by the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance and the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to the Registry of Election Finance, Longmeyer hosted a fundraising event for Beshear on Nov. 17, 2009, that raised $61,600 for Beshear\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nLast June 25, he hosted an event for Conway, who was then running for governor, which raised $25,400.\n\nLongmeyer, who went to work as the top deputy for Attorney General Andy Beshear, the former governor\u2019s son, when he took office in January, abruptly resigned from his job last week, just before the criminal charges became known publicly.\n\nBuy Photo Tim Longmeyer in 2005.

The services listed include focus group research.\n\nThose records also say that McIntosh was born in Hazard, is a graduate of the University of Kentucky, and worked as a staff assistant to former Sen. Benny Ray Bailey from 1980 to 1982, then worked in Martha Layne Collins\u2019 1983 campaign for governor.\n\nMcIntosh then served as an assistant to Democratic Party Chairman Edward M. Coleman in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cHe coordinated the Democratic Party\u2019s polling efforts for the 1986 legislative and 1987 gubernatorial races, as well as legislative liaison for the Kentucky House and Senate leadership offices,\u201d the records say.\n\nContribution records available on the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance website (for state contributions) and the Open Secrets website (for federal contributions) show that McIntosh has not been a big campaign contributor. Those records show he gave $250 to Republican Ernie Fletcher\u2019s general election campaign for governor, and $1,000 to Steve Beshear\u2019s re-election campaign for governor in 2009.\n\nHowever, those records show that five MC Squared employees gave to Andy Beshear\u2019s campaign for attorney general, three gave to the Kentucky Democratic Party, two gave to Jack Conway\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for governor last year, and three gave to Steve Beshear\u2019s 2011 re-election.\n\nReporter Tom Loftus can be reached at (502) 875-5136 or tloftus@courier-journal.com.
