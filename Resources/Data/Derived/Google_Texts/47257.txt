We scored some GREAT deals at the huge Rue21 clearance sale this weekend! If your kids like this store, now is a good time to check out the deals!

We found fall and winter shirts, sweatshirts and jackets for $2 - $5 and summer shirts for $6.99. Undies were only $1.00. I was really thrilled with the $2 and $5 shirts including adorable Disney character long sleeved shirts with Lion King and Little Mermaid. My teen girls were very happy with their haul! They also had a number of $1 and $3 clearance jewelry and watches.

In the picture above, you can see Mikayla with Rue21 in the 40/42 area showing off the $2 sale sign!

Happy shopping!
