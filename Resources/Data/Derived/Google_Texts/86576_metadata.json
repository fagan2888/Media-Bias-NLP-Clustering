Rural St.\n\nThis 15th annual event is one of the largest back-to-school events in the state.\n\nChildren in attendance receive a free backpack with school supplies. Back-to-school services include immunizations and sports physicals. For immunizations, parents or guardians should bring current shot records as well as an insurance or Medicaid card for any children seeking immunizations.\n\nHealth screenings and various types of health information will also be available. And, parents can get a copy of their child's birth certificate for a small fee with proper identification.\n\nNot to be missed is the Indianapolis Fire Department, who provides entertainment as part of the Fire Safety Festival, offering games, food and interactive educational displays.\n\nThose who need health insurance can get enrolled on-site for Hoosier Healthwise, Health Advantage, Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0, or the Affordable Care Act. In order to enroll, the following documents are needed: income stubs from the last three months, Social Security Number, and proof of address in Marion County.\n\n\"What makes this event successful is the support we receive from all of the community agencies that support us,\" said Pamela Humes, program director of Covering Kids & Families of Central Indiana. \"Our sponsors, our volunteers and the general public contribute to making this a very special day.\"\n\nCovering Kids & Families is a statewide program run locally by the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County. For more information about Back-to-School Family Day, please call 317-221-3178.\n\nHelp Control the Mosquito Population This Summer\n\nEnjoy summer evenings in the backyard this year by following some simple tips for reducing the mosquito population where you live.\n\nTake five minutes to look for any container, big or small, capable of holding water. These are perfect areas for mosquito to breed. You should clean the container, cover it or put it away. Old tires are also popular breeding grounds for mosquitoes because they stay warm in the sun and collect rain water.\n\nGetting rid of standing water reduces the likelihood of being bit and it helps control the mosquito population.\n\nMosquitoes generally do not venture too far away from where they hatch. So, if you get bit, there's a good chance the mosquitoes have a place to breed nearby.\n\nFor information, call Marion County Public Health Department's Mosquito Control program at 317-221-7440.\n\nFree Diabetes Self-Management Classes in August\n\nThe ABCs of Diabetes program is a free, four-part series on diabetes self-management offered by the Marion County Public Health Department.
