PATERSON, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say rapper Fetty Wap has been injured in a motorcycle crash in his northern New Jersey hometown.

Paterson Police Director Jerry Speziale said the 25-year-old Wap was being treated at a hospital for undisclosed injuries after his motorcycle collided with a car Saturday afternoon. Wap’s injuries are not considered life-threatening.

The crash remains under investigation and no summonses have been issued. The woman driving the car was not injured, and her name has not been released.

Wap, who was born Willie Maxwell, has had a lot of success in the past year with three Top-10 songs, including the hit “Trap Queen,” which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

His debut album, “Fetty Wap,” was released Friday.
