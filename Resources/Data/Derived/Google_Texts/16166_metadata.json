It develops slowly over time, with the first symptoms showing in a tremble in one hand. Famous sufferers of the disease include Muhammad Ali and Michael J. Fox, but even after years of seeing familiar faces connected to Parkinson\u2019s, there is no known cure. A new study published in Current Biology may give insight into what causes Parkinson\u2019s and pave a new way for treatment.\n\nResearchers at the University of Montreal have found that Parkinson\u2019s disease might be a result of brain cells that have unusually high energy needs in order to control their movement. This \u201cenergy crisis,\u201d as they call it, causes the cells to overheat and burn out.\n\n\"Like a motor constantly running at high speed, these neurons need to produce an incredible amount of energy to function,\" lead researcher Professor Louis-\u00c9ric Trudeau said in a press release. \"They appear to exhaust themselves and die prematurely.\" Trudeau hopes his team\u2019s findings produce a better understanding of the disease and thus better treatments.\n\nThe discovery could lead to drugs that help the brain manage its energy consumption or use energy more efficiently, which would lead to less damage to the cells over time. Trudeau says his team is already working on finding these kinds of drugs.\n\nThe team has spent the last three years trying to figure out why the mitochondria cells \u2014 the powerhouses that produce the energy our cells need to function, grow and release signals \u2014 inside the area of the brain affected by Parkinson\u2019s work so hard that they overheat. The team found that these cells have very complex structures with multiple branches and sites where chemical agents are released. They suggest that the complexity of these cells is to blame for the overheating.\n\n\"To use the analogy of a motor,\" Trudeau said, \"a car that overheats will burn significantly more fuel, and, not surprisingly, end up at the garage more often.\"\n\nThe older we get, this complexity makes our brain cells more vulnerable, making them more likely to overheat and die, which triggers Parkinson\u2019s. Trudeau says that as we find ourselves living longer, we must deal with the challenges of finding treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. He says that \"some of our neurons are perhaps just not programmed to last 80, 90, or 100 years. ... It's to be expected that certain parts of our body are less able to withstand the effects of time.\"\n\nSource: Pacelli, C, et al.
