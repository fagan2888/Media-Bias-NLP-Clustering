NEW YORK (AP) — There were moments in nursing school when Hina Naveed was tempted to quit, not because she couldn’t do the work, but because she wondered whether, as an undocumented immigrant, she’d be allowed to get a license once she graduated.

“OK, I paid all this money. I got this far. I’ve been talking about how I’m so excited to be a nurse. I’ve really enjoyed my experiences in clinical. All it comes down to is a piece of paper,” said the 25-year-old New Yorker, who was brought to the U.S. by her Pakistani family at age 10.

New York and a handful of other states have been taking steps to remove the uncertainty for immigrants like Naveed, who were granted the legal right to work in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy implemented by the Obama administration in June 2012, but who still face legal and bureaucratic hurdles in earning professional licenses.

New York’s Board of Regents, which certifies or licenses more than 50 different types of professionals, including teachers, doctors, nurses, interior designers and architects, voted late last month to adopt regulations that would allow applications from undocumented immigrants who are holders of so-called DACA status. The regulations are up for a final vote and would take effect June 1, if approved.

California passed a law in 2014 that eased licensing restrictions in 40 professions for qualified persons regardless of immigration status. Florida is granting law licenses to DACA holders. Nevada opened up teaching licenses, said Tanya Broder of the National Immigration Law Center.

The federal policy is aimed at those who entered the U.S. before they were 16 years old and have been here continuously since 2007. It is not a legal immigration status, but it puts off deportation and gives eligible residents an access to things like legal employment and, in some places, in-state tuition rates at state colleges.
