State officials are trying to stop the spread of the Asian citrus psyllid, a tiny bug that can transmit citrus greening disease, which can kill citrus trees. Also known as Huanglongbing, the bacterial disease does not hurt humans or animals.\n\nArizona agriculture officials have asked the public not to take or send citrus fruit, leaves or plants across county or state lines\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s Food Bank typically receives about 3 million pounds of citrus fruit each year. It\u2019s not unusual for people to show up with oranges or grapefruit by the truckload, according to St. Mary\u2019s spokesman Jerry Brown. But this current pest will likely cause a 30 to 35 percent drop, he said.\n\nTo be sure fruit doesn\u2019t come from a quarantined area, food banks have only one way to squeeze out more donated fruit - fetch it themselves.\n\nAt both St. Mary\u2019s and United Food Bank, interested donors can apply online to be added to a list of places where volunteer crews will come pick the citrus. It will cost the donor $10-$20 per tree for the service. Food banks, as a result, are in urgent need of more volunteers than usual.\n\n\u201cWe have to establish a chain of custody,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAn army of volunteers will probably not be able to make up for all the missed drop-off opportunities. Between January and March, St. Mary\u2019s typically holds \u201cSuper Citrus Saturdays\u201d where people drop off fruit at four different locations. One Saturday event can net up to 100,000 pounds.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many volunteers we have, we\u2019re not going to be able to pick as much as fruit as the people who bring it to us,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSergio Paris, United Food Bank spokesman, said fruits are distributed to smaller food pantries or organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs. Some fruit is also squeezed for juice which is frozen and labeled for doling out later.\n\nWhile following the quarantine is imperative, Paris said it isn\u2019t easy to think about all the fruit that will be left to rot on people\u2019s trees.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is that in order to prevent this, we\u2019re essentially taking fruit away from people who need it,\u201d Paris said. \u201cA 7-year-old boy won\u2019t be getting a piece of fruit and to supplement that, we will have to purchase fruit. But at the end of the day, if we don\u2019t stop this, it\u2019s something that could wipe out the entire citrus industry in the state.\u201d\n\nCitrus greening disease makes fruit on an infected tree misshapen and bitter. The tree then dies within a few years. Arizona agriculture officials say the disease has already crippled the citrus industry in Florida and Texas, costing thousands of jobs and $1 billion.\n\nThe areas under quarantine include parts of Maricopa, Pima, Santa Cruz, Mohave, La Paz, Yavapai and Yuma counties. However, most food banks in the smaller counties are accepting citrus, according to April Bradham, of the Association of Arizona Food Banks. Unlike Maricopa, smaller counties do not distribute food to other parts of the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donations to metropolitan Phoenix food banks will likely bear a lot less fruit this year because of a disease that has devastate citrus industries in other states.", "Author": "TERRY TANG", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Donations to metropolitan Phoenix food banks will likely bear a lot less fruit this year because of a disease that has devastate citrus industries in other states.", "title": "Quarantine limiting citrus fruits for Phoenix food banks", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/2/quarantine-limiting-citrus-fruits-for-phoenix-food/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/02/citrus_donations-food_banks.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/02/citrus_donations-food_banks.jpeg", "title": "Quarantine limiting citrus fruits for Phoenix food banks", "description": "Donations to metropolitan Phoenix food banks will likely bear a lot less fruit this year because of a disease that has devastate citrus industries in other states.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "However, most food banks in the smaller counties are accepting citrus, according to April Bradham, of the Association of Arizona Food Banks.\nSergio Paris, United Food Bank spokesman, said fruits are distributed to smaller food pantries or organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs.\nPHOENIX (AP) - Donations to metropolitan Phoenix food banks will likely bear a lot less fruit this year because of a disease that has devastate citrus industries in other states.\nBut St. Mary\u2019s Food Bank Alliance and Mesa-based United Food Bank - the main citrus donation charities in the Phoenix area - haven\u2019t been accepting drop-off donations of citrus because of a quarantine issued last month by the state Department of Agriculture.\nFood banks, as a result, are in urgent need of more volunteers than usual."}
