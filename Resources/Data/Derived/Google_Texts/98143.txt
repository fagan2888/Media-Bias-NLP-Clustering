Sioux Falls, SD

The man accused of killing the son of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is out of jail after someone posted a $2 million bond for his release from jail.

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead tells KELO-TV that bond was posted for Joseph Patterson around 1:30 p.m. Friday. Patterson awaits jury trial in the death of two-year-old Tyrese Ruffin which is scheduled to begin September 29. He is charged with second degree murder stemming from the child's death in October 2013.

The 28-year-old was released from custody before when his father posted $750,000 bond. Patterson was returned to jail after receiving new charges of kidnapping and assault in June. He faces life in prison after being accused of strangling a Sioux Falls woman to the point where she lost consciousness.

Milstead says that the warden notified the victim in that case of his most recent release. Prosecutors have said that Patterson violated his no contact order with the victim even when he was behind bars.

The latest $2 million bond was split between Minnehaha County and Lincoln County, according to Milstead, because Patterson faces charges in both counties.
