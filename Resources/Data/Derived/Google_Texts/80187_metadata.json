They had no comment on the Fitch credit report, which concluded that the nation's 35 Blues fared more poorly than their for-profit competitors, including United Healthcare and Aetna Inc.\n\nOn whether health insurers might have rebounded in the last three months of the fiscal year, Fitch's Mark Rouck, senior director, said health insurers tend to post worse financials during the last quarter of the year because patient care expenses usually accumulate after deductibles are met earlier.\n\n\"It is somewhat hard to overcome three quarters with one quarter, especially the last one in the year because claims need to be paid,\" said Rouck.\n\nFitch said 23 of the 35 Blues plans reported a collective $1.9 billion decline in earnings for the first nine months of 2015, and 16 reported net losses.\n\nThe biggest contributor to the decline in earnings was Blue Cross of Michigan with a $622 million difference in profits to losses, followed by Chicago-based Health Care Service Corp. ($442 million) and Pittsburgh-based Highmark Group ($266 million).

The Blues began a $100 million-per-year cost-reduction turnaround program last fall.\n\nNationally, Blues plans averaged only one-tenth of a percentage point increase to 10.6 percent from 10.5 percent, Fitch said.\n\nRouck did not have a comment as to why Michigan Blues are so much higher on administrative costs than other Blues' plans.\n\nLast December, Crain's reported that the Michigan Blues have begun a \"strategic business transformation\" to cut out $300 million of costs over the next three years.\n\nDuring the past several months, more than two dozen employees have either left or been laid off from Blue Cross of Michigan. Recently, Wheeler Coleman, Blue Cross's chief information officer, left the company for undisclosed reasons. At least two suppliers also have left, sources told Crain's.\n\nOn administrative costs, Rouck said all health insurers need to be careful with expenses.\n\n\"There are so many limits on insurers' ability to generate profits from an underwriting standpoint because of the Affordable Care Act,\" he said. \"It is increasingly important to have expenses under control.\"\n\nAccording to Fitch, Blue Cross companies have top market shares in 37 states and top-three shares in 49 states. Blues of Michigan are No. 1 in Michigan with 40 percent overall market share, Fitch said.\n\nLast year's financial slide was especially acute when compared to positive numbers of the previous three years. During the three-year period from 2012 to 2014, Blue Cross of Michigan averaged revenue of $9.7 billion with a three-year profit average of $162 million, Fitch said.\n\nBut Rouck said many Blues plans nationally have suffered declining revenue and profitability during that period.\n\nRouck said Fitch did not directly compare Blues' plans with the publicly traded companies because they calculate expenses differently. For-profit plans use generally accepted accounting principles, he said, whole Blues plans generally use statutory accounting principles.\n\n\"Overall, we can tell Blues plans are not performing as well as publicly traded companies,\" he said.\n\nFor example, Rouck said Blue Cross companies' medical benefit ratios are often higher and their EBITDA-based margins are often lower than those of the public for-profit competitors. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "A report from Fitch Ratings says 23 of 35 Blues plans in the country reported a collective $1.9 billion decline in earnings for the first nine months of 2015, and 16 reported net losses.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "A report from Fitch Ratings says 23 of 35 Blues plans in the country reported a collective $1.9 billion decline in earnings for the first nine months of 2015, and 16 reported net losses.", "title": "Fitch report: Blue Cross Michigan leads earnings decline among nation's Blues plans", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160225/NEWS/160229883/fitch-report-blue-cross-michigan-leads-earnings-decline-among", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/Assets/rwd/C-Block_RWD.png?v=201503291736", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health Care", "published_time": "2016-02-25T12:03:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-28T03:32:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc5e\"", "article_summary": "\"Earnings declines, lower enrollment and moderate revenue growth were challenges for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies,\" said Rouck said.\nAccording to Fitch, Blue Cross companies have top market shares in 37 states and top-three shares in 49 states.\nFor-profit plans use generally accepted accounting principles, he said, whole Blues plans generally use statutory accounting principles.\nRouck did not have a comment as to why Michigan Blues are so much higher on administrative costs than other Blues' plans.\nMichigan Blues have requested higher rate hikes the past two years from the Michigan Department of Financial and Insurance Regulation."}
