Ted Van Pelt, CC by 2.0\n\nGiven the opportunity, most people choose a comfortable setting to die in, like their house. In fact, the United Kingdom\u2019s government considers place of death to be a key indicator for quality of end of life care. Now a report written by Principal Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham Kristin Pollock suggests that a patient\u2019s home may not be \u201cthe best and preferred place of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen patients wish to die at home, every effort should be made to achieve this outcome,\u201d Pollock said in a statement. \u201cHowever, until resources are in place to adequately and equitably support home deaths, the current promotion of patient choice risks raising expectations that are not realized.\u201d\n\nDue to poor quality of care and high costs, hospitals are often considered inappropriate and undesirable places to die. However, many patients, especially those suffering from distress and pain, prefer hospitals for the perceived safety it provides and effective control of symptoms. Other patients prefer transferring their care from home to hospital in order to avoid burdening their family.\n\nPollock said that accounts of the so-called \u201cgood death\u201d at home do not account for the pain and discomfort they experience. \"The person may have been alone, inadequately supported, in pain, distressed, and fearful,\" she explained. Research shows that dying in pain is a much bigger concern for most patients compared to place of death.\n\nShe added that \"focusing on place of death as the key indicator of quality in end of life care distracts attention from the experience of dying.\" She also urges \"more attention and resources to be spent on improving end of life care wherever this occurs, in hospitals or elsewhere.\" However, she does believe in accommodating a patient\u2019s preferred place of death.\n\nSince hospitals tend to be the common place of death regardless of the patient\u2019s preferences, she said that instead of \"neglecting and disregarding the hospital as a site of terminal care, much greater thought and adequate resources must be directed to enabling hospitals to provide excellent support for dying patients and their families.\"\n\nA recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that most Americans would rather die at home these days and that most families are honoring their loved one\u2019s wish. In 2010, hospital deaths accounted for 29 percent of all U.S. deaths, which was up from 32 percent in 2000. Since then, the number of hospital deaths has continued to decline.\n\nSource: Pollock K.
