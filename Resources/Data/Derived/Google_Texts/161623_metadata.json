That strain of Avian Flu lead to a human infection in Hong Kong in 1997. H5N1 became more widespread in 2003 and to date, has killed around 450 people worldwide.\n\nThe H5N2 Avian Flu is what was detected in a Kansans backyard flock of chickens and ducks in Leavenworth County in March. H5N2 has not been proven to spread to humans yet.

Those events include county fairs, the Kansas State Fair, swap meets, and bird markets and auctions.
