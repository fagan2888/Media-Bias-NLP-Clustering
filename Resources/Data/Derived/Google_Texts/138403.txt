NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Purchasing insurance to protect your home in the event of an earthquake is not a straightforward decision since premiums and deductibles are expensive.

Homeowners need to evaluate the construction of their home and how close they live to fault lines before making a decision, said Diane Beatty, regional vice president at NFP, the White Plains, N.Y. national insurance broker.

Since homeowner’s insurance does not provide coverage if your home is damaged by an earthquake, purchasing additional insurance can help consumers recoup the costs of major damage to their house and their furniture and other items.

Since a deductible is typically 15% of the value of the home, consumers would need to be prepared to pay a $150,000 deductible on a policy with coverage of $1 million before they can make claim, she said. Although it varies depending on the replacement value of the home, earthquake insurance costs an average of $1,500 to $3,000 annually for a $1 million dwelling policy.

“Not every consumer should buy earthquake insurance,” Beatty said. “Homeowners should definitely ask their insurance agent to help them make a decision.”

Talking to your insurance agent first will help you determine how close your home is to fault lines and evaluate the history of tremors in the past, she said.
