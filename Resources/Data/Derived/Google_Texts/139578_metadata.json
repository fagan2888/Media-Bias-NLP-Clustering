The Supreme Court next month will hear from arts-and-crafts giant Hobby Lobby and a Pennsylvania cabinet-making company named Conestoga Wood; owners of both enterprises say they run their businesses to reflect their deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nThe First Amendment holds that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion [the establishment clause] nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof [the free-exercise clause].\u201d Against that backdrop, the cases raise important questions of separation of church and state, equal treatment for female workers, and whether corporations, a la Citizens United, have a right of religious expression to which the RFRA applies.\n\nThey have created an outpouring of amicus briefs, mostly favoring the companies, with advice for what the court should do. But one stands out from the others because of its blunt assessment about what the justices should do with the RFRA: declare it unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cRFRA is Congress\u2019s overt attempt to takeover this court\u2019s role in interpreting the Constitution,\u201d writes Marci A. Hamilton, a constitutional scholar representing a coalition of nonbelievers and others, such as the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.\n\nThe act \u201caccords religious believers extreme religious liberty rights that yield a political and fiscal windfall in violation of the clearest commands of the Establishment Clause.\u201d\n\nThe background is a 1990 Supreme Court case. After years of decisions that accommodated religious practices, the court seemed to draw a line in a case involving Native Americans who were fired for illegally smoking peyote during a religious ceremony.\n\nThe court said it would be \u201ccourting anarchy\u201d to allow individuals to claim a religious exemption from laws that were neutral and generally applied to the rest of the population. Scalia wrote the opinion for five other members of the court.\n\nCongress responded three years later with the RFRA. It says that government may not pass a law that \u201csubstantially burdens a person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d and it requires courts to apply strict scrutiny: whether there is a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason for the law and whether it is narrowly tailored to accomplish the goal.\n\nHamilton said that the law was all about usurping the Supreme Court\u2019s power. \u201cRFRA is a formula that would make it possible for Congress to meddle with any constitutional doctrine and decision, and move the court to the sidelines as political winds shift constitutional standards by simple majority vote,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court said in 1997 that the RFRA could not be applied to state and local laws, but it has not confronted the question of its constitutionality.\n\nHamilton, a professor at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University who argued the 1997 case, said she wanted to raise the question because no one else will.\n\nAlthough some legal scholarship have raised questions about the constitutionality of the act, religious groups obviously have no reason to question it because it affords them greater protection, and the administration has raised no objection.\n\nHamilton\u2019s brief drew attention as the documents in the case were filed last week \u2014 Lyle Denniston of Scotusblog highlighted it. Although the contraceptive challenges will be one of the court\u2019s most charged cases of the term, there is little support elsewhere in the briefs for the view that the RFRA is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cAll three branches agree \u2014 RFRA is fine,\u201d said Richard Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nCongress may have criticized and been motivated by the court\u2019s ruling in the peyote case, he said, but that doesn\u2019t mean the law it passed usurped the court\u2019s role. It simply wrote into federal statutory law accommodations for religion, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the context of litigation, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations control,\u201d Garnett wrote in an e-mail. \u201cBut that does not limit the power of Congress to say, \u2018Fair enough, but we want to hold ourselves to a higher standard than the Constitution requires.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHamilton said that she is not sure how the justices will view her brief. But she said she hopes that in light of questions about the law \u2014 retired Justice John Paul Stevens said in the 1997 case that he believed RFTA to be unconstitutional \u2014 the court might consider asking a third party to brief the argument, or refer the question back to lower courts.\n\nFrom the bench\n\n\u201cThis case . . . is about donning and doffing, two good old Anglo-Saxon words that are not much used any more. Though we still sing \u2018Don we now our gay apparel\u2019 at Christmas, and I suppose a well-bred gentleman still doffs his hat to a lady.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Justice Antonin Scalia, announcing the court\u2019s Jan. 27 opinion in Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp., regarding rules about changing clothes before and after a work shift.\n\nFor previous High Court columns, go to washingtonpost.com/fedpage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A twist: Religious Restoration Reform Act first supported by Democrats is now being used to battle health care", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A twist: Religious Restoration Reform Act first supported by Democrats is now being used to battle health care", "title": "Court to review religious law once hailed by Democrats but now used to battle Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-to-review-religious-law-once-hailed-by-democrats-but-now-used-to-battle-obamacare/2014/02/02/ff59ac8c-8ab2-11e3-916e-e01534b1e132_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/03/National-Politics/Images/294680-5169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-to-review-religious-law-once-hailed-by-democrats-but-now-used-to-battle-obamacare/2014/02/02/ff59ac8c-8ab2-11e3-916e-e01534b1e132_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Supreme Court, Obamacare, contraception, contraceptive coverage, Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA, First Amendment, separation of church and state, Establishment Clause, Hobby Lobby, Conestoga Wood", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ff59ac8c-8ab2-11e3-916e-e01534b1e132", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Supreme Court, Obamacare, contraception, contraceptive coverage, Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA, First Amendment, separation of church and state, Establishment Clause, Hobby Lobby, Conestoga Wood"}, "article_summary": "The act \u201caccords religious believers extreme religious liberty rights that yield a political and fiscal windfall in violation of the clearest commands of the Establishment Clause.\u201dThe background is a 1990 Supreme Court case.\nA law championed by Senate Democrats (including one named Joe Biden) to undermine a Supreme Court ruling written by Justice Antonin Scalia has become the latest obstacle to the Affordable Care Act.\nHamilton said that the law was all about usurping the Supreme Court\u2019s power.\n\u201cIn the context of litigation, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations control,\u201d Garnett wrote in an e-mail.\nThe Supreme Court next month will hear from arts-and-crafts giant Hobby Lobby and a Pennsylvania cabinet-making company named Conestoga Wood; owners of both enterprises say they run their businesses to reflect their deeply held religious beliefs."}
