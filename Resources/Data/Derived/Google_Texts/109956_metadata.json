It could treat many of the same patients who currently take Cerezyme for the most common form of Gaucher disease, an enzyme deficiency that can cause enlargement of the liver, excessive bleeding and bruising, and bone pain.\n\nCerdelga was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Aug. 19 and will be launched in the United States this month by Genzyme, an arm of French drug maker Sanofi SA. In extensive clinical trials, the capsule relieved Gaucher disease systems by reducing fatty lipids produced by the body, allowing patients to live normally.\n\nThe cost of Cerdelga is not unusual for rare disease drugs that qualify for tax credits and patent extensions under the federal Orphan Drug Act, which covers treatments for diseases afflicting fewer than 200,000 patients. Gaucher affects only about 2,000 people in the United States, some of whom are on medications from competing drug firms. It affects fewer than 10,000 people worldwide.\n\nBut the issue of drug prices has come under a spotlight this year as a driver of rising health costs. Payments for Sovaldi, a $1,000-a-day pill to treat hepatitis C, has strained the finances of health insurers. Sovaldi, sold by California-based Gilead Sciences, costs $84,000 for a three-month treatment regimen, and cures more than 90 percent of patients. Another high-profile pill, Tecfidera, sold by Biogen Idec Inc. of Cambridge, costs $60,121 a year to treat multiple sclerosis.\n\nUnlike hepatitis C, which affects an estimated 3.2 million people in the United States, or multiple sclerosis, which affects more than 300,000, Gaucher disease\u2019s small number of patients has made the aggregate cost of drugs such as Cerezyme less of a burden on insurance providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGaucher is among the rarest of the rare diseases,\u201d said Genzyme spokeswoman Lori Gorski. \u201cThe health care system already has been taking care of people with Gaucher disease. This is not a new burden on the system. This gives patients and physicians the ability to choose the therapy that is best for their circumstances without consideration of the price.\u201d\n\nSpending on specialty pharmaceuticals \u2014 a class of drugs, including rare disease medicines, used to treat chronic or life-threatening conditions and typically high-priced \u2014 is projected to grow from $160 billion this year to $193 billion by 2017 in developed countries, according to the IMS Institute of Healthcare Informatics, a research group in Danbury, Conn. The institute cites the prices of drugs for cancer, diabetes, mental health, respiratory ailments, and pain as the fastest growing in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt poses a challenge because a lot of these drugs are really breakthroughs and they\u2019re drugs you want patients to have access to,\u201d said Brendan Buck, vice president for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming with increasingly high price tags that could become unsustainable for health plans, Medicaid, Medicare, and private businesses.\u201d\n\nIn an interview last month, Genzyme president David Meeker said the company expected to price Cerdelga in the same range as Cerezyme.\n\n\u201cWe are indifferent to whether patients take one drug or another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to create a meaningful choice for patients and doctors.\u201d\n\nGorski acknowledged the manufacturing cost of the Cerdelga pill is less than that of biotech drugs such as Cerezyme, which are produced through an organic process in giant vats called bioreactors. But she said other factors come into play in pricing a drug, such as development costs, the clinical value it brings to patients, and the rarity of the condition.\n\nShe also said the price was important to the \u201csustainability\u201d of the drug maker \u201cso Genzyme can continue to be here and innovate on behalf of unmet needs.\u201d\n\nGenzyme expects that many patients who use Cerezyme might gravitate to Cerdelga. But the new pill may also attract patients who take competing drugs marketed by Shire PLC of Lexington and a partnership of Pfizer Inc. and Israel\u2019s Protalix BioTherapeutics.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.798468177", "eomportal-id": 572729, "description": "Cambridge biotech Genzyme has priced its new pill to treat Gaucher disease at $310,250 a year for the small population of US patients suffering from the rare genetic disorder.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Cambridge", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Cambridge biotech Genzyme has priced its new pill to treat Gaucher disease at $310,250 a year for the small population of US patients suffering from the rare genetic disorder.", "zip": 2142, "title": "New Genzyme pill to treat rare Gaucher disease will cost US patients $310,250 a year - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/02/new-genzyme-pill-treat-rare-gaucher-disease-will-cost-patients-year/5thkIb587nKi7zRAb9GgxM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/09/02/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/USA-BIOTECH_GENZYMED-7592147.jpg", "state": "MA", "longitude": "-71.08138300000001", "streetaddress": "500 Kendall St", "latitude": "42.363887", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Genzyme,Cerdelga,Gaucher disease,drug prices,Sanofi SA,Genzyme Corp, Food and Drug Administration, Sanofi Sa, Gilead Sciences Incorporated, Biogen Idec Incorporated", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 01:12:07 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Genzyme,Cerdelga,Gaucher disease,drug prices,Sanofi SA,Genzyme Corp, Food and Drug Administration, Sanofi Sa, Gilead Sciences Incorporated, Biogen Idec Incorporated, Pfizer Inc, Twitter,Genzyme Corp|GENZ|NASDAQ, Gilead Sciences Incorporated|GILD|NASDAQ, Biogen Idec Incorporated|BIIB|NASDAQ, Pfizer Inc|PFE|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "b9f80672-32c1-11e4-b764-6cb36370b3ef"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11ec\"", "article_summary": "Cambridge biotech Genzyme has priced its new pill to treat Gaucher disease at $310,250 a year for the small population of US patients suffering from the rare genetic disorder.\nIn extensive clinical trials, the capsule relieved Gaucher disease systems by reducing fatty lipids produced by the body, allowing patients to live normally.\n\u201cThe health care system already has been taking care of people with Gaucher disease.\nPayments for Sovaldi, a $1,000-a-day pill to treat hepatitis C, has strained the finances of health insurers.\nThe cost of Cerdelga is not unusual for rare disease drugs that qualify for tax credits and patent extensions under the federal Orphan Drug Act, which covers treatments for diseases afflicting fewer than 200,000 patients."}
