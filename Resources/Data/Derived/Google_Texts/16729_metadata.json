Netflix\u2019s plan was seen as a challenge to that system. The nation\u2019s largest theater chains, AMC, Cinemark and Regal struck back the best they could, by refusing to screen the Crouching Tiger sequel, throwing a wrench into the master plan of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Amazing Movie Theater Remakes\n\nThe move might annoy Hastings and undercut Netflix\u2019s first foray into cinematic releases, but the days of Hollywood and theater owners reliably counting on filling their coffers from separate releases for theaters, home video, television and online streaming are clearly winding down. Netflix just sped up the process.\n\nThe Netflix Value Proposition\n\nConsider: The average movie price in the U.S. was slightly below $8 over the first three months of the year (down 5 percent from last year). For a family of four, just getting in the theater doors costs more than $30. Then there is the concession stand (where the theater itself makes its money, since ticket sales mostly go to the studios). The average cost of a large popcorn is $8.15, a large soda is $6.31 cents, and a pack of candy is $4.25. Even assuming the kids get smaller sodas, that\u2019s still another $35 or so. That\u2019s nearly $70 for one movie. A monthly trip to the theater would come to approximately $850 a year. If the family goes twice a month (hardly out of the question), that\u2019s an annual budget bite of $1,700.\n\nNow consider that with the declining cost of flat-screen TVs, a family can set up a totally decent home entertainment center for around $500 to $600. Even throwing in a solid sound system and gaming device can be done for less than $1,000 total. And that\u2019s ignoring the fact that the television would not only act as a home theater replacement, but also as an arcade, a gym, and a device to watch news, sports, weather, sitcoms, mysteries, and \u2014 you know, TV shows. Add your own bag of popcorn (that can make many servings) at about $3 and a 2-liter bottle of soda at roughly $2.\n\nEven at a conservative estimate, that home entertainment equipment would last for 5 years and potentially provide entertainment every night of the week (not just a few hours on Saturday). Throw in $100 a year Netflix subscription and the marginal cost of electricity and you are still talking about roughly $300 a year to entertain your family at home on a basically limitless basis.\n\nRelated: Netflix Isn\u2019t Joking Around with Its Adam Sandler Deal\n\nCinephiles will obviously argue that it is the intangibles that make the theater experience different, and point to the sense of community that comes with seeing a film in a social setting. But this community is a double-edged sword, with buzzing cellphones, flashing lights from text messages, chatty viewers, crying babies, small bladders that lead to blocked views and stepped-on feet, teenagers in their many, many annoying forms, all detracting from the magic of cinema. For every eruption of laughter, gasp of horror, round of applause, or moment of genuine hushed transcendence there are at least five reasons to run from the theater screaming in annoyance.\n\nBy contrast, the home experience is controlled by the family (or at least the family member with the remote). Sound can be adjusted, motion can be paused for bathroom breaks and refills, alcoholic drinks can be enjoyed, cigarettes (or other things, in Colorado) can be smoked, clothing can be optional, and the only annoying people you have to deal with are the ones you are related to by birth, marriage or friendship. You can look up who that actress is that you just can\u2019t place without the fear that some cranky film goer will yell at you to \u201cturn that damn thing off!\u201d If you are a theater talker\u2026well, first, you are a bad person, but you can do it in your own home without annoying anyone who isn\u2019t already used to your chatter.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 26 Fall Movies to Draw You Back to the Big Screen\n\nSo what can cinemas do to fight the obvious appeal of ever-improving home theaters? Well, it\u2019s hardly a new battle for movie houses. Theaters have been threatened by the television since its first reached U.S. living rooms in the late forties. The widespread use of color film, the introduction of wide images, the limited restrictions on sex, violence and profanity were all attempts to offer something that television couldn\u2019t. But TV offers all of those things now. The last \u201csavior\u201d of the cinema, 3-D, has largely landed with a thud, despite the one-off success of James Cameron\u2019s Avatar.\n\nAs such, theater owners are constantly looking to get people to come to their establishments, in ways both desperate and creative. In an interview last year, George Lucas predicted (no, no, stay with me) that as the reasons for seeing small films in the theater becomes less and less obvious, that \u201ca trip to the movies\u201d would become more like going to a concert or play \u2014 a luxury experience with high prices and an expectation that you will be blown away by the experience.\n\nIncreasingly, Lucas\u2019s words look more and more prescient.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Amazing Movie Theater Remakes\n\nPhoto Essay by Marine Cole\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Netflix lays siege to the traditional movie theater experience, the nation\u2019s theater owners have declared that they won\u2019t go down without a fight.
