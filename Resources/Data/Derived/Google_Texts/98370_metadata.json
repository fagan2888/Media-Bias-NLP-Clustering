All that material\u2014electronic health records (EHRs), test results, emails, private communications, and research\u2014needs to be stored safely and securely, and many organizations are turning to data centers to deliver.\n\n\u201cHospitals first started out with a few computers, and then they started centralizing that into a room somewhere in the basement of the hospital,\u201d says James Coe, senior vice president and director of critical facilities at Syska Hennessy Group (New York). \u201cThat room started overheating or ran out of space or power, so they had to make the room bigger or dedicated to data.\u201d\n\nToday, healthcare providers are considering a host of options to serve as the next generation of data storage, including new or renovated facilities located on or off campuses, outsourcing to third-party operators, and cloud services. Forty-three percent of architecture, engineering, and construction firms that responded to Healthcare Design\u2019s 2014 Corporate Rankings Survey reported working on data center projects in 2013, up from 37 percent in 2012.\n\nAs owners focus on compliance with changing regulations, such as HIPAA\u2019s meaningful use requirement, which incentivizes providers to implement EHR technology to improve patient care while maintaining privacy and security of that information, and as the Affordable Care Act brings more patients into the system and further increases the volume of EHRs and other information, these projects are expected to remain prevalent for some time.\n\nMaking the right choice\n\nIndustry professionals say the first step in choosing an appropriate storage option is measuring a facility\u2019s or system\u2019s current and projected critical load, or how much power computers, servers, and networking equipment are drawing. Organizations also need to identify their budget and how quickly they need to deploy a solution.\n\nAccording to a report from DPR Construction, \u201cThe Convergence of Healthcare and IT,\u201d mechanical and electrical systems account for more than two-thirds of a data center\u2019s cost, so space is typically measured in terms of kilowatts (kW) of power available for computing equipment. A large healthcare organization might need a data center with the capacity to handle more than 5,000 kW, while a midsize provider might have a need between 1,000 to 4,000 kW.\n\nIn addition to size capacity, certain data center options are faster to bring to market (such as cloud storage and collocation within an existing data center), while others might take a few months to more than a year (wholesale leasing of substantial data storage and processing capacity from a developer/provider and new construction).\n\nOrganizations that want tight control of their data and servers might look at owning as the only option. This requires a substantial financial investment for construction as well as ongoing operations and maintenance, including staffing, utility fees, and the need to update or refresh computer and server equipment and applications on an average of every three to four years.\n\nOn the flip side, owning means providers control who can access the building and when maintenance and upgrades are performed. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that can come from other people in your building who have access to your equipment,\u201d says Mark Thompson, who oversees the advanced technology market for DPR Construction (Redwood City, Calif.). \u201cIt\u2019s not just your computer equipment but the infrastructure. You can be exposed to data center outages when you had no idea someone was in there working on the switchgear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Rooms and Workspaces,Facility Planning,Healthcare Reform,Master Planning,Data Centers", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe35\"", "article_summary": "You can be exposed to data center outages when you had no idea someone was in there working on the switchgear.\u201d\nA large healthcare organization might need a data center with the capacity to handle more than 5,000 kW, while a midsize provider might have a need between 1,000 to 4,000 kW.\nIn addition to size capacity, certain data center options are faster to bring to market (such as cloud storage and collocation within an existing data center), while others might take a few months to more than a year (wholesale leasing of substantial data storage and processing capacity from a developer/provider and new construction).\nForty-three percent of architecture, engineering, and construction firms that responded to Healthcare Design\u2019s 2014 Corporate Rankings Survey reported working on data center projects in 2013, up from 37 percent in 2012.\nAll that material\u2014electronic health records (EHRs), test results, emails, private communications, and research\u2014needs to be stored safely and securely, and many organizations are turning to data centers to deliver."}
