Or it\u2019s 5 p.m., and your elderly father is confused and disoriented. You call his geriatrician, who tells you to take him to the emergency room.\n\nAt the ER entrance, EMTs are wheeling in patients on oxygen. Inside, the waiting room is packed. Someone mentions a multicar crash on the highway. As a relatively stable patient in an overcrowded ER, you settle in for a long wait. What should you know?\n\n1. High-severity patients take top priority. Rosemarie Melendez is the director of the emergency department and nursing administration at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park, Maryland. The hospital ER, which serves Prince George's and Montgomery counties, and also takes some ambulances from the nearby District of Columbia, is \u201cvery busy,\u201d she says.\n\nAs patients arrive, the triage nurse evaluates their acuity, or severity. When a high-acuity patient comes into the packed ER, \u201cit\u2019s like the stock exchange,\u201d Melendez says. \u201cYou\u2019re in the back deciding, \u2018Who am I pulling out of a bed? Who am I sticking in the hall that can wait for test results? Who needs a monitor? Who do I need to sit next to me?\u2019\u201d\n\nMelendez has empathy for the less severely acute but just as anxious patients waiting to be seen. But those in most urgent need come first. \u201cSomebody with an acute, life-threatening situation \u2013 that is emergent; that is a Priority 1 and is going to take priority,\" she says.\n\n2. You can\u2019t schedule emergencies. \u201cEmergencies happen when they happen,\u201d says William Jaquis, member of the board of the American College of Emergency Physicians. \u201cThings like chest pains or strokelike symptoms need to be treated very quickly.\u201d\n\nCustomer innovations like emergency departments posting current wait times online don\u2019t apply in true emergencies, says Jaquis, chief of emergency medicine at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. That\u2019s when you go straight to your nearest ER, where, for example, a patient with severe chest pains, stroke symptoms or difficulty breathing from asthma would go to the top of the list.\n\nIn borderline cases \u2013 you need care but you\u2019re not in imminent danger \u2013 you have more leeway to make ER choices on where and when to go.\n\n3. Overcrowding persists. In May 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported average emergency department wait times (about 30 minutes) and treatment times (about 90 minutes), which add up to roughly two hours in the ER. Patients with immediate, emergent and urgent needs are seen sooner (and treated longer) than urgent, semi-urgent or non-urgent patients.\n\nA survey released Monday by ACEP suggests the Affordable Care Act may not have relieved ER crowding as hoped. For the poll of nearly 2,100 emergency physicians, 28 percent said their ER patient volume has \u201cincreased greatly,\u201d and 47 percent said their volume \u201cincreased slightly\u201d since the ACA was implemented.\n\n4. Speaking up can help. Ilene Corina, president and founder of PULSE of New York, a nonprofit patient safety group, spends a lot of time in ERs. When her son used to have asthma attacks, Corina says, she always called ahead to see if there was a long wait, to help her decide where to go.\n\nAs minutes spent waiting in the ER turn to hours, Corina \u201cabsolutely\u201d recommends speaking up. \u201cIt\u2019s about offering help and solutions,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I make this better? How can I help my family member or the patient?\u201d Complaining isn\u2019t useful, she adds. \u201cAlways be respectful. Respectful but assertive.\u201d It\u2019s important to have a companion, an ally, in the ER, she says. \u201cPatients are vulnerable. It\u2019s intimidating; it\u2019s a scary place to be.\u201d\n\nMelendez says you should let staff know if you notice a change in condition. If you came in feeling nauseous and unwell, but now you\u2019re also dizzy, that\u2019s a change in status. If a staff member is too overwhelmed to listen, ask to speak to the charge nurse, Melendez says. A quick recheck of your vital signs may bump up your acuity level.\n\n5. Hospitals want to improve ER flow. Like many hospitals, the Washington Adventist ER includes a Fast Track area, where patients with less-urgent conditions like sprained ankles can see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. The ER has also added a Rapid Medical Exam area, where patients can have intravenous lines inserted and blood work drawn, be seen by a physician and have X-rays ordered while waiting for a bed.\n\nSome hospitals are introducing observation units, which allow unstable patients to receive care for up to 24 hours while waiting to be admitted as inpatients or discharged. The University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital, in Lexington, opened its observation unit in December. It\u2019s too soon to definitively assess the unit\u2019s impact on ER wait times, says Dr. Roger Humphries, chairman of emergency medicine. Encouraging signs include reduced used of hallway beds and steady \u201cdoor-to-doctor\u201d times, he says, despite a 5 percent hike in emergency department visits since the new unit opened.\n\n6. Quicker-care options exist. Urgent care is an option when your situation is low risk but concerning enough that you don\u2019t want to wait until the next day. Minor problems such as colds, flu, earaches and eye infections, as well as injuries such as sprains, back pain and cuts requiring stitches can be treated in urgent care. The U.S. National Library of Medicine gives general guidelines on when to call 911, go to the emergency room or consider using an urgent care facility.\n\nSome hospital systems offer apps that give ER wait times along with information such as driving directions and available hospital services. Hospitals are increasingly using online scheduling that lets patients check in at a specific time for minor emergencies rather than wait indefinitely. Options like these come with caveats that check-in times or estimated wait times aren\u2019t guaranteed, given the unpredictability of ER admissions.\n\n7. Tips to smooth the process. Experts recommend the following steps to make your ER visit go better:\n\nJaquis suggests calling your primary care physician if you\u2019re headed to the ER. He or she can help coordinate your care with the ER physician, describe any underlying medical issues and outline your current treatment and medications.\n\nBring your medical records if you can. Having your doctors\u2019 notes, lab results and imaging tests at hand saves the ER staff time they\u2019d spend accumulating that information.\n\nER wait times are cyclical in nature, Jaquis says. Mondays are busiest, spilling over into Tuesday. The end of the week is probably the least busy, he says. \u201cIf you wake up at 8:00 on a Monday and say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll see how I feel in couple hours,\u2019 don\u2019t wait. The mornings are always a little less busy.\u201d\n\nCorina advises learning about local hospitals and the services they offer \u2013 before you need them. Which facilities have cardiac units, should you ever have a heart attack? If you\u2019re having a high-risk pregnancy, can the hospital handle complications? Does the hospital even have a labor-and-delivery unit?\n\nMelendez, who\u2019s worked in the same ER for nearly 18 years, says patients today are coming in sicker, with more complex care needs and longer hospital admissions. \u201cThere\u2019s no quick fix,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to provide care to a situation that\u2019s emergent or an acute life-threatening situation we\u2019re trying to resolve.\u201d Whatever the acuity, \u201cwe want to provide you with the best care,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf I could put everyone back at one time, I would.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Coronary heart disease is caused by plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries that pump blood to the heart and other parts of the body.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "What can you do when you\u2019re last on the list?", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Lisa Esposito", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "What can you do when you\u2019re last on the list?", "title": "Enduring Really Long Waits at the Emergency Room", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/05/08/enduring-really-long-waits-at-the-emergency-room", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/fb/83/eb7da01844f1b09153bed3e2ac4c/waitingroom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What can you do when you\u2019re last on the list?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Enduring Really Long Waits at the Emergency Room - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-05-08", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b31663f/2147483647/crop/327x327%2B169%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Ffb%2F83%2Feb7da01844f1b09153bed3e2ac4c%2Fresizes%2F500%2Fwaitingroom.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "health,LTHealth [Consumer Advice],patients,patient safety,doctors,health care,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],patient advice,healthwellness [Consumer Advice],injuries,heart attacks,stroke,asthma,Lisa Esposito", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-05-08"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z99t15", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "emergency rooms, ER overcrowding, hospitals, patient empowerment, medical care, Affordable Care Act, emergency departments, ER triage, urgent care, stroke"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0eb\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s too soon to definitively assess the unit\u2019s impact on ER wait times, says Dr. Roger Humphries, chairman of emergency medicine.\nSome hospital systems offer apps that give ER wait times along with information such as driving directions and available hospital services.\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine gives general guidelines on when to call 911, go to the emergency room or consider using an urgent care facility.\nThe hospital ER, which serves Prince George's and Montgomery counties, and also takes some ambulances from the nearby District of Columbia, is \u201cvery busy,\u201d she says.\nER wait times are cyclical in nature, Jaquis says."}
