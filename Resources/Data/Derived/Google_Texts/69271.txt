AUSTIN, Texas, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Tea Party Republican, turned himself in on Monday and was booked on three felony charges involving suspected securities fraud, officials said.

Paxton appeared for processing and posed for a mug shot in Collin County, near Dallas. The contents of a sealed three-count indictment will soon be released, the Dallas Morning News and other media outlets reported.

Neither Paxton nor the special prosecutors appointed to the case have commented on the indictment. Paxton took his post earlier this year as the state's top law-enforcement official, pledging a fight against abortion, same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

A grand jury in July heard evidence presented by the prosecutors and the Texas Rangers. It then returned the indictment that includes first-degree felony charges, which can bring up to 99 years in prison.

Paxton drew national attention when he said county clerks in Texas who object to gay marriage on religious grounds can refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June requiring states to allow same-sex marriage.
