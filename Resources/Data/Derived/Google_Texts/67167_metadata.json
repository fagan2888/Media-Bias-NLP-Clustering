And why did propose to start repealing Obamacare through the use of executive power? Because...I can hear the objections from Republicans now: \"But Mitt Romney's executive orders would have been legal, President Obama's were illegal,\" they will say. Uh, how's that? It would have been legal to start repealing Obamacare by executive order, but using the Treasury Department's authority to offer transition relief in implementing Obamacare isn't?\n\nTheir position would have to be that it's okay for a cop to unilaterally repeal the speed limit but it's not okay for him to cut some slack to drivers for a temporary period after the speed limit changes. That's not an argument you can make with a straight face, but making arguments that you can take seriously doesn't seem to be something they care about one tiny bit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "My favorite thing about House Speaker John Boehner'", "title": "Memo to wingnuts: Your beloved Mitt Romney promised to start Obamacare repeal by executive order", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/7/11/1313332/-Memo-to-wingnuts-Your-beloved-Mitt-Romney-promised-to-start-Obamacare-repeal-by-executive-order", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/289/story_image/romneyandboehner.jpg?1340902442", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "My favorite thing about House Speaker John Boehner's pre-impeachment lawsuit\u2014and the rabid Republicans who support it\u2014is that even though they are now so thoroughly outraged by President Obama's de...", "title": "Memo to wingnuts: Your beloved Mitt Romney promised to start Obamacare repeal by executive order", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/289/story_image/romneyandboehner.jpg?1340902442"}, "creator": "@jedlewison", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad1a\"", "article_summary": "...since an outright repeal would take time, an executive order is the first step in returning power to the states.\nIt would have been legal to start repealing Obamacare by executive order, but using the Treasury Department's authority to offer transition relief in implementing Obamacare isn't?\nIf I were president, on Day One I would issue an executive order paving the way for Obamacare waivers to all 50 states.\nBecause...I can hear the objections from Republicans now: \"But Mitt Romney's executive orders would have been legal, President Obama's were illegal,\" they will say.\nAnd why did propose to start repealing Obamacare through the use of executive power?"}
