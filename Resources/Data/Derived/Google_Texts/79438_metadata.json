But there are several rare psychological conditions that often go ignored because they sound too weird to be true. Alltime 10s\u2019s video, \u201cTop 10 Bizarre Mental Disorders,\u201d reveals the top 10 most mind-blowing mental health conditions, from Shenkui (the fear of semen loss) to Cotard\u2019s syndrome (the belief you\u2019re a walking corpse).\n\nIn the U.S. mental disorders are common, affecting tens of millions of people each year, with only about half of those affected receiving treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental illness, affecting 40 million adults age 18 and older, or about 18 percent of the U.S. population. Generally, those with an anxiety disorder are six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders than those who do not suffer from any.\n\nThe onset of mental illness can be either from inherited traits, environmental exposures before birth, or brain chemistry. The mind is very fragile, so a malfunctioning brain can cause the person to suffer an array of unpredictable consequences. The brain is equipped with a mechanism that helps people monitor their actions and make decisions on their own, but a mental disorder can disrupt the balance of the brain\u2019s chemistry.\n\nFor example, in 2010, a British woman went to bed complaining of a migraine, and when she woke up, she found herself talking in a Chinese accent. Although she has never been to Asia, she still talks with a Chinese accent today. Unfortunately, there is no cure for foreign accent syndrome.\n\nIn Asia, specifically China, there is a rare mental disorder known as \u201cShenkui.\u201d This is seen in Chinese men who fear that a loss of semen will result in a deficiency of \u201cyang,\u201d also known as positive male energy. The men equate losing too much semen as life-threatening, leading some to refrain from sexual activity completely. This fear and anxiety leads to dizziness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction with no physical cause. This mental disorder is also attributed to a lack of proper sex education, but it can easily be treated with therapy.\n\nWhile some mental disorders cause people to talk differently or fear their own bodily secretions, others convince people that they\u2019re actually dead. Patients suffering from Cotard\u2019s syndrome, or walking corpse syndrome, believe that they are dead. They become disconnected with reality and start to believe their body parts don\u2019t exist. As a result, many end up dying of starvation because they feel they no longer have to eat.\n\nAlthough hard to wrap your head around, these bizarre mental disorders actually do exist.\n\nClick on the video above to see the complete top 10 list to believe it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "10, mind, blowing, mental, disorders, you, probably, didnt, know, existed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "These psychological disorders, from fear of semen loss to walking corpse syndrome, are so bizarre you probably didn't know they existed.", "title": "10 Mental Disorders You Probably Didn't Know Existed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/10-mind-blowing-mental-disorders-you-probably-didnt-know-existed-334726", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/22/10-mind-blowing-mental-disorders-you-probably-didnt-know-existed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These psychological disorders, from fear of semen loss to walking corpse syndrome, are so bizarre you probably didn't know they existed.", "title": "10 Mental Disorders You Probably Didn't Know Existed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/10-mind-blowing-mental-disorders-you-probably-didnt-know-existed-334726", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/22/10-mind-blowing-mental-disorders-you-probably-didnt-know-existed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/22/10-mind-blowing-mental-disorders-you-probably-didnt-know-existed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-05-22T17:20:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T17:17:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "These psychological disorders, from fear of semen loss to walking corpse syndrome, are so bizarre you probably didn't know they existed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4763\"", "article_summary": "Psychological disorders like bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia are all common conditions discussed in mental health.\nAlthough hard to wrap your head around, these bizarre mental disorders actually do exist.\nIn the U.S. mental disorders are common, affecting tens of millions of people each year, with only about half of those affected receiving treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nThis mental disorder is also attributed to a lack of proper sex education, but it can easily be treated with therapy.\nAlltime 10s\u2019s video, \u201cTop 10 Bizarre Mental Disorders,\u201d reveals the top 10 most mind-blowing mental health conditions, from Shenkui (the fear of semen loss) to Cotard\u2019s syndrome (the belief you\u2019re a walking corpse)."}
