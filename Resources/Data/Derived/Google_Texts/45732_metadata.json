When JoAnne Nagler of Burlingame signed up for health insurance through Covered California early last year, she had no idea that an apparent $1,539 billing mistake would take her down a rabbit hole of paperwork, phone calls, appeals and erroneous tax forms that would consume more than 50 hours of her life and prevent her from filing her 2015 tax return on time.  Nagler and her husband are not the first to run into tax troubles involving Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, set up under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.  In late February, tens of thousands of Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente customers who enrolled through Covered California received erroneous tax forms saying they did not have health insurance last year when they actually did.    Because Covered California is an independent public entity within state government, when consumers have trouble, it\u2019s hard to know where to turn.  Unlike many other government agencies, Covered California has no consumer advocate or ombudsman.  Covered California spokesman Dana Howard said, \u201cWe are tenaciously working on a satisfactory resolution for the customer; however, this is an atypical case with complexities that have required more time than we would like to see.\u201d  People who buy individual health insurance through a government marketplace such as Covered California can get premium subsidies if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level for their household size.  The subsidy for each year is based on that year\u2019s adjusted gross income, which many people \u2014 especially the self- employed \u2014 don\u2019t know for certain until the year is over and they do their taxes.  When you do your taxes for the year, you figure out how much tax credit you should have received, based on your actual income, and compare it with how much you actually got each month.  If you don\u2019t want to run the risk of having to pay back money, you can pay your full insurance premium each month and get your entire subsidy when you file your return.  In February 2015, Nagler applied for a Kaiser policy through Covered California, after consulting with the San Mateo County Health System, which is listed as a \u201ccertified enroller\u201d on Covered California\u2019s website.  When Nagler called back and reported that her actual income for 2014 was just over $70,000, they told us that we were not eligible for a stipend and that we owed all the money back.  \u201cWhen appeals are submitted, DSS sorts the paperwork and then forwards the cases to Covered California staff who perform the analysis of the appeals and work towards an informal resolution,\u201d he said.  Consumers can use the appeals process to request an \u201celigibility hearing\u201d before an administrative law judge.  Howard said this second 1095-A was sent to the Naglers in error by the same unidentified vendor that sent the erroneous 1095-A forms to the tens of thousands of Kaiser and Blue Shield customers.  Kaiser would not discuss Nagler\u2019s case, other than to say, \u201cSometimes one or both of our organizations makes a mistake, and when that happens, we are committed to resolving the matter to our members\u2019 satisfaction and then working to make sure the error doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d  [...] on Wednesday, Nagler got a call from two Covered California reps.", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiumsfgate-article-7247102"}, "author.name": "By Kathleen Pender", "og": {"site_name": "San Francisco Chronicle", "description": "What happens when you mix health care and taxes \u2014 the two most complicated systems in the nation?
