Advanced Criminal Law (S1, EP5 – Oct. 8, 2009)

Pilot episodes are rarely great. With all the work of character and situation introduction, and actors still working out their characters, it generally takes a show a few episodes to find its groove. So skip the pilot. Jeff Winger is a lawyer who faked his undergrad degree and must now attend a community college full of losers, including one pretty but deeply weird blonde. Now you’re up to speed. "Advanced Criminal Law" is the first great episode of Community, opening up the possibility of a platonic Jeff and Britta while expanding the cast to include growing roles for Greendale’s three most important faculty members (Dean Pelton, Chang and John Oliver’s Professor Duncan). This episode also introduces Greendale’s pride in its most famous graduate, Luiz Guzman, and fantastic running joke character Leonard.
