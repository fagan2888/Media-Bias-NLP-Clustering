He's lived a good life. You can trust what he says,\" John Mount, another supporter said.\n\nCruz spent his time in Peoria talking his agenda like repealing the Affordable Care Act and creating jobs.\n\n\"You want to see the economy take off? Then lift the boot of the federal government off of the backs of the necks of small businesses,\" he said.\n\nBut it also didn't take long for Cruz to mention the person standing in his way. \"Illinois right now, Donald Trump and I are effectively tied. We are neck and neck in the state of Illinois.\"\n\nCruz says he is the only nominee that can beat the front runner and his supporters hope it\u2019s true.\n\n\"Trump scares me a little bit. I want someone that's going to hold themselves with dignity and respect to really represent our country well,\" undecided voter Paige Frevert said.\n\n\"I started out being a Trump fan when this all started and then I feel like he went down hill, and Ted Cruz is my next favorite,\" Brittany Yates, a Cruz supporter said.\n\nOne Trump supporter did disrupt the speech telling Cruz to go back to Canada, but Cruz used it as an opportunity to mention the recent violence at Trump rally.\n\n\u201cOne difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is I'm not asking anyone to punch you in the face,\" he said.\n\nCruz said after Tuesday's results, the Republican race will be down to two men and he said the path to the White House will be that much clearer.\n\nAmong Illinois and Ohio, the latest CBS polls have Cruz close but not winning any of them. His closest race is Illinois down four percentage points to trump.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is racing the clock wanting to grab any last minute votes he can ahead of Tuesday's primary, but he already had the votes of most of those in the crowd Monday afternoon.", "author": "Hannah HIlyard", "og": {"site_name": "CENTRALILLINOISPROUD", "description": "Ted Cruz is racing the clock wanting to grab any last minute votes he can ahead of Tuesday's primary, but he already had the votes of most of those in the crowd Monday afternoon.", "title": "Ted Cruz Rallies his Supporters in Peoria", "url": "http://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local-news/ted-cruz-rallies-his-supporters-in-peoria", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/centralillinoisproud/photo/2016/03/14/cruz2_1458009293542_7545465_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 465230923639659}, "google-site-verification": "eAOCMFjq3buzjl_-p9TvRCQMZimsrZYdWNLl9fuDIAg", "keywords": "Local News,News,Local,Top Local News Headlines,Top Stories,Top Local News", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2016-03-15T03:33:25+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T03:33:25+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e36\"", "article_summary": "\"I started out being a Trump fan when this all started and then I feel like he went down hill, and Ted Cruz is my next favorite,\" Brittany Yates, a Cruz supporter said.\nOne Trump supporter did disrupt the speech telling Cruz to go back to Canada, but Cruz used it as an opportunity to mention the recent violence at Trump rally.\nCruz spent his time in Peoria talking his agenda like repealing the Affordable Care Act and creating jobs.\nCruz says he is the only nominee that can beat the front runner and his supporters hope it\u2019s true.\nTed Cruz is racing the clock wanting to grab any last minute votes he can ahead of Tuesday's primary, but he already had the votes of most of those in the crowd Monday afternoon."}
