Why did the dam break now?\n\nThe share of the gross national product going to labor as opposed to the share going to capital fell from 68.8 percent in 1970 to 60.7 percent by 2013, according to Loukas Karabarbounis, an economics professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.\n\nEven more devastating, the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 36 percent, from 19.3 million in 1979 to 12.3 million in 2015, while the population increased by 43 percent, from 225 million to 321 million.\n\nThe postwar boom, when measured by the purchasing power of the average paycheck, continued into the early 1970s and then abruptly stopped (see the accompanying chart).\n\nStill Stagnant After All These Years Adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage increased $1.49 from 1964 to 2014. $25 Aug. 2014: $20.67 $20 Jan. 1964: $19.18 $15 $10 Wage if not adjusted for inflation $5 $2.50 \u201964 \u201970 \u201980 \u201990 \u201900 \u201910 \u201914\n\nIn other words, the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years. Starting in 2000, two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes.\n\nFirst, that year marked the end of net upward mobility. Before 2000, the size of both the lower and middle classes had shrunk, while the percentage of households with inflation-adjusted incomes of $100,000 or more grew. Americans were moving up the ladder.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter 2000, the middle class continued to shrink, but so did the percentage of households making $100,000 or more. The only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of $35,000 or less. Americans were moving down the ladder. (This downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article.)\n\nThe second adverse trend is that trade with China, which shot up after China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, imposed far larger costs on American workers than most economists anticipated, according to recent studies. And the costs of trade with China have fallen most harshly on workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder.\n\nIn their January 2016 paper, \u201cThe China Shock,\u201d David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson, economists at M.I.T., the University of Zurich and the University of California-San Diego respectively, found that\n\nIf one had to project the impact of China\u2019s momentous economic reform for the U.S. labor market with nothing to go on other than a standard undergraduate economics textbook, one would predict large movements of workers between U.S. tradable industries (say, from apparel and furniture to pharmaceuticals and jet aircraft), limited reallocation of jobs from tradables to non-tradables, and no net impacts on U.S. aggregate employment. The reality of adjustment to the China shock has been far different. Employment has certainly fallen in U.S. industries most exposed to import competition. But so too has overall employment in local labor markets in which these industries were concentrated. Offsetting employment gains either in export-oriented tradables or in non-tradables have, for the most part, failed to materialize.\n\nHigh wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and \u201cdo not experience an earnings loss,\u201d argue Autor and his colleagues. Low wage workers, in contrast, \u201csuffer large differential earnings loss, as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers.\u201d\n\nThis is why Trump\u2019s charge that China has gotten the better of the United States has gained traction.\n\nThe Shrinking Middle Class Over about the past half-century, the middle class has shrunk consistently. Before 2000, this was primarily because more Americans moved up the income ladder. But since 2000, more have fallen down. Percentage of households in the United States by income range, 1967\u20132013: Low Middle High Less than $35,000 $35,000\u2013100,000 More than $100,000 53% 45 43 40% 34 31 25 22 7% \u201967 \u201967 \u201967 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 Percentage of households in the United States by income range, 1967\u20132013: Low Middle High < $35,000 $35\u2013100,000 > $100,000 53 45 43 40% 34 31 22 25 7 \u201967 \u201967 \u201967 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913 \u201900 \u201913\n\nWhen I asked Gordon Hanson what factors provoked the populist insurgencies in both parties in this particular election cycle, he emailed back:\n\nThe recipe for populism seems pretty clear: take a surge in manufacturing imports from China and continued automation in the US workplace and add a tepid macroeconomy. The result is a combustible stew sure to sour the stomach of party leaders nationwide.\n\nThe stew, to continue Hanson\u2019s metaphor, began to boil over with the cataclysmic financial collapse in September 2008, which many people left and right felt was caused by reckless financial engineering on Wall Street. The collapse and the destruction it left in its wake was, without question, the most important economic and political event in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt was the financial crisis, what it revealed about government-Wall Street links, and the fumbling of the response to it that put the nail in the coffin of trust in government,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in reply to my questions. \u201cOnce trust in government was destroyed, those that had not benefited from the previous boom years became particularly easy pickings for populist rhetoric.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2008, Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. TARP funds bailed out major investment banks, and were also used, as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis put it, \u201cto make loans and direct equity investments to select auto industry participants, backstop credit markets, provide a lifeline to the American International Group (AIG) and provide ongoing support for government housing initiatives\u201d \u2013 but in addition, TARP insulated the very institutions and executives that caused the collapse and the disastrous recession that followed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can underestimate or underemphasize the impact of the bailout,\u201d Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think Washington think tank, told me in an email:\n\nThe widespread sense that all the elites in Washington and New York conspired to bail out the miscreants who caused the disaster and then gave them bonuses, while the rest of us lost our houses or saw their value, the biggest and often only asset of Americans, plummet, lost our jobs or saw them frozen and stagnant, and then saw gaping inequality grow even more, is just palpable.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2010, the Supreme Court granted those in upper income brackets additional privileges in its Citizens United decision (buttressed by subsequent lower court rulings) that allowed wealthy individuals, corporations and unions to make unlimited political contributions. By opening the door to the creation of Super PACs and giving Wall Street and other major financial sectors new ways to buy political outcomes, the courts gave the impression, to say the least, that they favored establishment interests over those of the less well off.\n\nA Bloomberg poll last September found that 78 percent of voters would like to see Citizens United overturned, and this view held across a range of partisan loyalties: Republicans at 80 percent; Democrats at 83; and independents at 71.\n\nIn March 2010, two months after Citizens United was decided, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, a program many in the white middle and working classes perceived as reducing their own medical care in order to provide health coverage to the disproportionately minority poor.\n\nBy the midterm elections of 2010, voter dissatisfaction among whites found expression in the Tea Party movement, which produced the sweeping defeat of Democrats in competitive congressional districts as well as of moderate and center-right Republicans in primary contests.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160301222828, "twitter": {"description": "What made it all come together for the Republican presidential frontrunner in 2016.", "title": "Why Trump Now?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/opinion/campaign-stops/why-trump-now.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004245111"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/02/opinion/02edsallWeb/02edsallWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/opinion/campaign-stops/why-trump-now.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004245111", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/opinion/campaign-stops/why-trump-now.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 1, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Trump  Donald J,Republican Party,United States Economy,Labor and Jobs,Income Inequality,Wages and Salaries,China,International Trade and World Market", "interactivegraphic": {"height": {"300": 1042}}, "news_keywords": "China", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Thomas B.
