Even though we have just finished a 2014 election with strong signs that voters are tired of extremist abortion bans, the prefilled bills for 2015 are already enough to leave reproductive rights activists chewing their nails off. Despite another failed Ohio attempt to pass a ban on abortion at the point in which a heartbeat can be detected, Kansas is prepping its own heartbeat ban proposal and Michigan Tea Party activists are discussing introducing a \u201clife at conception\u201d act . Add in longshot bills like the Missouri spousal consent bill and the Iowa 72 hour abortion waiting period and this legislative session could be another trouncing on abortion rights and access in multiple states, even without the inevitable 20-week bans, admitting privilege bills and telemedicine restrictions.\n\nThe bills filled give a view of a legislative onslaught as bad as 2011, 2012 or 2013, the three years that together account for literally hundreds of state level restrictions on abortion and birth control access. There is one major difference between 2015 and these past years, however: This time, activists know what\u2019s coming and are ready to fight it.\n\nOne good example is the battle already brewing in Tennessee, where the voters passed Amendment 1 by a small margin during the 2014 midterms. Unlike the other ballot amendments up for popular vote in the country, Tennessee\u2019s amendment language only said that the state constitution didn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion, a change that abortion opponents championed in order to pass more stringent abortion restrictions that had previously been blocked by the state courts.\n\nThe amendment itself is still in a legal challenge, with opponents claiming the state wrongly tallied the votes of people who didn\u2019t cast a vote for governor when they counted those who voted on Amendment 1. Legislators, however, are moving on as if the amendment is in effect, and are introducing new proposals that were previously struck down by state courts, including a mandatory ultrasound bill. Although the session has yet to start, local activists have already panned the not-yet-introduced bill, noting the similarities it has to a North Carolina mandatory ultrasound law that was just blocked by the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in mid-December.\n\nAllison Glass, state director for the Healthy and Free Tennessee coalition, piggybacked onto the 4th Circuit decision to argue that Tennessee should abandon their own attempts at similar legislation. \u201cThe 4th Circuit overturned the North Carolina bill based on First Amendment protections compelling speech,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis was due to the fact that the law required the person doing the ultrasound to describe the image. This same provision is included in House Bill 2, the Tennessee version introduced by Rep. Bill Womick.\u201d She goes on to say:\n\nThese bills are designed to intimidate, shame, and coerce people seeking abortion. Research show that forcing someone to undergo an ultrasound when they do not need to or to hear about the image does not change their decision, but it does contradict the principles of informed consent and interferes with the doctor-patient relationship. We do not want to see this kind of out of touch attack on health, safety and personal decision making in our state. We should learn a lesson from this case. These bills are an unconstitutional attack on reproductive freedom. Politicians in Nashville need to stop playing games with reproductive health.\n\nActivists plan to show their legislators their power, too. Healthy and Free Tennessee, Advocates for Women's And Kids' Equality and other reproductive rights and justice groups have planned a march on the capital on the opening day of the session to ensure their voices are heard and politicians know who they will be hurting if they pass restrictive, unconstitutional laws.\n\nTennessee activists won\u2019t be the only ones entering the 2015 session with a game plan for stopping aggressive anti-abortion restrictions. The Center for Reproductive Rights is hoping to see every state not just fight new restrictions coming down the pipeline, but to proactively change the dialogue and regain some of the rights that have been chipped away by medically unnecessary, ideologically-based legislation.\n\nTheir suggestions for proactive legislation that can be offered in any state was released in December, in a document entitled \u201cMoving in a New Direction: A Proactive State Policy Resource for Promoting Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice.\u201d In it, the CRR suggests pro-rights, pro-reproductive freedom:\n\nWhen our elected officials return to work next year, they should focus on advancing measures that truly support women\u2019s health\u2014and reversing the tide of laws that have trampled on women\u2019s rights and blocked their access to health care,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights in a press release announcing the blueprint. \u201cAfter years of relentless attacks on reproductive health care, millions of women across the nation are now left with rapidly disappearing safe and legal options. This new resource provides forward-thinking and innovative policies for state officials who want to put the lives and well-being of their constituents first. It\u2019s time we move forward with a clear agenda to advance reproductive health, rights, and justice.\n\nSuggestions of positive legislation to enact include \u201cexpanding abortion access, implementing the Affordable Care Act, expanding contraception access, and supporting pregnant women\u2019s rights,\u201d according to the release.\n\nIntroducing positive, pro-access and women\u2019s health affirming legislation is a no-lose situation, even in states like Ohio, Indiana, and others with super-majority GOP legislatures and Republican governors at the helm. Regardless of whether a bill will ever pass a full vote, the mere introduction of the bills provide a contrast between what pro-choice advocates believe\u2014that the decision to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth should always rest with the pregnant person\u2014and what anti-choice legislators believe\u2014that from the moment conception happens, that new unborn being has a right to life that supersedes the needs, wants or rights of the person carrying it.\n\nWe have reached the point in a number of legislatures where lawmakers are truly representing the most extreme of anti-abortion views, far more extreme than the voters they represent. Bringing in proactive bills recenters the debate back to where it belongs\u2014on the rights of the pregnant woman. It makes it clear how far away from the mainstream today\u2019s anti-abortion politicians truly have moved.\n\nGather our allies at the capitol. Fight the new restrictions even before they have been proposed. Put out our own bills to center the debate back onto the rights of pregnant people. If we focus on each of these, we can do our best to make 2015 more successful than the legislative sessions that came before.\n\nRobin Marty is a freelance writer, speaker and activist.
