The report, written by CIS fellow David North, says the Internal Revenue Service doled out $4.2 billion in what is known as the \u201cadditional child tax credit\u201d in 2010 to those using an individual taxpayer identification number, or ITIN, which is usually a signal of an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe IRS doesn't even check, because it claims the law doesn't allow it to.\n\nInvestigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN-related tax refunds were sent \u2014 including 8,393 refunds deposited to a single bank account. Mr. North said those were pretty good indications of fraud. He said the IRS should also look for cases where an ITIN filer goes from claiming no dependents to claiming four or five dependents the next year.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Dysfunctional idiocy in two vignettes.", "title": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/our-government-is-hopelessly-corrupt-dangerously-stupid-or-both/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2013/01/U.S.-Capitol-building-at-night-300x252.jpg", "updated_time": 1464112652, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dysfunctional idiocy in two vignettes.", "title": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/our-government-is-hopelessly-corrupt-dangerously-stupid-or-both/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2013/01/U.S.-Capitol-building-at-night-300x252.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ef0\"", "article_summary": "Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or BothDrudge headlines this one: Kansas Obamacare \"navigator\" has a criminal record and an outstanding arrest warrant against her according to the Daily Caller.\nInvestigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN-related tax refunds were sent \u2014 including 8,393 refunds deposited to a single bank account.\nThe IRS doesn't even check, because it claims the law doesn't allow it to.\nGovernment bureaucrats have been paying out billions in tax credits to illegal aliens, according to the Washington Times.\nHe said the IRS should also look for cases where an ITIN filer goes from claiming no dependents to claiming four or five dependents the next year."}
