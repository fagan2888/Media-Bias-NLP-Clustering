While they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, family caregivers often have a big job. Some are on call 24-7 and often they can\u2019t even take a break.\n\n\u201cOne day my mom became ill and my life changed in a moment, I knew I could not leave her alone.\u201d\n\nIris Vasquez gave up her career at age 59 to take care of her mother, Maximina, who suffers from multiple ailments \u2014 any of which could mean life in a nursing home. But Iris was determined to keep her mother at home, where she wanted to be, and out of costly institutional care.\n\n\u201cShe gave us life, helped raised our children and now I am only doing for her what she would do for any family member that needed help.\u201d\n\nEach year, family caregivers like Iris spend 37 million hours helping with bathing and dressing, meals, chores, transportation and more \u2014 like complex medical tasks including wound care, giving injections and complicated medication management. This unpaid care is valued at about $470 billion a year. But, like Iris, we know this care is invaluable.\n\n\u201cI just do what I have to for my 89-year-old mom to give her comfort and the best quality life\u2026 I do it out of love.\u201d\n\nI know firsthand from my time caring for my parents, family caregiving is not without challenges:\n\nMore than half (55 percent) of family caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the needs of their loved one.\n\nSixty percent of family caregivers also work full or part time, juggling work and caregiving duties.\n\nThree out of 10 family caregivers report providing direct financial support for a loved one, with some experiencing moderate to high financial strain as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, family caregivers have a big job, but we can help with some basic support, and commonsense solutions, to make their big responsibilities a little bit easier:\n\nthe Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act, to support family caregivers when their loved one goes into the hospital and to provide instruction on medical tasks they will need to perform once their loved one returns home\n\ncaregiver employee leave, so family caregivers don\u2019t have to worry about losing pay \u2014 or their jobs \u2014 when they need to take time off to care for a loved one\n\nrespite care, to give family caregivers a much-needed break\n\ncutting through red tape to give nurses more authority to help\n\nmaking sure caregivers have access to the right resources in the community, such as home care and adult day care\n\nhelping family caregivers navigate financial challenges by making sure power of attorney and adult guardianship laws are consistent and honored from state to state\n\nand more!\n\n\n\n\n\nYour stories are the road map to these commonsense solutions. As Iris recently said,\n\n\u201cAt times you may feel that you are in this by yourself, but you\u2019re not. There are so many people out there doing the same thing that you\u2019re doing.\u2026 Share your experiences because sometimes when you share what you\u2019re going through you never know that it could be a helping hand to the next person.\u201d\n\nAARP believes family caregivers, like Iris, aren\u2019t celebrated nearly enough. Share your story with us, your Portrait of Care. That way, the world can get a better picture of just how much you give every day.\n\nTo honor and recognize family caregivers all around the country, AARP will randomly select?* one caregiver from each of the 53 U.S. states and territories to receive a Portrait of Care, an artist\u2019s painting of you and your loved one.\n\nVisit aarp.org/iheartcaregivers to share your story and photo today.\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration (SASI) for AARP.
