Smoldering embers from a controlled burn yesterday in Kingman County rekindled in this afternoon's high winds, before getting out of control.

A representative for Kingman County said the flared up about 4.5 miles south of US-54 just across the Kingman/Sedgwick county line.

A large smoke plume was visible from radar before crews from both counties were able to get the flames under control by about 5 p.m.

One firefighter was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.
