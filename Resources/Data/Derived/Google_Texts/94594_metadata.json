McCarthy\u2019s claim in a Nov. 19 House Republican press conference continued that line of attack.\n\nMcCarthy, Nov. 19: Consumer Reports, have you ever noticed Consumer Reports to recommend you not to go to a website? They recommend Americans not to go to the website because of the fear of having fraud.\n\nIn a blog posting on Oct. 8, Consumer Reports highlighted some of the technical problems consumers were facing trying to enroll in a plan on the federal site in the early days of the rollout. The state-run marketplaces seemed to be \u201crunning much more smoothly\u201d than the ones run by the federal government, the report said. \u201cIf your state\u2019s marketplace enrollment goes through Healthcare.gov (here\u2019s our list of state marketplaces), your best strategy right now is to wait a couple of weeks and hope that the site irons out its many problems.\u201d\n\nA week later, Consumer Reports provided some detailed tips on how to \u201cget past the roadblocks'\u201d on the site to register for insurance. After providing a handful of suggestions, the blog post concluded, \u201cIf all this is too much for you to absorb, follow our previous advice: Stay away from Healthcare.gov for at least another month if you can. Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Dec. 3: Nancy Metcalf, senior program editor for Consumer Reports, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Rundown with Chuck Todd\u201d on Dec. 3 and advised that \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d to start using the site.\n\nNever, however, did Consumer Reports advise people to stay off the site due to concerns about fraud.\n\nWe reached out to Consumer Reports for clarification, and it released this statement to FactCheck.org:\n\nConsumer Reports statement, Nov. 19: A Consumer Reports blog from October advised consumers that they could wait a few weeks before visiting Healthcare.gov in order to give the government time to fix technical glitches on the site. That statement was not in reference to any concerns regarding fraud in the insurance marketplaces. Our advice to consumers looking to purchase health insurance remains the same now as it was then: The best place to buy coverage on your own is through the Health Insurance Marketplace in your state.\n\nIn fact, Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy division of Consumer Reports, issued a press release announcing the White House\u2019s \u201cinteragency initiative to protect consumers from being victims of fraud while using the upcoming Health Insurance Marketplaces, including a way for consumers to report fraud through the Marketplace call centers.\u201d In that release, the Consumer Union\u2019s director of health reform, DeAnn Friedholm, \u201cpraised the commitment to preventing fraud and taking action against those connected with scams, while reinforcing the need for education to help consumers avoid these pitfalls.\u201d\n\nDespite detailing technical problems with the website, Consumer Reports has been generally supportive of the Affordable Care Act, as was made clear in an Oct. 21 blog posting that ran under the headline, \u201cObamacare opponents have misrepresented Consumer Reports\u2019 position: HealthCare.gov problems do not negate benefits of new health law.\u201d\n\nConsumer Reports, Oct. 21: Pundits opposed to the new health care law and some media outlets have tried to suggest that our coverage of the troubled HealthCare.gov site means that Consumer Reports has turned against the Affordable Care Act. Not true. Consistent with our mission to inform and protect consumers, particularly in this complicated health care market, our advice remains the same: The best place to buy coverage on your own is through the Health Insurance Marketplace in your state. That guarantees you will get comprehensive coverage, and it\u2019s the only way you can lower the cost of your premiums and possibly even your deductibles and copayments. Doing that online in most states means registering at and shopping through the federal HealthCare.gov.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s concerns about fraud have been echoed by numerous opponents of the Affordable Care Act. House Republican leaders have claimed, so far without much evidence, that the HealthCare.gov website was launched despite \u201cserious security vulnerabilities,\u201d as the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform put it in a Nov. 11 press release.\n\nRepublican concerns about security were stoked by a nine-hour interview the House oversight committee conducted on Nov. 1 with Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Chao oversaw implementation of the website. At the interview, Chao was given a copy of a Sept. 3 CMS memo that, the committee press release said, confirmed \u201cserious security vulnerabilities present in the Federal Facilitated Marketplaces.\u201d Chao told the committee that he was unfamiliar with the memo and he would \u201chave to look into this,\u201d according to a partial transcript of his interview.\n\nHowever, at a Nov. 13 oversight committee hearing, Chao told the committee that the Sept. 3 memo pertained to parts of the website that did not go live on Oct. 1 and still aren\u2019t active, so there is no security risk from any of the issues raised in that memo.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 led by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the oversight committee \u2014 also have pointed to a Sept. 27 memo in which Chao and others wrote that the Security Control Assessment was \u201conly partly completed\u201d before the website went live.\n\nIn his Nov. 1 interview, Chao explained the phrase \u201conly partly completed.\u201d He said MITRE Corp. was hired to conduct security assessments, but it was not asked to do end-to-end security testing of the website. That is, he said, the website was tested for security controls in three parts \u2014 but not all at the same time because of the complexity of the project. Chao said the website \u201cpassed all the security controls.\u201d He acknowledged that end-to-end testing would have been \u201cideal,\u201d but he also said \u201cthat almost never happens in any project that I have ever worked on in the 20 years I have been at CMS.\u201d\n\nAt a Nov. 19 hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight, David Amsler, president of Foreground Security Inc., one of the firms responsible for monitoring the website for malicious activity, was asked about the current security status of the website (beginning at about the 3:12:36 mark). Amsler said no website is fully secure. \u201cToday I feel comfortable with the capabilities we have put in place. But I\u2019m always striving for more.\u201d Maggie Bauer, senior vice president of Creative Computing Solutions Inc., which works with Foreground Security to monitor for cyber attacks, agreed. \u201cThe system is secure,\u201d she said.\n\nBauer also said (at about the 2:59:00 mark) that there have been cyber attacks, but nothing \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d since the website went live on Oct. 1.\n\nIn his opening statement to the committee, MITRE Senior Vice President Jason Providakes said his company is not in charge of the website\u2019s security and has \u201cno view on the overall \u2018safety\u2019 or security status of HealthCare.gov.\u201d Asked if he would feel comfortable putting his personal information on the site, Providakes said in fact he had already done so. \u201cI feel comfortable, personally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e8d\"", "article_summary": "McCarthy, Nov. 19: Consumer Reports, have you ever noticed Consumer Reports to recommend you not to go to a website?\nWe reached out to Consumer Reports for clarification, and it released this statement to FactCheck.org:Consumer Reports statement, Nov. 19: A Consumer Reports blog from October advised consumers that they could wait a few weeks before visiting Healthcare.gov in order to give the government time to fix technical glitches on the site.\nNever, however, did Consumer Reports advise people to stay off the site due to concerns about fraud.\nIn a blog posting on Oct. 8, Consumer Reports highlighted some of the technical problems consumers were facing trying to enroll in a plan on the federal site in the early days of the rollout.\nHopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they\u2019ve made.\u201dUpdate, Dec. 3: Nancy Metcalf, senior program editor for Consumer Reports, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Rundown with Chuck Todd\u201d on Dec. 3 and advised that \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d to start using the site."}
