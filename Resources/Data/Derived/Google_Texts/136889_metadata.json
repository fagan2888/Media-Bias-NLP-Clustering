It\u2019s all about supply and demand.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough properties to buy, or rent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 40 per cent less on the market year-on-year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worry. If there\u2019s not enough to buy or rent you can ask what you like for it.\n\n\u201cAlso interest rates are ridiculously low, which potentially will be a problem when interest rates do go up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "HOUSE prices are on the up in south Essex in a trend that looks set to continue into 2014.", "title": "House values soar, but fears of a property bubble remain", "og": {"site_name": "Echo", "name": "House values soar, but fears of a property bubble remain", "title": "House values soar, but fears of a property bubble remain", "url": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/10907644.House_values_soar__but_fears_of_a_property_bubble_remain/", "image": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/2785410/", "type": "website", "description": "HOUSE prices are on the up in south Essex in a trend that looks set to continue into 2014."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/2785410/"}, "description": "HOUSE prices are on the up in south Essex in a trend that looks set to continue into 2014.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "House values soar, but fears of a property bubble remain"}, "vr": {"category": "News", "type": "Text"}, "fb": {"app_id": 129009113837493}, "keywords": "Echo, Essex, Southend, Basildon, Canvey, Benfleet, Rayleigh, Wickford, Billericay, Thurrock, Leigh, Rochford, Stanford, Corringham, A127, A13, pier, Castle Point, Hadleigh, Thundersley, Thorpe Bay, Southchurch, Prittlewell, Westcliff, Eastwood, c2c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Local News, Echo News, House Values Soar But Fears Of A Property Bubble Remain"}, "article_summary": "Average property prices in Thurrock are up 5.8 per cent year-onyear, while Billericay has seen an increase of 7.2 per cent.\nBalgores Property Group reckon house prices in Basildon have gone up a whopping 12.5 per cent throughout this year.\nThe figures come as Hometrack revealed Essex is in the top ten boom places across Britain \u2013 with average property prices going up 5.3 per cent in 2013.\nHOUSE prices are on the up in south Essex in a trend that looks set to continue into 2014.\nNew figures, from property analysts Hometrack show homes with SS postcodes \u2013 including those in Basildon, Southend, Rayleigh, Rochford and Wickford \u2013 are up an average of 6.8 per cent."}
