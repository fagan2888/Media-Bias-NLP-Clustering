We have seen them waive the rules that helped so many people escape welfare.\u201d\n\nI had not heard any politician compare the safety net to a \u201cspider web\u201d before, and based on a quick Google search, Bush has not made the comparison before either. It\u2019s reminiscent of Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s analogy of the safety net as a \u201chammock\u201d that traps the poor in poverty, an analogy that has been harshly criticized. But while a hammock evokes images of laziness and gives agency to the poor, a spider web suggests that the poor are trapped. With many Americans believing that Republicans don\u2019t care enough for the poor, you can understand why Bush settled on the \u201cspider web\u201d analogy.\n\nBut does Bush actually reject the \u201cmaker and taker\u201d rhetoric? At the Washington Post, Greg Sargent argues yes\u2014or at least that Bush will do so rhetorically. \u201cMessage: Jeb Bush will not be 47-percent-ed. He will not be Mitt-ed,\u201d Sargent writes. \u201cHe will present a conservative pro-economic-freedom case without committing the fatal political misstep of showing contempt for those who currently depend on government in any form.\u201d That seems broadly right, at least insofar as we can determine Bush\u2019s rhetorical strategy from one speech. Yet, it\u2019s always a tight line to blame government for making the poor dependent without actually blaming the poor themselves.\n\nAnd when Bush argues that Obama tried to \u201cwaive the rules that helped so many people escape welfare,\u201d he\u2019s harkening back to an old, disproven conservative meme against the administration. During the 2012 election, Mitt Romney argued that Obama was undoing welfare reform by offering states waivers allow them to forego the welfare work requirements, as long as they accomplished the goal of the law\u2014 moving welfare recipients to work. In fact, Republican governors had requested the waivers. The Washington Post fact checker gave Romney four Pinnochios for the baseless assertion. But Bush has brought the attack line back.\n\nOverall, Bush seemed to be trying to use the same conservative talking points and attacks, with a more positive spin. Yet, it\u2019s still hard to look at this speech and see what part of the Republican Party it appeals to, at least compared to his competitors. Florida Senator Marco Rubio has a far more comprehensive agenda at this point. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker offers a very conservative governing record and has won three statewide races in four years. Many Republican candidates have switched their economic message to focus on wages and inequality, if only to find a new attack against the president as the recovery strengthens.\n\nGranted, this is just one speech. Bush has plenty of time to deliver concrete policy proposals. But there's something telling about the ordinariness of his speech, of its generic GOP talking points. There\u2019s no natural constituency for his candidacy, at least in the primary. Bush has said that the GOP nominee must be willing to \"lose the primary to win the general.\" In other words, to avoid taking far-right positions that doom the candidate in the general election.\n\nThought about in that light, Bush's speech makes more sense. Spinning conservative talking points in a positive light, while promising a new agenda, is a campaign platform that could appeal to the full electorate. If he somehow emerged as the Republican nominee, he could be a very credible challenger to Hillary Clinton. Yet, the underlying problem remains: He has to win the nomination. His willingness to lose the primary will, in all likelihood, prove self-fulfilling.\n\nThis isn't just his problem, though; it's the Republican Party's. The primary electorate makes it hard for a candidate like Bush, who despite being extremely conservative is nonetheless moderate compared to the other candidates, to win. It forces the eventual nominee to move to the right, eventually putting himself in an almost impossible position to win the general election.
