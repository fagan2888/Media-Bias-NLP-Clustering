The AG received last year a scathing, detailed Public Disclosure Commission report that Eyman took money from initiative campaigns for personal use and illegally used money donated to one initiative to put a different initiative onto the ballot.\n\nVote Them Out is a classic example of the \"independent expenditure\" ads in politics, but such expenditures against targeted candidates must be given footprints. For instance, the Eyman videos do not contain the required disclaimer that no candidates have authorized the ads.\n\nThe Eyman campaign contrasts with a series of 30-second cable TV ads being aired by an allegedly non-partisan but pro-Republican business political group called Enterprise Washington.\n\nThe Enterprise Washington ads effusively praise of state Sen. Steve Litzow, and urge viewers to dial up the Mercer Island Republican and thank him for his multiple good deeds.\n\nEnterprise Washington is clearly listed on the ad. The group has also reported its major contributions to the Public Disclosure Commission: The Associated General Contractors have given $10,000, Washington Build another $10,000, and the Washington Farm Bureau $5,000.\n\nEyman has a record of violating public disclosure laws that goes back to a $50,000 penalty imposed in 2002. The current campaign to \"unelect\" Democratic legislators has followed a kind of catch-me-if-you-can pattern.\n\n\"Eyman has a long history of concealment, sloppy reporting and delinquent filing: He's a serial offender who continues to re-offend, election after election,\" said Andrew Villeneuve, head of the Northwest Progressive Institute. Villeneuve has spent a decade blowing the whistle on Eyman.\n\n\"Washingtonians for Ethical Government\" has informed Ferguson and Satterberg that it is giving them 45 days notice to act on Eyman's flouting of the rules.\n\nThe group said that after 45 days it will send a second notice. \"If, after 10 days following receipt of the second notice you still have not filed suit against Eyman, Washingtonians will bring an action in Superior Court,\" it added.\n\nIt's not likely Washingtonians for Ethical Government will be filing any complaints against Democrats.\n\nAs a \"board member,\" one of two listed in the group's filing, Villeneuve is an active Democrat, was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention, just elected over the weekend as a 2016 national convention delegate pledged to Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe group's attorney is Knoll Lowney, who went after the Building Industry Association of Washington in the last decade over its boosting of Republican Dino Rossi, and challenged 2012 GOP gubernatorial candidate, AG Rob McKenna, for joining in a legal challenge to Obamacare.\n\nEyman's response will be reported as soon as it is received.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "vf": {"section": "local", "unique_id": "seattlepi-article-7941013"}, "og": {"site_name": "seattlepi.com", "description": "Initiative promoter Tim Eyman is flaunting state disclosure laws in going after state legislators he doesn't like, according to a complaint sent Monday to the state Attorney General and Kind County Prosecutor.", "title": "Dems say Eyman campaign pokes disclosure laws in the eye", "url": "http://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/Eyman-Vote-Them-Out-campaign-pokes-disclosure-7941013.php", "image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/25/41/05/5640518/7/rawImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SeattlePI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 177356725623403}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A ... more Photo: Joshua Trujillo, Seattlepi.com Dems say Eyman campaign pokes disclosure laws in the eye 1 / 1 Back to GalleryInitiative promoter Tim Eyman is flouting state disclosure laws in going after state legislators he doesn't like, according to a complaint sent Monday to the state Attorney General and King County prosecutor.\nA complaint filed Monday says Eyman has flaunted state public disclosure laws.\nEyman has a record of violating public disclosure laws that goes back to a $50,000 penalty imposed in 2002.\nDems say Eyman campaign pokes disclosure laws in the eyePhoto: Joshua Trujillo, Seattlepi.com Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Tim Eyman has made a living and kept himself in the public eye through 17 years of sponsoring ballot initiatives.\nless Tim Eyman has made a living and kept himself in the public eye through 17 years of sponsoring ballot initiatives."}
