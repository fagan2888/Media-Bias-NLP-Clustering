Mike Ross (D), who drove Clinton around the state when he ran for a second term in 1982.\n\n\"When I was running for governor of Arkansas in 1982, a talented and energetic young man named Mike Ross was a big help to me and my campaign,\" Clinton wrote in the email. \"Mike drove me all over the state and I became close friends with him. I even had a hunch that someday he might run for governor himself.\"\n\nRoss\u2019s likely opponent in the general election for the seat of retiring Gov. Mike Beebe (D) is former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R), who was a leader of the effort to impeach President Clinton in 1998.\n\nRoss chauffeured Clinton around Arkansas for nearly two years, during which time the two bonded in between campaign events.\n\nRoss was a leading member of the more conservative Blue Dog Coalition of Democrats in the House of Representatives, where he served for 12 years.\n\nThough Ross opposed the Affordable Care Act and voted with Republicans for a \"forcible rape\" bill, Clinton paints his record in Congress as a more progressive one.\n\n\"In Congress, Mike fought against Republican attempts to privatize Social Security and Medicare, and he consistently voted to raise the minimum wage,\" Clinton's email reads.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Bill Clinton's tenure as governor of Arkansas. He served nearly 12 years and was elected to the job five times.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Hillary And Bill Through The Years Hillary And Bill Through The Years\n\n1 of 21 Their wedding day on October 11, 1975 Share this slide:\n\nFacebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton, who served nearly 12 years as the governor of Arkansas before heading to the White House, sent a fundraising email Wednesd...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-02-13 11:59:00 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton, who served nearly 12 years as the governor of Arkansas before heading to the White House, sent a fundraising email Wednesd...", "title": "Bill Clinton Repays His Former Campaign Driver, Arkansas Gubernatorial Candidate Mike Ross", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/12/bill-clinton-mike-ross_n_4774584.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1618520/images/o-MIKE-ROSS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton, who served nearly 12 years as the governor of Arkansas before heading to the White House, sent a fundraising email Wednesd...", "creator": "SamLachman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1618520/images/o-MIKE-ROSS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Bill Clinton Repays His Former Campaign Driver, Arkansas Gubernatorial Candidate Mike Ross", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-12 11:59:00 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4774584", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "arkansas,elections 2014,Bill Clinton,Mike Ross,governors race,campaign fundraising,campaign,arkansas politics,Asa Hutchinson,HuffPolitics blog,politics,Politics News,video,governors races,2014 election,fundraising,bill clinton mike ross", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "arkansas,elections 2014,Bill Clinton,Mike Ross,governors race,campaign fundraising,campaign,arkansas politics,Asa Hutchinson,HuffPolitics blog,politics,Politics News,video,governors races,2014 election,fundraising,bill clinton mike ross", "published_time": "2014-02-12 11:59:00 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-12 12:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0367\"", "article_summary": "Ross chauffeured Clinton around Arkansas for nearly two years, during which time the two bonded in between campaign events.\nHe served nearly 12 years and was elected to the job five times.\n\"When I was running for governor of Arkansas in 1982, a talented and energetic young man named Mike Ross was a big help to me and my campaign,\" Clinton wrote in the email.\nThough Ross opposed the Affordable Care Act and voted with Republicans for a \"forcible rape\" bill, Clinton paints his record in Congress as a more progressive one.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Bill Clinton's tenure as governor of Arkansas."}
