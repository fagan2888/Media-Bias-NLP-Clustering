Conservatives cried betrayal. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cis now dead to conservatives,\u201d declared Curt Levey, president of the right-wing Committee for Justice.\n\nProgressives, for their part, were able to breathe again, even as they struggled to reconcile this term with the past decade of conservative activism. What had saved the day? Was it the sheer power and persuasiveness of liberal arguments? A collapse on the court\u2019s right flank? The impressive unity displayed by the four liberal justices, who deferred when necessary to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy? Whatever the explanation, there was the data, after all, with 56 percent of the term\u2019s decisions coding \u201cliberal.\u201d Results speak louder than explanations, right?\n\nAs a mirage in the morning light, the \u201cliberal Roberts court\u201d narrative is now fading. Chief Justice Roberts is clearly no traitor; he was, in fact, in dissent in three of the four most important liberal victories, the exception being his majority opinion in King v. Burwell that saved the Affordable Care Act. And the liberal justices were unable at the end of the term to dissuade their colleagues from dragging the court back into the morass of affirmative action; the new term will revisit a now laughably moot challenge to the University of Texas admissions plan. The chance that the court\u2019s liberals will be able to deflect a crushing defeat for public employee unions, in another case to be heard in the new term, appears vanishingly small.\n\nIt\u2019s fading, but not fast enough. The \u201cliberal Roberts court\u201d theme retains its grip, and I worry that it may become the received wisdom about the 2014-15 term as public attention moves on from the Supreme Court. On the eve of the presidential primaries, it\u2019s important that progressives not be lulled by a few welcome decisions into thinking that the court is in safe hands. The court that gutted the Voting Rights Act and hijacked the First Amendment as a deregulatory tool (remember Citizens United?) is, to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, the court we have. It\u2019s not the court we might wish we had.\n\nExplanations do in fact matter. So how to explain the seeming liberal drift? Two weeks ago, an Upshot column provided a link to one of the more illuminating academic political science articles I have read recently. The article, by Kevin T. McGuire, Georg Vanberg, Charles E. Smith Jr. and Gregory A. Caldeira, isn\u2019t new; it was written in 2007 and published in The Journal of Politics in 2009. It doesn\u2019t deal with the Roberts court, and its title, \u201cMeasuring Policy Content on the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d is not particularly inviting. It nonetheless offers an \u201caha!\u201d insight worth keeping in mind as the next \u2014 and, most likely, more typical \u2014 Supreme Court term takes shape.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe authors argue that the common practice of toting up the numbers of conservative and liberal outcomes in order to assess the direction of the court has the capacity to mislead by introducing what they call systemic bias. They go beyond a more common critique of the numbers game, which is that numbers alone don\u2019t take account of the fact that a conservative court shifts the doctrinal baseline ever rightward; a decision that codes as liberal against that baseline may objectively not be liberal at all.\n\nRather, the authors distinguish between Supreme Court rulings that affirm and those that overturn a lower court decision. They argue that on a conservative court, affirmances tend to be liberal and so should be discarded from a statistical snapshot of a given term\u2019s ideology.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150709065500, "twitter": {"description": "As if a mirage, the \u201cliberal Roberts court\u201d narrative is fading.
