He has already said Canada should see the Olympics as a \u201cpriority,\u201d and has added that Toronto is the only city in Canada with much of the sporting infrastructure already in place.\n\nToronto could be moving in just as Boston\u2019s bid is faltering with local approval running below 50 percent.\n\nBoston is in the mix with Budapest, Hungary; Hamburg, Germany; Paris; and Rome.\n\nNorth America has not hosted a summer games since 1996 in Atlanta, and from an American perspective, it would still feel like \u201chome country games\u201d with the Canadian government picking up the bills.\n\nIf a bid is approved, the COC must move quickly, as bidders must declare their intentions to the IOC by Sept. 15.\n\nToronto has many venues in place from the Pan Am Games, but lacks a centerpiece track and field stadium.\n\n\u201cToronto\u2019s a fairly well-kept secret to the rest of the world,\u201d Toronto Mayor John Tory told The Associated Press.\n\nSome of the Olympic momentum is driven by the success of Canadian athletes in the Pan Ams. On Saturday, Canada won its 197th medal, breaking its Pan Am record of 196 with a full day of competition remaining.\n\nThe Canadians will finish No. 2 in the medal table behind the United States, which is competing with what a top official called its \u201cB and C team.\u201d The Americans have won twice as many medals as anyone else in the 64-year history of the games.\n\nToronto lost two recent Olympics bids - to Atlanta for the 1996 games and Beijing for 2008. Canada has spent $2.5 billion Canadian ($2 billion) organizing the Pan Am Games, 10 times more than Winnipeg spent 16 years ago, and about three times what Guadalajara, Mexico, spent four years ago.\n\n___\n\nStephen Wade on Twitter: http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organizers want to keep the focus on the Pan American Games until rapper Kanye West brings down the curtain in Sunday's closing ceremony.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Organizers want to keep the focus on the Pan American Games until rapper Kanye West brings down the curtain in Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony.", "title": "As Pan Am Games wind down, Toronto examines 2024 Olympic bid", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/25/as-pan-am-games-wind-down-toronto-examines-2024-ol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/0a3edc332b9e3d217d0f6a706700dab4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/0a3edc332b9e3d217d0f6a706700dab4.jpg", "description": "Organizers want to keep the focus on the Pan American Games until rapper Kanye West brings down the curtain in Sunday's closing ceremony.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "As Pan Am Games wind down, Toronto examines 2024 Olympic bid"}, "Author": "STEPHEN WADE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb39\"", "article_summary": "But Canada\u2019s largest city is being overtaken by something larger than the Pan Am Games, the 2024 Olympics, and the increasing likelihood Toronto will bid for it.\nToronto has many venues in place from the Pan Am Games, but lacks a centerpiece track and field stadium.\nOn Saturday, Canada won its 197th medal, breaking its Pan Am record of 196 with a full day of competition remaining.\nTORONTO (AP) - Organizers want to keep the focus on the Pan American Games until rapper Kanye West brings down the curtain in Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony.\nToronto could be moving in just as Boston\u2019s bid is faltering with local approval running below 50 percent."}
