Both have been charged with \"participation to the activities of a terrorist group and terrorist murders,\" according to the prosecutor.\n\nIt is not clear if the remaining two detained, neither of whom have been named, have been or will be charged.\n\nFresh round of raids\n\nOn Saturday, witnesses said about 50 police officers descended on an apartment in the Brussels neighborhood of Etterbeek.\n\nAuthorities said they suspected the apartment of being a safe house, but Saturday's search turned up no weapons or explosives, the prosecutor's office said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mohamed Abrini has been positively identified as the third suspect in the Brussels Airport attack March 22, according to the Belgian federal prosecutor's office.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Prosecutors-office-Abrini-is-the-third-Brussels-airport-attacker-375138011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/559*315/Abrini.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mohamed Abrini has been positively identified as the third suspect in the Brussels Airport attack March 22, according to the Belgian federal prosecutor's office.", "title": "Prosecutor's office: Abrini is the third Brussels airport attacker"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Mohamed Abrini has been positively identified as the third suspect in the Brussels Airport attack March 22, according to the Belgian federal prosecutor's office.", "title": "Prosecutor's office: Abrini is the third Brussels airport attacker", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Prosecutors-office-Abrini-is-the-third-Brussels-airport-attacker-375138011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Abrini.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Prosecutor's office: Abrini is the third Brussels airport attacker", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Prosecutors office Abrini is the"}, "article_summary": "ET]Mohamed Abrini has been positively identified as the third suspect in the Brussels Airport attack March 22, according to the Belgian federal prosecutor's office.\nAbrini, who was arrested on Friday, has been tied through surveillance video and DNA to last November's terror attacks on Paris, which left 130 people dead.\nAbrini has been tied through surveillance video and DNA to the Paris attacks.\nFresh round of raidsOn Saturday, witnesses said about 50 police officers descended on an apartment in the Brussels neighborhood of Etterbeek.\nBoth have been charged with \"participation to the activities of a terrorist group and terrorist murders,\" according to the prosecutor."}
