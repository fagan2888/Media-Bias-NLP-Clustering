Burwell upholds subsidies to millions of Americans buying health insurance through Obamacare, but it does so in relatively bloodless language about deferring to congressional intent.\n\nBut the fiery dissent from conservative Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2014 features a number of zingers, applause lines and harshly worded criticism.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at seven of his best lines:\n\nScalia starts by bashing the majority opinion:\n\nThe Court holds that when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act says \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d it means \u201cExchange established by the State or the Federal Government.\u201d That is of course quite absurd, and the Court\u2019s 21 pages of explanation make it no less so.\n\nThen he shows how depressed the case makes him:\n\nWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d\n\nThen he questions his colleagues\u2019 motivation:\n\nUnder all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the Government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.\n\nThen he uses a word from the 19th century to criticize their logic:\n\nThe Court\u2019s next bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery involves other parts of the Act that purportedly presuppose the availability of tax credits on both federal and state Exchanges.\n\nThen he uses a euphemism for what he thinks of their logic your grandma might have used:\n\nPure applesauce.\n\nThen he suggests an alternate name for Obamacare:\n\nWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare.\n\nThen instead of ending with the typical \u201cI respectfully dissent,\u201d he writes this:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia didn't carry the majority in his fiery decision on Obamacare, but he did get off a few good lines.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Even if you disagree, he's pretty funny.", "title": "The 7 Best Lines from Justice Scalia's Obamacare Dissent", "url": "http://time.com/3935650/supreme-court-obamacare-antonin-scalia/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/supreme-court-obamacare-antonin-scalia.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/supreme-court-obamacare-antonin-scalia.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "Even if you disagree, he's pretty funny.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The 7 Best Lines from Justice Scalia's Obamacare Dissent"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "king v burwell, antonin scalia, antonin scalia obamacare dissent, obamacare, affordable care act, supreme court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "King v Burwell, Antonin Scalia, Antonin Scalia Obamacare dissent, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "But the fiery dissent from conservative Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2014 features a number of zingers, applause lines and harshly worded criticism.\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act won the battle of opinions at the Supreme Court Thursday, but critics may win the battle of words.\nBut normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.\nThen instead of ending with the typical \u201cI respectfully dissent,\u201d he writes this:\nThen he uses a euphemism for what he thinks of their logic your grandma might have used:Pure applesauce."}
