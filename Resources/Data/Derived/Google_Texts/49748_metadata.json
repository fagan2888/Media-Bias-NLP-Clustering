A competitive marathon runner, he\u2019s raced in Asia, Europe, and America. But his wife Askale Tafa has him beat: Their massive cabinet in the living room is packed with sparkling trophies, mostly hers. Fifth place, Boston; third place, Dubai; second place, Berlin. Reader Responses Excerpts from comments posted to this story: \"African runners tend to be much happier and joyful about running. This is a generalization, but they thoroughly enjoy what they do.\"\n\n\u2014Paddy_O_Door \"Part of the reason the US in not producing large numbers of great distance runners is simply that the culture at large doesn't care about distance running\u2014not like we do about basketball and football.\"\n\n\u2014JackDawkins Read all comments Not long ago, Tolo and Askale were living a very different life: herding cattle and farming in Bekoji, the pastoral, grain-producing town in central Ethiopia, several hours south of Addis, where they grew up. They moved to the capital to join a large urban running club, but they\u2019ve maintained their ties to Bekoji, capitalizing on their athletic success by opening a hotel back home.\n\n\n\nAnd they\u2019re not the only champions from their town of 17,000. Bekoji has produced seven Olympic medal-winning runners: Kenenisa Bekele and his younger brother Tariku Bekele, Derartu Tulu and her cousins Ejegayehu Dibaba and Tirunesh Dibaba, Fatuma Roba, and Tiki Gelana. Among them, Bekoji\u2019s runners have won 16 total Olympic medals\u201410 of them gold\u2014and more than 30 world championships. For some perspective: The runners from this tiny town have hauled in more gold medals than India (population: 1.2 billion) has won in all Summer Olympic categories put together, and nearly twice as many as Indonesia (population: 247 million) has. The Dibaba sisters alone have won as many medals as Syria (population: 22 million) and Saudi Arabia (population: 28 million) combined, and Tirunesh Dibaba has racked up as many golds as Pakistan (population: 179 million). Between 1995 and 2004, the legendary Haile Gebrselassie, who grew up in the nearby town of Asella, held the world record for the 10,000 meters for all but two years. Kenenisa Bekele broke Gebrselassie\u2019s record 10 years ago, and he\u2019s held it ever since. This single-minded devotion is easy to see on the streets of Bekoji. Almost everyone in town\u2014whatever his or her profession\u2014wears running shoes, and people regularly gather in shops with TVs to watch major running events, especially when Ethiopians are competing. Tolo has a brother and sister who are runners, and his wife\u2019s brother is one, too. The runners from this tiny town have hauled in more gold medals than India has won in all Summer Olympic categories put together. After I arrived in town, an arduous three-bus journey from the capital, I explored the track-and-field mecca at the crack of dawn, the time when Bekoji\u2019s forests pulse with hundreds of casual and serious runners. The town is fantastically beautiful, surrounded by lush fields and green, cloud-tipped mountains. There is one main thoroughfare and market, and simple mud huts mingle with small, modern buildings that have electricity and running water. Everywhere you go, you\u2019re flanked by animals\u2014horses, donkeys, goats, cows, sheep, and stray dogs. On rare occasions, tourists and foreign journalists visit as well, seeking answers about the runners\u2019 town. If Bekoji were simply home to a good runner or two, it wouldn\u2019t be such an anomaly. Ethiopia as a whole has been renowned for its runners since Abebe Bikila\u2014who came from a village in the Shewa region, northeast of Addis\u2014won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Not only did he break the world record for the event and become the first sub-Saharan African to win an Olympic gold, but he did it running barefoot. Bikila stunned the world again at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics when he won another gold only six weeks after undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis. Since 1960, Ethiopia has won 44 Summer Olympic medals\u2014all in races 3,000 meters or longer, and mostly over the past 15 years.\n\nThe phenomenon extends southward to neighboring Kenya as well. Middle- and long-distance runners from these two countries now hold more than 90 percent of the all-time world records and current top-10 world rankings for their events. Ethiopia\u2019s most accomplished runners tend to hail from the Shewa and Arsi zones (Bekoji is in Arsi), while Kenya\u2019s best are usually from Nandi county. All these regions run along the steep edges of the Great Rift Valley, at elevations of 6,500 feet or more.\n\nIn his book The Sports Gene, the Sports Illustrated writer David Epstein offered an evolutionary explanation for East Africa\u2019s disproportionate success in distance racing. Citing the work of researchers such as the University of Glasgow biologist Yannis Pitsiladis, Epstein wrote that the ethnic groups producing the region\u2019s top distance runners are descended from tribes who lived in the Nile Valley, and, over generations, adapted to the hot, dry climate, which tends to produce people with long, thin limbs that cool down easily. He noted that runners with slender calves and ankles expend less energy when racing, and that runners training at just the right high elevation\u2014around 6,000 to 9,000 feet\u2014use oxygen more efficiently by producing additional red blood cells. Other theories credit these runners\u2019 diets, or, as one study by Pitsiladis and another scholar put it, their \u201cfavorable skeletal-muscle-fiber composition and oxidative enzyme profile.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Bekoji\u2019s runners are exceptional even by the standards of this extraordinary region. Tolo explained that rural life cultivates strong, disciplined people\u2014crucial characteristics for long-distance runners. Running, often barefoot, is simply a part of life in Bekoji. (In town, most people wear shoes, but farmers and shepherds frequently forgo them.) \u201cWe are running everywhere,\u201d Tolo said, whether it\u2019s shepherding farm animals or simply getting from point A to B in a town with virtually no cars. And if altitude helps build endurance, Bekoji has that going for it as well: It\u2019s higher than many other towns in the Great Rift Valley, at more than 9,000 feet above sea level. Runners train in thin highland air (what some residents call \u201chealing air\u201d), which makes racing at lower altitudes relatively easy. The forest also serves as a natural training ground; runners zigzag between the trees and use their roots as an obstacle course. Of course, just under half the world\u2019s population lives in rural areas, and many people live at high altitudes. Yet the planet has few Bekojis. What is unique about the town is its coach Sentayehu Eshetu, who trained most of Bekoji\u2019s most successful runners. Sentayehu grew up far from Bekoji, in the eastern Ethiopian city of Harar. He was a gym teacher there, but had to flee his hometown after Ethiopia\u2019s war with Somalia in the late 1970s. The 57-year-old coach has a knack for picking champions, though he was never a professional runner himself. \u201cI can tell a great athlete just by looking at them,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nI meet Sentayehu at an outdoor table at Hotel Wabe, the establishment Askale and Tolo opened two years ago. The coach\u2014looking the part in his baseball cap, light windbreaker, and white running shoes\u2014ticks off the qualities he looks for in a champion: running technique, posture, body type, discipline, and general health. \u201cThe first thing is the desire of the athlete,\u201d he adds. As he speaks, passersby pay their respects, curious onlookers peer through the fence surrounding the hotel, and shepherds crack their whips in the distance.\n\nSentayehu discovered Derartu Tulu, the first of Bekoji\u2019s most successful runners, almost 30 years ago, when she was only 14. At the time, Sentayehu was working as a gym teacher at a school in Bekoji. Derartu\u2014who went on to compete in the 1992 Barcelona games, where she became the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal\u2014was a fierce competitor even as a young teenager. \u201cThere was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to win,\u201d Sentayehu recalls. He began to personally train Derartu according to his own specially designed program, and he\u2019s been training other athletes that way ever since. The coach ticks off the qualities he looks for: technique, posture, body type, and discipline. \u201cThe first thing is the desire of the athlete,\u201d he adds. Derartu\u2019s success inspired runners like Kenenisa Bekele, who started training seriously at age 18 when Derartu was already famous. By that time, Ethiopian runners had other role models to motivate them: Sentayehu explains that running became popular in Ethiopia after Abebe Bikila won the Olympic marathon in 1960. Abebe \u201cmade Ethiopia\u2019s flag known to the world,\u201d he explains. But when Bekoji\u2019s own runners began winning international competitions, it had a galvanizing effect on the whole town. Beyecha Bekele, the father of Olympic medalists Kenenisa and Tariku, is grateful for the success his older son enjoys as the world\u2019s reigning master of the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races. \u201cI was just an ordinary farmer, but when Kenenisa won and made our name famous, I was so proud,\u201d he says, sitting in a separate hotel Kenenisa built in Bekoji. (Few tourists visit the town but, thanks to the largesse of Bekoji\u2019s famous sons and daughters, they now have several places to stay.) Beyecha, who cuts a charming figure in his flat cap, scarf, and cane, takes no credit for his son\u2019s fame. \u201cIt\u2019s God and Coach Sentayehu that have helped him get this far,\u201d he says. \u201cSentayehu is his father. He changed Kenenisa\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, the government-run Ethiopian Athletics Federation spent more than $67,000 to open a live-in training center for young runners. Each year, Sentayehu selects 20 male and 20 female runners between the ages of 12 and 20 into his two-year training program, and many of them go on to join one of the professional running clubs in bigger towns and cities. (The training is so time-consuming that many end up dropping out of school.) Almost all come from farming families, and they don\u2019t have to pay for the training. \u201cWe just need them to be ready mentally,\u201d Sentayehu says. The coach isn\u2019t entirely dependent on the Ethiopian government for financial assistance; the Girls Gotta Run Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit, now works with local organizations to help fund the training of young runners and the salaries of assistant coaches, including Bekoji\u2019s first female coach.\n\nAfter 30 years, Sentayehu has his regimen down to a science. \u201cI don\u2019t want to toot my own horn, but I think I know how to take care of my kids,\u201d he says. The runners wake up at dawn every day to a light, carbohydrate-heavy breakfast of besso, a local drink made from barley. After a brisk workout beginning around 6 a.m. in a forest near the training center, the coach leads a discussion in which he points out mistakes runners have made and gives them advice. Throughout the week, the young athletes cycle through grueling workouts using the track in the town\u2019s stadium and Bekoji\u2019s undulating terrain, which includes rolling hills and flat stretches. Sentayehu tells his trainees to maintain good hygiene, eat high-carb foods like wheat and potatoes, rest when they\u2019re not training, and stay out of trouble. Alcohol and dating are strictly forbidden. Biruk Fikadu, 20, is one of Sentayehu\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. He\u2019s been running the 800 meters for three years, and his best time is an impressive 1:49. Tall and razor-thin, with a prominent brow, Fikadu is serious and polite. Though the weather is chilly at the outdoor table at Hotel Wabe, he isn\u2019t shivering. He\u2019s used to early-morning running in the crisp forest air.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ethiopia, where the gross national income per capita is $400 and nearly 40 percent of the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 per day, running offers a means of escape. A very successful marathoner can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from sponsorships, prize money, and fees for appearing in races (these can be as high as $250,000 per event), and many athletes start businesses back home with their earnings. Haile Gebrselassie, for instance, has amassed a small real-estate empire since his running days. And as of 2007, Tirunesh Dibaba was earning about $500,000 a year\u2014and that was before she won three Olympic gold medals.\n\nBut while Biruk grew up on a small farm in Bekoji, he says money isn\u2019t his primary motivation for winning. \u201cI want to defeat David Rudisha,\u201d he says with a smile, referring to the Kenyan Olympic champion and world-record holder for the 800 meters. \u201cThe first thing in their mind is winning. There\u2019s no thought of material gain,\u201d insists Sentayehu. \u201cWe train them to win, not to make money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The village of Bekoji, in the highlands of Ethiopia, has produced long-distance runners\u00a0who\u2019ve won\u00a016 Olympic medals in 20 years.
