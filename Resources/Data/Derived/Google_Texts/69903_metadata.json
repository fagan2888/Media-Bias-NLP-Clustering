That edifice collapsed amid the start of the 2016 campaign cycle.\n\nToday, Barack Obama\u2019s most dangerous adversaries occupy his side of the aisle. As the president seeks expanded authority to negotiate a free trade agreement with America\u2019s Asian partners, he has met unexpected resistance to this proposal from Democrats. In his effort to compel his left flank to drop their objections to this trade agreement, the president has relied almost exclusively on his diminished cult of personality to compel progressive submission.\n\n\u201cIf you were watching MSNBC and all this stuff, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Man, I love Obama, but what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Obama said on MSNBC. While this is perhaps an accurate appraisal of the average MSNBC viewer\u2019s internal monologue, it\u2019s a touch unseemly for the president to so callously expose the liberal cable news network\u2019s flagrant biases while he is its guest.\n\n\u201cWhen people say this trade deal is bad for working families, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d the petulant president continued in this week\u2019s multilateral interview with, among others, MSNBC host Chris Matthews.\n\nObama went on to note that he finds it objectionable that so many of his erstwhile progressive allies refuse to defer to his better judgment and assume that he has their best interests at heart:\n\n\u201cThink about it. I\u2019ve spent the last six and half years yanking this economy out of the worst recession since the great depression. Every single thing I\u2019ve done from the Affordable Care Act to pushing to raise the minimum wage to making sure that young people are able to go to college and get good job training to what we\u2019re pushing now in terms of sick pay leave,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEverything I do has been focused on how do we make sure the middle class is getting a fair deal.\u201d \u201cNow I would not be doing this trade deal if I did not think it was good for the middle class. And when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts they are wrong,\u201d Obama said.\n\nScorned, the president took his anti-progressive message where he is the most comfortable: A campaign setting. In a speech to those remaining parishioners who populate OFA\u2019s ever-thinning pews, the president scolded his party\u2019s activist class for \u2013 no joke \u2013 centering their campaign against the TPP on empty rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the past. We shouldn\u2019t want to. We want to make sure we win the future,\u201d Obama told about 200 activists from Organizing for Action \u2014 the reincarnation of the presidential campaign that fought for \u201cchange we can believe in.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t make change through slogans,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make change through ignoring realities.\u201d\n\nObama tore into those members of the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing for \u201csaying this trade deal would destroy the American working families, despite the fact that I\u2019ve done everything in my power to make sure that working families are empowered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy this logic I would\u2019ve had to do all his stuff for the last six and a half years and then, suddenly, just say I want to just destroy all of that,\u201d the president added.\n\nNational Review\u2019s Charles C. W. Cooke noticed that the president is abandoning the art of argumentation and is instead relying on the force of his personality to make the case for the TPP.\n\n\u201cThat he expects the public and his party to just accept that he\u2019s a perfect champion for the middle class and that absolutely anything he does is therefore the right thing to do \u2014 well, that\u2019s pretty disgusting,\u201d Cooke noted.\n\nDisgusting, and more than a little bit emotionally manipulative. Wounded, the president is not making the case for the TPP but is instead asking his former adorers why they now forsake him.\n\nThis might be the clearest indication yet that the president\u2019s strutting over this past winter, in which he attempted to recast himself as invigorated and emboldened following his rebuke at the hands of the midterm electorate, was no feint at all. Maybe he honestly believed that he could buck history and demonstrate that lame duck status was not inevitable so long as the occupant of the Oval Office possessed the will and strength of character sufficient to obviate that condition. If Obama was truly convinced of that, he was only deceiving himself.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Why hast thou forsaken me?", "title": "Today in self-awareness, Obama scolds allies:  \u2018You don\u2019t make change through slogans\u2019", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/24/today-in-self-awareness-obama-scolds-allies-you-dont-make-change-through-slogans/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T14:41:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T13:25:58+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, tpp, trade,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you were watching MSNBC and all this stuff, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Man, I love Obama, but what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Obama said on MSNBC.\nAnd when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts they are wrong,\u201d Obama said.\nI\u2019ve spent the last six and half years yanking this economy out of the worst recession since the great depression.\nWe want to make sure we win the future,\u201d Obama told about 200 activists from Organizing for Action \u2014 the reincarnation of the presidential campaign that fought for \u201cchange we can believe in.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t make change through slogans,\u201d he said.\nAs the president seeks expanded authority to negotiate a free trade agreement with America\u2019s Asian partners, he has met unexpected resistance to this proposal from Democrats."}
