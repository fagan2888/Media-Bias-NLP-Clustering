In his case the drug that worked for him was put onto the list of drugs requiring prior authorization. He had to spend endless time with the insurance company and get his doctor to advocate for him to keep him on his therapy.\n\nThe author would like to see insurance companies barred from using step therapy and prior authorization, \u201cparticularly when insurance companies are still turning profits on our premiums.\u201d That\u2019s a simple solution that will appeal to many readers. After all, the insurance company is standing in the way of what\u2019s best and also inconveniencing the patient and doctor along the way. Yet this solution too simplistic and ignores the broader context in which this situation is unfolding.\n\nAs a society we\u2019ve handed health insurers much of the responsibility for controlling costs, while also imposing a series of constraints on them that limit their scope of action. ObamaCare, which I support, takes this approach even further and puts the rest of the US in a similar position to where we are in Massachusetts.\n\nIn a more typical insurance business \u2013like life insurance or liability insurance\u2013 the insurance company succeeds by refusing to insure customers who are likely to file claims, increasing rates after claims are filed, and writing policies in such a way as to exclude most things that are likely to happen. There is regulation, but in general you\u2019ll struggle to get life insurance if you\u2019re about to die or if you flunk your medical exam, and your car insurance rates will rise if you get a speeding ticket or cause a crash. In many parts of the country, health insurance has worked like this as well.\n\nBut under RomneyCare and now ObamaCare, health plans can\u2019t charge more for people with pre-existing conditions \u2013such as depression\u2013 and can\u2019t refuse to accept business even from customers who will definitely be unprofitable. Not only that, but even when insurers do a good job of controlling costs, their profits are capped due to minimum medical loss ratio regulations. If they don\u2019t spend enough on medical costs then the excess premium is returned to the customer.\n\nBefore we place yet another restriction on cost containment methods for health plans, let\u2019s look at the broader picture.\n\nFirst, rising health care costs are a huge problem for employers, individuals and taxpayers. Have your raises been low for the last several years? It\u2019s probably because your employer is paying more for health insurance instead of giving you a salary boost. Is your town having trouble balancing its budget and struggling to find funds to build new schools or hire teachers? A big driver is the rising cost of employee and retiree health care. So it\u2019s really important to bring healthcare costs under control. Step therapy and prior authorization are reasonable ways to do it.\n\nThe price differences and impact on premiums are not trivial. The May 2014 issue of Consumer Reports compares prices of drugs before and after they go off patent. Two of the eight drugs on the list (Cymbalta and Abilify) are used for depression. After three years off patent, Cymbalta cost $27 per month for the generic v. $538 for the brand, and Ability was $45 v. $900. In other words, these generic drugs are 95% cheaper. As someone paying insurance premiums, I would rather have someone use a product that costs 5% if it works just as well.\n\nNaturally, pharmaceutical companies will push newer, higher-priced products. That\u2019s their job as profit-maximizing companies, and they have a wide array of marketing and sales tools available to them to make it happen. (Unlike health plans, pharmaceutical companies\u2019 profits are not capped.) On the other side, the health plan needs a set of tools to deploy to keep things in balance. In today\u2019s world of biologic drugs that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars it\u2019s prudent to expect most patients to step through a process of trying less expensive treatments first, especially when those treatments may work just as well or better and be less dangerous. If we want \u2013as the author does\u2013 to have fully unrestricted access, then that would require some regulation of the price of drugs. Take that too far, however, and the incentive to develop new and innovative medicines will be compromised.\n\nStep therapy and prior authorization are legitimate and even necessary tools. This doesn\u2019t mean that these approaches shouldn\u2019t be scrutinized. In particular, the author implies (although doesn\u2019t come right out and say) that he went through a series of drugs before finding the one that worked for him. If that\u2019s the case, then he shouldn\u2019t be forced to go back and try ones that have already not worked for him. But it\u2019s not clear that this is what\u2019s happening.\n\nBalancing cost, quality, access and convenience in today\u2019s healthcare system is not easy. Making things better requires something more than legislating further restrictions on health insurers.\n\n\n\nphoto credit: torbakhopper via photopin cc\n\n\u2014\n\nBy healthcare consultant David E.
