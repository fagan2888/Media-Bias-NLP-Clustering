Ligety was second, 0.33 of a second behind, and Weibrecht was third (0.36).\n\nLigety has 51 World Cup podiums and 25 wins to go along with seven world championships medals and two Olympic gold medals. That Weibrecht\u2019s only podiums came at the Olympics before Saturday was one of the great paradoxes of U.S. ski racing.\n\n\u201cOh my God, I get that question so much,\u201d Weibrecht said during the race while waiting to see if his podium position would hold up. \u201cI had two fifth-place finishes last year, which I was super-psyched about. Just to get that monkey off my back, where I don\u2019t have to field that question anymore, would be unbelievable.\u201d\n\nU.S. head men\u2019s coach Sasha Rearick has been with Weibrecht for 14 years, going back to when Weibrecht was racing the developmental Europa Cup and Rearick was the Europa Cup team\u2019s conditioning coach.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone (through) the ups and downs, the valleys and the peaks of the mountains,\u201d Rearick said. \u201cFortunately for U.S. skiing, those peaks were at the Olympics. So (Saturday) means a lot. It\u2019s a big relief to finally see him step on that podium.\u201d\n\nLigety is the reigning Olympic champion in giant slalom and will be favored in Sunday\u2019s GS, having won five of the last six World Cup GS races here (plus a world championships gold medal here last February) and winning five World Cup GS titles. Saturday marked his second World Cup podium in super-G, but he was happy for Weibrecht, too.\n\n\u201cI like to joke that he\u2019s the fastest guy in all four events for 20 seconds,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cEven in slalom sometimes, he\u2019s ridiculously fast. It\u2019s no surprise that he gets on the podium. I guess it\u2019s more of a surprise that it hasn\u2019t happened more often. It was really cool to share a podium with him.\u201d\n\nThat it came here, the home of men\u2019s World Cup skiing in the U.S. since 1997, made it that much more special. Weibrecht made his World Cup debut here in 2006. He had an unforgettable downhill run here in 2007 when he was the 53rd-ranked man in the race and finished 10thwith a hair-raising run in a snowstorm. That was his best finish in downhill until he finished fifth here Friday.\n\n\u201cI would have taken it anywhere, but to have the first podium here in Beaver Creek is unbelievable,\u201d Weibrecht said. \u201cI had my first World Cup points here (2007), got my first top-10 here, and now I got my first podium here. It\u2019s a pretty special place for me.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ted Ligety, Andrew Weibrecht place second, third in World Cup super-G at Beaver Creek", "title": "Ted Ligety, Andrew Weibrecht place second, third in World Cup super-G at Beaver Creek", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/ted-ligety-andrew-weibrecht-place-second-third-in-world-cup-super-g-at-beaver-creek/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__5dc7b93e92a8b336890f6a706700f5adp1.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__5dc7b93e92a8b336890f6a706700f5adp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T13:30:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:13:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In a snowstorm that made conditions challenging, four-time World Cup overall winner Marcel Hirscher of Austria, who excels in slalom and giant slalom, claimed his first World Cup super-G win.\nLigety has 51 World Cup podiums and 25 wins to go along with seven world championships medals and two Olympic gold medals.\nSaturday marked his second World Cup podium in super-G, but he was happy for Weibrecht, too.\nThe 29-year-old from Lake Placid, N.Y., kept one trend alive Saturday while ending another, claiming his first World Cup podium in his 117th start and sharing it with another superstar teammate, this time Ted Ligety.\n\u201cI had my first World Cup points here (2007), got my first top-10 here, and now I got my first podium here."}
