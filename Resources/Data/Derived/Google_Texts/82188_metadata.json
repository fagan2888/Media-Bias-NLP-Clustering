The bad news: They still haven\u2019t abandoned the broad consensus to perpetuate deficit spending. The \u201cdoc fix\u201d for Medicare that rolls back reimbursement cuts to providers \u2014 cuts that Congress passed to control costs \u2014 won Senate approval 92-8 last night, even though an effort to cut other areas of the budget to pay for the bill failed:\n\nAmerica\u2019s doctors can rest easy: Not only has Congress ensured they will be paid in full for the services they render to Medicare patients, it has ended the yearly ritual putting that in doubt. The Senate voted 92-8 to approve a long-term \u201cdoc fix,\u201d as the legislation adjusting Medicare fees has long been known, less than three hours before federal officials would have reduced payments to health-care providers by 21 percent. President Obama has indicated that he will sign the bill, which also extends the federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a key Democratic priority. Despite the last-minute nature of the vote, it was lauded by Hill leaders as a bipartisan triumph for both removing a yearly headache from the legislative calendar but also by implementing modest reforms to Medicare, including future incentives for doctors to deliver better care as well as premium hikes for the wealthiest Medicare recipients. \u201cInstead of kicking this important Medicare payment issue down the road again, a strong bipartisan majority in Congress voted to finally solve the problem and ensure that seniors on Medicare don\u2019t lose access to their doctors,\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement.\n\nMcConnell says this ends the \u201ckick the can\u201d on the doc-fix by ending the requirement first established in 1997 to keep the reimbursements from rising past the rate of inflation. This was an early example of Congress mistaking price for costs, and thinking that controlling the former equated to controlling the latter. (ObamaCare makes the same mistake on an industrial scale.) Thanks to lots of different factors \u2014 incentives to seek care (in part because of subsidies to do so), innovation, and sheer longevity \u2014 the costs of treatment went up a lot faster than inflation, which meant that price-fixing ended up forcing doctors to reconsider Medicare patients. That\u2019s why political pressure to reset the reimbursement rates forces an annual waiver of the 1997 restriction, and why it was pointless in the first place.\n\nSo McConnell\u2019s right about ending that little game of \u201ckick the can.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be more wrong about the major-league version of \u201ckick the can,\u201d though:\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mike Lee had introduced a potential amendment to the bill that would have subjected the bill to spending rules known as pay-as-you-go, which would have required the cost of the bill to be fully offset by spending cuts or tax increases. Lee\u2019s amendment, which required 51 votes to pass, fell short at 42-58. While both sides of the aisle agreed that the Sustainable Growth Rate \u2014 a schedule that steadily decreases payments to physicians for Medicare patients, which Congress annually prevents in a \u2018doc fix\u2019 bill \u2014 needed to be reformed, the GOP has been split on whether it should require the cost increases in the law to be entirely offset instead of increasing the budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has pegged the cost of the measure at $141 billion, while the federal government\u2019s top Medicare expert, the Medicare actuary, has warned that the bill\u2019s fixes won\u2019t be permanent. In order to pass the reform, the Senate waived the pay-as-you-go requirements that the legislation be budget-neutral, 71-29.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re still kicking the can down the road on the unsustainable fiscal structure of Medicare, and on deficit spending in general. To fix the problem of Congress\u2019 initial fix of the problem, it will cost $141 billion (although that appears to be a ten-year projection from CBO). We still, however, haven\u2019t actually fixed THE problem, which is runaway spending growth in Medicare. ObamaCare hasn\u2019t fixed it, obviously, and there seems to be no will in addressing the issue in either party. Indeed, this round of kick the can on deficit spending had overwhelming support in both parties.\n\nSo who will stand up for fiscal sanity and entitlement reform? The Washington Post notes the eight dissenters in the Senate:\n\nEight Republicans opposed final passage: [Ted] Cruz, [Mike] Lee, David Perdue (Ga.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and Tim Scott (S.C.).\n\nOne big surprise among the majority: Rand Paul. That\u2019s a change from his deficit-hawk beginnings in the Senate.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Congress\u2019 favorite pastime.", "title": "Wide bipartisan agreement on Medicare doc fix, and on not paying for it", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/15/wide-bipartisan-agreement-on-medicare-doc-fix-and-on-not-paying-for-it/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "CHIP, deficit spending, Medicare, Rand Paul,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-15T14:01:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T12:14:07+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfece\"", "article_summary": "Wide bipartisan agreement on Medicare doc fix, and on not paying for itposted at 10:01 am on April 15, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyThe good news: Congress finally found a broad consensus on an issue.\nThe bad news: They still haven\u2019t abandoned the broad consensus to perpetuate deficit spending.\nTo fix the problem of Congress\u2019 initial fix of the problem, it will cost $141 billion (although that appears to be a ten-year projection from CBO).\nIn other words, we\u2019re still kicking the can down the road on the unsustainable fiscal structure of Medicare, and on deficit spending in general.\nIndeed, this round of kick the can on deficit spending had overwhelming support in both parties."}
