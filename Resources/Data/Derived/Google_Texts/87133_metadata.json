Eddy won two state titles and was named the 4A swimmer of the year. ( David R. Jennings / Daily Camera )\n\nTHORNTON \u2014 Success isn't guaranteed.\n\nEryn Eddy knew as much. Winning state titles her first three seasons as a high school swimmer would mean nothing at her final 4A State Swimming and Diving Championships. Neither wouldn't being the favorite in her two events, because favorites wear targets for the competition to take aim.\n\nSaturday at Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center, Eddy just made one for herself, and the culmination of her Thompson Valley career was a complete bullseye, finding the rhythm of the day supplied her with the ideal arsenal.\n\n\"Some serious adrenaline,\" Eddy said. \"The finals are so much more intense than prelims, and you don't really know the effect of that until you're actually standing there, they're announcing your name, everyone you know is in the stands and your team is cheering for you. It's really just a time to put it in.\"\n\nAt meet's close, the senior had added two more state titles (now six in all), both coming with state records and All-American times, results that earned her the hardware for 4A swimmer of the year.\n\nBoth \u2014 the 200- and 100-yard freestyles \u2014 were titles she had won before. This time around, especially in the 100, it was a fight to the finish.\n\nShe cruised in the 200 free, pulling away after the first 100 and touching the wall at 1:46.95, nearly 4 seconds ahead of her closest competitor, but taking 1.39 off the standard she set back in 2013.\n\nThe 100 free was much different. It was the fastest race of the day for the lead pack, with the top trio all hitting the All-American standard. Eddy wasn't in the lead at the halfway point, but by the 75 mark, it was her race to lose.\n\nShe just wasn't going to let that happen, taking a final breath and putting her head down to the wall in notching a 50.08, .33 ahead of Brooke Stenstrom of Valor Christian and .68 in front of third-place Katelyn Kenchl of Evergreen.\n\n\"I honestly hugged Brooke and told her, 'thank you for pushing me.' She's a fantastic person in general, but having her race me like that was honestly exactly what I needed,\" Eddy said. \"It was close, so that's what I needed.\n\n\"I needed the push on the last 50. That's where I need someone to say, 'hey, if you want to go fast, you need to beat me.' That's what Brooke did for me today.\"\n\nEddy pointed out she hadn't posted a best time in the 100 free since her sophomore season, and she established a personal mark in the 200 free by nearly 1.5 seconds.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't realize what you can do until you put it all in the water like that,\" Eddy said. \"It was the perfect finish.\"\n\nShe wasn't the only Eagle to enjoy the spoils of the day. The team scored 176 points to finish fourth (Evergreen won with 368), and a major addition in points came from the swims of sophomore Katie von der Lippe.\n\nWhile Eddy was expected to win, von der Lippe made a mad push the final half of the 500 free and nearly came away with her own title to show for it, finishing in 5:04.12 to place second. It was a drop of more than 9 seconds from the day before, and she just didn't see it coming.\n\n\"It was just so unexpected to drop that much time,\" von der Lippe said, who was seeded sixth. \"I knew after the first couple of 100s I was up in the front of the pack. I figured there were two girls ahead of me, and I was thinking fourth or third, but I was never thinking second. I was really happy.\"\n\nWhen the day started, all she really wanted was to break the school record in the 100 breaststroke, which she did a few events later. Her 1:06.41 toppled the 1:07.21 set in 2005 by Lisa Schmidt, and also moved von der Lippe up the podium to fourth.\n\nHonestly, there really isn't much better than ending your day having a hard time choosing which race was better.\n\n\"I am ecstatic about getting my goal time, even more than I thought,\" von der Lippe said. \"I'm really happy for both, but the 500 is definitely my favorite of the two. It's always the greatest part of a meet when you can't decide.\"\n\nSenior Mattea Wabeke closed her Thompson Valley career with a pair of seventh-place finishes (200 individual medley, 2:08.56; 100 backstroke, 58.82). Her times were improvements from what she established coming in, leaving her with a great feeling as she exits a program that was winning state titles as she arrived.\n\nMountain View's Kelsey Vreeman performs a dive during the 4A state swim meet at the Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center in Thornton on Saturday. (David R. Jennings / Daily Camera)\n\n\"I'm really happy with it,\" Wabeke said. \"It's been incredible being part of a four-peat and then seeing how the other end of the spectrum is and swimming for fun. I really liked it all.\"\n\nKelsey Vreeman led the Mountain View charge, doing so from the diving board. After taking 13th last season, she moved up five spots as a junior, scoring a 397.20.\n\nShe threw a new dive into her set, the last one she performed, and it didn't go as she would have hoped, but she felt great about her state performance as a whole.\n\n\"It felt really good. It was a fun meet,\" said Vreeman, who set the school 11-dive record last week. \"I feel very accomplished. Before finals I was ranked sixth, and I messed up that last dive, so that's a bummer. Hopefully next year I can come back next year and do that dive and nail it.\"\n\nTeammate Hannah Morse dropped time in both of her consolation finals swims, moving up the board in the process. After earning the final spot in the 200 IM, she came back to place 11th with a 2:14.69. In the backstroke, she took 14th with a time of 59.58.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/RHpreps\n\n4A State Swimming and Diving Championships\n\nAt Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Evergreen 368, Cheyenne Mountain 276, Valor Christian 193.5, Thompson Valley 176, Manitou Springs 159, Air Academy 106, Aspen 101, Silver Creek 98.5, Windsor 94, St. Mary's 82, Centaurus 76, D'Evelyn 72, La Junta 55, Kent Denver 55, Skyline 44, Glenwood Springs 42, Mullen 37, Colorado Academy 37, Niwot 28, Eaton 28, Golden 24, Pueblo County 23, Durango 23, Ponderosa 21, Pueblo South 20, Mountain View 20, Littleton 18, Montrose 14, Pueblo Central 12, Standley Lake 10, Thomas Jefferson 4, Greeley Central 3, Salida 2, Discovery Canyon 2.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
