Presence Health selected Kaufman Hall\u2019s solution to streamline Presence\u2019s cost accounting processes and fully integrate resulting service line and population volume and cost analytics into its planning and performance monitoring. Presence Health spans multiple hospitals, long-term care and senior living facilities, and dozens of physician offices and health centers.\n\nWith Kaufman Hall\u2019s recent acquisition of Axiom EPM \u2013 an industry-leading enterprise performance management software company - it remains committed to a 30-year history of providing healthcare organizations with the consulting expertise and enabling software solutions to promote effective strategic and financial decision making. Presence Health, already a user of Kaufman Hall\u2019s financial planning and budgeting tools, will be implementing Kaufman Hall\u2019s Cost Accounting and Decision Support solution as part of fully unified performance management platform.\n\n\u201cThe ability to fully integrate patient-level costing and service line reporting through sophisticated financial planning and modeling will help our organization meet the demands of today\u2019s changing industry,\u201d said Tony Filer, CFO of Presence Health. \u201cAs an existing customer, we knew we had a very capable partner that was committed to our success. Through our evaluation process, Kaufman Hall demonstrated they have a modern software platform and the consulting expertise to help us optimize the tools and processes necessary to successfully navigate that change.\u201d\n\nLeveraging Kaufman Hall\u2019s cost accounting and service line analytics solutions, Presence Health will have insight into volume, cost, and revenue trends to better support tactical and strategic planning initiatives. Using a variety of costing methodologies, detailed patient-level costs can be efficiently computed, promoting greater visibility into the cost of care by patient encounter or population, by episode of care, and across clinical service lines. With rich data visualization and reporting capabilities built in, the Presence team will have more timely access to information to impact decision making.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of healthcare reform, understanding the cost of patient care has become a critical input to cost management initiatives as well as overall strategic and financial planning,\u201d said James Bodan, Executive Vice President of Kaufman Hall\u2019s software division. Presence Health will be joining the rapidly growing group of healthcare providers that rely on Kaufman Hall\u2019s cost accounting and service line analytics solutions. \u201cWe are excited to be working with Presence Health by providing both the expert consulting and the sophisticated software solutions needed to help their organization achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nAbout Presence Health\n\nPresence Health is the largest Catholic health system based in Illinois, created in November 2011 through the merger of Provena Health and Resurrection Health Care.
