— Buccaneers coach Lovie Smith is trying to bring Dallas Cowboys’ defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli back to Tampa Bay.

So says ProFootballTalk.

Citing an unnamed league source, PFT reported Sunday that Marinelli will soon join the Bucs as their new defensive coordinator.

Bucs officials would not comment on the speculation, but rumors of a Marinelli-Smith reunion have been rampant for weeks.

Those rumors resurfaced Sunday less than an hour after the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs by the Green Bay Packers.

That loss brought an end to Marinelli’s contractual commitment to the Dallas organization, which he has been a part of for two years.

A 41-year coaching veteran, Marinelli first came to the NFL in 1996 as a defensive line coach for the Bucs under then coach Tony Dungy.

Smith joined the Bucs at the same time as their linebackers coach, and he and Marinelli have been close friends ever since.

Marinelli spent 10 years with the Bucs, leaving in 2006 for a two-year stint as the head coach of the Detroit Lions.

Marinelli then went to Chicago, where then Bears coach Smith hired him as his defensive line coach before promoting him to coordinator.

Helping fuel speculation of a reunion was Smith’s failed attempt last year to bring Marinelli back to Tampa as a member of his first Bucs staff.

Smith wound up naming former Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier defensive coordinator, a position Frazier still holds.
