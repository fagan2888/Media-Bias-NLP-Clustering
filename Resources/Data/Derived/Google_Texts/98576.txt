Ajuba Solutions, one of the oldest business process outsourcing companies, has expanded its operations in Chennai with a new facility that can accommodate nearly 650 employees. This is the company’s fifth and the largest delivery centre in the city.

Tony Mira, Founder and Group CEO, Ajuba, said the company currently has around 3,500 employees in Chennai with plans to increase by 20-30 per cent by the year-end. The increase in number is necessitated due to a huge growth expected in outsourcing of healthcare service with ICD-10 transition from ICD-9 and the Obamacare in the US.

Ajuba, which is part of the $100-million US-based MiraMed Global, specialises in the healthcare sector, and hopes that large number of clients would seek its service when the transition will happens later this year. Post a treatment in the US hospital, the company takes over the patient’s record and processes the entire revenue life cycle, he told newspersons. Mira said the company last week acquired a US-based Healthcare Information Management Service provider On Call Consulting for an undisclosed amount. This company provides coding, which will be useful during the ICD-10 transition.

ICD-10 is the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, a medical classification list by the World Health Organization. It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.

Obamacare is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or referred to as Obamacare healthcare reform.
