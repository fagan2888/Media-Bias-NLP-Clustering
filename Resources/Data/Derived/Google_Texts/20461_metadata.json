In addition, hospitals, physician practices and other facilities should charge no more than the actual supply and labor cost for providing paper copies of medical records, according to Katherine Downing, director of HIM Practice Excellence for AHIMA.\n\n\u201cIf it costs only a dollar, that reasonable cost-based fee can\u2019t be more than that,\u201d Downing said.\n\nStory continues under map.\n\nA recent survey suggests many HIM professionals may be violating the HIPAA standard, putting themselves at risk of an Office of Civil Rights audit, Downing said.\n\nHIPAA requires healthcare providers furnish patients with a copy of their medical records within 30 days of the request. Under the HITECH Act of 2013, patients have the right to request their health information in electronic form. The fee imposed also cannot exceed the labor and supply costs of responding to the request.\n\nThe American Medical Association suggests \u201ca reasonable fee\u201d be charged for copying medical records.\n\nA recent survey by the AHIMA Foundation and Texas State University shows fees charged, particularly for supplying paper medical records, vary widely by state.\n\nOut of 313 AHIMA members who responded to the survey, about a quarter said they base their charges on state regulations. The survey findings show state fees varying from free to hundreds of dollars.\n\nSee which states charge the most for patient medical record copies. - Tweet this\n\nAbout 65 percent of respondents said they charge less than $1 per page.\n\nMore than half, 52.6 percent, said they charge for electronic copies and 64.7 percent reported they charge patients for paper copies.\n\nDowning said a member of her family was charged $200 to get medical records.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating, as far as customer service,\u201d Downing said.\n\nUnder meaningful use criteria, healthcare organizations are encouraged to offer information via a patient portal. The portals offer patients a way to directly access their medical history.\n\n\u201cWe really want to encourage patients to access their information,\u201d Downing said.\n\nHowever, half of the survey respondents said patient use of the portal systems was very low, at less than 5 percent.\n\nMany healthcare professionals simply hand patients a CD of medical records, according to Downing.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the electronic media available should drastically reduce the labor and supply costs,\u201d Downing said. \u201cMore information is stored electronically. They must have a way to provide it in electronic form.\u201d\n\nCompliance in EHRs is good among hospitals and larger entities, she said.\n\n\u201cI think where this continues to be an issue is physician practices,\u201d said Downing, who said she continues to hear complaints from patients who tell her they\u2019ve gotten the run around in trying to access their medical information.\n\nHIM professionals should evaluate practices to ensure compliance and have a procedure in place to comply within the 30-day deadline, according to Downing. Meanwhile, workers should seek to educate patients about how to access EHRs through online portals, which would eliminate the need for special charges.\n\nFor those using an EHR vendor, managers should push for tools for them to easily burn a CD of a patient\u2019s records.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/patient-medical-record-fees-violating-hipaa-standard-advocates-say", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/records%202.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Advocates are grilling healthcare providers over the prices they charge patients for electronic or printed medical records, claiming some fees may even go as far as to violate HIPAA rules.", "title": "Patient medical record fees violating HIPAA standard, advocates say"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/records%202.png"}, "description": "Advocates are grilling healthcare providers over the prices they charge patients for electronic or printed medical records, claiming some fees may even go as far as to violate HIPAA rules.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Patient medical record fees violating HIPAA standard, advocates say"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Advocates are grilling healthcare providers over the prices they charge patients for electronic or printed medical records, claiming some fees may even go as far as to violate HIPAA rules.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca960\"", "article_summary": "The American Medical Association suggests \u201ca reasonable fee\u201d be charged for copying medical records.\nHIPAA requires healthcare providers furnish patients with a copy of their medical records within 30 days of the request.\nFor those using an EHR vendor, managers should push for tools for them to easily burn a CD of a patient\u2019s records.\nMedical recordsAdvocates are grilling healthcare providers over the prices they charge patients for electronic or printed medical records, claiming some fees may even go as far as to violate HIPAA rules.\nThe American Health Information Management Association recently said health information managers should remove or reduce the cost associated with supplying patients their electronic medical records."}
