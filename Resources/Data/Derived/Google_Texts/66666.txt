A transgender woman who was terminated from her job after informing her employer that she would be transitioning from living as a man to living as a woman has reached a landmark settlement in a job discrimination case, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has announced.

Cory McCreery was fired in 2010 from Don’s Valley Market in Rapid City, S.D., and Lambda Legal filed a complaint in 2012 charging that the termination violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In addition to receiving $50,000, the maximum settlement allowable for businesses with fewer than 100 employees, the settlement will require that McCreery’s former employer post a public notice about job discrimination on the workplace bulletin board, host an annual, all-staff training on workplace protections and issue a letter of apology and letter of recommendation for McCreery.
