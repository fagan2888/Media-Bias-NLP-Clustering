Can we seriously be looking at the possibility of another government shutdown this fall?\n\nHouse and Senate leaders vowed to make short order of a stop-gap spending bill to keep the government operating beyond the start of a new fiscal year Oct. 1 before members return home again to campaign for reelection. Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) joked on Monday that she would do everything possible to keep the bill non-controversial and easy for the two chambers and President Obama to approve.\n\n\u201cRight now what I hope to be able to do is to keep the government open, to avoid a government shutdown, to do no harm and to be as boring as possible,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cBoring is my new best friend.\u201d\n\nRelated: Immigration Delay Lands Obama in Hot Seat\n\nEnter Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the Tea Party firebrand who helped provoke last year\u2019s 16-day government shutdown in a drive to derail Obamacare. He\u2019s at it again \u2013 this time threatening to block the continuing resolution over immigration policy.\n\nCruz endorsed a GOP effort to attach an amendment to the CR that would block Obama\u2019s executive order deferring the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to this country at an early age\u2014the so-called \u201cdreamers.\u201d At a news conference Tuesday, Cruz declined to rule out opposing the stop-gap spending bill if it doesn\u2019t include language rescinding the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, according to Roll Call.\n\nIn June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and who meet several guidelines, might request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible for work authorization. Cruz and many House Republicans critics contend that the DACA program is tantamount to \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: Wanted: A Top-Tier GOP Frontrunner for 2016\n\nBy forcing a vote on DACA as part of the continuing resolution debate, Cruz seeks to put many Democrats facing tough reelection campaigns on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives has stood up and led,\u201d Cruz said, according to Roll Call. \u201cLet senators go on record whether or not they support amnesty. Senators who support amnesty, or those here illegally, let them look in the eyes of their constituents before Election Day, and say, \u2018This is what I support, you let me know if you agree or not.\u2019\u201d\n\nCruz \u2013 joined by Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) \u2013 told reporters it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d to add the language to the CR, saying that lawmakers should use \u201cany tool at our disposal,\u201d according to Roll Call.\n\nA noticeably agitated Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) later told reporters that if Republicans press for a CR amendment blocking the administration program, they would be courting another government shutdown.\n\n\u201cIf I have anything to do with it? No, no, no,\u201d Reid said of allowing a vote on such a proposal. When asked what would happen if the Republican senators insisted on a vote on the immigration provision as part of the CR, Reid replied, \u201cThey have every right to do whatever they want legislatively. If they want to be the lead team of shutting down the government, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to have to do.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House and Senate leaders vowed to make short order of a stop-gap spending bill to keep the government operating beyond the start of a new fiscal year Oct. 1 before members return home again to campaign for reelection.
