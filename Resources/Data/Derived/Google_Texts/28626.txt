North Dakota insurance agent Gary L. Ihry was fined $57,500 by state insurance regulators after treating 21 clients to a Minnesota Vikings game and holding two annual customer appreciation dinners for hundreds of clients.

Ihry is part owner of Ihry Insurance Agency, which has eight offices in North Dakota and one in Minnesota. He is also the mayor of Hope, N.D.

The football game was in December 2011, and the dinners were in 2010 and 2011.

In both cases, Ihry spent more than the gift amount allowable by his stateâ€™s law, which is $50. It is also against state law for insurance agents to rebate any portion of an insurance premium.

Ihry will have a conditional license for one year, and $37,500 of his fine will be suspended as long as no other violations occur.
