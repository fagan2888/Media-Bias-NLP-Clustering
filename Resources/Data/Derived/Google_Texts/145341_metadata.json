(REUTERS/Chris Wattie)\n\n4230744\n\nDemocratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed portions of a state budget Friday that would have prevented him from accepting and using federal funding to expand Medicaid under Obamacare \u2014 but the state GOP is questioning whether his veto is lawful.\n\nRepublicans in the state General Assembly passed a budget for the upcoming year including an amendment stating that the executive branch cannot expand Medicaid unless the legislature appropriates the money for it. But Friday McAuliffe used a line-item veto power to rid the budget of language that blocked the expansion, prolonging the Medicaid battle even further, the Washington Post reports. (RELATED: After Messy Battle, Virginia Legislature Rejects Obamacare Medicaid Expansion)\n\n\u201cSecretary Hazel will have a plan on my desk by no later than September, first detailing how we can move Virginia health care forward even in the face of the demagoguery, lies, fear and cowardice that have gripped this debate for too long,\u201d McAuliffe said Friday, promising an expansion plan from Health and Human Resources secretary William Hazel.\n\nThe Democratic governor hit state Republicans for \u201crefusing any and all compromise\u201d and said he would have vetoed the whole budget if it wouldn\u2019t have led to a government shutdown. The state\u2019s fiscal year ends July 1, and the budget agreement is coming in just in time.\n\nBut Republicans may mount a legal challenge against McAuliffe\u2019s veto, according to the Washington Post. McAuliffe\u2019s veto targeted just one line of the state\u2019s entire Medicaid budget. According to state Republicans, courts have ruled that the governor\u2019s line-item veto can apply to entire budget items \u2014 but not one part of one budget. That would force McAuliffe to veto funding for the state\u2019s existing Medicaid program in order to bypass the ban on the Obamacare expansion.\n\nVirginia\u2019s heavily Republican House will likely have enough votes to overrule McAuliffe\u2019s veto in any case, but the GOP controls the state Senate by just one vote. The governor\u2019s move means the state\u2019s bitter struggle over the expansion will likely carry on for months.\n\nTwenty-two states, mostly Republican-controlled, have rejected Obamacare\u2019s costly Medicaid expansion so far.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed portions of a state budget Friday that would have prevented him from accepting and using federal funding to", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed portions of a state budget Friday that would have prevented him from accepting and using federal funding to expand Medicaid under Obamacare -- but t", "title": "Virginia Medicaid Expansion Back On The Table: McAuliffe Rejects Ban With Questionable Veto", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/20/virginia-medicaid-expansion-back-on-the-table-mcauliffe-rejects-ban-with-questionable-veto/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-13T172635Z_1_CBREA1C1CGL00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1403295129236.jpg", "height": 271}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP doubts veto's legality", "title": "Virginia Medicaid Expansion Back On The Table: McAuliffe Rejects Ban With Questionable Veto Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/20/virginia-medicaid-expansion-back-on-the-table-mcauliffe-rejects-ban-with-questionable-veto/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-13T172635Z_1_CBREA1C1CGL00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1403295129236.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-20 16:22:42", "sailthru.title": "Virginia Medicaid Expansion Back On The Table: McAuliffe Rejects Ban With Questionable Veto", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,terry-mcauliffe,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "medicaid expansion,obamacare,terry mcauliffe", "sailthru.description": "Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed portions of a state budget Friday that would have prevented him from accepting and using federal funding to expand Medicaid under Obamacare -- but t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-13T172635Z_1_CBREA1C1CGL00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1403295129236.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That would force McAuliffe to veto funding for the state\u2019s existing Medicaid program in order to bypass the ban on the Obamacare expansion.\nTwenty-two states, mostly Republican-controlled, have rejected Obamacare\u2019s costly Medicaid expansion so far.\nMcAuliffe\u2019s veto targeted just one line of the state\u2019s entire Medicaid budget.\nBut Friday McAuliffe used a line-item veto power to rid the budget of language that blocked the expansion, prolonging the Medicaid battle even further, the Washington Post reports.\nAccording to state Republicans, courts have ruled that the governor\u2019s line-item veto can apply to entire budget items \u2014 but not one part of one budget."}
