I\u2019m fourth in line to the Spanish throne.\u201d\n\nWhen a student from another group, who has been named as Pipe, told the prince that this was no excuse and he should still wait his turn, Froil\u00e1n allegedly shouted: \u201cYou shut up you f***ing chino\u201d \u2013 \u2018chino\u2019 meaning Chinese in Spanish.\n\nSpanish paper El Economista reports that various witnesses have confirmed the incident happened.\n\nThis is not the first time that Froil\u00e1n has hit the headlines. In 2012, he shot himself in the foot on a hunting trip and two years later was expelled from school after failing his exams.\n\nHe is the son of Princess Elena, eldest sister of King Felipe VI, and her ex-husband Jaime de Marichalar.\n\nFroil\u00e1n\u2019s alleged behaviour will cause a fresh headache for the Spanish monarchy, which was once the most popular in Europe but suffered a series of scandals in recent years. King Juan Carlos announced his abdication last year, handing the throne to son Felipe.\n\nThe new king and his glamorous wife, Queen Letizia, have done much to revive the royal family\u2019s image, but an ongoing corruption scandal involving Felipe\u2019s sister, Princess Cristina, continues to damage their reputation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prince Accused of Racially Abusing Chinese Student", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Prince Accused of Racially Abusing Chinese Student", "title": "Prince Accused of Racially Abusing Chinese Student - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/froilan.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-04T07:26:04-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/06/04/prince-accused-of-racially-abusing-chinese-student/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prince Accused of Racially Abusing Chinese Student", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/froilan.jpg", "title": "Prince Accused of Racially Abusing Chinese Student - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "chinese, prince froilan, racism, royal, royalty, Spain,Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-04T07:13:55-07:00", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T07:26:04-07:00", "tag": "Spain", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe King of Spain\u2019s nephew is alleged to have racially abused a student at a Madrid theme park.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe prince is reported to have become angry when a teacher challenged his attempt to jump to the front of the line, saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.\nHe is the son of Princess Elena, eldest sister of King Felipe VI, and her ex-husband Jaime de Marichalar.\nThe new king and his glamorous wife, Queen Letizia, have done much to revive the royal family\u2019s image, but an ongoing corruption scandal involving Felipe\u2019s sister, Princess Cristina, continues to damage their reputation.\nKing Juan Carlos announced his abdication last year, handing the throne to son Felipe."}
