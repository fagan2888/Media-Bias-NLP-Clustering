In doing so, he not only revealed his conspicuous lack of patriotism, but displayed an amazing lack of awareness about the country hosting him.\n\nPresident Obama discussed America\u2019s faults Friday with young Asian leaders, saying the U.S. suffers from \u201cpitfalls\u201d such as income inequality, a political system controlled by the wealthy and political parties divided along racial lines.\n\nObviously, Obama is unaware that the largest political party in Malaysia is race-based. The United Malays National Organization (UNMO) has supplied all six of the prime ministers who have run the government since the country\u2019s founding and have made Malaysia an Islamic state, despite the fact that Malays account for a bare majority of the population, with very large Chinese (22.6%) and Indian (6.7%) minorities. The country enforces quotas designed to discriminate against the Chinese- and Indian-heritage citizens in favor of the Malays, who lag in education, income, and adaptation to the demands of an industrial and commercial society.\n\nObama is almost certainly completely ignorant of Malaysia\u2019s horrific history of race-based slaughter \u2013 i.e., in 1969, when Malays roamed the streets of Kuala Lumpur and elsewhere beheading Chinese.\n\nIt is bad enough that a president demonizes his own country abroad. But to disparage our race politics in a country like Malaysia is unforgivable.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/11/obama_trashes_america_in_speech_in_malaysia.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Obama trashes America in speech in Malaysia"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda020\"", "article_summary": "I am disgusted that President Obama disparaged the United States in a speech he delivered overseas, in Malaysia, of all places.\nObviously, Obama is unaware that the largest political party in Malaysia is race-based.\nBut to disparage our race politics in a country like Malaysia is unforgivable.\nPresident Obama discussed America\u2019s faults Friday with young Asian leaders, saying the U.S. suffers from \u201cpitfalls\u201d such as income inequality, a political system controlled by the wealthy and political parties divided along racial lines.\nIn doing so, he not only revealed his conspicuous lack of patriotism, but displayed an amazing lack of awareness about the country hosting him."}
