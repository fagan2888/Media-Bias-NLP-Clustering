Pregnancy. Abortion. Abortifacient.\n\nThose words today are in a rhetorical swamp where contesting religious, medical and political views muddy understanding. And soon the U.S. Supreme Court will wade in.\n\nOn March 25, it will hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision that employers must provide insurance coverage with no co-pays for contraception.\n\nA fundamental legal question in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. is whether corporations, like individuals, have a right to religious speech. Hobby Lobby is owned by devout evangelical Christians who say they should not be forced to provide contraception services that they find immoral.\n\nWhile Hobby Lobby officials say they don\u2019t object to all contraception, they refuse to provide access to \u201cabortifacient\u201d (causing an abortion) drugs. Since the mandate covers all contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, how these methods work and whether they are abortifacients matters.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s descriptions never mention the terms \u201cabortifacient\u201d or \u201cabortion.\u201d It spells out the primary ways each method works:\n\n* Many prevent a woman from releasing eggs (ovulation)\n\n* Many prevent sperm from reaching or fertilizing the egg\n\n* A few interfere with a fertilized egg attaching (implanting) in the womb (uterus), which is essential for a viable pregnancy.\n\nThat last one is key to the objection by Hobby Lobby\u2019s evangelical owners, and it gets to the very heart of debates over when life begins, how to define pregnancy and what constitutes an abortion.\n\nHobby Lobby already provides insurance coverage for 16 other forms of birth control, including pills that prevent ovulation. But they contend their religious freedom rights would be violated if they are required to cover four specific forms of birth control \u2014 implanted devices such as intrauterine devices (known as IUDs) a contraceptive rod implanted in a woman\u2019s arm and two forms of emergency contraception commonly called \u201cmorning after pills.\u201d\n\nThey say those four methods are abortifacient because, in the words of Hobby Lobby President Steve Green \u201cWe believe life begins at conception.\u201d In their view, fertilization, conception and pregnancy are synonymous.\n\nThe federal government and major medical voices, such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, disagree.\n\n\u201cA pregnancy exists once a fertilized embryo has implanted in the uterus. Prior to that implantation, we do not have a viable pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Barbara Levy, vice president for health policy for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nLevy\u2019s group argues that emergency contraception \u201ccannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg,\u201d and that it is \u201cnot effective after implantation; therefore, it is not an abortifacient.\u201d\n\nDrugs such as RU-486 or methotrexate combined with misoprostol were designed specifically to bring a medical end to a pregnancy and are clearly abortifacient. But those are not contraceptives, Levy said, and they\u2019re not included in the mandate.\n\nLevy contends that her group\u2019s definition of pregnancy, established in 1970, \u201c is scientific. By the time I was in medical school, it was crystal clear to all of us.\u201d\n\nPublic policy has been shaped accordingly.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion and public health data, points out that federal regulations that block the use of public funds to pay for abortion nonetheless allow funds for \u201cdrugs or devices to prevent implantation.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 official definition of pregnancy is \u201cthe period of time from implantation until delivery.\u201d\n\nHowever, some physicians and researchers stand firm on the pre-1970 view that pregnancy begins at the moment of conception, when a sperm unites with an egg. From that perspective, any method that prevents implantation of that fertilized egg (essentially, everything except barrier methods such as condoms) is abortifacient.\n\nIf a woman believes life, conception and pregnancy all begin with the fertilized egg, the ethics of informed consent should require doctors to tell patients about this possibility when patients seek prescriptions for birth control pills or an IUD, said Dr. Joseph Stanford.\n\nStanford, a professor in family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah, is co-author on two research studies on \u201cpost-fertilization implantation\u201d and informed consent.\n\nHe prefers to avoid both rhetorical battles. \u201cPeople define conception and pregnancy different ways and no one can say definitively what is or isn\u2019t so,\u201d said Stanford.\n\nSo when he deals with patients, he inquires about their beliefs on when life begins and explains all the possible ways \u2014 including blocking implantation \u2014 that birth control could work. If they still want pills or an IUD, he refers them to colleagues.\n\nStanford is Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has no formal statement on contraception, so his decision is personal, he said: \u201cI am not willing to prescribe anything that may, even some of the time, prevent the further development of a human embryo.\u201d\n\nJohn Di Camillo, an ethicist with the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, said any artificial birth control method \u2014 from condoms to pills or devices \u2014 deprives a husband and wife of the full meaning of sexual intercourse. Both the act and the intention \u2014 to be fully open to each other \u2014 are meaningful, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you prevent implantation of a life, that is, essentially, an abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it is only in a tiny percentage of cases, it still has moral weight.\u201d\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RNS-ABORT-COURT, United States, North America, Abortion, Birth control, Emergency contraception, Health, Medication, Religion, Hobbies, Human rights and civil liberties, Social issues, Social affairs, Women's health, Sexual and reproductive health, Religious issues, Diagnosis and treatment, Recreation and leisure, Lifestyle, Health care policy, Government policy, Government and politics", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Conception.
