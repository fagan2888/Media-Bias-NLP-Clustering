Such bleed air can be contaminated with toxic synthetic jet engine oils.\n\nThe Boeing 787, which made its debut two years ago, is at this point the only commercial bleed-free aircraft in operation. The GCAQE as well as Anderson\u2019s organization are hoping that airframe and engine manufacturers will only use Boeing 787 bleed-free technology on all newly manufactured or new type of aircraft to protect crews and passengers.\n\nSome of the symptoms of exposure to these fumes while on board of an airplane include stomach cramping, muscle weakness and sinus congestion. You can also identify the fumes by their smell.\n\n\u201cThe fumes smell like dirty socks or a misty or moldy smell,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nShe added that people react differently to the exposure in the weeks following it. Longer-term, it can affect your liver function and neurological symptoms can start to appear. Speech can also be impaired and your balance can be affected. \u201cThere\u2019s no treatment for these symptoms,\u201d she said, and some cases of crew members and pilots being poisoned by toxic fumes have led to death.\n\nRelated: Another Reason to Hate the TSA\n\nAnderson noted that there\u2019s not much motivation on behalf of manufacturers and airlines to change the status quo. \u201cAirlines don\u2019t have to install filters and they don\u2019t have to let passengers know that there are oil fumes in the air, even if an aircraft is redirected and a crew taken to the emergency room for that reason,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, through the Airliner Cabin Environment Research Center, which it funds, has been researching air contaminants and sensor technologies that can detect hazardous fumes, but it has so far taken no concrete steps to reduce exposure to high-risk fumes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After more than 50 years of knowing that the air you breathe on an airplane can be contaminated with hazardous oil fumes, only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 787, has been designed to provide clean air to passengers and crews.", "title": "How Toxic Fumes on Airplanes Can Impact Your Health", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/How-Toxic-Fumes-Airplanes-Can-Impact-Your-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04202012_Airfare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/How-Toxic-Fumes-Airplanes-Can-Impact-Your-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04202012_Airfare_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After more than 50 years of knowing that the air you breathe on an airplane can be contaminated with hazardous oil fumes, only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 787, has been designed to provide clean air to passengers and crews.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Next time there\u2019s a foul smell on the plane, you could be exposed to toxic oil fumes impacting your health.\n\u201cThe fumes smell like dirty socks or a misty or moldy smell,\u201d Anderson said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no treatment for these symptoms,\u201d she said, and some cases of crew members and pilots being poisoned by toxic fumes have led to death.\nRelated: 6 Sneaky Fees That Are Making Airlines a Bundle\u201cYou could be exposed to oil fumes on a flight tomorrow,\u201d said Judith Anderson, a staff member of the AFA-CWA Air Safety, Health and Security Department, which aims to improve conditions that affect the health of flight attendants.\nSome of the symptoms of exposure to these fumes while on board of an airplane include stomach cramping, muscle weakness and sinus congestion."}
