Specialty drugs represent 3% of brand name drugs dispensed over the past five years, but they have accounted for 73% of drug spending growth, according to a committee bill analysis.\n\nAB 339, by Assembly member Rich Gordon (D-Menlo Park), would place limits on how much health plans can charge enrollees for outpatient prescriptions. Under the bill, outpatient drug costs paid by members would be capped at 1/24th of the annual out-of-pocket limit for a 30-day supply. AB 339 also requires health plans to use specific formulary tiers. The committee approved the bill with a vote of 11-5.\n\nGordon said the bill would \u201censure Californians are able to better afford prescription drugs.\u201d He conceded that while the bill could lower drug costs in the short-term, it doesn\u2019t address the underlying root causes of rising drug costs.\n\nSupporters include Consumers Union, Health Access California and patient advocacy groups. Opponents include health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nOpponents said the influx of newly insured because of the Affordable Care Act is disrupting the health insurance marketplace to such a degree that more time is needed before setting further limits on drug cost-sharing.\n\n\u201cWe need to let the dust settle before we go forward,\u201d said Assembly member Rocky Chavez (R-Oceanside).\n\nThe committee also passed AB 374, by Assembly member Adrin Nazarian (D-Van Nuys), that would allow prescribing physicians to \u201coverride\u201d health plan rules on so-called step therapy \u2014 the term used for trying less expensive drugs before prescribing brand name or more expensive drugs. Nazarian said the duration of each step can last 90 days in some cases, preventing patients from getting medications in a timely manner. The bill passed on a 14-4 vote.\n\nAn anticipated bill, the Pharmaceutical Cost Transparency Act, AB 463, by Assembly member David Chiu (D-San Francisco), was changed to a two-year bill and will be heard next year. That bill would have required pharmaceutical companies to publicly disclose the details on the factors that go into pricing expensive prescription drugs, including the costs of marketing, research and development.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The Assembly health committee heard and passed two bills yesterday dealing with the rising costs of specialty drugs.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "The Assembly health committee heard and passed two bills yesterday dealing with the rising costs of specialty drugs.", "title": "Drug Costs, Restrictions Get Hearing", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/pharmaceutical-costs-restrictions-get-hearing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-04-29T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T03:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7c0\"", "article_summary": "Gordon said the bill would \u201censure Californians are able to better afford prescription drugs.\u201d He conceded that while the bill could lower drug costs in the short-term, it doesn\u2019t address the underlying root causes of rising drug costs.\nUnder the bill, outpatient drug costs paid by members would be capped at 1/24th of the annual out-of-pocket limit for a 30-day supply.\nPrices for specialty drugs for the treatment of serious or chronic conditions have soared in recent years.\nSpecialty pharmaceuticals took the stage at the Assembly Committee on Health yesterday with discussion \u2014 and approval \u2014 of two bills addressing the rising costs of prescription drugs.\n\u201cWe need to let the dust settle before we go forward,\u201d said Assembly member Rocky Chavez (R-Oceanside)."}
