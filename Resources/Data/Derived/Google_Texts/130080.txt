Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea for his third visit this morning. Because he is the only American who has been granted access to leader of DPRK, Kim Jong Un, the family of detained American Kenneth Bae's is urging Rodman to use his friendship and celebritydom to encourage the release of Bae.

But could it be just the oppositeâ€“ that Rodman has used Bae to reignite his image?

On May 7, Dennis Rodman tweeted: "I'm calling on the Supreme Leader of North Korea or as I call him 'Kim', to do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."

But in the months that followed, he has repeatedly told media he is not an American diplomat, but simply a friend and basketball fan.

Carol spoke with Terri Chung, Bae's sister, about the potential role Rodman could play in his release.
