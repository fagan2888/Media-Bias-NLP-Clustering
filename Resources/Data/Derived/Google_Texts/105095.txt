Even though Halloween is over, there are still fun events for kids to get out an enjoy this fall.

And hundreds of them joined in for some fall fun at Aaron Bessant Park Saturday for a free fall festival.

Woodlawn United Methodist Church hosts this event each year with the help of local businesses and vendors.

Volunteers said each year it continues to grow with more and more kids coming out to enjoy all the fun outdoor activities.

From face painting to bouncy houses, kids and families at this year's festival got a chance to embrace the cooler fall weather.

"It's our way of sharing the love of Christ with the community and it's been fantastic, it seems to grow every year and we get a great response from it, I love being a part of it," said Woodlawn United Methodist Church member Liz Bennett.

Last year organizers saw around 4,500 people come through and they're hoping for an even bigger turn out this year.
