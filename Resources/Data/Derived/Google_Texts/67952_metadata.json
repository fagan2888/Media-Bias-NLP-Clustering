Or convinced Ruth Bader Ginsburg to star in a show set in a courthouse?\n\nThat\u2019s what the folks at \u201cLiving on Love\u201d have pulled off with the madcap comedy about an opera singer, featuring Renee Fleming.\n\nThe four time Grammy Award winner is a delight in the show that opened Monday at the Longacre Theatre, able to lovingly goof on her refined world with an insider\u2019s grin.\n\n\u201cPlease, call me - Diva,\u201d she introduces herself.\n\nThe gentle play by two-time Tony Award winner Joe DiPietro is based on the play \u201cPeccadillo\u201d by Garson Kanin. DiPietro, who wrote the book of \u201cMemphis\u201d and \u201cNice Work If You Can Get It,\u201d has a knack for writing for daffy characters and this play has a half-dozen of them. It feels comforting, like an old black-and-white film, and yet there\u2019s a newness here, too.\n\nSet in a Manhattan penthouse in 1957, the play centers on an aging soprano, played by a bejeweled Fleming, and her lothario Italian conductor husband who prefers to go as simply Maestro. A fantastic Douglas Sills plays him like an impish boy beneath an exterior of shocking slicked-back arrogance and heavily accented English.\n\nThese two have been together for 30 years and are on the downswing career-wise. Bookings for her are drying up and he is being displaced by Leonard Bernstein. (\u201cMaestro have-a more talent in teeny tiny pinky!\u201d he thunders.)\n\nTheir marriage reaches a crisis point when a ghost writer - he calls them \u201cspooky helper\u201d - is sent to facilitate the Maestro\u2019s autobiography. But the gloriously nerdy ghostwriter, played by Jerry O\u2019Connell, falls under the Diva\u2019s spell, requiring a new nervous ghostwriter (a great Anna Chlumsky, with spunk). The Maestro and Diva now have rival autobiographies cooking and potential new lovers to boot.\n\nOne of the play\u2019s joys is the performances of two stuffy servants - the exceptional Blake Hammond and Scott Robertson - who sing along to arias as they elegantly change the props between scenes or answer bells perfectly in sync. Their rendition of \u201cMaking Whoopee\u201d is hysterical.\n\nThe play is directed with comedic aplomb by three-time Tony Award winner Kathleen Marshall, more often associated with big musicals. The material could be accelerated and made into a farce, but Marshall never lets the comedic elements upstage the slightly looney characters themselves.\n\nFor a play, \u201cLiving on Love\u201d is full of music, as Fleming or the servants sing snippets of \u201cBarber of Seville\u201d or \u201cBolero\u201d or \u201cLa Boheme.\u201d Having Fleming herself belt out notes - and self-pompously believe her voice has the ability to cure the disabled - is delicious.\n\nThe play ends with the only ending possible - although an unexpected detour is taken by the servants. Stick around after the curtain closes on this satisfying, sweet comedy and you\u2019ll find a cast that returns to mug, unable to help themselves.\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.LivingonLoveBroadway.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "What if you produced a play about soccer players and managed to get Pele to be in it?
