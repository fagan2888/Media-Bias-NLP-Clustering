Or at least part of it.\n\nIn one of the first signs that life may be improving for the latest generation of adults, the underemployment rate for recent college grads has dropped to 6.2 percent from 10.2 percent at the height of the recession, according to a new report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. The rate for all workers fell below 10 percent the first time since 2007.\n\nThe rate includes both those who want a job but don\u2019t have one and those who want a full-time job but only have a part-time one.\n\nRelated: 5 Million Job Openings, So Why Can\u2019t You Get Hired\n\nTwo factors are behind the rise in full-time employment among college grads: job vacancies left by retiring Baby Boomers and the increase in overall job growth, report co-author Anthony Carnevale said in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nCarnevale said two of three jobs available for college graduates in the next few years will be because of retirements.
