On August 4, 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule updating the hospice wage index and payment rate for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and adopting a number of payment reforms addressing concerns about program integrity, beneficiary protection, and quality (Final Rule).

CMS also issued an accompanying Fact Sheet which summarizes the significant provisions. The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 2014 with an effective date of October 1, 2014.

Hospices are paid on a per diem basis in one of four prospectively determined rate categories, i.e., routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Hospice payments are subject to a patient-specific cap on inpatient days and an annual aggregate payment cap.
