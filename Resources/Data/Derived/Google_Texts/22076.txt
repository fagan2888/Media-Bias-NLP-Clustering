On Saturday, the Fox News Channel’s “Justice with Judge Jeanine” host Judge Jeanine Pirro argued “.ISIS doesn’t have a morale problem, they’re not a JV team, they’re not on the run, and we’re not winning.”

Pirro stated that unless the surrounding of a Marine base by ISIS fighters was taken seriously, “We are setting ourselves up for a loss of American lives.” She continued, “one minute, ISIS’ morale is sinking. The next, they’re circling our Marines…ISIS doesn’t have a morale problem, they’re not a JV team, they’re not on the run, and we’re not winning.”

She then said to the president “you keep telling us that we’re winning, but we’ve been kicked out of Libya, Syria, and now Yemen.” And “you’re not a serious leader. You keep telling the enemy what we intend to do and not do…on the same day that you announce a surge, you announce when we’re leaving, and as we leave, our troops are in more danger because there are fewer in number. Our Constitution puts the military under civilian leadership, that’s why the president is called the commander-in-chief. It is a fundamental tenant to our country’s democracy. Congress decides whether to fight and the president manages the fight, but as commander-in-chief, Mr. President, you seem more concerned with the politics of war and the campaign promises to end conflicts and close Gitmo than in protecting Americans.”
