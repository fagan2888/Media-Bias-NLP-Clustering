Thomas Dewey almost beat Wendell Willkie for the nomination in 1940, so in 1944 (and \u201948) it was his turn. Dwight Eisenhower, whom both parties wanted as their nominee, was a special case, given that whole invading-Europe-and-defeating-Hitler thing.\n\nBut Richard Nixon had been Ike\u2019s vice president in 1960, and in 1968 Republicans believed he had been the victim of John F. Kennedy\u2019s stolen election, so they nominated him again. Gerald Ford was Nixon\u2019s veep and the sitting president in 1976. Still, Ronald Reagan almost beat him in the primaries, so the next time around the Gipper got a shot.\n\nIn 1988, Reagan\u2019s veep, George H.W. Bush, had his turn. Bob Dole (Ford\u2019s running mate in \u201976) had almost beaten Bush in \u201988, so he got the nod in \u201996. George W. Bush was nominated in 2000, in part because the rank and file felt nostalgic for his dad during the sordid Clinton years. In 2008, John McCain cashed in his runnerup coupon for the nomination. In 2012, Mitt Romney did likewise.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats tend to favor outsiders: George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008. Two of the three exceptions were former or sitting vice presidents \u2014 Walter Mondale in 1984 and Al Gore in 2000 \u2014 who used their positions to consolidate power. The third was John Kerry, who won the nomination because of a combination of the mistaken belief that he was the Democrats\u2019 best shot at beating Bush (whom Democrats hated more than they loved outsiders) and Howard Dean\u2019s sudden implosion.\n\nOn the Democratic side for 2016, the two top-tier candidates are both next-in-liners, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Clinton is the indisputable front-runner: She\u2019s more popular; she was the runnerup in 2008; she\u2019s the dashboard saint of elite feminist groups, and she and her husband have been working the party machinery nonstop.\n\nThe contrast between the two parties is amazing. To say that the GOP base has soured on this next-in-line thing is an understatement on par with \u201cDennis Rodman wouldn\u2019t make an ideal baby sitter.\u201d Talk to a conservative audience about the \u201cnext-in-line\u201d habit and you\u2019ll likely hear the sorts of boos and hisses you\u2019d expect at a sports bar when you change the channel to a C-SPAN hearing on rural electrification.\n\nRepublicans want an outsider, which is why the senators aiming for the nomination \u2014 Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio \u2014 spend much of their time denouncing the city they work in. The governors \u2014 Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Mike Huckabee, formerly of Arkansas \u2014 have it easier, but they certainly never miss an opportunity to express their disappointment in Washington. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012, is the one candidate who could claim next-in-line status without setting off a riot, but he\u2019s unlikely to run. Jeb Bush is beloved by the party establishment, but nothing short of a legal name change would appease the Tea Party.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not clear what the Democrats actually want. They certainly expect Clinton to be the nominee. But should they? She\u2019s easily one of the most overrated political talents of the last quarter-century. Both McCain and Romney were hobbled by the fact that they couldn\u2019t distance themselves from an unpopular GOP president. Having served as Obama\u2019s secretary of state (never mind being the \u201cgrandmother\u201d of ObamaCare), Clinton would probably have a similar burden. Perhaps the possibility of a female president will substitute for the thrill of nominating an actual outsider.\n\nBut given where the country is \u2014 and likely will be in 2016 \u2014 I\u2019d put my money on the real thing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Of course it\u2019s too early to talk about 2016.\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way .\u2009.\u2009.\nThe most interesting dynamic about the presidential race so far is that the Democrats are behaving", "title": "Better bet on a dark horse in 2016", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/clinton.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@JonahNRO", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-2916996\"}", "sailthru.tags": "chris-christie,hillary-clinton,joe-biden,politics,presidential-election,republicans,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-11 22:58:49", "sailthru.title": "Better bet on a dark horse in\u00a02016", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/clinton.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Of course it\u2019s too early to talk about 2016.\r\n\r\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way .\u2009.\u2009.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting dynamic about the presidential race so far is that the Democrats are behaving like Republicans \u2014 and vice versa.\r\n\r\nSince 1940, with the exception of Barry Goldwater, Republicans have nominated the guy next in line.
