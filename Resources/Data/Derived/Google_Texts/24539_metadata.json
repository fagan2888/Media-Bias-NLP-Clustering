Tonight, he visited The Kelly File for a debate about ObamaCare. In my opinion, he got the best of Megyn Kelly's attempts to smear the president. Tell me what you think.\n\nBy the way, don't you just love how Megyn Kelly demands President Obama \"take responsibility?\" But when she got in trouble for saying \"Santa is white,\" she pretended she had been joking and played the victim! And I have yet to see her take responsibility for her phony-baloney \"scary black man\" crusade against Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nMeanwhile, watch how Weiner refuses to allow Kelly to seize control of the discussion. Just about every Democrat who goes on Fox could take a lesson.\n\nEnjoy!", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "tkkM8AFkj3/+AWkziomIeUFNUHhfcI+JsKr6mADY5zo=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/anthony_weiner_vs_megyn_kelly_on_obamacare_01172014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Anthony Weiner Vs.
