Fortunately, they were unable to force the IRS website to generate most of the PIN numbers they needed to file fraudulent tax returns.\n\n\u201cThe agency reveals that 101,000 PINs were successfully generated during the attack, but the IRS claims it blocked the attack and no personal information was compromised or disclosed,\u201d reports the Consumerist. The victims have been notified their Social Security Numbers were stolen, and their accounts have been flagged to prevent future efforts at tax fraud.\n\nThe jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a \u201csuccessful\u201d attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.\n\nKoskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn\u2019t been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive. The IRS received a $290 million budget hike in the two-year budget deal reached last fall.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the plan promises to make IRS operations more efficient and combat identity theft. The plan would ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act to implement an electronic document retention policy \u2013 a sore point for lawmakers in recent years during probes of alleged political bias in the IRS\u2019s Exempt Organizations division,\u201d GovExec writes.\n\nThe Hill reports pushback against Koskinen\u2019s budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously \u201cwhen the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn\u2019t make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.\u201d\n\nCrenshaw noted that in Obama\u2019s budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.\n\n\u201cEach year we learn that customer service diminishes,\u201d Crenshaw said to Koskinen. \u201cYou may argue it\u2019s because the IRS budget has been cut, but I\u2019m going to argue that it\u2019s because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.\u201d\n\nRep. Rogers further criticized the Obama budget proposal for adding more funding to implement ObamaCare, a measure Congress has repeatedly rejected, and for removing administrative provisions that would prevent repeats of the Tea Party targeting scandal, or the IRS wasting money on ridiculous training videos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.", "title": "IRS Commissioner Blames Obamacare Drain for Poor Performance, Cyber Attacks - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/obamacare-dmv-getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-11T17:44:34-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/11/irs-commissioner-blames-poor-performance-cyber-attacks-on-demands-of-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.", "title": "IRS Commissioner Blames Obamacare Drain for Poor Performance, Cyber Attacks - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/obamacare-dmv-getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, customer service, House Appropriations Committee, Internal Revenue Service, irs, john koskinen, obamacare,Tech,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-11T14:30:24-07:00", "section": "Tech", "modified_time": "2016-02-11T17:44:34-07:00", "tag": "obamacare", "categories": "Tech"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTestifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.\n\u201cEach year we learn that customer service diminishes,\u201d Crenshaw said to Koskinen.\nKoskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn\u2019t been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.\nPresident Obama\u2019s last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive.\nFortunately, they were unable to force the IRS website to generate most of the PIN numbers they needed to file fraudulent tax returns."}
