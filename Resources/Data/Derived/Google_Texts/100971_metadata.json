Sarah Palin (R) \u2014 who invoke slavery as a comparison to modern inconveniences like the glitchy Obamacare rollout should get a first-hand lesson in the actual horrors and everyday cruelties of slavery.\n\nBashir was incensed at remarks Palin made last Saturday while promoting her book Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas at the annual Iowa Faith and Freedom Conference.\n\nPalin was grousing to the assembled conservative throng about supposed freeloaders who want the government to give them \u201cfree stuff\u201d in the form of health care and public assistance.\n\n\u201cOur free stuff today is being paid for today by taking money from our children and borrowing money from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen that note comes due \u2014 and this isn\u2019t racist so try it anyway, this isn\u2019t racist \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be like slavery when that note is due, right? We are going to be beholden to a foreign master.\u201d\n\nBashir and many others were appalled, but not especially shocked that Palin would evoke one of the cruelest and most horrifying chapters of western history in such a flippant manner.\n\n\u201cGiven her well-established reputation as a world class idiot,\u201d Bashir said, \u201cit\u2019s hardly surprising that she should choose to mention slavery in a way that is abominable to anyone who knows anything about its barbaric history.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, he said, Palin should try to find out what slavery was really like.\n\nSpecifically, he speculated that perhaps the failed vice presidential candidate and 1984 Miss Alaska runner-up should be subject to a form of abuse that involved defecation into a slave\u2019s mouth, a punishment ritual derived by West Indian slaver Thomas Thistlewood, an Englishman who owned a massive sugar plantation in Jamaica.\n\nThistlewood conceived a particularly sickening punishment for a slave named Darby, who was caught eating the sugar cane he was supposed to be harvesting.\n\nThe plantation-owner \u201chad him well flogged and pickled\u201d \u2014 which is to say that Darby was whipped and then salt and other irritants were rubbed into his whip cuts \u2014 \u201cthen made Hector, another slave, s-h-i-t in his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis became known as \u2018Darby\u2019s Dose,\u2019\u201d Bashir said, \u201ca punishment invented by Thistlewood that spoke only of inhumanity. And he mentions a similar incident in 1756, his time in relation to a man he refers to as Punch. \u2018Flogged punch well, and then washed and rubbed salt pickle, lime juice and bird pepper, made Negro Joe p*ss in his eyes and mouth.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI could go on, but you get the point,\u201d Bashir said. \u201cWhen Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn\u2019t just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.\u201d\n\nMany on the right are furious and say that with these remarks, Bashir has stepped over the line.
