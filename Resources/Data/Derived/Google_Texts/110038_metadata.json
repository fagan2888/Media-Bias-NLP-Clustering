Later this afternoon, NRL News Today will run an update on the Obama mandate which the Supreme Court justices are expected to render a decision on later this month. To understand it fully requires that we remember how the justices handled the oral arguments by the respective sides roughly three months ago. Hence the following which ran March 25.\n\nIn a widely anticipated case, the Supreme Court this morning today heard two challenges consolidated into one case that are contesting the HHS mandate which compels employers to provide health coverage for drugs and procedures to which they have moral or religious objections.\n\nEach side was given 45 minutes to present its case. The lead attorneys were the same as faced off two years ago when the High Court addressed the issue of ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate requirement: former U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, and current Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.\n\nThe Plaintiffs\u2013Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp.\u2013 are family owned corporations. Hobby Lobby is a chain of arts-and-crafts stores while Conestoga Wood Specialties is a Mennonite-owned cabinet maker. They argue that the mandate, which are regulations adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services under a provision of ObamaCare, violates the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise of religion clause.\n\nMost media accounts came to the conclusion that, as is so often the case, the swing vote is likely Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. Adding suspense was that he asked questions that each side could conclude favored their position.\n\nFor instance, over at the Scotusblog.org, long-time Supreme Court watcher Lyle Denniston likened the discussion to\n\n\u201csomething like a two-act play on a revolving stage: first the liberals had their chance and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy gave them some help, and then the scene shifted entirely, and the conservatives had their chance \u2014 and, again, Kennedy provided them with some support.\u201d\n\nAnd the Washington Post\u2019s Robert Kaiser wrote, \u201cThe three liberal and female justices were the most vocal in questioning Paul Clement. Justice Elena Kagan \u2018said Clement\u2019s argument could be extended to employers refusing to pay for blood transfusions or vaccines because of religious objections.\u2019\u201d\n\nDenniston wrote, \u201cWhen it was Solicitor General Verrilli\u2019s turn at the lectern, he found immediately that Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito, Jr., were ready to pounce, disputing each of the government lawyer\u2019s core points\u201d about the need for the mandate in this context.\n\nThose included queries about what Congress meant when it passed the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the religious rights of corporations, and why the government couldn\u2019t pay for the services it wanted but to which the plaintiffs objected.\n\nWhat Denniston described as the \u201clow point\u201d for Verrilli came near the end\n\n\u201cwhen Justice Kennedy told him bluntly: \u2018Under your view, for-profit corporations can be forced to pay for abortion. Your reasoning would permit that\u2026. You say that for-profit corporations have no standing to litigate what their shareholders believed.\u2019\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby, which has a workforce of 16,000 full-time people of all faiths, prevailed before the full 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cIn a divided opinion, the appeals court relied in part on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which said corporations have political speech rights just as individuals do in spending on elections,\u201d Kaiser wrote. In that case Judge Timothy Tymkovich, writing for the majority, concluded \u201cWe see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporation\u2019s political expression but not its religious expression.\u201d\n\nA panel of the 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the Conestoga Wood Specialties must comply with the HHS mandate.\n\nThe financial penalties for non-compliance are extremely heavy, particularly for Hobby Lobby with its large work force. The fine is $100 per day per employee\u2013$365 million+ for Hobby Lobby.\n\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) issued a statement this morning with this apt conclusion:\n\n\u201cThis burdensome penalty is completely unfair, unreasonable, and unconscionable. The Obama administration is saying we will punish you, we will hurt you, we could even put you out of business for providing healthcare for your employees unless you provide healthcare according to the government\u2019s conscience. Also, employees currently on their businesses health plan could lose the coverage they need for themselves and their families. [HHS] Secretary Sebelius and President Obama have no business imposing their morality on people of faith, but that is exactly what their oppressive mandate does.\u201d\n\nPlease join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
