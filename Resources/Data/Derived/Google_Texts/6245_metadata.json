Worse, that this lack of ambition, this ability to not strive for greatness, gives me real pleasure.\n\nWorse still (here I\u2019m closing in on ideological treason), I see this ability to rest easy as a virtue, even a talent. (Quite possibly I\u2019m number one in not caring if I\u2019m number one.) I believe that being good enough, in many cases, is more than good enough; that it may, in fact, be the key to the contentment box, and that properly understood and appropriately applied, it can make us a lot happier and a whole lot less annoying to others.\n\nLet me take a second to throw some tacks under the wheels of my critics.\n\nFirst, I have no quarrel with the strivers who choose to march \u2013 and I mean march \u2013 to a different drummer. If going for personal bests is your oyster, I\u2019d be the last one to take it away. I\u2019ve known that oyster \u2013 damn-near killed myself on the track and the squash court, for example \u2013 and there\u2019s great satisfaction to be found in it.\n\nSecond, in praising the virtues of good enough-ness, I\u2019m not suggesting that you apply it with a great, slovenly brush to your entire life. I\u2019m not proselytizing for sloth. By all means, pick a thing, or a couple, if you like, in which \u201cgood enough\u201d will never be good enough \u2013 I have \u2013 and strive for mastery. Knock yourself out.\n\nThen find a place in the shade and consider the benefits of not striving for mastery in badminton, say, of not going for the gold in bird-watching, or barbecuing. Imagine letting the competitor-consumers, the relentless researchers, the worried trend-watchers with their fingers forever on the pulse of the moment sprint grimly ahead, while you take the day to mess around with your kids, or head off into the woods, or burn some chicken. Think of the money you\u2019ll save and the confusion you\u2019ll sow.\n\nI say confusion because the world is filled with things, big things, unsuited to competition and perfect for \u201cgood enough\u201d; things that can\u2019t be ranked because there\u2019s no universal yardstick by which to measure them. Because they just don\u2019t measure. Whose #1 in decency? Or joy? Or even \u2013 despite a 150-year-old industry devoted to convincing us otherwise \u2013 contentment?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is the number of things similarly unsuited \u2013 parenting, for example, or leisure \u2013 that we\u2019ve somehow been conned into believing are not profoundly individual activities in which one person\u2019s notion of success is different from another\u2019s, but rather activities which \u2013 like tennis \u2013 will reward our dedication with the brass ring of excellence. Never have so many been suckered so effectively. Barnum would be proud.\n\nIn many ways, of course, we Americans were ripe for the fall, culturally predisposed, like fifth-generation alcoholics, to find the rabbit hole and throw ourselves into it. For 350 years, ever since the Puritans began to fudge the Covenant of Grace by suggesting that, hey, maybe there were some things we could do \u2013 like working, striving, etc. \u2013 to punch our ticket to heaven, we\u2019d been associating virtue with labor and labor with accumulation. On our journey through life, we\u2019d come to understand, our task was to attach stuff to ourselves, and if the logical apotheosis of that Velcro philosophy was the figure of Donald J. Trump, bestriding the New World like a gold-plated colossus and braying \u2018\u201dI\u2019m number one!\u201d well, that happy sight was still a ways off in the future.\n\nBack to history. It didn\u2019t take long for the spirit of capitalism to capitalize on the suggestion that our labor could save us; all that had to be done \u2013 picture Don Draper of \u201cMad Men\u201d making the pitch \u2013 was to bring the whole business down to earth. In the blink of a banker\u2019s eye, work now pointed to a secular salvation and competition-for-things became the three-word answer to every question, the yellow brick road to every dream, the cure for every fear, and if by some chance you had the presumption not to feel afraid, the sellers would fix you by selling you that, then selling you the stuff to dispel it.\n\nFrom there on it was one swift ride, made swifter by the breakdown of civil society, the rise of mass media, the increasing atomization of American culture. Selling stuff to David Riesman\u2019s \u201clonely crowd,\u201d it turned out, was a piece of cake. Miserable people could be made to feel inadequate \u2013 society\u2019s losers. Isolated people could be conned into believing that striving for a bigger house or newer car would make everything right simply by showing them pictures of people with bigger houses, newer cars, who looked happy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the sellers found a receptive audience for their Kwik-Fix solution to life\u2019s disappointments; after all, real contentment was hard to find, hard to hold on to \u2013 it took years (and something like wisdom) to even recognize it. How much easier to just strive for the corner office, the perfect score, the award-winning kid, the trophy wife. Why climb the stairway to heaven when you could take the escalator, and lay your money down.\n\nEnter social media, on which everyone\u2019s life is always better than yours, on which everyone\u2019s thrilled because they just love their new French marble countertops and Kylie just got into Princeton (or the pre-school certain to get Kylie into Princeton), and they\u2019re leaving on that vacation (which you could never afford) with their adoring husband who just got that promotion and . . . But you\u2019ll show them. You\u2019ll \u201clike\u201d their pics to prove you don\u2019t care, and then post that selfie in which you look so thin so they\u2019ll see it while they\u2019re stuffing themselves in Tuscany.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: In response to this wonderfully intricate mousetrap we inhabit, I propose, laughably enough, the cultivation of \u201cenough,\u201d a concept as elegant in its simplicity as it is revolutionary in its implications. There\u2019s nothing to buy \u2013 no salesman will call. It\u2019s not available in any store.\n\nBefore proceeding, however, you should be aware that good enough-ness is potentially both infectious and hereditary and that adopting a laissez faire approach to barbequing, for example, may keep your kid out of Harvard, which currently asks its 18-year-old applicants to limit themselves to their top six state- or national-level awards.\n\nYou\u2019ve been warned.\n\n***\n\nCase Study #1: Sex\n\nLet\u2019s start with sex. As an impressionable college freshman I was once wandering past the used bookstores on Amsterdam Avenue when I came across a book on sex. If memory serves \u2013 it\u2019s been a while \u2013 it was called something like \u201cHow to be a Great Lover,\u201d or \u201cTwelve Steps to Becoming a Great Lover.\u201d Assuming an expression of amused sophistication \u2013 How absurd! \u2013 I started reading. Though I\u2019d have denied it under torture, when it came to sex I was as ignorant as a turnip. Maybe I\u2019d learn something, pick up some pointers, improve my \u201ctechnique.\u201d There was a technique, right?\n\nThe book, which, disturbingly, I remember well, consisted mostly of exercises accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations designed to fast-track my lovemaking prowess. Fingertip push-ups were involved, as were tongue-extension sessions (the men\u2019s room at the office was a good bet for getting in that mid-day workout), and high-speed blinking exercises to minimize fatigue while performing the butterfly flutter on her nipples.\n\nTen pages in, hope entered my heart: If this was what the competition was up to, I might be all right. If Becoming a Great Lover involved sitting on the can during lunch developing a tongue of steel and indefatigable eyelids, maybe greatness was the wrong goal. Maybe, unless you aspired to join the pro tour, having a good time without worrying about your ranking might be enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beware of the architects of insecurity: sex, love, decency, joy--these are not competitive sports", "author": "Mark Slouka", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Beware of the architects of insecurity: sex, love, decency, joy--these are not competitive sports", "title": "The case for \u201cgood enough\u201d: Forget striving\u2013our happiness depends on being satisfied with less", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/the_case_for_good_enough_forget_striving_our_happiness_depends_on_being_satisfied_with_less/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_good_enough.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beware of the architects of insecurity: sex, love, decency, joy--these are not competitive sports", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_good_enough.jpg", "title": "The case for \u201cgood enough\u201d: Forget striving\u2013our happiness depends on being satisfied with less", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The case for \u201cgood enough\u201d: Forget striving\u2013our happiness depends on being satisfied with less", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Consumerism, Editor's Pick, Life stories, Love and Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(Quite possibly I\u2019m number one in not caring if I\u2019m number one.)\nI\u2019ve known that oyster \u2013 damn-near killed myself on the track and the squash court, for example \u2013 and there\u2019s great satisfaction to be found in it.\nTopics: Consumerism, Editor's Pick, Life stories, Love and Sex, Life NewsI admit it: there are one or two things I\u2019m not number one in.\nSecond, in praising the virtues of good enough-ness, I\u2019m not suggesting that you apply it with a great, slovenly brush to your entire life.\nMaybe, unless you aspired to join the pro tour, having a good time without worrying about your ranking might be enough."}
