A few dozen National Football League players will join the American Diabetes Association on Capitol Hill Thursday as the group urges lawmakers to allocate new funding for diabetes research.

The players will join the American Diabetes Association in spreading awareness for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for diabetes research. The players will be at a Capitol event with Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), the co-chairs of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, and then meet one-on-one with lawmakers.

The ADA is asking Congress to increase funding for the NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases by $2.165 billion, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Diabetes Translation by $170.129 million and the National Diabetes Prevention Program by $25 million, according to a spokesman for the group.

At Thursday’s event, the organization will officially launch Team Tackle, which includes Dont’a Hightower of the New England Patriots, Duane Brown of the Houston Texans and former player and radio host Mike Golic, before the athletes meet with lawmakers.

More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, and another 86 million have pre-diabetes and are at risk of developing the illness. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually on diabetes treatments.
