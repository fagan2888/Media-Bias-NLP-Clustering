At age 69 at the time of her potential inauguration, Hillary Clinton would be just eight months younger than the current record holder, Ronald Reagan.\n\nRelated: Millions of Boomers Are Making This Big Retirement Mistake\n\nAs all of us live longer and healthier lives, the idea of a septuagenarian holding one of the most stressful, demanding jobs on the planet has received scant attention. After all, it\u2019s not uncommon to see older Americans working well past what used to be retirement age.\n\nPeople are working longer for a variety of reasons, including very real concerns about their financial security once they quit working, but for many it\u2019s also an evolving understanding of retirement itself. While retirement was once defined as the end of work, working in retirement is now increasingly the norm. Nearly half of today\u2019s retirees say they have either worked or plan to work during their retirement years, according to a 2014 report by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.\n\n\u2018It would be foolish for me to retire\u2019\n\nIrvington, N.Y., resident Judy Uman, 77, began her working career late, when her youngest daughter was in high school. Thirty years later, she is still commuting every day to her job as a social worker in the Bronx neighborhood where she grew up, helping elderly residents arrange the home care needed for them to age in place.\n\nOccasionally Uman says she wonders whether choosing not to retire means that she missed out on time with her five grandchildren when they were little, or more vacations or time playing tennis. But the rewards of her job \u2014 and the ability to help people who really need it \u2014 are too important to her to give up.\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish for me to retire because there aren\u2019t many people who do the kind of work that I do,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a special mission, and it\u2019s an honor to do this work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Raising the Retirement Age for Social Security Hurts These Workers the Most\n\nUman, who says that her decision to continue working has nothing to do with her finances, plans to work at least until she turn 80. Nearly two-thirds of individuals who are not retired and plan to work past age 65 by choice say they will do so because they enjoy their career, while another 60 percent want additional disposable income, according to a report published this year by Northwest Mutual.\n\nBlanche Lozar, 70, of Zelienople, Pa., says she took a part-time job with pet food manufacturer Puppy Cakes just to have some \u201cpin money.\u201d Between that job and her volunteering gigs with a local retirement community, she keeps busy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like staying home,\u201d says the former educator. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on television, and there\u2019s only so much yard work you can do. I feel like I know more about the world being in it than being at home.\u201d\n\n\u2018There\u2019s really nothing else I would rather do\u2019\n\nFor freelance writer and editor Cynthia MacGregor, 72, the income she gets from continuing to work is a nice supplement to her social security and savings, but it is not the primary reason that she keeps putting in 60 hours per week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else I would rather do,\u201d says the West Palm Beach, Fla., resident. \u201cI don\u2019t want to retire ever. When I drop dead, they\u2019ll find my gnarled hands over the keys of my keyboard.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for a Healthy Retirement\n\nCommercial real estate entrepreneur Jerry Swartz, 76, says he has never considered retiring. He still works full-time running CityFunders in fast-paced New York City.\n\n\u201cI probably will never retire,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoy working. I think I would be frightened to death to wake up one morning and not have an office to go to.\u201d\n\nSwartz says technology still allows him to enjoy some travel, since he can easily check in to the office or with clients when visiting his summer home.\n\nWhile Swartz and MacGregor enjoy working full-time, for many people working into retirement years is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Forty-one percent of workers now envision transitioning into retirement by reducing their hours to allow for more leisure time to enjoy life (26 percent) or by working in a different capacity that is less demanding or brings greater personal satisfaction (15 percent), according to a report released this year by the TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s good for my ego\u2019\n\nWhen she left her full-time job, Philadelphia lawyer Marie Fritzinger, 71, planned on working just a few hours a week with a local nonprofit that helps with drug and alcohol treatment services. Soon, the role expanded and she found herself putting in up to 90 hours a month.\n\nStill, her role as an outside contractor gave her flexibility to enjoy some of the perks of retirement \u2014 she just took an 18-day vacation abroad \u2014 while remaining useful and mentally engaged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for my ego,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to be needed. I consider myself semi-retired. I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to what I want to do. I think I would feel too isolated if I retired. I like the idea of at least three times a week, I have to get up and go somewhere\u201d\n\nRelated: The 12 Worst States for Retirement\n\nPlus, she enjoys her time with the twenty-somethings in her office.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very computer savvy,\u201d she says. \u201cI learn from them, and every once in a while, I teach them something.\u201d\n\nWhile many Americans plan on working through their retirement years, planners say that it\u2019s smart to save as if you\u2019re going to quit earlier. Unexpected events, such as a change in your or your spouse\u2019s health or a company layoff can derail such plans. Even though it\u2019s more common to hear about folks working into their 70s, the median age for retirement in America is still 62, which \u2014 despite worker plans \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed in more than 20 years.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s been plenty of criticism lobbed at the current crop of presidential candidates", "title": "Here\u2019s Why So Many Retirees Are Still Working", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/02/Here-s-Why-So-Many-Retirees-Are-Still-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06042013_Boomers_Cities_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/02/Here-s-Why-So-Many-Retirees-Are-Still-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06042013_Boomers_Cities_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There\u2019s been plenty of criticism lobbed at the current crop of presidential candidates", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While Swartz and MacGregor enjoy working full-time, for many people working into retirement years is not an all-or-nothing proposition.\nWhile retirement was once defined as the end of work, working in retirement is now increasingly the norm.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not uncommon to see older Americans working well past what used to be retirement age.\n\u201cI enjoy working.\nPeople are working longer for a variety of reasons, including very real concerns about their financial security once they quit working, but for many it\u2019s also an evolving understanding of retirement itself."}
