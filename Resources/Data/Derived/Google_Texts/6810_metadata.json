For example, in a section about nurses, the survey asks, \u201cDuring this hospital stay, after you pressed the call button, how often did you get help as soon as you wanted it?\u201d Patients have complained on the survey, which in previous incarnations included comments sections, about everything from \u201cMy roommate was dying all night and his breathing was very noisy\u201d to \u201cThe hospital doesn\u2019t have Splenda.\u201d A nurse at the New Jersey hospital lacking Splenda said, \u201cThis somehow became the fault of the nurse and ended up being placed in her personnel file.\u201d An Oregon critical-care nurse had to argue with a patient who believed he was being mistreated because he didn\u2019t get enough pastrami on his sandwich (he had recently had quadruple-bypass surgery). \u201cMany patients have unrealistic expectations for their care and their outcomes,\u201d the nurse said.\n\nA 2012 study, conducted by University of California, Davis, professor Joshua Fenton, found that highly satisfied patients actually cost more health care resources than dissatisfied patients.\n\nThe study also found that satisfied patients were more likely to die within four years.\n\nFenton speculated that basing doctors\u2019 pay on patient happiness could lead to doctors being less honest with patients and not bringing up uncomfortable topics such as quitting smoking or losing weight.\n\nRobbins pointed to the example of the University of Toledo Medical Center, a hospital that tries to give patients the \u201cRitz Carlton experience.\u201d\n\nThat experience comes at a price: UTMC has some of the worst stats in the state of Ohio when it comes to patients dying, suffering complications or being readmitted unexpectedly.\n\nA UTMC nurse once threw away a perfectly good kidney that a brother had donated to his sister.\n\nRobbins found that nationwide, two-thirds of the least healthy hospitals \u2014 the hospitals where patients are more likely to die, suffer botched procedures and the like \u2014 score above average on the government\u2019s patient satisfaction survey.\n\nShe recalled the words of a Missouri clinical instructor: \u201cPatients can be very satisfied and dead an hour later.\u201d\n\nRead the full Atlantic piece here.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Zach Noble (@thezachnoble) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The customer is always right?
