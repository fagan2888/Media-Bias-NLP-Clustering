The other Republican candidates are still promising to support Trump in the general election, and presumably some stalwart-seeming #NeverTrumpers will fall into line as well.\n\nAnother, better reason to doubt that #NeverTrump is more than a strategic effort to defeat Trump in the primary\u2014rather than in the general election\u2014can be found in the Senate, where #NeverTrump sentiment is about to come into exquisite tension with the Republican Party\u2019s determination to deny President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee a fair hearing.\n\nThe tactics #NeverTrump conservatives demand of Senate Republicans are of a piece with the reactionary maximalism that gave rise to the Trump phenomenon in the first place. The person who will determine whether this final act of resistance to Obama will hold together is Iowa\u2019s Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, and thus controls whether Obama\u2019s nominee will receive confirmation hearings, fair or otherwise. Grassley faces reelection this year and will likely be running against a formidable Democratic opponent. Obama is reportedly vetting Jane Kelly, an appellate court judge from Iowa whom Grassley has praised effusively in the past. So there\u2019s a great deal of countervailing pressure on Grassley to break ranks from the rest of the GOP\u2014including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who holds that the next president should get to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Yes, it sounds paradoxical.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Yes, it sounds paradoxical.", "title": "#NeverTrump Conservatives Are Fighting for Him to Reshape the Supreme Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7dbd782c26a3f0b9f12798e7c73e77b97a252da4.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/131498/nevertrump-conservatives-fighting-reshape-supreme-court", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yes, it sounds paradoxical.", "title": "#NeverTrump Conservatives Are Fighting for Him to Reshape the Supreme Court", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7dbd782c26a3f0b9f12798e7c73e77b97a252da4.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/7dbd782c26a3f0b9f12798e7c73e77b97a252da4.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"#NeverTrump Conservatives Are Fighting for Him to Reshape the Supreme Court \",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/131498/nevertrump-conservatives-fighting-reshape-supreme-court\",\"section\":\"Donald Trump\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-14T10:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":131498,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Donald Trump\",\"Chuck Grassley\",\"Election 2016\",\"Republican Primary 2016\",\"Politics\",\"Supreme Court\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Hillary Clinton\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-03-14"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The tactics #NeverTrump conservatives demand of Senate Republicans are of a piece with the reactionary maximalism that gave rise to the Trump phenomenon in the first place.\nObama is reportedly vetting Jane Kelly, an appellate court judge from Iowa whom Grassley has praised effusively in the past.\nSo there\u2019s a great deal of countervailing pressure on Grassley to break ranks from the rest of the GOP\u2014including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who holds that the next president should get to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nThe other Republican candidates are still promising to support Trump in the general election, and presumably some stalwart-seeming #NeverTrumpers will fall into line as well.\nThe organizing principle of the #NeverTrump movement isn\u2019t simply that Republicans should deny Donald Trump their presidential nomination, as Marco Rubio has it, but that they should also deny him the presidency should he prevail in the primary."}
