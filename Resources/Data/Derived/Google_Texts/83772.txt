A major earthquake hit southern Alaska early on Sunday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, setting off tremors felt more than 170 miles (280 km) away in the state’s biggest city Anchorage.

Twitter users reported feeling shaking, but there were no immediate reports of casualties in the region. “Long and pretty strong earthquake and power out in West Anchorage,” wrote David Hulen.

The magnitude 7.3 quake struck 30 miles east-southeast of Pedro Bay, on the shore of Iliamna Lake, the USGS added. It was recorded at a depth of 124.8 km at 1030 GMT (0530 ET).
