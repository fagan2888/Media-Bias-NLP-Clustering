Since 2010, we\u2019ve worked with ranchers to conserve, restore, or maintain more than 4 million acres of habitat on private lands \u2013 an area twice the size of Yellowstone National Park.\u201d\n\nThe USDA reported restoring over 4 million acres of sage-grouse habitat in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and eight other Western states.\n\nHowever, the bird species has not yet been added to the endangered species list. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is set to decide this September whether or not the sage-grouse will be included on the endangered species list.\n\nSome ranchers argue that listing the bird as an endangered species could have a larger impact on the industry than the spotted owl listing had on the timber industry.\n\nBut environmentalists argue that delaying the conservation efforts for the bird will lead to habitat destruction and the eventual extinction of the species.\n\n\u201cAmerican ranchers are working with us to help sage-grouse because they know they are helping an at-risk bird while also improving the food available for their livestock,\u201d Mr. Bonnie said. \u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018What\u2019s good for the bird is good for the herd.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to work diligently to remove the conifer trees that put sage-grouse and their habitat at risk,\u201d said Tim Griffiths, NRCS\u2018 coordinator for SGI. \u201cBy removing trees and saving vulnerable grasslands, we\u2019re expanding the footprint of prime sage-grouse habitat while supporting sustainable ranching and working lands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly released a report on Thursday announcing a plan to spend over $750 million on sage-grouse preservation efforts by 2018.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly released a report on Thursday announcing a plan to spend over $750 million on sage-grouse preservation efforts by 2018.", "title": "USDA pledges $750M by 2018 for sage-grouse conservation", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/14/usda-pledges-750m-by-2018-for-sage-grouse-conserva/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/14/sage-grouse-us-fish-and-wildlife.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/14/sage-grouse-us-fish-and-wildlife.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly released a report on Thursday announcing a plan to spend over $750 million on sage-grouse preservation efforts by 2018.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "USDA pledges $750M by 2018 for sage-grouse conservation"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, US Department Of Agriculture, Usda Natural Resources Conservation Service, Robert Bonnie"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2659\"", "article_summary": "However, the bird species has not yet been added to the endangered species list.\n\u201cBy removing trees and saving vulnerable grasslands, we\u2019re expanding the footprint of prime sage-grouse habitat while supporting sustainable ranching and working lands.\u201d\nFish and Wildlife Service is set to decide this September whether or not the sage-grouse will be included on the endangered species list.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture quietly released a report on Thursday announcing a plan to spend over $750 million on sage-grouse preservation efforts by 2018.\nBut environmentalists argue that delaying the conservation efforts for the bird will lead to habitat destruction and the eventual extinction of the species."}
