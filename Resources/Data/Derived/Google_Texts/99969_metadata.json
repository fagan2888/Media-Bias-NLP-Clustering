The employee got a ride home from a friend.\n\nBefore the deli closed at 7 p.m., a man brought the backpack into the deli and asked if workers would hold onto it, Alex Aldali, who works at the deli, said Monday. The owner of the deli wanted nothing to do with the backpack, Aldali said, so the man who brought it into the store left with it.\n\nOn Friday morning, House Republicans got a call from a man who wanted to turn in the backpack, said Pat O'Neil, a spokesman for House Republicans. The call was relayed from the switchboard to the office of Rep. Jay Case, R-Winchester, because the caller lives in Case's district. Case was not there, however.\n\nA worker at Case's office took the call and received the backpack that morning, O'Neil said.\n\n\"At that point, we contacted Kevin Counihan directly, and he said, 'Oh, OK,' \" O'Neil said, referring to the CEO of Access Health CT. An employee at Access Health CT went to the Legislative Office Building to retrieve the backpack and the information.\n\nFriday afternoon, Access Health CT sent out an advisory about a possible security breach.\n\nA representative at Maximus said Monday that it is reinforcing its policies in the aftermath of the security breach.\n\n\"The bottom line is that one of our team members made a mistake,\" Baylinson said. \"He violated our corporate policies and procedures for handling personal data. Removing any personal data from our offices and facilities is strictly prohibited and this individual is now on administrative leave.\"\n\nBaylinson added that the administrative leave will last until the police investigation is complete. The Maximus employee is \"deeply sorry and has been fully cooperative with the investigation, and based upon what we know today, we have no reason to believe that any of this information was used for fraudulent purposes.\"\n\nMaximus' standard procedure for hiring people includes a criminal background check, Baylinson said.\n\n\"This individual is extremely remorseful and very upset about the situation. He is one of our better employees,\" Baylinson said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "business", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-thecourant", "description": "HARTFORD - The backpack containing a notepad with names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of Access Health CT customers was left Thursday outside a downtown deli and found by a man who...", "title": "New Details Emerge About Backpack Found With Access Health CT Information", "url": "http://articles.courant.com/2014-06-09/business/hc-access-health-ct-backpack-0610-20140609_1_access-health-ct-maximus-backpack", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53962911/turbine/hc-access-health-ct-backpack-0610-20140609-001/2048/2048x1536", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 115228168554095}, "description": "HARTFORD - The backpack containing a notepad with names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of Access Health CT customers was left Thursday outside a downtown deli and found by a man who"}, "article_summary": "The backpack contained information on more than 400 customers of Access Health CT, the state health exchange created by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\"At that point, we contacted Kevin Counihan directly, and he said, 'Oh, OK,' \" O'Neil said, referring to the CEO of Access Health CT.
