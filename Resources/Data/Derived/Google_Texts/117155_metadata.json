Haley, 63, took over as chief executive officer of Pekin Hospital on April 16 and has been working with the hospital board on a strategic plan.\n\n\n\nHaley said the plan will be made public before the end of the summer.\n\n\n\nHaley, who spent the past two years in International Falls, Minn., likes what he sees of the hospital and the community.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe facility has a lot of potential,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe offer great services here.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe physicians \u2014 a lot of them practice here and in Peoria, so you\u2019re liable to find the same physician if you go to the (emergency room) here or the ER at OSF (Saint Francis Medical Center), but the other (physician) specialties that we have recruited in the past couple of years are very, very good.\n\n\n\nHe added that the hospital is actively recruiting physicians.\n\n\n\nThe hospital, which laid off nine employees in February and cut the hours of 22 additional employees, will not need additional reduction in force, Haley said.\n\n\n\nHealth care, said Haley, is \u201crapidly changing with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, and the hospital here is responding positively to those changes. The Affordable Care Act is not fully implemented yet \u2014 it will take another two to three years for the law to be implemented, so yes, there will be changes. We\u2019re not entirely sure what they will be and how the government will interpret the law in the coming months, but we have talked to a number of consultants and are preparing for the best-guess plans of how the law will continue to unfold. We\u2019re not waiting just to react to it, we\u2019re out ahead of it and preparing to have changes in place when new parts of the law come into effect.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaley began working in hospital administration in 1975. He spent 16 years at Denton Hospital in a suburb of Dallas.\n\n\n\nHospital Board President Andy Sparks said a news release he said, \u201cThe board is impressed with Bob\u2019s experience and believes he will be an excellent leader of Progressive Health Systems. His experience and leader\u2019s skills will allow us to continue our positive momentum, make certain we maintain progress and continue to serve our community with exceptional medical care.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaley and his wife, Scarlett, live in North Pekin. They have four grown children, two grandchildren and a grandchild on the way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PEKIN \u2014 Bob J.
