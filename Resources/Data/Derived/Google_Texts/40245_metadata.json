Molina Healthcare Molina is for-profit and has more than 8,600 employees in the United States; 2,600 to 2,800 of them work in the Long Beach area. The company deals in plans for patients who are eligible for Medicare, Medicaid and health care exchange plans. Molina offers Medicaid plans in California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. Financial results for 2013 and the final quarter of the year are scheduled to be released Monday. In the third quarter of last year, Molina reported about $7.6 million in profits on nearly $1.7 billion in revenue. Headquarters: 200 Oceangate, Long Beach. Job openings: www.molinahealthcare.com SCAN Health Plan SCAN Health Plan is a nonprofit provider of Medicare Advantage Plans in California and Arizona. SCAN has about 1,000 employees and had about 146,000 members, 35 percent of whom live in Los Angeles Country, as of information reported in April. Headquarters: 3800 Kilroy Airport Way, Long Beach Job openings: www.scanhealthplan.com\n\nLONG BEACH >> The only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Long Beach and a nonprofit that offers highly rated Medicare Advantage plans are among the city\u2019s most significant employers.\n\nMolina Healthcare and SCAN Health Plan are both involved in the work of helping patients receive government-assisted health coverage. Molina and SCAN have needs for health care practitioners, people with information technology skills and employees with strong customer service skills who can help people understand often-complicated health plans.\n\n\u201cA typical member\u2019s call is about their benefits. She has to go to outpatient surgery, or she wants to know what her co-pay is,\u201d SCAN member services representative Be Dobson said.\n\n\u201cI become the mediator between the two of them (patient and care provider), and I explain to that provider, which is the doctor\u2019s office or facility, and I tell them that they can\u2019t overcharge,\u201d she added. \u201cI talk to the member and I tell her what her benefits are.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere on the floor were Dobson and her colleagues work is far from the stuffy environment often associated with the business world. SCAN\u2019s member services employees do their jobs in a well-illumninated environment, filled with bright-colored furniture, while being reminded to stay on task by a wall-mounted television letting them know how many people are waiting to have their phone calls answered.\n\nThese touches of modernity, however, exist alongside more old-fashioned, if not downright cozy, signifiers of achievement. The floor\u2019s \u201cwall of fame,\u201d situated between the elevators and employees\u2019 work spaces, is adorned with many handwritten notes of thanks from seniors who have received help.\n\n\u201cI think it has to be a people person,\u201d Dobson said. \u201cIt has to be a person that loves to conversate with others. It has to be a compassionate, caring person that loves the job of doing this.\u201d\n\nFederal impact\n\nSCAN and Molina operate on different sides of the nonprofit/for-profit divide, and both organizations\u2019 plans can be heavily affected by federal health policies.\n\nThe nonprofit SCAN has about 1,000 employees, and although hiring managers plan this year to recruit customer service personnel who can handle the job of answering plan holders\u2019 phone calls, SCAN, which as a Medicare Advantage provider is a private organization that contracts with Washington to offer care plans, is experiencing some headwinds due to federal issues, SCAN Vice President of Human Resources Emily Arison said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs summarized by The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, budget legislation enacted in December will give doctors a half-percent increase in Medicare payments through April, but federal remuneration to physicians treating Medicare patients is set to be reduced after April. Although overall Medicare payments are expected to increase by billions over the next several years, Washington\u2019s current fiscal plans also, in some cases, reduce Medicare payments to those who receive long-term hospital care.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are with the changes in Medicare, but we are growing,\u201d Arison said. \u201cNursing is always a good career to go into. Coding. As the world changes, the health care world changes.\u201d\n\nBoon to Molina\n\nIn Molina\u2019s case, however, federal policies are expected to be a boon. The Affordable Care Act, frequently derided in conservative circles for mandating insurance payments and the much-reported technical problems that beset many Americans\u2019 online attempts to sign up for new insurance plans offered in accordance with the law, is expected to be a major driver for revenue growth at Molina.\n\nMolina has specialized in health plans for patients who are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid and is also among the state\u2019s health plans selected to serve patients who are signing up for insurance through Covered California, which is the state-run insurance \u201cexchange\u201d as a result of the ACA. Exchanges are intended to help those who are eligible for insurance subsidies buy coverage provided by private firms.\n\nIn Molina\u2019s case, the company did not provide Covered California enrollment numbers for this article, but top executives have said they expect the ACA, through such provisions as the creation of insurance exchanges and expanded Medicaid eligibility, to result in a doubling of the firm\u2019s 2012 revenues to some $12.5 billion next year.\n\nAround Long Beach, Molina has 2,600 to 2,800 employees, and more than 8,000 people work for the firm nationwide, senior vice president Bob Gordon said. The company hired about 2,000 people across the country last year and is locally expanding its physical presence by moving workers into the former Press-Telegram building on Pine Avenue in downtown Long Beach.\n\nMolina is also renovating the adjacent Meeker Baker building to house employees. Meeker Baker is expected to be ready for business late this year, and Gordon said the company\u2019s physical expansion is intended to accommodate new information technology employees needed as the company anticipates serving a larger number of people.\n\n\u201cWe spent last year really building up for the growth period in IT,\u201d he said.\n\nMolina also operates health clinics, and the company\u2019s hiring needs for people such as case managers and registered and licensed vocational nurses reflect that, Gordon said.\n\n\u2018A challenging field\u2019\n\nAmong Molina\u2019s recent hires is Lenore Mallek-Passey, a licensed vocational nurse whose current duties include checking patients\u2019 claims and making sure Molina pays valid claims in a timely manner. She is also taking classes at DeVry University to earn a degree in health information technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a changing field,\u201d Mallek-Passey said. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed being able to learn new things. It\u2019s not a routine type of thing.\u201d\n\nSCAN and Molina executives alike emphasized that an employee needs to fit into their respective company\u2019s organizational culture to succeed.\n\nFor SCAN, Arison emphasized hires need to be passionate about helping seniors obtain health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having the sensitivity and understanding for seniors and patients, and knowing your customer,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Molina, new hires who work in Long Beach or even if hired in other states are invited to an orientation session with the company\u2019s top executives, such as CEO Mario Molina and CFO John Molina, who are sons of company founder C. David Molina.\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s publicly traded, it\u2019s still family-run,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nThe orientation, he added, \u201creally focuses on the culture and history of the company.\u201d\n\nMemorialCare Health\n\nMemorialCare Health, which operates Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Miller Children\u2019s Hospital, Community Hospital Long Beach and facilities in other cities, also has its own health plan operation.\n\nAlso in Long Beach, MemorialCare Health System created the nonprofit Seaside Health Plan last year as a healthcare network for Medicare, Medi-Cal or commercial insurance customers who are already enrolled in Health Net, L.A. Care Health Plan, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California or Care 1st Health Plan.\n\nAt present Seaside has 40 employees, according to MemorialCare. Hiring plans call for the addition of 14 people to fill positions in information technology, case management, enrollment, credentialing and support.\n\nCall Andrew Edwards at 562-499-1305.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONG BEACH >> The only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Long Beach and a nonprofit that offers highly rated Medicare Advantage plans are among the city\u2019s most significant employers.Molina Healthcare and SCAN Health Plan are bot", "title": "Long Beach-based health plan providers are major employers", "og": {"url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/business/20140209/long-beach-based-health-plan-providers-are-major-employers", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20140209/NEWS/140209359/AR/0/AR-140209359.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "943px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Long Beach-based health plan providers are major employers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "presstelegram.com", "description": "LONG BEACH >> The only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Long Beach and a nonprofit that offers highly rated Medicare Advantage plans are among the city\u2019s most significant employers.Molina Healthcare and SCAN Health Plan are bot", "title": "Long Beach-based health plan providers are major employers", "url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/business/20140209/long-beach-based-health-plan-providers-are-major-employers", "image": {"src": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20140209/NEWS/140209359/AR/0/AR-140209359.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@presstelegram", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551754518", "iphone": "id502958939", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.longbeachpresstelegram"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Health care industry, Health care industry news, Long Beach Health care industry news, CA Health care industry news, US Health care industry news, world Health care industry news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health care industry, Health care industry news, Long Beach Health care industry news, CA Health care industry news, US Health care industry news, world Health care industry news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6dc\"", "article_summary": "LONG BEACH HEALTH PROVIDERS Molina Healthcare and SCAN Health Plan are both among Long Beach\u2019s major employers.\nJob openings: www.molinahealthcare.com SCAN Health Plan SCAN Health Plan is a nonprofit provider of Medicare Advantage Plans in California and Arizona.\nAlso in Long Beach, MemorialCare Health System created the nonprofit Seaside Health Plan last year as a healthcare network for Medicare, Medi-Cal or commercial insurance customers who are already enrolled in Health Net, L.A.
