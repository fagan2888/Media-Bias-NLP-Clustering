The tale RAND tells is not one of different EHR technologies, as both VistA and Epic both employ the MUMPS programming language and file-based database.

Kizer, who served as the VA\u2019s Undersecretary for Health from 1994 through 1999. Dr. Kizer considered installation of a major system upgrade to be a core element in his effort to transform the organization \u2026\n\nFull disclosure: Dr. Kizer is Medsphere\u2019s board chairman.\n\nFrom February 1997 to December 1999, the VA connected VistA across all agency facilities. \u201cIt was (and remains) the largest and most rapid deployment of an EHR ever done,\u201d the RAND report says.

RAND notes that VistA\u2019s clinical acceptance has been consistently validated over numerous surveys:\n\nIndependent surveys suggest that physicians are broadly satisfied with VistA compared with other EHR systems. In a 2011 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and a similar 2012 poll by Medscape, VistA outscored the large majority of health IT solutions, particularly those offered by large vendors like Epic and McKesson. When the AAFP survey asked respondents to express their level of agreement with the statement, \u201cThis EHR enables me to practice higher quality medicine than I could with paper charts,\u201d VistA received the top score. In both the AAFP and Medscape survey\u2019s, VistA was one of the highest ranking systems overall.\n\nAs public domain software financed by the American taxpayer, VistA is affordable for any hospital or health system and it clearly demonstrates the promise of EHRs in meeting the goals of the HITECH act: adoption, acceptance, Meaningful Use and interoperability.\n\nEPIC\n\nThe RAND report looks critically at Epic\u2019s dominance, which few can refute at this point in the history of EHRs.\n\nEpic has established itself as the enterprise-wide solution of choice for large private health care systems and academic medical centers, irrespective of ongoing concerns about its limited interoperability and less-than-ideal usability.\n\nThere seems to be a natural history to all technology dominance. There was a time when Microsoft, for example, was the most valuable company in the world. I think Epic\u2019s closed-platform approach has a similar trajectory and, similarly, over time I believe the company\u2019s proprietary single-source model will erode its dominance. This is what happens when you put up walls between your end users and innovation/interoperability.\n\nAn independent evaluation of Epic\u2019s impact in the Kaiser system found that implementation led to efficiency losses and a persistent two-minute increase in the length of time of an average patient encounter \u2026 Moreover, physicians complained of workflow interruptions, slower processes of care, and excessive time with the provider\u2019s \u201cback to the patient\u201d because of the need to focus on computerized order entry.\n\nWhile Epic preaches interoperability, it practices non-interoperability and vendor lock.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns with Epic is its relative lack of interoperability. Although the company has a strict structure and retains tight control of its software and data, it does customized installations for each client \u2026 it limits Epic\u2019s interoperability between sites and much of its capacity to communicate with out-of-network providers who use other EHRs. In some health care systems, two facilities running Epic in the same health care system cannot share data.\n\nQuoting Epic critics, the RAND report goes on to say that perhaps Epic\u2019s \u201cCare Everywhere\u201d interoperability solution is disingenuously named.\n\nEpicCare (Care Everywhere) specifically breaks the standard CCD form, and makes it incompatible with the rest of the 400+ EMRs in the USA by adding their proprietary extensions. This is consistent with Epic\u2019s proprietary, one-vendor-shop, non-interoperability stance.
