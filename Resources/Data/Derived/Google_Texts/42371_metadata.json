Since then, the 70,000-member state employees\u2019 union membership plummeted by 59,000; the American Federation of Teachers representing the college system saw membership drop from 22,000 to less than 10,000; and the 100,000 member National Education Association representing K-through-12 teachers lost 35,000 members.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Supreme Court appeal that will be heard in the fall was started by Orange County elementary school teacher Rebecca Friedrichs, who claimed in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association that \u201cI\u2019m not a member of the union, and I\u2019m opposed to forced fees and forced unionism.\u201d She sued because despite the lack of union membership, her bi-monthly paychecks are still docked to pay $650 a year for local union \u201cagency fees\u201d to compensate, supposedly, for the union\u2019s collective bargaining services.\n\nThose public sector employee fees typically constitute about 60 percent of the national average of $1,000 in annual union membership, and the money is mostly used to finance political spending.\n\nAs a demonstration of the partisan nature of agency fee spending in her home state, only 0.08 percent of the California Teachers Association\u2019s political contributions between 2003 and 2012 went to Republicans.\n\nThe union did spent $60 million to defeat three ballot measures to eliminate automatic paycheck dues deductions, and funded millions in \u201cpolitical education\u201d to force private employers to pay for health benefits and Obamacare.\n\nMost teachers like Ms. Friedrichs have modest means. But the conservative Center for Individual Rights legal advocacy group funded her legal expenses in California federal district and appellate courts in an effort to take the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court for a definitive national decision.\n\nMs. Friedrichs\u2019 world-class attorney Michael Carvin, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. Department of Justice in the Reagan Administration and a partner at the prestigious Washington, D.C. office of Jones Day, called the case \u201ca challenge to the largest regime of state-compelled speech for public employees in the nation,\u201d according to his appeal, filed at the high court in January.\n\nThe suit revisits the 1977 Supreme Court ruling in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that upheld laws requiring all public sector employees that benefit from collective bargaining to pay so-called \u201cfair-share\u201d to local unions for those services, regardless if they choose to be union members or not.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito recently wrote two majority opinions against unions\u2019 coercive payments, and hinted that the high court seems ready to overturn forced \u201cagency fees.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, in 2012, Alito rebuked a California SEIU union local for mandatory collection of a special election-year fee from Dianne Knox and others workers objecting to making payment.\n\nLast year, he stated in a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that the Illinois requirement that home health aides help cover a union\u2019s cost of collective bargaining violates their First Amendment right to free speech. Justice Alito emphasized that it is a \u201cbedrock principle\u201d of the First Amendment that \u201cno person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support.\u201d\n\nIntrepid reporter Steve Greenhut of the San Diego Union-Tribune points out how important the Supreme Court decision will be, since \u201cthe state\u2019s public-employee unions are among the most powerful interest groups\u201d in Sacramento and they \u201cfear a coming rollback in their financial power.\u201d\n\nGreenhut tracked how the Democrat controlled state legislature tried to use a \u201cgut-and-amend\u201d tactic quietly to pass a non-negotiable \u201cpublic employee orientation.\u201d The quality time for unions would mandate that all newly hired school employees and transit workers attend a program during working hours sponsored by their \u201crecognized local union.\u201d There is obvious concern that the \u201corientation\u201d could be used to badger or humiliate new hires into signing up for automatic union fee deductions.\n\nThe League of California Cities and Association of California School Administrators have pushed back on the idea by sending a letter to legislators expressing concern: \u201cIf proponents of agency fees are allowed to urge public employees to pay them voluntarily, this provides an opportunity to anyone with opposing views to address those employees in the same manner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A coming Supreme Court decision that may permanently end all compulsory union dues collections in California.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A coming Supreme Court decision that may permanently end all compulsory union dues collections in California.", "title": "Supreme Court May Dump Mandatory Union Dues, Fees in CA", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2400, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_ap-photo1562.jpg", "height": 1881}, "updated_time": "2015-09-11T11:01:39-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/09/cal-unions-fear-court-will-dump-mandatory-dues-in-ca/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A coming Supreme Court decision that may permanently end all compulsory union dues collections in California.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_ap-photo1562.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court May Dump Mandatory Union Dues, Fees in CA", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "california unions, Friedrichs v.
