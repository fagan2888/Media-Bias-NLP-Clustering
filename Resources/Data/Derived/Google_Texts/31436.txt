An Alabama-based salvage company is now helping to recover an Army Black Hawk helicopter that crashed off the Florida panhandle.

A barge from the Resolve Marine Group arrived at the Santa Rosa sound yesterday afternoon. It will assist divers in recovering a chopper that went down Tuesday in heavy fog during training. Investigators are still working to determine the exact cause of the crash. All 11 service members who were on board are believed to be dead.
