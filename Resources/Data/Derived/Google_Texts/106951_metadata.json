Wade Spees/Staff April 16, 2015\n\nSeveral local civil rights organizations have unified in response to the shooting of Walter Scott and will gather Monday at North Charleston City Hall for a mass demonstration.\n\nThe conglomerate has been dubbed the Charleston Civil Coalition for Reform (CCCR) and members will be demonstrating in recognition of the one-month anniversary of Scott\u2019s death.\n\nNorth Charleston Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager, who has since been fired, is charged with murder. A video released soon after Scott\u2019s death showed him being shot in the back by Slager as he ran during a traffic stop.\n\n\u201cAs a community of conscience, we will meet at city hall to honor Walter Scott, reiterate our demands to the city and launch an aggressive voter registration campaign,\u201d states a media release from CCCR. \u201cThe death of Walter Scott and other victims of police violence must not be in vain.\u201d\n\nOrganizations that came together to form CCCR include Black Lives Matter Charleston, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Local 1422, Chicora Cherokee Neighborhood Association, The Coalition, National Action Network, Nation of Islam and Oak Forest Neighborhood Association.\n\nThe group\u2019s inaugural meeting took place on April 25 at the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Hall on Morrison Drive. The release states that the organizations plan to unify around an \u201cagenda of reform that seeks to remove the residue of Jim Crow-ism from the City of North Charleston\u2019s Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is our Selma,\u201d the release states. \u201cWalter Scott is our Jimmie Lee Jackson. This is the new Civil Rights era to build on the movement of the 60s, a time for this generation no matter of race or creed to lend to positive reforms, a time for the current people in the movement to bring positive contributions, and a time to bring awareness to the degradations in underserved neighborhoods. A time for change.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration outside city hall is set for 4 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston-area rights groups unify over Walter Scott death, plan Monday demonstration, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Black Lives Matter,demonstration,michael slager,North Charleston,protest,The Coalition,Walter Scott", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Several local civil rights organizations have unified in response to the shooting of Walter Scott and will gather Monday at North Charleston City Hall for a mass demonstration.", "title": "Charleston-area rights groups unify over Walter Scott death, plan Monday demonstration", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150503/150509788/charleston-area-rights-groups-unify-over-walter-scott-death-plan-monday-demonstration", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509788/AR/0/AR-150509788.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509788/AR/0/AR-150509788.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several local civil rights organizations have unified in response to the shooting of Walter Scott and will gather Monday at North Charleston City Hall for a mass demonstration.", "title": "Charleston-area rights groups unify over Walter Scott death, plan Monday demonstration", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509788/AR/0/AR-150509788.jpg?201505032158", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509788}}, "keywords": "Charleston-area rights groups unify over Walter Scott death, plan Monday demonstration , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Black Lives Matter,demonstration,michael slager,North Charleston,protest,The Coalition,Walter Scott", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T16:45:57Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-03T21:58:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Several local civil rights organizations have unified in response to the shooting of Walter Scott and will gather Monday at North Charleston City Hall for a mass demonstration."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2314\"", "article_summary": "Wade Spees/Staff April 16, 2015Several local civil rights organizations have unified in response to the shooting of Walter Scott and will gather Monday at North Charleston City Hall for a mass demonstration.\nA time for change.\u201dThe demonstration outside city hall is set for 4 p.m.\nThe conglomerate has been dubbed the Charleston Civil Coalition for Reform (CCCR) and members will be demonstrating in recognition of the one-month anniversary of Scott\u2019s death.\n\u201cWalter Scott is our Jimmie Lee Jackson.\nThe release states that the organizations plan to unify around an \u201cagenda of reform that seeks to remove the residue of Jim Crow-ism from the City of North Charleston\u2019s Government.\u201d\u201cThis is our Selma,\u201d the release states."}
