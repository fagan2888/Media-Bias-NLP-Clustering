Although this bill typically receives bipartisan support, there are several controversial amendments in this year\u2019s legislation sparking debate.\n\nHere are some of the most important amendments the Senate is evaluating:\n\n\u2018Buy American\u2019 Amendment\n\nLast week, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., introduced an amendment that enhances \u201cBuy American\u201d requirements for the Department of Defense. Essentially, his proposal prevents American taxpayer dollars to be spent on foreign military goods, even if those goods will be used overseas.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon should be required to buy American-made goods unless there\u2019s a genuine budgetary or national security reason they can\u2019t do so,\u201d Murphy said in a press release. \u201cThis amendment would help break the Pentagon\u2019s addiction to \u2018Buy American\u2019 waivers and provide a boost for American manufacturing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Justin Johnson, senior policy analyst for defense budgeting policy at The Heritage Foundation, said this amendment would not be cost-efficient.\n\n\u201cIn effect, what it would do is drive up costs for the military and take longer for the military to get things they need,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson also said that if the amendment were passed, it would be a \u201cslap in the face to our allies.\u201d\n\nISIS Amendment\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., added an Authorization for Use of Military Force amendment\u2014related to the U.S.\u2019 military actions to confront the ISIS terrorist group\u2014which may gain bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cOur military has been waging war against ISIL since last September, and Congress has been appropriating funds to pay for those operations,\u201d Flake said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s past time for Congress to formally voice its support of the mission itself.\u201d\n\nPrimary provisions of this amendment include repealing the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq, a provision that was not present in President Obama\u2019s proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force last year.\n\nAdditionally, it includes a clause granting this new authorization as the only authority for military action against ISIL. This nullifies the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the use of troops against terrorists after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMurray Amendment\n\nThe Murray amendment, proposed by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa., addresses cuts to civilian personnel working for the Department of Defense. As a result, the Murray amendment outlines several provisions to determine who should be released and who should remain working for the Department of Defense.\n\nThe criteria described in the Murray amendment causes seniority to be the most important factor when determining civilian personnel cuts, while performance is last.\n\nCritics of the Murray amendment, like Johnson of Heritage, support performance as the most essential provision, not seniority.\n\nGuantanamo Bay Amendments\n\nThe Obama administration has outlined its goal to close Guantanamo Bay and the National Defense Authorization Act includes numerous amendments concerning the future of the base. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., proposed two amendments concerning Guantanamo Bay\u2014one that would prohibit funding to go toward closing the base and another to continue operating the base.\n\nAdditionally, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., submitted amendments that prevent Guantanamo Bay detainees to be released or transferred to the U.S., even in cases of medical treatment.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also included an amendment that would prevent detainees from being transferred to countries with Department of State travel warnings.\n\nNuclear Weapons Amendments\n\nSeveral amendments related to nuclear weapons are on the table for debate.\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., proposed a few amendments to update the cost to replace nuclear ballistic missile submarines and require a \u201c25-year cost estimate for the U.S. nuclear modernization program.\u201d Additionally, Markey wants to establish limits to nuclear cruise missiles and reduce nuclear expenditures overall.\n\nSen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., added an amendment promoting nuclear missions as a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the Air Force.\n\nAlso, Rubio added several amendments to \u201cprohibit the nuclear nonproliferation funding\u201d to Russia, unless Russia agrees to several treaties, including the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force Treaty, New START Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\nAmendments Bring Tension\n\nTension between the White House and Congress exists and President Obama said on Tuesday he may veto the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe White House is opposed to some amendments, including those related to Guantanamo Bay and ones that would decrease federal spending.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed their version of the bill on May 15 and the Senate will continue debating amendments\u2014and potentially vote on the legislation\u2014this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, the Senate is debating the National Defense Authorization Act, which outlines the U.S. Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This week, the Senate is debating the National Defense Authorization Act, which outlines the U.S. Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 2016.", "title": "The Most Critical Amendments to the Military Spending Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/NDAA.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-11T19:55:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1B64ZoG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This week, the Senate is debating the National Defense Authorization Act, which outlines the U.S. Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 2016.", "title": "The Most Critical Amendments to the Military Spending Bill", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/NDAA.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "military", "published_time": "2015-06-11T18:13:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T19:55:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "NDAA, defense spending, pentagon, Guantanamo Bay, Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake"}, "article_summary": "This year\u2019s bill currently has over 500 amendments, ranging from military child care, funding for military commissaries and a variety of foreign policy initiatives.\nThis nullifies the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the use of troops against terrorists after the 9/11 attacks.\nCritics of the Murray amendment, like Johnson of Heritage, support performance as the most essential provision, not seniority.\nAmendments Bring TensionTension between the White House and Congress exists and President Obama said on Tuesday he may veto the National Defense Authorization Act.\nThis week, the Senate is debating the National Defense Authorization Act, which outlines the U.S. Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 2016."}
