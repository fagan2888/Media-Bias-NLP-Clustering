The bitterly cold temperatures and falling sleet Sunday morning were the perfect conditions for people enjoying a sled ride at Sedgwick County Park.

A large hill in the park was the scene of many families coming out and having fun.

"We are having a lot of fun with our daughter here today," said Cari Scarborough, whose entire family partook in sliding down the hill. "Since my husband works to many hours, we take whatever we can get and this is just a small slice of heaven," she said.
