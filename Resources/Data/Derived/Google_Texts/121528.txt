Despite recent pushes by the Obama administration for immigration reform, a new poll released Thursday by Gallup shows that a majority of Americans are far more concerned with other issues such as healthcare, the economy, and a general sense of dissatisfaction with the government.

Twenty one percent of respondents said that the most important problem facing the United States was dissatisfaction with government, while 19 percent said the economy in general was the most important problem. Rounding out the top three responses was healthcare, which 17 percent labeled as the most important issue. Immigration was second to last with three percent, only slightly above "war/fears of war, lack of respect for each other, and the gap between the rich and the poor," which all garnered two percent of responses.

Immigration has not ranked in the top five of responses all year, as Americans have shown that they are primarily concerned with the economy and healthcare.

Republicans should take these polls into mind when strategizing for 2014 and beyond. It's obvious what Americans are not happy about: healthcare and the economy. By presenting clear plans to fix both of these issues, the GOP could make gains in coming elections. Issues like the wage gap and immigration, while trendy among the current administration, simply are just not that important to the average American.
