I\u2019d kicked the tires on the idea a few times over the years \u2014 ever since reading this piece, actually \u2014 but the inertia of paying the monthly bill made it hard to take the necessary steps. As recently as last month, I\u2019d done research on what it would cost to switch to a lower package but not give it up altogether. As part of a flurry of cost-cutting measures, though, we eliminated cable TV altogether and kept our Internet service. Comcast sent me a shipping box with a prepaid UPS label, and the cable box was gone.\n\nAnd nothing has changed. Everything is the same, but better.\n\nI should be clear, cord-cutting might not be for everyone. But for us, right now, it\u2019s amazing. Here\u2019s why:\n\nWe don\u2019t watch sports.\n\nAt all. My wife and I don\u2019t follow sports, watch live games, or keep up with sporting news. I couldn\u2019t tell you what channel ESPN was in my now-defunct lineup. I don\u2019t remember who won the Super Bowl earlier this year; I don\u2019t even remember who played in it. I know the baseball playoffs are happening right now, and my gut says something happened with the Tigers, but I don\u2019t care enough to look it up because I\u2019m just going to forget it in an hour.\n\nThis is probably the biggest barrier for people who want to ditch cable, because even with a digital antenna or a device like Aereo to watch over-the-air games, your selection is still limited by location. (And at this moment, the future of Aereo is uncertain, too.) We\u2019re lucky, though, in that we\u2019re just not that into sports, so giving up the opportunity to watch them wasn\u2019t even a factor.\n\nWe already pay for Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime.\n\nOur Netflix plan allows for unlimited streaming, as well as one disc (Blu-ray or DVD) out a time, because there are still loads of movies and shows not available to stream. That covers dozens of series, as well as recent seasons of things like Breaking Bad or Mad Men. We\u2019ve also got Hulu Plus, which has back catalogs of a variety of series as well as new episodes of ongoing series that are still airing, like New Girl and Parks and Recreation. And I\u2019ve been an Amazon Prime member for years, since it was solely a shipping-related perk, so the addition of streaming video made it an even better deal. (At $80 per year, Amazon Prime is also cheaper than either Netflix or Hulu Plus, both of which offer streaming service for $8 per month, or $96 per year.) We already had so many ways to watch TV and movies, whether on our computers or phones or streamed to the TV via my Xbox 360. We weren\u2019t hurting for entertainment options.\n\nWe\u2019re already used to time-shifting.\n\nRelated to that, we were already so used to watching new TV series a day or two after the latest episode aired that having to wait for those episodes to hit Hulu Plus doesn\u2019t feel like a chore. Even when we watched shows the night they aired, we rarely watched them live: we\u2019d usually allow for a buffer of 15-20 minutes that meant we could skip commercials and rely on the DVR. Bumping New Girl from Tuesday night to Wednesday night doesn\u2019t feel abnormal or inconvenient.\n\nA family member remarked that one of the things that made it easier to cut cable when we did was that Breaking Bad had finished airing a couple days before we pulled the plug. And yes, it was nice to watch Breaking Bad the day it aired, and to be able to publish pieces on each episode the same night. But I didn\u2019t need cable to watch the show. I could just as easily have bought the show via iTunes, downloaded it a day after air, and been fine. My reviews would\u2019ve been a day late, but that\u2019s it. It was the powerful illusion that I needed cable that kept me on the hook.\n\nWe don\u2019t watch that many new series, and we\u2019re OK paying for the ones we do watch.\n\nMy wife and I both like to keep up with (among others) Parks and Recreation, New Girl, Bob\u2019s Burgers, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, all of which are available the day after air via Hulu Plus. We\u2019re also big fans of FX\u2019s Justified and The Americans, both of which are available to purchase through iTunes and Amazon. (Currently, the fourth season of Justified is $35 on iTunes, though that\u2019s HD; the SD version is $23.) It\u2019s easy to purchase a season pass for those shows and then have them download after they\u2019ve aired, which we plan to do when they return next year. I could easily see us buying an Apple TV or a Roku to make the TV interaction even simpler. Paying for a season pass is cheaper than footing a cable bill, and the episodes are yours to keep, too. I could buy both season passes at once for $70, which is still less than one month\u2019s cable costs in my old setup.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A couple of weeks ago, my wife and I got rid of our package.
