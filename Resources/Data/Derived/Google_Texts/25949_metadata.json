Jeb Bush speaks during a campaign stop in Pelham, N.H., on Saturday. John Minchillo/Associated Press\n\nMERRIMACK, N.H.\u2014Florida Gov. Jeb Bush defended negative ads that a super PAC supporting him has run against his rivals, saying that \u201cpolitics isn\u2019t beanbag.\u201d\n\nDuring a town hall event here Saturday night, Mr. Bush took a question from a voter who said he\u2019d grown tired of overwhelmingly negative ads that are now blanketing the airwaves in New Hampshire, Iowa and other early primary states.\n\n\u201cI bet you have a lot of them,\u201d Mr. Bush joked in return.\n\nIn his defense, the governor said that Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting his bid, had run a lot of ads early on about \u201chow great I was as governor of Florida.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Bush said that \u201ccomparing and contrasting\u201d candidates was also warranted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around politics for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is actually pretty tame compared to other campaigns I\u2019ve been involved in terms of the attacks.\u201d\n\nRight to Rise has increasingly gone negative in its ads, delivering broadsides against Fla. Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The PAC has defended its approach, saying it\u2019s \u201cequal opportunity\u201d with all the candidates.\n\nMr. Bush on Saturday said the PAC has highlighted facts about other candidates\u2019 records, such as who expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in their states. Both Messrs. Kasich and Christie accepted Medicaid funding as governors, though conservatives don\u2019t support the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nAbout 250 people attended Mr. Bush\u2019s third town hall event in New Hampshire Saturday. The governor will next campaign on Tuesday, in Nevada.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Florida Gov.
