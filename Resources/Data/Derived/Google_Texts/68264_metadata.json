But a spokesperson says he might soon.\n\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin took the oath of office last month and has spent most of his time since then appointing cabinet members and writing a state budget, said Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute.\n\nBevin\u2019s representatives have so far declined to comment on KentuckyWired, and spokeswoman Jessica Ditto had no immediate answers for Watchdog.org this week.\n\n\u201cOur folks are carefully evaluating everything, and the earliest I will be able to give public comment is later next week,\u201d Ditto said in an email.\n\nBevin ran on a platform of reducing the size of government and has pledged to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange under Obamacare \u2014 although he has said friendlier things about the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, to the dismay of some conservatives.\n\nThey\u2019re expecting more on state-owned broadband.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked with many folks in Kentucky\u2019s tea party movement who see KentuckyWired for what it is,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big government boondoggle. The tea party folks definitely oppose this whole idea and understand this is something the private sector should do \u2014 not government.\u201d\n\nRelated: New government broadband could put Kentucky taxpayers at risk\n\nMembers of the state\u2019s Kentucky Telecom Association are patrolling the halls of the Capitol in Frankfort, warning legislators that KentuckyWired will cost their industry $26 million a year in lost state contracts, according to the group\u2019s president, Tyler Campbell.\n\n\u201cI am unaware of what Gov. Bevin\u2019s specific position on the KentuckyWired project is,\u201d Campbell said, adding his organization is trying to set up meetings to discuss the matter with members of Bevin\u2019s cabinet. \u201cWe are still in the process of coordinating that meeting.\u201d\n\nFormer Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear signed KentuckyWired into law last fall. Construction hasn\u2019t started yet.\n\nKentuckyWired will cost federal taxpayers $20 million and state residents another $30 million. On top of that, $300 million in bond money\u2014 $230 million in tax exempt senior revenue bonds and $57 million of taxable senior revenue bonds \u2014 will pay for the rest, according to Moody\u2019s. The Australian-based Macquarie Group will design, develop and operate Kentucky Wired for 30 years. The commonwealth will own the network and will provide at least 1,100 government facilities in the state with broadband service.\n\nState officials have not said what Macquarie would get in return for its services, and company officials declined to speak on the record. But it\u2019s not hard to figure out that Macquarie will benefit financially, Campbell said.\n\nState officials contend that KentuckyWired won\u2019t directly compete with private Internet service providers for broadband customers.\n\nBut Kentucky Telecom\u2019s Campbell said that in some areas of the state, \u201cthis is just a pure duplication of the excess fiber capacity that we already have.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Kentucky\u2019s new tea party-backed governor hasn\u2019t announced plans to do anything about a $350 million statewide municipal broadband project.", "title": "Bevin mum on state-owned broadband - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T11:39:01+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/254319/bevin-mum-state-owned-broadband/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Kentucky", "tag": "broadband,KentuckyWired,matt bevin,municipal broadband,Tea Party", "published_time": "2016-01-15T15:49:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T11:39:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Kentucky\u2019s new tea party-backed governor hasn\u2019t announced plans to do anything about a $350 million statewide municipal broadband project.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "title": "Bevin mum on state-owned broadband - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Kentucky\u2019s new tea party-backed governor hasn\u2019t announced plans to do anything about a $350 million statewide municipal broadband project."}, "article_summary": "State officials contend that KentuckyWired won\u2019t directly compete with private Internet service providers for broadband customers.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked with many folks in Kentucky\u2019s tea party movement who see KentuckyWired for what it is,\u201d Waters said.\nThe commonwealth will own the network and will provide at least 1,100 government facilities in the state with broadband service.\nState officials have not said what Macquarie would get in return for its services, and company officials declined to speak on the record.\nThey\u2019re expecting more on state-owned broadband."}
