After supposedly routine heart valve surgery, she suffered a major stroke, leaving her unable to walk, speak much or feed herself.\n\nFor months, hospice staffers cared for her in her nursing home. \u201cThey were awesome people,\u201d said her daughter, Audrey Marsh. \u201cThey bathed and changed her and kept her company. They fed her.\u201d\n\nThe hospice had admitted Mrs. Fine for 90 days, then another 90. After that, Medicare rules required re-certification every 60 days, meaning that a physician must attest she is likely to die within six months if her disease runs its normal course. In May, when Mrs. Fine was no longer losing weight or showing other signs of decline, the hospice apologetically said she no longer qualified.\n\nMs. Marsh understands the rationale: \u201cShe\u2019s not getting any better, but she\u2019s not wasting away.\u201d\n\nCarol Willette, on the other hand, is seething. Her family had debated for months about calling hospice. Her mother Earlene Willette, 90, a nursing home resident in Mill Valley, Calif., had been ailing for several years \u2014 falling, battling infections, eventually losing mobility.\n\n\u201cMom was trying to tell people she didn\u2019t want anyone prolonging her life,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI was talking about hospice, but my siblings were in an uproar about it.\u201d\n\nIt took a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, to make everyone understand that Earlene Willette\u2019s condition was terminal and meant increasing disability. In mid-November, a local hospice enrolled her, and the usual team \u2014 aides, nurses, a social worker, a chaplain \u2014 began visiting. \u201cThey all said they were there for her and for us,\u201d Carol told me.\n\nLess than a month later, the hospice discharged Mrs. Willette, saying she was not losing ground. \u201cI told them how cruel it was to do this,\u201d Carol said.\n\nMrs. Willette can return to hospice care as her condition worsens (so can Mrs. Fine), but Carol worries that her mother will feel on probation, at risk of losing care she will come to depend on.\n\nHospices have always had the ability \u2014 and under Medicare rules, the obligation \u2014 to discharge some patients. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, relying on 2009 and 2010 data, has reported that 20 percent of hospice patients are discharged alive each year; the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization says its surveys show that a third of discharges are initiated by patients themselves, and two-thirds by hospices.\n\nBut discharges are climbing. Gilchrist Hospice, the largest in Maryland, now discharges of about 20 percent of patients, and \u201cwe\u2019re on the low side,\u201d said its clinical director, Regina Bodnar. Indeed, a Washington Post investigation, analyzing a million records of California hospice patients, found that the proportion discharged alive rose 50 percent between 2002 and 2012.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here? Hospices have lamented for years that dying patients wait too long to call, enrolling at the eleventh hour when they could have benefited months earlier. Now, we\u2019re hearing more about patients doing as hospice believers (including me) have urged, calling earlier in the course of a terminal disease \u2014 and then, in a substantial minority of cases, getting bounced.\n\nJon Keyserling, senior vice president for policy at the national hospice organization, points to several pressures.\n\nFirst, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are peering over every hospice administrator\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCMS, through its contractors, is looking much more carefully at longer-stay patients,\u201d Mr. Keyserling said. With hospices under increasing scrutiny, \u201cthey need to be even more careful about the patients they admit and the patients they keep.\u201d\n\nThe claims reviewers pay particular attention to whether a patient\u2019s disease is progressing. They want to see evidence: Does the patient need more oxygen? Have her medications changed? Is he falling?\n\nIn the past, \u201cyou never did weights on hospice patients,\u201d Ms. Bodnar said. Now, Gilchrist weighs patients; if it can\u2019t, it measures the circumferences of their arms. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for objective data\u201d to justify recertifying patients, she said.\n\nBut hospice patients sometimes hit plateaus or temporarily improve; in fact, studies have shown that they live slightly longer than those with the same diseases but without the additional care. At that point, to comply with Medicare rules, \u201cyou have to seriously consider whether they\u2019re eligible to continue,\u201d Ms. Bodnar said. Patients can appeal discharges, but they don\u2019t usually win.\n\nWhen auditors question hospice decisions, causing a flurry of expensive and time-consuming paperwork, they can hold up Medicare reimbursement for months or years \u2014 if the hospices are eventually found to be entitled to payment.\n\nAnd if they\u2019re not? Medicare audits forced the 35-year-old nonprofit San Diego Hospice, California\u2019s largest, to close earlier this year; denied expected payments, the hospice owed millions of dollars and declared bankruptcy. \u201cA sobering moment,\u201d said Ms. Bodnar.\n\nAt the same time, all hospices face shrinking budgets. The federal sequester reduced payments by 2 percent. With other cuts, some a vestige of the Bush administration and some mandated by the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reimbursements to hospices will be about 4 percent lower this year, Mr. Keyserling said.\n\nOne can sympathize with hospice organizations caught in this squeeze. Determining which patients will likely die within six months has always been difficult, especially with conditions like heart disease or dementia, whose trajectories can be unpredictable. To avoid being penalized if they guess wrong, hospices are taking no chances.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s true of hospices operating according to the regulations and honoring the movement\u2019s historic mission. The Post attributed much of the jump in discharges to the way for-profit hospices have come to dominate the field, enrolling ineligible seniors for long stays to bolster corporate bottom lines, then dumping them to evade Medicare sanctions. (The Times has also reported on growing hospice costs.) Whistleblowers and the Justice Department have sued several large national chains to stop these practices.\n\nBut I worry about families who have agonized about the decision and finally called for help, then feel betrayed when hospice withdraws, even though their relatives can regain hospice care when they decline further. They shouldn\u2019t get caught in this crossfire.\n\nWas this really the intent of the 1983 hospice Medicare benefit \u2013 to have dying older people moved off and on the rolls, to have families receive crucial support and then lose it, depending on whether someone\u2019s weight has stabilized for a few weeks?\n\n\u201cI get the need to right the ship and make sure only eligible patients receive benefits,\u201d Ms. Bodnar said. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re at risk of discharging patients who aren\u2019t dying fast enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140107112700, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 7, 2014", "keywords": "Elder Care,Hospice Care,Medicare,End-of-Life Care,Give and Take", "GBLC": "End-of-Life Care;Give and Take", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/Bounced From Hospice ( 20140107 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Paula Span", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Paula Span", "byl": "Paula Span", "twitter": {"description": "Hospices are discharging increasing numbers of patients before they die.", "title": "Bounced From Hospice", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/bounced-from-hospice/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002636744, "description": "Hospices are discharging increasing numbers of patients before they die.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 7, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Give and Take", "published_time": 1389112020, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T22:40:29-05:00"}, "utime": 20140121224029, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140107, "pdate": 20140107, "des": "Elder Care;Hospice Care;Medicare", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Hospices are discharging increasing numbers of patients before they die.", "title": "Bounced From Hospice", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/bounced-from-hospice/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/bounced-from-hospice/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Bounced From Hospice", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3675\"", "article_summary": "But I worry about families who have agonized about the decision and finally called for help, then feel betrayed when hospice withdraws, even though their relatives can regain hospice care when they decline further.\nIn the past, \u201cyou never did weights on hospice patients,\u201d Ms. Bodnar said.\nFor months, hospice staffers cared for her in her nursing home.\nLess than a month later, the hospice discharged Mrs. Willette, saying she was not losing ground.\nIndeed, a Washington Post investigation, analyzing a million records of California hospice patients, found that the proportion discharged alive rose 50 percent between 2002 and 2012."}
