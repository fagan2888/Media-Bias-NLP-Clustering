Only intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation have curative potential. However, comorbid conditions may interfere with effective therapy. Although transplantation following low-intensity conditioning is being carried out in patients even in their 70s, these are highly selected patients, and the data cannot be extrapolated to the population at large. Further, such a therapy in older individuals may be associated with considerable morbidity and the need for prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation, stressing the system and draining family resources. As the focus of many older individuals is on quality of life, it is important to emphasize that, for various advanced malignancies, emerging data indicate that quality of life may be better and survival may be longer with palliative care. A re-assessment of treatment decisions in older patients is in order. We tend to 'oversell', and particularly older patients do not have a full understanding of the impact of the proposed therapy on their lives. Our conversations with these patients must include a discussion of supportive/palliative care and must address end-of-life issues. Talking about death may mean talking about life.\n\nTop of page Introduction Modern medicine appears to render almost 'everything possible', and progress in some areas of cancer therapy, including the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, has been remarkable, with cure rates reaching 90% for certain diagnoses and patient groups. Concurrently, however, there has been a staggering increase in health-care cost, and government-funded insurance programs are facing growing deficits. Reasons include the cost of hospitalization, the availability of multiple treatment options for sequential therapy, the price tag on new medications and the aging of the population that places growing demands on resources. As the incidence of cancer increases with age, growing numbers of older individuals are receiving anticancer therapy, often with intensive modalities. As older patients also tend to present with comorbidities, treatment decisions may prove difficult because comorbid conditions affect tolerability and efficacy of anticancer therapy. Toxicity related to treatment and the frequently required prolonged hospitalization have a profound impact on the quality of life (QOL). QOL, however, has a high priority for most older individuals. Further, the need for prolonged care drains health resources, and out-of-pocket expenses exhaust family reserves. It will be important to modify physician and patient attitudes in regards to achievable goals, and include discussions of palliative management earlier in the course, particularly in patients with refractory disease. How will we weigh medical, ethical and socioeconomic aspects in older patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or AML, who are being considered for intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation? We have previously highlighted some of these issues.1 Here we reflect on the philosophical basis in the decision-making process and offer a broader discussion of the relevance of those questions in clinical practice.\n\nTop of page Affluent health-care systems and aging populations Life expectancy and disease The average life expectancy in North America, Western Europe or Japan has increased to 80 years or more.2 To a large extent this increase is because of improved living conditions, safer working environments, changes in nutrition and spectacular advances in medicine. The slogan has been 'the 60s are the new 40s', implying that at the age of 60 years biologically we are really still in the middle of our productive lives. If retiring at the age of 60, people may have a post-retirement lifespan almost as long as their professional careers. Whereas a proportion of those individuals will embark upon 'second' productive careers and contribute to health-care funds, most will not. Further, even though many older individuals are in better health and biologically appear younger than individuals of the same chronologic age some 40 or 50 years ago, classic diseases of older age will develop.3 In fact, longer life may result in an even broader mix of those conditions. Age and comorbidities Diseases other than cancer, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and pulmonary or renal diseases, occur more frequently with advanced age, and will be present as comorbid conditions in patients diagnosed with myeloid malignancies or other types of cancer. The presence of comorbid conditions increases the risk of complications associated with anticancer therapy and is responsible for inferior outcome.4, 5, 6 The fact that manifestations of comorbid conditions are being treated ever more successfully will reduce early mortality and increase the likelihood that older patients presenting with cancer will also present with those comorbidities. As these patients typically take a variety of medications, direct drug effects or drug interactions may further compromise the anticancer treatment strategy and increase the probability of developing new comorbidities, related to therapeutic interventions. Despite much effort, the number of clinical trials specifically tailored to older patients is limited, and treatment strategies for older patients are often based on extrapolation of observations in younger cohorts.7 This leads to a biased selection of those older patients who are likely to tolerate treatment as tested in younger patients. Although possibly cost-effective for a small segment of the population, this is not applicable to older patients in general, despite the slogan that 'age is only a number'. There is considerable heterogeneity, and there are 'fit' as well as 'unfit' older patients. In fact, reaching a particular age, be it 75 or 80 years, represents a biologic selection of fitter individuals with a longer life expectancy.3 Aging and prognosis A detailed review of the process of aging is beyond the scope of our discussion. Aging is associated with a slowing of metabolic processes, a decrease in immunocompetence, an increase in pro-inflammatory signals and senescence of cells and tissues leading to an overall decline of biologic reserve.8 Whereas the senescence of cells is thought to oppose the development of cancer, the balance appears to be tenuous, and other factors including reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and altered repair capacity contribute to the increase in malignancies with age. The same processes may also contribute to differences in disease pathophysiology and greater susceptibility to treatment-related toxicity. Malignant disorders of hematopoiesis, such as MDS or AML, are part of the spectrum of malignancies that increase in frequency with age, and treatment success in patients more than 60 or 65 years of age has consistently been lower than in younger cohorts.9, 10 High-risk karyotypes are more common in older patients with AML, and even markers associated with a more favorable prognosis in younger individuals, such as inv (16) or t (8;21), are not favorable in patients more than 65 years of age.11 Similarly, mutations favorable in younger patients, including those in NMP1, are not associated with a better prognosis in older individuals,12 and 5-year survival in patients with the FLT3 ITD mutations who are older than 55 years is less than 10%, compared with 20% in younger individuals.12, 13, 14 MDS advances more rapidly in older patients: the median life expectancy with intermediate risk MDS by IPSS-R (International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised) criteria is 5.2 years in patients aged 65 years or younger compared with 2.6 years in older patients.15 Age is the most potent adverse risk factor for patients with low-risk MDS in the MD Anderson scoring system.16 Treatment decisions and QOL Thus, the prognostic implications of age, age-associated comorbid conditions and age-dependent biological characteristics of MDS and AML represent important challenges for the design of effective, nontoxic treatment regimens. Advances in our understanding of disease mechanisms, in particular the molecular biology of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies, has resulted in novel treatment modalities by taking advantage of newly identified molecular targets.17, 18 Novel strategies are at least in part responsible for improved tolerability of both nontransplant and transplant strategies in older individuals with MDS or AML. As transplantation is currently the only option with curative potential for patients with MDS, and the most promising strategy for patients with high-risk AML, many older patients will be considered for transplantation, and the development of 'non-myeloablative' or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, has made it possible to offer transplantation to older patients, even in those in their 70s.19, 20 However, although a small subgroup of older patients may greatly benefit from transplantation,19 for many the procedure is not effective, and treatment-related complications, in particular GVHD and infections, are frequent. Current front-line therapy for GVHD, steroids, are poorly tolerated in older individuals; their use will enhance muscle wasting and bone loss and may incapacitate patients.21, 22 Will patients be spending their remaining time in the hospital and in rehabilitation? Available data indicate that with advancing age patient expectations as to their level of activity change, and, generally, goals tend to be more limited.23 QOL, including time spent with family and friends, may be at the top of the list. Physicians have an obligation to care for patients and provide state-of-the-art therapy. However, a primary responsibility is not to do harm, yet complications of aggressive treatment are primarily iatrogenic. Some literature suggests that complications occur no more frequently in older patients than in younger individuals, and that treatment success is not dependent upon age,19 but, as stated already, this is true only in highly selected individuals and cannot be generalized. Of course, we formally discuss those issues when we obtain 'informed' consent from patients. However, it is difficult or impossible for most patients to fully comprehend the implications of therapy. A clear understanding of what a given treatment involves and how it affects the patient long term is typically missing.24, 25 We respect patient autonomy; however, the first element of autonomy, the ability to understand and process information, cannot be assumed to be present.26 These considerations apply, of course, to all patients, but older individuals tend to be more vulnerable. Whereas factors such as depression, common in old age,27 are considered in currently used comorbidity scoring systems6, 28, 29 and affect selection of patients for intensive therapy, others, such as general anxiety, neuroses or phobias, are not. Those conditions, however, interfere with effective communication between patient and treatment team and lead to misunderstandings regarding planned or ongoing therapy.7\n\nTop of page Intensive therapy and the cost of health care Physicians must provide the treatment that is most appropriate for a given patient, and the cost of therapy has not been a primary consideration. However, the development of multiple treatment options for a particular indication leaves choices, and there is a tendency to select the most recent, fashionable modality, even though such novel (and expensive) therapy may offer little practical advantage over a more established (and less costly) strategy.30 Health-care expenditures in most countries have increased progressively and account for a sizable portion of the gross domestic product (Table 1). Longer life expectancy and treatment of an aging population contribute significantly to these expenses. In the United States of America, life time health-care expenses in 2012 were $316 000 per capita (268 700 for men and 361 200 for women, at least 40% of the difference being accounted for by the longer life expectancy of women, that is, 82.2 versus 77.4 years).31, 32 Whereas about one-third of health-care expenses is incurred in middle age, nearly 50% are spent during the senior years. These expenses are calculated for all health care: patients undergoing intensive therapy such as transplantation for AML or MDS are likely to incur expenses far exceeding the calculated average. As intensive therapy is also associated with substantial out-of-pocket expenses and the failure rate is high in older patients, the appropriateness of such therapy must be subject to continuous thoughtful re-assessment, including evaluation of the value of newly emerging therapies. Cost considerations, certainly from a patient perspective, are more important in the United States of America than in other Western countries, as currently only 49% of health-care expenses in the United States of America are covered by Medicaid, Medicare and other state funds, compared with ~75% in other Western countries.33, 34 Table 1 - GDP and health expenditures per capita (in US dollars). Full table\n\nTransplant programs typically generate substantial revenues for the respective centers. Deciding against a transplant would amount to a loss of revenues. A visitor to one American center listened to the presentation of an older patient with treatment-refractory leukemia referred for transplantation and commented that this particular patient was not a good candidate for transplantation. The center physicians agreed, but replied that the patient had been referred for transplantation, and, hence, a transplant would be carried out. Whereas insurance coverage and reimbursement policies differ from country to country, there are similarities. In France, for example, reimbursement is substantially higher for intensive inpatient treatment (induction chemotherapy and transplantation) than for ambulatory care, clearly generating a financial conflict of interest when deciding between more intensive (inpatient) and less expensive (ambulatory) therapy.\n\nTop of page Ethics of treatment decisions Promising new treatment options have become available for many diseases, and patients, or more often their families, present with even higher expectations as to treatment results; they want 'everything done',24 frequently under circumstances where the likelihood of success is vanishingly small. Their father may be 82 years old, but he is in good shape (other than his treatment-refractory leukemia)\u2014why not offer a transplant? Yes, this is possible; however, does the fact that it is possible to imply that such treatment should be given? Most importantly, is it in the patient\u2019s best interest? There is no simple answer, and none that can be applied across the board. Physicians like to use established decision tools, which relieve them, to a degree, from the responsibility of making decisions on the basis of their personal judgment.6, 28 However, these instruments amount to a 'scientific formalization', reflecting a normative approach, which disregards the fact that there is always an individual, irreducible core of uncertainty. Transplantation may be the only treatment with curative potential; however, there is no guarantee, and with current tools we are unable to determine beforehand in whom the transplant will be successful and in whom it will not. We cannot predict in whom our efforts will prove futile.35 Another important ethical challenge for all treatment decisions lies in the pipeline of new therapeutic compounds reaching the market. New drugs may, indeed, offer short-term gains, even though they may not result in improved long-term outcome. On the other hand, although not curative, these drugs may transform certain malignancies into chronic diseases, without the risks associated with intensive therapy. This, in turn, raises additional potential conflicts. Prolonged use of a medication (for example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, hypomethylating agents) is of great interest to the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing and marketing those drugs, which come at a high financial cost. In fact, the price for many of the recently introduced anticancer compounds is exorbitant, and one could argue that a one-time effort at transplantation, in comparison, would be economically attractive. Of course, this argument cannot negate the potential problems, including mortality, associated with intensive therapy. Further, physicians are reluctant to decline patient requests. There is the emotional attachment, and often there is the feeling of guilt for not having fulfilled the patient\u2019s hopes. Typically, this attitude is combined with a reluctance to openly discuss potential poor outcome, including the possibility of death, even though 'talking about death means talking about life'.36 In addition, patients may not be prepared to accept a 'realistic assessment'. The fact that intensive treatment may shorten the patient\u2019s lifespan because of complications related to such therapy37, 38 often receives little attention in the consenting process. Physicians are not free of bias, and our attitudes are conveyed to patients; even if the same facts are presented, the discussion by colleagues may send different signals.39 Is the option of supportive care included in the discussion, and does the patient understand what palliative care can offer?37, 40 This is an important juncture, and only the team, that is, physicians along with patients and their families, can arrive at an acceptable decision. Here, physicians must truly practice the art of medicine, an undertaking that requires preparedness and time.40 The primary task of medicine is to preserve or restore health and to reduce suffering in every individual patient, yet this is distinctly different from extending life at any cost.24 Extension of life, with the patient hospitalized, proceeding from one chemotherapy regimen to the next in an effort to delay death, cannot be a desirable goal. Of course, patient attitudes vary and one certainly does not want to miss a chance\u2014if there is a realistic chance\u2014but how high does this chance have to be, and how uncertain a path is acceptable?40 These issues raise fundamental questions, not restricted to medical considerations, but involving central ethical positions.40 Although the questions pertain to patients of any age, the answers become more difficult with advanced age, related to typical life expectancy, comorbid conditions and, probably, socioeconomic considerations.\n\nTop of page Health-care systems, treatment access and economics Political systems and individual resources, in addition to cultural patterns, determine accessibility of and approach to health care. Historically, countries with communist administrations offered comprehensive health services to the 'productive' sections of society, typically individuals up to 65 years of age, whereas older patients, following their retirement, were moved to the side lines. This is not what we are striving for, there is no intention to 'ration' treatment, and most countries have attempted to establish fair systems, using different approaches. The Affordable Care Act is a recent effort to that effect in the United States of America. Other countries have tested various strategies. The United Kingdom, for example, has established the National Health Service that provides government-funded care for everybody, but with restrictions and stipulations regarding patient age and the projected gain from a given treatment, which are determined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the performance of which is reviewed on a regular basis. The NHS is negotiating price ceilings for new medications with the pharmaceutical industry, often at the cost of delaying drug availability in comparison with countries, such as the United States of America. In view of the fact that certain new medications, although offering, for example, greater convenience, may not offer clinically significant response or survival advantages, this strategy may not represent a real disadvantage for patients.30 The French government, through the Caisse Nationale Assurance Maladie provides health insurance coverage for everybody, but has taken a different path. The state covers 100% for 'severe' diseases, including leukemia and chronic disorders. For complete financial coverage of other diseases and for certain medications supplemental private insurances are available. However, this strategy appears to be leading to sizable budgetary deficits.41 What can the United States of America learn from the experience in these countries with single payer systems?33, 42\n\nTop of page Changing perspectives With the aging of the population and the age-associated increased frequency of many types of cancer, including MDS and AML, considerable demands are being placed on health-care systems. Would it be appropriate to design treatment modalities based not only on the disease stage but also on the patient age? Are there ways of easing current demands and of optimizing the use of resources? Education Most patients have little appreciation of the actual cost of treatment, and physicians and clinical investigators have a tendency to disregard expenses. However, state-supported insurance programs face rapidly growing deficits, and individual insurance premiums are not sufficient to cover fully modern therapy at current cost. While treatment must not be withheld where it is appropriate, physicians need to help patients understand all treatment options, including the fact that not all novel (and expensive) therapies are more efficacious than more established modalities.30 Patients need to know that third- or fourth-line salvage therapy may not induce remissions and, in fact, may lead to complications that may shorten rather than extend survival and keep them in the hospital for their remaining time. Physicians on the other hand, must be willing to acknowledge failure of treatment, without considering this a defeat. Physicians must incorporate, in early discussions with patients, the real possibility that treatment will not be effective, introduce the concept of palliative care37, 38 and be willing to address end-of-life questions,36, 43 particularly in older individuals who are less likely to tolerate well and respond to multiple cycles of therapy. Finally, as these considerations are being incorporated in medical school curricula, we must mentor trainees in hematology and oncology to allow them to be comfortable in those conversations with patients. Consideration of ethics Transplantation is often considered the only appropriate therapy for myeloid malignancies. Results have improved progressively,44 and the age ceiling\u2014if a ceiling is, indeed, considered\u2014has been raised to 70, 75 years or even older.19 Published data indicate that some patients in that age bracket are transplanted successfully.20 However, even among these highly selected patients, maybe only 20% will survive in remission, their QOL often impaired by treatment-related complications. Furthermore, for the remaining patients, the procedure is likely to have shortened life, and the emotional and financial stress may have been substantial. Controlled prospective studies such as the current trial comparing transplantation to nontransplant therapy or supportive care in patients with MDS older than 50 years (clinical trials.gov, NCT 02016781) are needed, and end points must include not only remission status and survival but also QOL37 and, possibly, treatment costs and the impact of such treatment on financial resources of the family. We are mortal,23 and some of us are likely to die from AML, MDS or other malignancies. Of course, recent developments offer an ever increasing assortment of therapies, and if one strategy is not successful, there are additional options. But how far should we push? How many patients are there who continue to receive chemotherapy, while the disease is progressing, during the last week of their lives, clearly in a futile effort?45 These strategies disregard patient dignity. Moreover, as discussed, for various malignancies, palliative care has been associated with longer survival and better QOL than intensive therapy.37, 38 Any discussion, particularly with older patients with advanced malignancies must include an 'end-of-life' conversation. This requires a balance of honesty, empathy and identification of achievable goals.36 Cost Health care is expensive, more so in the United States of America than in other Western countries, and not sustainable at the present level. As a French colleague stated, We are on a cloud and heading for the precipice. The aging of the population will continue to increase expenses. Many approaches to cost reduction have been proposed.46 A shift from medical to social optimal care may be required.46 The ratio of working 'contributors' to insurance funds such as Medicare, and the number of 'consumers' drawing from those funds will decrease, adding further stress to the system. Are we willing to contribute ever greater proportions of income to health insurance, and do so in a way that may eventually benefit ourselves, but certainly will be used by other members of society?33, 42, 47 Individual and societal attitudes differ between cultures and political systems. Some patients may demand that the last penny be spent on their care while others consider the resources of those they leave behind. Social responsibility is poorly developed in the United States of America\u2014will this change with the shifting ethnic composition of the country? Can we formulate a compelling plan to show that everybody in this heterogeneous country will benefit, eventually, if all contribute? The physician\u2019s primary concern must be the good of the individual patient. However, societal interests are part of physicians' responsibilities, and financial stewardship, trading low chances of a small benefit in a single patient for a larger benefit to many patients by way of preserving resources, may have to be considered. This may be counter to the attitude that 'everyone has it in their own power',33 but may be necessary in the national interest. Clearly, there are no noncontroversial answers to these questions. Nevertheless, these issues must be addressed by the medical community, specifically oncologists and hematologists. The answers, however, will require participation of our society at large, that is where the discussions need to take place. Those discussions must include consideration of the likely success of therapy, prioritization of therapy, the usefulness of palliation, the impact of treatment on the patient\u2019s QOL, end-of-life questions and socioeconomic considerations, in an effort to achieve a balance.\n\nTop of page Conflict of interest The author declares no conflict of interest.\n\nTop of page References Deeg HJ, Steuten LM.
