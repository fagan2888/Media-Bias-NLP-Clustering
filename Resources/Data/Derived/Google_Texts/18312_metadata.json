At last, his mother took him to a pediatric weight management clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. But she did not at all like the dietitian\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t buy Chips Ahoy! cookies,\u201d said the mother, herself a nurse.\n\nThis was hardly the first time that Mary Savoye, the exasperated dietitian who recalled this exchange, had counseled parents who seem unable to acknowledge the harsh truth about their child\u2019s weight.\n\n\u201cOften they don\u2019t want to accept it because change means a lot of work for everyone, including themselves,\u201d Savoye said.\n\nDespite widespread publicity about the obesity epidemic, parents increasingly seem to be turning a blind eye as their children put on pounds. In a recent study in Childhood Obesity more than three-quarters of parents of preschool-age obese sons and nearly 70 percent of parents of obese daughters described their children as \u201cabout the right weight.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also compared these 2012 survey results with those from a similar survey in 1994. Not only were the children in the recent survey significantly heavier, but the likelihood that parents could identify their child\u2019s weight accurately had declined about 30 percent.\n\nDr. David L. Katz, the director of Yale\u2019s Prevention Research Center, has coined a word for the problem: \u201coblivobesity.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents cannot ignore the threat of obesity to our children and still hope to fix it,\u201d he wrote in an editorial accompanying the new study.\n\nOne reason parents may have difficulty perceiving their child\u2019s weight is because of the \u201cnew normal\u201d: Throughout the developed world and even in some developing countries, children are generally becoming heavier.\n\nBut Katz also cited parents for \u201cwillful, genuine denial.\u201d\n\nOnce a parent acknowledges the child has a problem, he said, \u201cyou have to deal with it.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Do I become the food police? Do I have to change my diet and walk the walk?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cSo, often, it\u2019s easier to pretend the problem\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nOther experts counter that the problem can be complicated and subtle, the result of family dynamics. Perhaps the parents are resigned to being overweight. Perhaps there are slender siblings, and the parents cannot figure out a diet that fits all.\n\n\u201cDenial can be a coping mechanism,\u201d said Arnaldo Perez, a doctoral candidate at the University of Alberta who researches what motivates families to seek help for their overweight children. Before judging them outright, providers should explore parents\u2019 possible feelings of guilt and failure, he said.\n\nDenial may also be a form of wishful thinking.\n\nIt is \u201cnatural for a parent to want to think optimistically about their child,\u201d said Thomas N. Robinson, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Center for Healthy Weight at Stanford and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford.\u201cI have parents tell me that they waited to address it because they thought their child would \u2018grow out\u2019 of their extra weight.\u201d\n\nKatz and others said that a first step in helping parents help their children was to set aside the shame that might be their biggest impediment.\n\n\u201cIt has to be about love,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies have to approach this together. This is not just about the child.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003096806-FL_SAR_HFYOUTH07.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca61d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDenial can be a coping mechanism,\u201d said Arnaldo Perez, a doctoral candidate at the University of Alberta who researches what motivates families to seek help for their overweight children.\nDespite widespread publicity about the obesity epidemic, parents increasingly seem to be turning a blind eye as their children put on pounds.\nNot only were the children in the recent survey significantly heavier, but the likelihood that parents could identify their child\u2019s weight accurately had declined about 30 percent.\nOne reason parents may have difficulty perceiving their child\u2019s weight is because of the \u201cnew normal\u201d: Throughout the developed world and even in some developing countries, children are generally becoming heavier.\nDo I have to change my diet and walk the walk?\u2019\u201d he added."}
