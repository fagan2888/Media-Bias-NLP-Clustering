He spent most of last week trying to explain, re-explain and then explain again his stance on the Iraq War, but in between explanations he managed to weigh in on healthcare policy. His remarks on the topic were drowned out somewhat by his headline-grabbing Iraq War shambles, but they were noteworthy for how they captured the bankruptcy of the GOP\u2019s approach to healthcare.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg News, Jeb was holding an event at a brewery in Arizona and he launched into a standard-issue exhortation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In the middle of his spiel, Bush started talking about his Apple Watch and how wearable technology holds the potential to shake up how we access health information.\n\n\u201cOn this device, in five years, will be applications that will allow me to manage my healthcare in ways that five years ago were not even possible,\u201d Jeb imagined. \u201cI\u2019ll have the ability \u2013 someone will look at my blood sugar, there\u2019ll be a wireless \u2013 someone will send me a signal, it\u2019ll come here, I\u2019ll get a double beep saying \u2018you just ate a butterscotch sundae,\u2019 or something like that. You went way over the top, you\u2019re a diabetic, you can\u2019t do that, whatever.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing vision of the future! And I have no doubt that someone like Jeb Bush, who is very wealthy and can afford to purchase fancy Wi-Fi-enabled watches that sync up to a system that remotely monitors his blood levels and whatnot, will happily take full advantage of this incredible service. But the question is: How do the rest of us get there? What does Jeb have in mind healthcare policy-wise that makes this revolutionary (and likely very expensive) system broadly accessible?\n\nAfter all, as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff points out, these amazing healthcare services aren\u2019t going to materialize out of thin air. \u201cThere is not some army of benevolent people out there monitoring blood sugar.\u201d The \u201csomeone\u201d Jeb imagines who will keep an eye on his sugar consumption is going to want to be paid for doing so, very likely through insurance. So what does Jeb propose?\n\nWell, he wants to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with \u2026 something. In his Apple Watch remarks, Jeb called for replacing Obamacare with \u201ca consumer-directed model where people are engaged in making healthcare decisions for themselves, and where they\u2019re given the tools to do so.\u201d That\u2019s meaningless boilerplate that pretty much every Republican candidate endorses when talking about healthcare \u2013 more choice, more freedom, more flexibility, etc.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush envisions a healthcare system that costs nothing, regulates no one and exploits high-end wearable tech VIDEO", "title": "Jeb\u2019s bankrupt healthcare fantasy: Expanding coverage with Apple Watches and freedom", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jeb Bush envisions a healthcare system that costs nothing, regulates no one and exploits high-end wearable tech VIDEO", "title": "Jeb\u2019s bankrupt healthcare fantasy: Expanding coverage with Apple Watches and freedom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/jebs_bankrupt_healthcare_fantasy_expanding_coverage_with_apple_watches_and_freedom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/jeb_bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush envisions a healthcare system that costs nothing, regulates no one and exploits high-end wearable tech VIDEO", "title": "Jeb\u2019s bankrupt healthcare fantasy: Expanding coverage with Apple Watches and freedom", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/jeb_bush.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Apple Watch, Free Market, healthcare, Healthcare Reform, Jeb Bush, Obamacare, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Apple Watch, Free Market, healthcare, Healthcare Reform, Jeb Bush, Obamacare, Video, Politics NewsJeb Bush has some ideas about healthcare.\nIn the middle of his spiel, Bush started talking about his Apple Watch and how wearable technology holds the potential to shake up how we access health information.\nWhat does Jeb have in mind healthcare policy-wise that makes this revolutionary (and likely very expensive) system broadly accessible?\nAfter all, as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff points out, these amazing healthcare services aren\u2019t going to materialize out of thin air.\nYou went way over the top, you\u2019re a diabetic, you can\u2019t do that, whatever.\u201dIt\u2019s an amazing vision of the future!"}
