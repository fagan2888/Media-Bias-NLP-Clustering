More than half \u2013 or 52 percent \u2013 of the $25 billion that states spent annually on public assistance programs between 2009 and 2011 went to individuals and families with at least one member who works. For the federal government, the percentage was even higher, with 56 percent of public assistance money going to working families.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not that the recipients are out of work and living off welfare programs. As a result, the authors conclude that \u201chigher wages and increases in employer-provided health insurance would result in significant Medicaid savings that states and the federal government could apply to other programs and priorities.\u201d\n\nThe study cites the well-known fact that for the bottom 70 percent of the income distribution in the U.S., inflation-adjusted earnings either remained stagnant or fell between 2003 and 2013. However, the report takes the unique step of assessing how much the individual states and the federal government spend in order to bring low-wage workers up to a reasonable standard of living.\n\nTo be fair, the study uses a rather expansive definition of working families, characterizing them as \u201cthose that have at least one family member who works 27 or more weeks per year and 10 or more hours per week.\u201d\n\nUsing data from 2009 to 2011, the researchers determined that 61 percent of individuals enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP are members of families where at least one member works. Among TANF recipients, the rate was 32 percent. Among Earned Income Tax Credit recipients, 74 percent come from working families, while the same is true for 36 percent of food stamp users.\n\nRelated: 11 New Tax Laws House Republicans Want to Pass Now\n\nThis translates into a de facto subsidy for low-wage employers, many of whose workers would not be able to function without the public assistance funds that keep them fed and healthy. The numbers are particularly high among front-line fast food workers, where 52 percent of employees rely on some form of public assistance, and among childcare and home health care workers, where the rates are 46 percent and 48 percent respectively.\n\nThe study also notes that many public assistance recipients are not in lines of work typically associated with poverty. One in four part-time college faculty members, for example, receive public assistance, the authors wrote.\n\nRelated: Tax Day \u2013 Americans Muddle Through a Flawed System\n\nOf course, businesses that rely on low-cost labor would likely pass the cost of higher payrolls on to their customers, so a portion of the tax dollars not needed for public assistance would be eaten up by higher prices. Yet the upside would be a more efficient system, where businesses cannot rely on invisible subsidies to create artificially low prices.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S. taxpayers deliver a whopping $152.8 billion subsidy to low-wage companies by supplementing their employees\u2019 meager wages through both state and federal public assistance programs.", "title": "How Your Tax Dollars Subsidize Low-Wage Industries", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/15/How-Your-Tax-Dollars-Subsidize-Low-Wage-Industries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03302012_Walmart_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/15/How-Your-Tax-Dollars-Subsidize-Low-Wage-Industries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03302012_Walmart_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "U.S. taxpayers deliver a whopping $152.8 billion subsidy to low-wage companies by supplementing their employees\u2019 meager wages through both state and federal public assistance programs.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The study also notes that many public assistance recipients are not in lines of work typically associated with poverty.\nAn assessment of the rate at which working families receive public assistance payments finds that taxpayers deliver a whopping $152.8 billion subsidy to low-wage companies by supplementing their employees\u2019 meager wages.\nFor the federal government, the percentage was even higher, with 56 percent of public assistance money going to working families.\nOne in four part-time college faculty members, for example, receive public assistance, the authors wrote.\nAmong Earned Income Tax Credit recipients, 74 percent come from working families, while the same is true for 36 percent of food stamp users."}
