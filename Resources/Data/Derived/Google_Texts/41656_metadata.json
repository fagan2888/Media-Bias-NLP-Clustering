Scalise treated him to a tour of the state Capitol, and later that year, McCarthy was the biggest national figure to endorse Scalise for Congress \u2014 and cut him a check. Eric Cantor followed suit \u2014 at McCarthy\u2019s behest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCantor is now on his way out of Congress, and this duo \u2014 their political fortunes still twinned \u2014 face a shared challenge: reshaping a House Republican leadership that has at times seemed beset by divisions and distant from the rank and file. McCarthy, of California, will become House majority leader on July 31, and Scalise, of Louisiana, will be the majority whip \u2014 a leadership shakeup resulting from Cantor\u2019s shocking primary loss last month.\n\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Kevin McCarthy?)\n\nIn separate interviews last week, the pair laid out a fresh direction for the House GOP that includes an agenda that\u2019s less leadership driven and more inclusive of members\u2019 desires. They envision a more strategic leadership structure, complete with a team focused on long-term legislative planning. No more shoehorning ideas into a bill and hoping the votes will follow.\n\n\u201cMy style is very collective,\u201d McCarthy said, speaking in his Capitol office. \u201c[I] like to have a lot of input from others. I like committees to do their work. Empowering committees. I like accountability in the process.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou always win the argument before you win the vote. Sometimes we try to win the vote before we\u2019ve won the argument.\u201d\n\nA collaborative leadership team will be a boon. Leaderships are often composed of a mesh of unbridled \u2014 and sometimes competing \u2014 ambition. Early in this House GOP majority, Cantor and Speaker John Boehner spent months privately \u2014 and even sometimes publicly \u2014 feuding. But Boehner has known McCarthy since the Californian was a staff aide on the House Administration Committee. There is a sense that the tough dynamics within the leadership, and between leaders and the rank and file, have fallen away.\n\n( PHOTOS: Steve Scalise\u2019s career)\n\nBut the relationships of the new leadership team will still be tested \u2014 and soon.\n\nA supplemental spending bill to combat the influx of migrants on the Texas border has already drawn criticism from some conservatives. Putting together a deal and passing it through the House will test one of the central elements of Scalise\u2019s candidacy for majority whip: his ability to bring conservatives into the fold.\n\nOther issues \u2014 a renewal of government-backed terrorism insurance and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank \u2014 will test how McCarthy handles one of the party\u2019s most ideologically stringent chairmen: Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling of the Financial Services Committee. The business community is furious that the House hasn\u2019t yet acted on either issue.\n\nMeanwhile, government funding needs to be reauthorized before Sept. 30, or else the government will again shut down.\n\nFissures within leadership are sure to emerge \u2014 particularly over what to do with Obamacare.\n\nAfter years of lobbing sharp criticism at the law, McCarthy refused to commit to a vote on the party\u2019s own prescription for health care reforms. Conservatives have pressed for a vote on legislation before Election Day, but chairmen have resisted, worried about protecting their turf.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of health care bills out there,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou also have to look to the committee process, what\u2019s been through, what\u2019s not. It\u2019s all part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nScalise, meanwhile, has built his brand around pushing a health care replacement bill through the House.\n\nHe said he will \u201ccontinue to advocate for the things I\u2019ve felt are the right approaches for our party to be successful at winning the debate and changing the policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A collaborative leadership team with the new leaders would be a boon to the GOP.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A collaborative leadership team with the new leaders would be a boon to the GOP.", "title": "Parallel paths: McCarthy and Scalise", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/kevin-mccarthy-steve-scalise-gop-leadership-109154.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/20/140720_kevin_mccarthy_steve_scalise_js_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Congress,Steve Scalise,House Republicans,Eric Cantor,Kevin McCarthy,John Boehner", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe60c9\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Parallel paths: McCarthy and ScaliseTheir parallel rise began in the late 1990s, when Kevin McCarthy, the national chairman of the Young Republicans, became good pals with Steve Scalise, a local leader in Louisiana.\nScalise treated him to a tour of the state Capitol, and later that year, McCarthy was the biggest national figure to endorse Scalise for Congress \u2014 and cut him a check.\nMcCarthy and Scalise envision a more strategic leadership structure.\nMcCarthy, of California, will become House majority leader on July 31, and Scalise, of Louisiana, will be the majority whip \u2014 a leadership shakeup resulting from Cantor\u2019s shocking primary loss last month.\nSometimes we try to win the vote before we\u2019ve won the argument.\u201dA collaborative leadership team will be a boon."}
