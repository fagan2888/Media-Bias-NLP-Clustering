The Washington Post did what Erdely and Rolling Stone had refused to do\u2014some actual reporting\u2014and exposed massive holes in the accuser\u2019s story. (Some examples: Though the Rolling Stone article portrayed the alleged assault as some kind of fraternity initiation, no member of the fraternity fit Erdely\u2019s description of the attack ringleader, Drew, a fellow lifeguard of Jackie. Indeed, there\u2019s no evidence that a fraternity party even took place on the night of the alleged incident.) Both the accuser, \u201cJackie,\u201d and Erdely herself have ceased doing interviews on the tale.\n\nErdely easily could have discovered at least some of her source\u2019s problems that the Post uncovered. For instance, nothing in Rolling Stone\u2019s agreement with Jackie not to contact the only other people possibly with first-hand knowledge about the alleged rape precluded Erdely from contacting other people at the alleged party to determine if Drew attended, if he attended with Jackie, and if Jackie were seen after the alleged incident. If Erdely had done that basic reporting, Jackie\u2019s story might never have seen the light of day. But Erdely was committed by her own admission to finding a story that would confirm her preconceptions about a campus violent crime wave against women.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that the majority of survivors who come forward are telling the truth.\u201d\n\nWhatever happened to Jackie that night\u2014real or imagined\u2014made VA fraternities victims of this story. According to the ground rules of the interview with Jackie, Erdely couldn\u2019t contact the men Jackie named as rapists. But she was free to talk to others at the fraternity and anyone else on campus. (Leave aside the question of why Rolling Stone apparently wasn\u2019t troubled by its sole source insisting that the reporter not speak to the only people who might be able to challenge her version of events.)\n\nThat\u2019s what The Post did when it contacted Phi Kappa Psi\u2019s lawyer and learned that the fraternity never hosted a party on the night in question and that Drew, the alleged rapist, claims he never met Jackie let alone invited her out on a date.\n\nBacking the Wrong Horse\n\nThe rise and fall of the Rolling Stone article should\u2014but almost certainly will not\u2014focus intense attention on UVA president Teresa Sullivan. Trusting no more than Erdely\u2019s word, Sullivan made a significant policy decision: she suspended not merely the fraternity in question, but all fraternities at UVA. She also expressed support for allowing campus police to enter fraternities (and, it seems, only fraternities) without probable cause.\n\nSullivan\u2019s actions came not from well-reasoned consideration, but from a rushed acceptance of a flawed story. If Rolling Stone\u2019s target had been a group on the other side of the campus race/class/gender divide, would Sullivan have acted as she did, accompanied by a ringing proclamation to drive out the \u201cevil\u201d that lurks on campus?\n\nRelated: Guilt by Accusation: How Colleges Deal with Campus Sex\n\n\n\nThe Post article also buried an item of extraordinary significance on the university front. It turns out that Erdely discovered Jackie and her story not from an \u201cactivist\u201d group or from the reporter\u2019s own research\u2014but from a University of Virginia employee.\n\nEarlier this year, UVA hired Emily Renda as a \u201csexual violence awareness specialist.\u201d Renda told the Post that she introduced Erdely to Jackie in July. She didn\u2019t reveal how she herself had come into contact with Erdely, and Erdely thus far has not commented on the connection. It\u2019s unclear if Renda will face any consequences for peddling an inaccurate, unverified story\u2014but one that badly damaged her employer\u2019s reputation\u2014to a national magazine.\n\nJ\u2019accuse!\n\nThe story\u2019s aftermath also has exposed the Orwellian language too often used to discuss sexual assault issues on campus. Here\u2019s a comment from Alex Pinkleton, who The Post describes as one of Jackie\u2019s friends and someone \u201cwho survived a rape and an attempted rape during her first two years on campus.\u201d There was no trial, much less a conviction in the Pinkleton case, yet neither The Post nor Pinkleton use the standard qualifying \u201callegedly\u201d\u2014 as someone who \u201csurvived an allegedly attempted murder\u201d -- if no evidence existed of any crime beyond the interviewee\u2019s word.\n\nIn the event, here\u2019s Pinkleton: \u201cOne of my biggest fears with these inconsistencies emerging is that people will be unwilling to believe survivors in the future. However, we need to remember that the majority of survivors who come forward are telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the men win, their names likely will come up in such a story, and some people will believe the allegations more than the vindication.\u201d\n\nPinkleton\u2019s belief that only \u201cthe majority of survivors who come forward are telling the truth\u201d means that even this extremist victims\u2019 rights activist concedes that some unspecified minority of \u201csurvivors\u201d are not telling the truth. But if someone is not telling the truth about being raped, in what way can she be a \u201csurvivor\u201d of sexual assault? The \u201csurvivor,\u201d in such an instance, would be the student falsely accused.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake, of course, is that this kind of finger-pointing justice undercuts the real victims of rape. In college, an accusation is as good as a conviction \u2013 no trial, no DNA, no defense necessary. The more these charges are disproved as men fight back, the worse it is for the real victims.\n\nFinally, Eugene Volokh, at The Post has a long, interesting analysis on possibilities of a libel suit against Rolling Stone for the students targeted by Erdely and Jackie. Though the grounds are plausible, he expresses doubts that such a suit will ever be filed. If the students sue, Volokh astutely observed, \u201ceven if they win, their names likely will come up in such a story, and some people will believe the allegations more than the vindication (or will just remember the allegations more than the vindication).\u201d\n\nThis principle applies not merely to a libel suit in this instance but more broadly to due process suits for students branded a rapist as a result of rigged campus disciplinary procedures. More than a dozen universities nonetheless are currently facing such lawsuits. How many\u2014including, perhaps, based on what we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks, the University of Virginia\u2014fail to provide even basic due process to students accused of sexual assault?\n\nHanna Rosin, an analyst at Slate, summed it up this way: What this Rolling Stone story shows is that maybe we\u2019ve reached a point where we hold stories about rape to a lower standard.\n\nThis article also appears in Minding the Campus.
