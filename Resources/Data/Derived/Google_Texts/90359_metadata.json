But his supporters should know it\u2019s all an act.\n\nDonald Trump is marching toward the Republican presidential nomination, sweeping all five primaries this week. And despite the persistent efforts of the GOP establishment to stop him, Trump\u2019s poll numbers keep climbing. The best chance for derailing his path to the nomination will likely be Trump himself.\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity among Republican primary voters centers on his bombastic personality and his propensity for saying whatever pops into his head. Voters have equated that with authenticity.\n\nBut last Friday, Trump\u2019s new campaign guru, Paul Manafort, told a Republican National Committee meeting in Florida that Trump would change his unfiltered ways if he were to win the nomination, assuring them the candidate would become more presidential.\n\nThat may be soothing for uneasy party leaders. But what about Trump supporters who gave him their votes in large part because they like him just the way he is \u2014 or the way they think he is? Take that away, and there isn\u2019t much left.\n\nTrump is style over substance. Over the years, on major issues from Obamacare to abortion, he has changed his mind over and over again. Similarly, he\u2019s flip-flopped on immigration, ISIS and foreign policy.\n\nTrump is a reality TV show star, and he\u2019s running a campaign that\u2019s hugely entertaining. And there\u2019s no denying it is resonating with voters who are angry and ready for something vastly different.\n\nBut do they really know what they\u2019re getting in Donald Trump? In light of Manafort\u2019s revelation, that\u2019s a question his supporters should be asking.\n\nFollowing Manafort\u2019s comments, Trump has tried mightily to reassure his fans that he\u2019s the same boorish guy. On Monday, he bashed Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump\u2019s two remaining rivals for the GOP nomination, for how he eats his pancakes.\n\n\u201cDid you see him? He has a news conference all the time when he\u2019s eating. I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion,\u201d Trump said in Rhode Island.\n\nAfter Tuesday night\u2019s impressive wins, he again enraged women by declaring the only thing Hillary Clinton has going for her is \u201cthe woman card.\u201d\n\nTrump says he can do better, but doesn\u2019t really want to.\n\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d he said during a campaign rally over the weekend in Waterbury, Conn., while mugging like a puckish child. \u201cI\u2019m like a really smart person. Like a lot of you people. Presidential is easy.\u201d\n\nBut he also acknowledged, \u201cIf I acted presidential, I guarantee I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nTrump is right about that.\n\nAnd increasingly, Republicans who looked to this summer\u2019s national convention in Cleveland to finally stop Trump are seeing that hope slip away.\n\n\u201cAverage voters do not want a contested convention,\u201d says Michigan pollster Steve Mitchell. \u201cIn order to stop that, enough voters may decide to go for Trump to avoid a deadly convention battle.\u201d\n\nGOP political strategist Katie Packer, who started an anti-Trump political action committee, says despite Manafort\u2019s reassurances, it isn\u2019t possible to remake Trump.\n\nThe truth of this reality show is that with the campaign winding down, voters still don\u2019t know the real Donald Trump, or if the candidate even knows who he is himself.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1TxGQwx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Trump is winning the nomination reality show.
