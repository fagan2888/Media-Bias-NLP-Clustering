This is a very big deal,\" Lee said.\n\nConversely, Lee said, taxpayers are free to file an amended return if their tax form indicates they are due money back.\n\nThese problems and the delays in getting answers have frustrated thousands of Californians who have wanted to complete their tax forms and find out whether they owe money to Uncle Sam or stand to receive a refund.\n\nConsumers may have to repay some portion of their government subsidy as part of their tax return if their income was higher than what they estimated during enrollment. Others who qualified for more government assistance in 2014 could get a refund.\n\nCovered California said it sent incorrect information on some forms because its customer data didn't match what health plans had on file.\n\nFor instance, there may have been a discrepancy for the person's length of coverage in 2014 and amount of subsidy received. Overall, Covered California sent out nearly 900,000 tax forms.\n\nLee cautioned that the exchange is still sorting through numerous files and some forms might not be available until after the tax filing deadline of April 15.\n\n\"This is the first tax season ever that healthcare and taxes are interwoven,\" Lee said. \"We are learning from this.\"\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare: California sends 120,000 corrected tax forms, thousands more coming", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's Obamacare exchange has sent out 120,000 corrected tax forms, but it said tens of thousands of other consumers are still waiting for their information.", "title": "Obamacare: California sends 120,000 corrected tax forms, thousands more coming", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-tax-forms-20150323-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55103903/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-tax-forms-20150323", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, taxes, 1095", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83124765", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-23", "Description": "California's Obamacare exchange has sent out 120,000 corrected tax forms, but it said tens of thousands of other consumers are still waiting for their information.
