A Kentucky mom who lost her preferred health care plan confronted President Obama Friday about Obamacare’s failings.

“I’m probably not the only one whose had really a panicked experience lately trying to figure out if my 10-year-old son can continue with his specialist or not,” Rebecca Stewart said during an online forum hosted by the White House. “I know that I can’t keep my plan — which I liked — but as I’m trying to figure out what to do going forward, I’ve spent weeks with days on the phone getting confidently delivered wrong answers, conflicting information. What are you doing to fix this, or simplify what appears to be such a complicated process?”

Obama’s first response was that a White House staffer would call Stewart to help her resolve her problem.

Stewart told Elisabeth Hasselbeck on “Fox & Friends” Monday, that she did get a call, but she still doesn’t have an answer.

“We were promised that we were going to be able to keep this [coverage], and now we’re not, and I can’t even get an answer about it,” she said.

Hasselbeck asked the mom, who needs coverage for her two children, what she would like to say to the president.

“The president says, ‘Everything’s OK. Everyone’s happy. It’s almost fixed,’” Hasselbeck said. “What’s your message to him?”

If he’s talking about the website, Stewart said, his answer may be accurate.

“But I’m talking about answers that actually affect people like me, and I’m talking about people all across the country that need to pay attention to this,” she said. “Cut out the politics and get down to the facts.”
