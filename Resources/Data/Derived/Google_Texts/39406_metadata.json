Upon learning of the kidnapping the Guachene community and Cantoni's family sent out an alert to the nearby towns of Corinto and Toribio, and to the Indigenous Guards of those towns who immediately activated \"control sites\" located along the local roads and throughout the territory. The family did provide a description of a \"white camper truck\" as the vehicle used by the kidnappers.\n\nAccording to a press release of the Indigenous Councils Association of Northern Cauca, known by it's Spanish language acronym ACIN, the Indigenous Guards and members of the Afro-Colombian community stayed on alert, paying special attention to all of the vehicles traveling throughout the area. Other sources described the sweep conducted by the Indigenous Guards and Afro-Colombians as being done by a \"human chain.\"\n\nBy noon of that Thursday, the Indigenous Guards had located the car that was used by the kidnappers on the outskirts of the towns of Corinto and Toribio, \"allowing them to deduce that Alejandra was in that sector,\" according to the ACIN press statement. The team of searchers intensified their efforts in and around the town of Toribio, \"pressuring the captors to release the girl by early evening in Toribio.\"\n\nCatoni was found in the town of Toribio by state authorities and the Indigenous Guard at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 29, several hours after her abduction that same morning. Cantoni is the daughter of Sgt. Victor Cantoni, commander of the Padilla Police Station and local police and federal soldiers assisted in the search. Prior to discovering the 10 year-old Indigenous Guards had delivered two alleged kidnappers to regional police.\n\nThe identities of the two men had not been released as of press time but details of the daylong rescue effort were made public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A young Afro-Colombian girl\u2014who was rescued by Indigenous Guards and others\u2014had been mistakenly kidnapped by the FARC rebel group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/15/farc-mistakenly-kidnap-colombian-girl-rescued-indigenous-guards-155292", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/alejandra_cantoni_-_courtesy_correoconfidencial.com_.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "FARC Mistakenly Kidnap Colombian Girl, Rescued by Indigenous Guards"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-15T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "FARC Mistakenly Kidnap Colombian Girl, Rescued by Indigenous Guards"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/15/farc-mistakenly-kidnap-colombian-girl-rescued-indigenous-guards-155292", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "FARC, Indigenous Guards, Alejandra Cantoni, Afro-Colombians, Colombia, Kidnapped, Indigenous Councils Association of Northern Cauca, Sgt.
