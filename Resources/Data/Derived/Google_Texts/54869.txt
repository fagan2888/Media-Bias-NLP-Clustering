GloStream merger forms Triarq Health; HQ remains in Troy

A group of investors who jointly own Troy-based gloStream and New York City-based Triarq Network LLC have decided to merge their organizations into Triarq Health to take advantage of Medicare and private payers moving away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement and into quality-based pay-for-performance.



Investors purchased Triarq, which will be based in Troy, in December for an undisclosed amount.



The investors include Mike Sappington, Triarq Health chairman and managing member and founding CEO of gloStream; Ann Arbor entrepreneur David Fry; several other company executives; and private investors.



Since the Affordable Care Act was approved in 2010, dozens of hospitals and physician organizations have formed accountable care organizations to manage the care of Medicare patients, saving the federal government more than $400 million so far by paying for improved performance and lower costs.



The Obama administration announced last month it will ramp up its new performance-based reimbursement system -- moving away from fee-for-service payments -- to base 30 percent of payments on quality and effectiveness by 2018.



Sappington said Triarq has been formed to supply services to help ACOs, physician organizations, health insurers and other groups manage care for new payment systems from Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and other pay-for-performance models.



Trending to episodes of care



Over the next few years, physician practices will continue to face revenue challenges by many payers who have not increased fees in five years, Sappington said.
