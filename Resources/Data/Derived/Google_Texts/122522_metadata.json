He called the carnival a symbol for Obamacare. But the carnival isn\u2019t advocating any specific policy or change to the law. It\u2019s just an elaborate, anti-Obamacare roadshow. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to educate and mobilize young Americans to kick the Obamacare disaster out of their towns,\u201d he said, adding that the campaign will build on Gen Opp\u2019s Opt Out campaign, in which the group tried to convince young people not to sign up for Obamacare.\n\nYou can follow the \u201cCreepy Care-nival\u201d site here, and check out the full video here:\n\nGenOpp debuted Creepy Uncle Sam last September in two separate videos geared toward young women and young men. The videos, which were used to encourage young people to \u201cOpt Out\u201d of Obamacare, generated considerable media coverage.\n\nCreepy Uncle Sam launched a SnapChat campaign late last year, as well, utilizing the new social media app to share weird images with countless recipients. During the same period, GenOpp took its creepy figurehead to college campuses, tailgating with young people and raising awareness for Obamacare\u2019s negative effects.\n\nAfter the Care-nival on the National Mall, GenOpp will take Creepy Uncle Sam to \u201c10 or 12 states,\u201d so be on the lookout for a raggedy ambulance in your neighborhood in the coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Creepy Uncle Sam,Generation Opportunity,ObamaCare,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Creepy Uncle Sam II Creepy Uncle Sam is back.
