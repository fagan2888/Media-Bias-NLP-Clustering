His 16 RBIs lead the majors.\n\nHis first home run Sunday came off Cubs lefty Jon Lester. Arenado drove Lester\u2019s first-pitch 89 mph fastball into left field. With the wind blowing in at Wrigley Field, Arenado\u2019s homer barely got out, but there was enough power to lift it into the basket above the dormant ivy.\n\n\u201cWhen I first hit it, I thought it was gone,\u201d said Arenado, who now has six homers. \u201cBut then the wind got it, and I saw that (left fielder Jorge Soler) was camped, so I was like, \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 But thank God it went into the basket.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cThe next one (off reliever Justin Grimm), I thought I hit pretty good. I felt like I\u2019ve been jumping at the ball a little bit too much. Today I was really focused on staying back and staying on my back leg, and it really worked out.\u201d\n\nStory\u2019s story. Rookie shortstop Trevor Story continues to strike out a lot. He whiffed twice Sunday, bringing his season total to 22, most in the National League. But he also also hit seven homers and has a .294 average, and he ripped a first-inning single to left field off Lester.\n\nManager Walt Weiss said he\u2019s not worried about Story\u2019s mounting strikeout totals. And while Weiss might give the rookie a day off soon, he doesn\u2019t think Story has hit the wall.\n\n\u201cTypically with young players, I\u2019m going to look for spots to protect them, and I will do that with Trevor,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI still think Trevor is competing really well, and he\u2019s still a dangerous bat at the top of our lineup. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve continued to run him out there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been pitched tough by a couple of guys here lately, but I still think he\u2019s competing well in the (batter\u2019s) box.\u201d\n\nWeiss said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to make too much\u201d of the strikeouts.\n\n\u201cI think he still has a plan and he\u2019s still sticking to it,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI think that showed up in his last at-bat (a double Saturday).\u201d\n\nGray watch. Weiss said the team has not decided when right-hander Jon Gray will rejoin the rotation. After pitching two rehab games for high Single-A Modesto, Gray is expected to rejoin the team in Cincinnati on Monday, but he\u2019s not yet on the Rockies\u2019 pitching schedule.\n\n\u201cWe need to get him here in front of us, and then we will make a decision in the next couple of days,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nFootnotes. The Cubs lost their first series of the 2016 season. \u2026 Tyler Chatwood became just the second Rockies starter to pitch at least seven innings while allowing only two hits against the Cubs. The other was Pedro Astacio on Aug. 1, 2000.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nRockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 11.25 ERA) at Reds RHP Dan Straily (0-0, 3.24), 5:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nIt\u2019s up to Lyles to keep the momentum going. The Rockies took two of three over the weekend against the Cubs when Colorado\u2019s three starters combined for a 1.00 ERA. Lyles\u2019 fastball has been reaching 96 mph in the early going, but his inability to command it and his penchant for falling behind in counts have gotten him into trouble early. In two starts, he has yet to get through five innings before getting the hook. Straily, who has made three appearances out of the bullpen, will make his first start of the season. In 8 innings, he has given up three runs, struck out eight and walked four.\n\nTuesday: Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (1-1, 8.80 ERA) at Reds RHP Alfredo Simon (0-1, 12.15), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: RHP Chad Bettis (2-0, 2.95) at Reds RHP Raisel Iglesias (1-1, 3.24), 10:35 a.m., no TV; 850 AM\n\nThursday: Off", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nolan Arenado back in power zone for Rockies with two homers vs. Cubs", "title": "Nolan Arenado back in power zone for Rockies with two homers vs. Cubs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/17/nolan-arenado-back-in-power-zone-for-rockies-with-two-homers-vs-cubs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160417__Nolan-Arenadop1.jpg", "height": 492}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160417__Nolan-Arenadop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-17T18:24:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:40:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd277b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTypically with young players, I\u2019m going to look for spots to protect them, and I will do that with Trevor,\u201d Weiss said.\n\u201cI still think Trevor is competing really well, and he\u2019s still a dangerous bat at the top of our lineup.\nLooking AheadRockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 11.25 ERA) at Reds RHP Dan Straily (0-0, 3.24), 5:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AMIt\u2019s up to Lyles to keep the momentum going.\nTuesday: Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (1-1, 8.80 ERA) at Reds RHP Alfredo Simon (0-1, 12.15), 5:10 p.m., ROOTWednesday: RHP Chad Bettis (2-0, 2.95) at Reds RHP Raisel Iglesias (1-1, 3.24), 10:35 a.m., no TV; 850 AMThursday: Off\n\u201cWhen I first hit it, I thought it was gone,\u201d said Arenado, who now has six homers."}
