A bunch of new headlines this week are adding surprising new twists to the scandal that has plagued international private banking for about 10 years \u2014 and so far resulted in little more than fines and public posturing by banks and politicians.\n\nHere\u2019s a round-up of some major news as Swiss banking suddenly lives up to its cloak and dagger reputation:\n\nProsecutors Are Still Digging for Evidence\n\nSwiss prosecutors raided the Geneva headquarters of HSBC\u2019s private bank looking for proof that the Swiss private banking division of the world\u2019s second largest bank helped clients launder money and evade taxes.\n\nRelated: HSBC Admits It Helped Wealthy Clients Dodge Taxes\n\nThere is plenty of evidence already floating around. Stolen documents from 2008 were leaked first to regulators and then to a consortium of news organizations who reported on the contents 10 days ago. They show pretty clearly that HSBC marketed tax avoidance schemes, helped rich people hide assets and allowed customers to withdraw untraceable \u201cbricks\u201d of foreign currency to bring back home.\n\nWhy Wednesday\u2019s raids? Swiss law doesn\u2019t allow investigations to proceed based on stolen documents so prosecutors need to find their own evidence.\n\nHSBC Isn\u2019t the Only Bank in the Spotlight\n\nThe French government issued arrest warrants for three former UBS managers on charges that they illegally recruited French clients to open Swiss bank accounts in order to evade taxes. News of the warrants, issued in January, broke on Tuesday.\n\nNews You Can Lose?\n\nOn Tuesday, U.K. political journalist Peter Oborne went public with allegations that Britain\u2019s Telegraph had buried negative press about HSBC \u2014 including substantive coverage of the leaked documents \u2014 because the bank is a major advertiser in the paper. In his post, \u201cWhy I have resigned from the Telegraph,\u201d he calls the paper\u2019s \u201csoft coverage\u201d of HSBC \u201ca fraud on its readers\u201d that has profound consequences. While not exactly viral, the post was widely read and covered in both finance and media circles.\n\nRelated: How Drug Traffickers Used HSBC to Launder Money\n\nTougher Capital Requirements Are Coming\n\nThe Swiss government said Wednesday that it would raise capital requirements for its two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, by year-end. That effort to make sure the banks aren\u2019t \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d ostensibly has nothing to do with the tax evasion scandals. But it does indicate that Swiss authorities are toughening up on the country\u2019s native banks.\n\nThe Next Big Shoes to Drop\n\nFor HSBC, there\u2019s worry that Swiss prosecutors will find evidence of illegal activity that took place since 2012. If they do, the U.S. could reopen a 2012 agreement to settle accusations that HSBC laundered drug money in which the bank paid a $1.9 billion fine and promised not to break the law. Then HSBC could lose its license to bank in the U.S.\n\nThe scandal is also spilling over into politics in Britain, where HSBC\u2019s CEO and chairman have to testify on Feb. 25. The Labour Party is quick to point out that the bank\u2019s former chairman, Lord Stephen Green, became a trade minister in the Conservative Party even after the government knew about allegations against the bank.\n\nClearly, for bankers and their friends in high places, any connection to secret Swiss bank accounts has become a pretty dicey proposition.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This week alone has brought a bank raid, allegations of a newspaper cover-up and arrest warrants for private bankers.
