Originally, a mental health facility had been planned, but that was later scuttled.\n\nThe mental health court will identify Potter County jail inmates who could benefit from mental health care. Authorities would gradually pull patients from the jail and provide assistance to deal with their criminal charges while placing them on probation and providing medication or counseling services, Globe-News files show.\n\nThere will be two public hearings on the tax increases. The first one will be at 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 3 and the second is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Sept. 8.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News", "og": {"url": "http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2015-08-12/potter-budget-plans-include-425-percent-tax-hike", "site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "type": "article", "description": "A Potter County budget that has received preliminary approval includes a 4.25 percent property tax rate increase. \nThis would bring the total property tax rate from 0.634 of a percent to 0.", "title": "Potter budget plans include 4.25 percent tax hike"}, "description": "A Potter County budget that has received preliminary approval includes a 4.25 percent property tax rate increase.This would bring the total property tax rate from 0.634 of a percent to 0.66 of a percent, which would raise taxes from $634 to $660 for a $100,000 house and would generate an additional $2.6 million in tax revenue.\u201cWe\u2019ve been very conservative with our spending and inflating is getting to us now, so we have to increase our revenue a bit,\u201d said county auditor Kerry Hood."}, "article_summary": "A Potter County budget that has received preliminary approval includes a 4.25 percent property tax rate increase.\nThe mental health court will identify Potter County jail inmates who could benefit from mental health care.\nWhile Randall County had nearly $864,000 in costs associated with Affordable Care Act compliance, Potter County has kept those costs to about $118,000.\n\u201cThe fire station will be going to serve the people that voted down the tax increase for that,\u201d said Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner.\nOriginally, a mental health facility had been planned, but that was later scuttled."}
