When quantities are large, however, we do not use numbers in a precise way. We approximate using a \u2018round number\u2019 as a place mark. It is easier and more convenient. When I say, for example, that there were a hundred people at the market, I don\u2019t mean that there were exactly one hundred people there. And when I say that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, I don\u2019t mean exactly 13,700,000,000, I mean give or take a few hundred million years. Big numbers are understood approximately, small ones precisely, and these two systems interact uneasily. It is clearly nonsensical to say that next year the universe will be \u201813.7 billion and one\u2019 years old. It will remain 13.7 billion years old for the rest of our lives.\n\nRound numbers usually end in zero. The word round is used because a round number represents the completion of a full counting cycle, not because zero is a circle. There are ten digits in our number system, so any combination of cycles will always be divisible by ten. Because we are so used to using round numbers for big numbers, when we encounter a big number that is non-round \u2013 say, 754,156,293 \u2013 it feels discrepant. Manoj Thomas, a psychologist at Cornell University, argues that our sense of unease with large, non-round numbers causes us to see these numbers as smaller than they are: \u2018We tend to think that small numbers are more precise, so when we see a big number that is precise we instinctively assume it is less than it is.\u2019 The result, he claims, is that we will pay more for an expensive object if the price is non-round. In one of Thomas\u2019s experiments, respondents viewed pictures of several houses together with their sale prices, which were randomly assigned either a round number, such as $390,000, or a slightly larger, precise one, such as $391,534. Asked whether they considered each price high or low, on average the respondents judged the precise prices to be lower than the round ones, even though the precise numbers were actually higher. Thomas and his collaborators argued that whatever other inferences the respondents were making about why the price was precise \u2013 such as that the seller had thought more carefully about it, and so the price was fairer \u2013 they still made the subconscious judgment that non-round numbers are smaller than round ones. A tip to readers selling their homes: if you want to make money, don\u2019t end the price with a zero.\n\nThe practice of subtracting 1 from a round number conveys a potent message. When we read a number, we are more influenced by the leftmost digit than we are by the rightmost, since that is the order we read, and process, them. The number 799 feels significantly less than 800 because we see the former as 7-something and the latter as 8-something, whereas 798 feels pretty much like 799. Since the nineteenth century, shopkeepers have taken advantage of this trick by choosing prices ending in a 9, to give the impression that a product is cheaper than it is. Surveys show that anything between a third and two-thirds of all retail prices now end in a 9.Though we are all seasoned shoppers, we are still fooled. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern Brittany monitored a local pizza restaurant that was serving five types of pizza at \u20ac8 each. When one of the pizzas was reduced in price to \u20ac7.99, its share of sales rose from a third of the total to a half. Dropping the price by one cent, an insignificant amount in monetary terms, was enough to influence customers\u2019 decisions dramatically.\n\nOur response to prices ending in 9, however, is subject to more complex influences than a bias towards the leftmost digit. A price ending in 9 feels like a bargain, even when it isn\u2019t. Eric Anderson of the University of Chicago and Duncan Simester of MIT arranged for the same dress to be priced at $34, $39 and $44 in three otherwise identical mail order catalogues. The dress sold best at $39, rather than the cheaper price of $34. Similar results have been found in other studies: the 9-ending is a cue that the item has been discounted and is therefore a good deal. But the association of 9 with bargains can also mean that a 9-priced product looks cheap, or can give the impression that the seller is somehow manipulating you. An upmarket restaurant, for example, would never dream of pricing a main course at, say, $32.99. Nor would you trust a therapist who charged $99.99 a session. The prices would be $33 and $100, which feel both classier and more honest. Our response to the number 9 is conditioned by a mixture of cultural and psychological factors. Numbers are not impartial and straightforward; they have baggage.\n\nShopkeepers have other reasons for using prices that end in a 9, or, for that matter, an 8. Tests show that prices ending in 8 and 9 are much harder to recall than prices ending in 0 and 5, since the brain takes longer to store and process them. If you don\u2019t want your customers to remember a price, to prevent them comparing prices, then use an 8- or 9-ending. Conversely, if you do want a customer to remember a price, perhaps to reinforce that it is cheaper than rival products, label it $5 and not $4.98. Traders, in fact, use an array of psychological number tricks to reduce price awareness. For example, a Cornell University study showed that by leaving the currency sign off a menu \u2013 so that the price of a dish was listed as 20 rather than $20 \u2013 a New York restaurant increased average spend per customer by eight per cent. The \u2018$\u2019 reminds us of the pain of paying. Another clever menu strategy is to show the prices immediately after the description of each dish, rather than listing them in a column, since listing prices facilitates price comparison. You want to encourage diners to order what they want, whatever the price, rather than reminding them which dish is most expensive.\n\nPerhaps the most blatant use of number psychology in retail, however, is the display of absurdly expensive items to create an artificial benchmark. The $100,000 car in the showroom and the $10,000 pair of shoes in the shop window are there not because the manager thinks they will sell, but as decoys to make the also expensive $50,000 car and $5,000 shoes look cheap. Supermarkets use similar strategies. We are surprisingly susceptible to number cues when it comes to making decisions, and not just when shopping. In one study, 52 German judges read a description of a woman caught shoplifting, and then rolled a pair of dice, loaded to land either on 1 and 2, or on 3 and 6. Once the dice were rolled, the judges were asked to state whether they would sentence the girl to more or fewer months in prison than the sum of the numbers on the dice, and then to specify the exact sentence. The judges who rolled 3 gave her five months on average, while the judges who rolled 9 gave her eight. The judges were experienced professionals, yet the mere suggestion of a number with no connection to the case determined the length of sentence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The relationship between people and numbers is so much more fascinating than simple dollars and cents", "author": "Alex Bellos", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The relationship between people and numbers is so much more fascinating than simple dollars and cents", "title": "The secret history of numbers: How math shapes our lives in amazing, unpredictable ways", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/21/the_secret_history_of_numbers_how_math_shapes_our_lives_in_amazing_unpredictable_ways/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/magnet_numbers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The relationship between people and numbers is so much more fascinating than simple dollars and cents", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/magnet_numbers.jpg", "title": "The secret history of numbers: How math shapes our lives in amazing, unpredictable ways", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The secret history of numbers: How math shapes our lives in amazing, unpredictable ways", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, History, math, Psychology, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb78d\"", "article_summary": "Tests show that prices ending in 8 and 9 are much harder to recall than prices ending in 0 and 5, since the brain takes longer to store and process them.\nThe word round is used because a round number represents the completion of a full counting cycle, not because zero is a circle.\nOur response to prices ending in 9, however, is subject to more complex influences than a bias towards the leftmost digit.\nRound numbers usually end in zero.\nBecause we are so used to using round numbers for big numbers, when we encounter a big number that is non-round \u2013 say, 754,156,293 \u2013 it feels discrepant."}
