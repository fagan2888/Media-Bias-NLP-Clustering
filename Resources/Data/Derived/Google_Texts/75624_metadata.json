According to the Baltimore Business Journal, the new initiative will use emocha\u2019s medication adherence application in a trial of tuberculosis patients.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control notes approximately one-third of the world\u2019s population is infected with TB. In 2013, that meant nine million people contracted the disease, with an estimated 1.5 million TB-related deaths worldwide. TB is also a leading cause of death among HIV-patients.\n\nIn 2013, Maryland reported 176 cases of tuberculosis or 3 per 100,000 people, according to Centers for Disease Control statistics, a rate that was 13th in the country. Alaska led the nation with 9.7 cases per 100,000 people, though only 71 cases were reported in 2013. Among the 50 states and District of Columbia, Wyoming was the only jurisdiction without a tuberculosis diagnosis last year, according to the CDC report.\n\nemocha lays out a scenario in which a child contracted TB, a highly contagious bacterial infection for which the typical U.S. standard requires Direct Observed Therapy (DOT). This means every time a patient must take his medication, it must be directly observed by a clinician. This practice is designed to ensure proper dosage and to reduce change of transmission of the disease to new patients. In this particular case, DOT was not possible, since the child\u2019s mother could not leave work to take her child to the clinic every day.\n\nIn stepped emocha, with their patient adherence application to provide a viable solution. Using the app, the patient is able to satisfy the Maryland DOT standard using an easy-to-use self-video application on her smartphone, while also capturing daily clinical assessments. The app replaces the need for DOT with a new procedure, called miDOT, or mobile indirect observational therapy.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe patient\u2019s mother downloaded the emocha miDOT application onto her smartphone and began to video her child taking medication while entering any symptoms which may be present. Via secure upload, video is then transmitted to the emocha Health Information System, where the clinician accesses for data for review. miDOT effectively improves medication adherence and efficiently links patients to care.\n\nEmocha officials said the app makes it easier for patients to comply with their medication regimen and the DOT regulations, while also reducing the financial burden on health departments of making clinicians available for the in-person verifications.\n\nEmocha\u2019s mobile health management platform can be used for a variety of \u201cremote patient management\u201d applications, company officials said. The platform has been implemented in nearly a dozen countries, according to the company.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the miDOT app will increase the health department\u2019s capacity to provide quality care for TB patients while freeing up clinician time for other critical TB control activities,\u201d said Dr. Patrick Chaulk, the department\u2019s acting deputy commissioner for communicable disease, according to BioHealth Innovation. \u201cemocha\u2019s miDOT has gained traction nationally and internationally for a simple reason,\u201d emocha CEO Sebastian Seiguer said. \u201cIt solves a major problem for patients and clinicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Baltimore health department begins new TB trial using emocha app to manage spread of infection. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Health App Leveraged To Tackle TB", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/6518b9da/6518b9da-5da9-4ac2-a6f2-4f14e43af28c/iphone_mhealth_apps.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Baltimore health department begins new TB trial using emocha app to manage spread of infection.
