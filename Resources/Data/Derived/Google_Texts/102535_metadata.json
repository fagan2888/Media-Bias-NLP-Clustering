Saxby Chambliss, but his name has resurfaced in political news in recent days, and he\u2019s not ruling out another run at public office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going away,\u201d Broun said in a Thursday interview on his leading role in working against the possible election of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, as speaker of the House of Representatives when that body\u2019s GOP leadership elections are held next week. Broun is among the sponsors of FireMcCarthy.com, an effort which also includes a number of political\n\naction committees including the Constitutional Rights PAC, with which Broun says he\u2019s been working recently.\n\nMcCarthy, seen as a leading contender to replace Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who recently resigned from the speaker\u2019s post, has raised the ire of many congressional Republicans and conservatives across the country in recent days. In comments to Fox News, McCarthy suggested the investigation by the GOP-dominated House into a 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead was politically motivated. Hillary Clinton, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the Benghazi attacks.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\u201d McCarthy told Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. \u201cBut we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she\u2019s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\u201d\n\nBroun\u2019s concerns about House leadership \u2014 and Senate leadership, for that matter \u2014 are broader than the immediate concern about McCarthy suggesting the House was pursuing the Benghazi probe simply to hurt Clinton\u2019s chances of winning her party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\n\u201c\n\nWe need to have substantial legislation,\u201d Broun said, \u201cto repeal Obamacare, to get rid of the Obama amnesty [for undocumented immigrants], and we\u2019ve got to stop the Iran treaty,\u201d an agreement that conservatives say will not keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cI believe we need a clean sweep of leadership in the House and the Senate.\u201d\n\nSounding a broader theme Thursday, Broun returned to what had been a cornerstone of his political campaigns, a belief in a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201c\n\nBoth political parties are responsible\u201d for the country\u2019s drift away from constitutional governance, Broun said, adding that America has \u201cgot to return to a policy of individual responsibility and accountability.\u201d\n\nBroun, whose bedrock conservative Christian faith has figured prominently in his public life, said Thursday his continuing interest in the political scene is now informed by a biblical verse, as he recited the third verse of Psalm 11, which reads, \u201cIf the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\u201d\n\nBroun added he believes he has \u201ca calling to restore the foundational principles of this country.\u201d Asked if that meant he might consider another run at public office, Broun said he would \u201cprayerfully consider\u201d any opportunities the might come his way to again run for office.\n\nBroun was elected to Congress in a special 2007 election necessitated by the death of incumbent Republican Charlie Norwood. He subsequently won three terms in the House, but left the political scene after his effort to win one of Georgia\u2019s U.S. Senate seats came up short last year amid a crowded GOP field.\n\nAlso in Thursday\u2019s interview, Broun commented briefly on the recent decision by a consultant who worked in two of his re-election campaigns to plead guilty in federal court to making false statements in connection with an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation into Broun\u2019s use of taxpayer funds for his congressional office.\n\nBrett O\u2019Donnell, a well-known debate coach with Alexandria, Va.-based O\u2019Donnell & Associates Strategic Communications, initially told the OCE he didn\u2019t do campaign work for Broun, but a plea agreement filed in federal court notes that O\u2019Donnell \u201cfalsely told OCE that he hid not believe he had to perform work for [Broun\u2019s} campaigns\u201d in order to ensure the continuation of his other work with Broun\u2019s office.\n\nAn OCE report concluded Broun \u201cmay have violated House rules and federal law\u201d in using his office allowance to pay a campaign consultant, but the House Ethics Committee took no action on the report, and when Broun left Congress, he moved beyond the reach of any of that body\u2019s ethics sanctions.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why O\u2019Donnell became the subject of a U.S. Justice Department investigation, marking the first time an OCE probe moved into the federal court system.\n\n\u201cMr. O\u2019Donnell is a friend,\u201d Broun said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he made the plea\n\n.\u201d\n\nBroun went on to say that if he should become the subject of any federal probe regarding use of his congressional office funds, he is confident he would be exonerated of any wrongdoing.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Jim Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "Dr. Paul Broun, the Watkinsville physician and former three-term Georgia Republican congressman, went back to his medical practice in the wake of his GOP primary defeat in last year's race for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Georgia senior Sen.", "title": "Broun back in political arena, not ruling out another run for office", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/breaking-news/2015-10-04/broun-back-political-arena-not-ruling-out-another-run-office", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/Broun.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b33\"", "article_summary": "Broun is among the sponsors of FireMcCarthy.com, an effort which also includes a number of politicalaction committees including the Constitutional Rights PAC, with which Broun says he\u2019s been working recently.\nBroun was elected to Congress in a special 2007 election necessitated by the death of incumbent Republican Charlie Norwood.\nHillary Clinton, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the Benghazi attacks.\nIt\u2019s not clear why O\u2019Donnell became the subject of a U.S. Justice Department investigation, marking the first time an OCE probe moved into the federal court system.\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\u201d McCarthy told Fox News commentator Sean Hannity."}
