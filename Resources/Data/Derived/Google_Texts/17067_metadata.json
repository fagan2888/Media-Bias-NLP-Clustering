But Priests for Life explained that by informing the government of the opt-out, the coverage is then provided by other groups, and the priests object to triggering contraceptive services.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled last November that the HHS mandate does not violate the religious freedoms of Priests for Life or any of the 11 other groups that challenged the mandate. The court declared that the burden on religious organizations to submit a form to declare their objection to providing such coverage does not serve as a substantial one, rejecting the notion that the process forces the plaintiffs to remain involved in the act of making contraceptives available to their employees.\n\nBut the nonprofit groups take issue with the accommodation, stating that the act of completing the forms helps to facilitate employee access to contraception coverage, thereby violating the groups\u2019 convictions.\n\nFollowing the Court of Appeals' November ruling, Father Frank Pavone, director of Priests for Life, announced the pro-life group\u2019s intent to appeal, and released the following statement:\n\nThere are such things as \u201cinsubstantial\u201d burdens on the practice of the faith. For instance, we wouldn\u2019t object if fire codes or zoning ordinances might make a church temporarily unavailable for worship. It may cause us an inconvenience, but it is not worship as such that is being outlawed in that case.\n\nAt issue in our lawsuit is an objective criterion: our inability to cooperate in evil is based on a verifiable, publicly stated belief of the entire Catholic Church, and that belief is not optional for one who wants to be a Catholic. When, therefore, the only options the government leaves a citizen are to violate his/her religion or violate the law, that is the same thing as making the practice of Catholicism illegal.\n\nPriests for Life has asked the court to reconsider its ruling on the grounds that it violated the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby ruling. The group is asking the D.C. Circuit to hear their case en banc.\n\nFox News explains, \u201cThe group says the court\u2019s decision contradicted the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which stated closely held corporations did not have to insure contraceptives that conflicted with their owners\u2019 beliefs, particularly morning-after pills that some equate with abortion.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the Obama administration contend that the Hobby Lobby ruling does not apply to nonprofits, however. \u201cUnlike plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were closely held for-profit companies that were not eligible for the accommodations,\u201d the government\u2019s attorneys said. \u201cThe linchpin of the court\u2019s \u2018very specific\u2019 holding in Hobby Lobby was the existence of the opt-out alternative afforded to organizations such as the plaintiffs in this case.\u201d\n\nPriests for Life rejects the notion that the existence of a religious exemption is sufficient to ensure the protection of religious liberties. \u201cThe government is using the same kind of arguments it has used in other lawsuits against the mandate brought by religious groups, namely, that because they have a religious exemption and in the light of promised changes in the mandate, these groups really aren\u2019t being harmed, have nothing to worry about, and therefore no basis to sue the government,\u201d Pavone stated.\n\nBut the administration argues that the nonprofits are asking for too much. \u201cOn plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning, a conscientious objector to the draft not only can refrain from serving himself, but can also allege that his religion is substantially burdened if the government drafts a replacement to serve instead,\u201d the government wrote.\n\nWhile the Priests for Life appeal is pending, the group does not have to comply with the prior ruling, though they have already stated that they did not intend to comply. \u201cIt makes no difference whether plaintiffs must pay for the contraceptive coverage,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s attorneys. \u201cWhat matters is that, in their religious judgment, it would be immoral for them to contract with a vendor that will provide the offending coverage to their plan beneficiaries.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obama, lawyers, Supreme Court, ruling, Hobby Lobby, contraception mandate, religious non-profits, HHS, ObamaCare, Priests for Life", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/19928-obama-lawyers-hobby-lobby-ruling-not-for-religious-nonprofits", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/67818a5ede266d718808e9782b31023e_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Administration lawyers said the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling doesn't apply to religious non-profits; they must comply with ObamaCare's birth control mandate. by Raven Clabough", "title": "Obama Lawyers: Hobby Lobby Ruling Not for Religious Nonprofits"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/67818a5ede266d718808e9782b31023e_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca451\"", "article_summary": "Priests for Life has asked the court to reconsider its ruling on the grounds that it violated the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby ruling.\nFox News explains, \u201cThe group says the court\u2019s decision contradicted the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which stated closely held corporations did not have to insure contraceptives that conflicted with their owners\u2019 beliefs, particularly morning-after pills that some equate with abortion.\u201dAttorneys for the Obama administration contend that the Hobby Lobby ruling does not apply to nonprofits, however.\nLawyers for the Obama administration said on Thursday that faith-based nonprofits should continue to comply with a segment ObamaCare\u2019s birth control mandate, as the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling does not apply to those groups.\n\u201cUnlike plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were closely held for-profit companies that were not eligible for the accommodations,\u201d the government\u2019s attorneys said.\nIn the Hobby Lobby ruling, the Supreme Court justices determined that the federal government acted in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which requires the government to accomplish its agenda in the most minimally restrictive way."}
