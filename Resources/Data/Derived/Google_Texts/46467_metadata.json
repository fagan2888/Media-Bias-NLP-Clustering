The suit targeted the law's \"individual mandate\" that Americans obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\n\nFDA Mulls Parameters for Allergy Therapies\n\nFaced with rising rates of allergic conditions in children and a dearth of interventions available to stop them early in life, the FDA brought in a group of independent advisors Thursday to help it decide how to move forward in developing and approving immunotherapies for curing, not just managing these conditions.\n\nWith no specific products to review and no up-or-down voting questions, the agency's Allergenic Products Advisory Committee heard from FDA officials and academic experts, who discussed a range of issues, including clinical trial design, appropriate end points, age-unique testing issues, and safety and efficacy for novel products aimed at asthma prevention and treatment and food allergies.\n\nThe panel spent a lot of time discussing the unique and challenging safety issues involved with testing and treatment of young children and infants.\n\n\"I can't help worrying about traumatizing infants with immunotherapy,\" one of the panelists said.\n\nPanel members worried that young children -- an important population to try to treat -- would be unable to articulate when they are experiencing symptoms such as pruritus, mouth edema, and throat irritation before anaphylaxis becomes life-threatening. And that a lack of reliable data on trials involving infants and children under 5 would make it difficult to know where to set parameters.\n\nNIMH Should Change Research Direction, Senators Told\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is going in the wrong direction on mental health research, an expert told a Senate committee Wednesday.\n\n\"In building programs related to brain research, the National Institute of Mental Health has lost its focus on public mental health, and it has abandoned what should be its natural interest in diagnostic categories,\" said William Eaton, PhD, a professor of mental health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"These new programs at NIMH have confused a huge range of researchers and puzzled the international community.\"\n\nThis new focus \"also has [eviscerated] the probability of developing research-based prevention programs for mental health and substance use disorders,\" Eaton told members of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions Committee at a hearing on how to improve the federal government's response to mental healthcare challenges.\n\nTax Dollars Pick Up Two-Thirds of Healthcare Tab\n\nTaxpayers funded nearly two-thirds of all U.S. health expenditures in 2013, and that figure is expected to rise even higher by 2024, a study has found.\n\nThe percentage of federal, state, and local taxpayer funding of healthcare expenditures rose from 59.8% in 1999 to 64.3% in 2013, and is projected to increase to 67.1% by 2024, according to David Himmelstein, MD, and Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, both of City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College in New York City. The study appeared online Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\"The big thing that went up was Medicare [spending], and that went up about 2.5 [percentage] points,\" Woolhandler told MedPage Today in a phone interview. \"The rest pretty much stayed the same. We expected over the next decade that Medicaid was going to be the piece that goes up, but in fact the thing going up was the Medicare program.\"\n\nNext Week\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that it has canceled all activities for next week due to the snowstorm in the Washington area. But some other activities are continuing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing on developments in the prescription drug market.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on mental health and the criminal justice system. On Wednesday, the same committee will hold a hearing on the epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions Committee will hold a hearing on the generic drug user fee amendments.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce  Frieden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/55811", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/55xxx/55811.jpg", "description": "Supreme Court turned away a challenge to the Affordable Care Act", "card": "Summary", "title": "D.C.
