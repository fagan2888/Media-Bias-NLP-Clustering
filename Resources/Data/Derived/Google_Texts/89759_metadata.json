By having consumers answer a simple set of questions, a health care organization can tailor its patient interaction, education and advertising to a consumer\u2019s preferences, increasing the likelihood of success.\n\n\u201cThis level of consumer understanding is especially important in today\u2019s changing health care environment, which is undergoing a dramatic shift in the way companies market their products and services,\u201d said c2b solutions Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Brent Walker.\n\n\u201cIn an environment under the Affordable Care Act where millions of consumers shop for their own coverage, and reimbursement is tied to patient outcomes, healthcare providers need to make sure they understand consumer motivations and how to influence their behavior,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFor example, the compensation of many hospitals, Accountable Care Organizations, and health insurance companies is linked to meeting performance requirements against patient satisfaction and quality of care.\u201d\n\nA former marketing executive at Procter & Gamble, Walker said c2b solutions\u2019 insights and services translate across the health care industry, including health insurance companies, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter medicine manufacturers, retail pharmacy and employers. c2b solutions provides the health care industry access to:\n\nIts psychographic segmentation model for highly targeted and effective consumer engagement\n\nA robust research database with more than 15 million data points on health care consumer attitudes, motivations and behaviors\n\nPublications and presentations of its market research on health care consumers, including patients with specific health conditions. The c2b Consumer Diagnostic is a comprehensive, 625-page reference manual on the U.S. health care consumer based on c2b solutions\u2019 market research.\n\nFormer U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson believes that c2b solutions can help link the best of both worlds \u2013 consumer desires and healthcare resources. From his foreword to the c2b Consumer Diagnostic, \u201cHealth care organizations must evolve in this new era by deeply understanding consumer attitudes and behaviors to anticipate what excellence in health care means to them,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cPatient care supported by consumer insights will help deliver the standards we expect from the American health care system of tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot only does c2b solutions\u2019 proprietary research help companies better understand consumer behavior, it ultimately saves them money and time, Walker said. \u201cWe are seeing insurance plans scrambling to attract members on the health insurance exchanges with standardized offerings. We understand how to help them rise above the clutter and help the industry remain nimble and responsive to these changes.\u201d\n\nBased in Cincinnati, c2b solutions was founded by former P&G executives to help organizations enhance their health care strategies and initiatives through proprietary consumer insights and proven marketing methods.
