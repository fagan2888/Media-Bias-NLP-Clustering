In numerous reports, Fox News called the game \"horrifying,\" \"deadly,\" \"sick\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\nAmong the Fox News anchors Hayes said were guilty of \"over-coverage\" were Bill O'Reilly, Gretchen Carlson, Greta Van Susteren and Sean Hannity.\n\nHayes's top under-covered story of 2013 was climate change; he called particular attention to the frightening fact that carbon parts per million in the atmosphere reached a new high this year.\n\n\"That got zero, zero coverage,\" he said.\n\nHayes's claim falls right in line with a new FAIR survey released Wednesday that found only 4 percent of news networks' weather reports this year mentioned the words \"climate change\" or made reference to humans' impact on extreme weather.\n\nStories about black Santa, the \"Duck Dynasty\" scandal, problems with the Obamacare website and Pope Francis were also deemed over-covered, while Hayes and his guests said issues like Medicaid, immigration and unemployment were largely under-covered this year.\n\nWatch the video above for the full awards ceremony.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Media Lawsuits Media Lawsuits\n\n1 of 11 Charlie Rose An intern sued Charlie Ros e and his show over fair wage allegations.
