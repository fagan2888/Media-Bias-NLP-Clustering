Its people are about to elect a new leader as the country struggles to maintain stability while facing a large-scale drawdown of NATO forces.\n\nEleven contenders are vying for president, and their vast differences showcase the complexities of Afghan politics. Doctors and scholars are running alongside notorious former jihadist warlords, some of whom stand a real chance of ruling the nation.\n\n#Afghanistan's fragile democracy in action: millions watch 1st Presidential debate on TV's once banned by Taliban pic.twitter.com/D5iFAIPzyY \u2014 Jamieson Lesko (@jamiesonNBC) February 4, 2014\n\nReminiscent of a traditional American presidential debate, the five candidates participating in the debate Tuesday stood side by side at podiums for two hours, racing a timer to make their points.\n\nA big issue of discussion among the candidates was the bilateral security agreement, a long-term pact between the U.S. and Afghanistan, which President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to sign.
