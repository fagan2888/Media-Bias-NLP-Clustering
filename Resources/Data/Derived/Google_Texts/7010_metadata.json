I feel sorry for this person.\u201d\n\nDenver police were called five minutes before the zoo\u2019s closing time at 9 p.m., Barnhart said. Flynn was taken to a Denver hospital following the mishap. Police and fire officials said she was intoxicated.\n\nBarnhart said alcoholic drinks are served during zoo lights, including beer and a hot peppermint cocoa and spiced apple cider drinks with alcohol.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be working pretty hard at it to get drunk at the zoo,\u201d Barnhart said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that she was drinking before she entered the zoo, she said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Intoxicated woman arrested in Denver zoo romp charged with trespassing", "title": "Intoxicated woman arrested in Denver zoo romp charged with trespassing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/24/intoxicated-woman-arrested-in-denver-zoo-romp-charged-with-trespassing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224__Denver_zoo_lightsp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224__Denver_zoo_lightsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-24T12:08:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:58:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8ed\"", "article_summary": "An intoxicated woman who may have shocked herself on an electric fence designed to keep elephants away from humans at the Denver Zoo has been charged with trespassing.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be working pretty hard at it to get drunk at the zoo,\u201d Barnhart said.\nIn order to get to the electric fence, zoo visitors would have to first climb a fence built to keep people out of the sprawling elephant enclosure, said Tiffany Barnhart, Denver Zoo spokeswoman.\nKelly Flynn, 21, was arrested Monday night after she apparently touched the electric fence after climbing a fence designed to keep people out of the newly constructed Elephant Passage.\nBarnhart said alcoholic drinks are served during zoo lights, including beer and a hot peppermint cocoa and spiced apple cider drinks with alcohol."}
