Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to win the GOP\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn June\u2019s inaugural Breitbart Primary poll, Cruz finished first nationally (33%)\u2013and in each of the first three nominating states\u2013with Walker (23%), who has yet to declare his candidacy, right on his heels. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) finished in third with 10%, followed by Dr. Ben Carson (7%), former Texas Governor Rick Perry (5%), businessman Donald Trump (4%), former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (4%), and Sen. Marco Rubio (4%).\n\nVoting in the Breitbart Primary will be reset every month, and Breitbart News readers are encouraged to cast their ballots in July\u2019s Breitbart Primary here.\n\nThe complete national results for June\u2019s Breitbart Primary are below, and results from Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina follow.\n\nSince upsetting establishment Republican David Dewhurst in Texas\u2019s Senate primary in 2014, Cruz has aggressively taken on the GOP establishment along with the D.C.\u2019s bipartisan political class. Emphasizing his \u201cbold\u201d brand of conservatism against the \u201cpale pastels\u201d approach favored by establishment Republicans, Cruz has been a thorn in the side of the permanent political class by trying to defund Obamacare and President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nWalker, by taking on Wisconsin\u2019s government unions and prevailing in a recall election, showed that conservative policy solutions can translate to electoral success. Though he is expected to announce his candidacy in July, Walker has already shaped the debate when he said that the next president must make \u201cdecisions about a legal immigration system that\u2019s based on, first and foremost, on protecting American workers and American wages.\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) has praised Walker for his comments and said that his pro-American worker stance on immigration would be \u201chelpful for the republic.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin governor, though his political organization has been criticized for hiring operatives who have tried to undermine conservatives in the past, has been touted as a candidate who can unite the grassroots and the establishment wings of the party to successfully take on Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nIowa:\n\nAmong Breitbart Primary voters in Iowa, Cruz leads with 36% to Walker\u2019s 20%, but Walker actually received more votes when second- and third-choice votes were considered. Paul came in fourth with 10% while Fiorina was fourth with 8%. Though Perry was the first choice of 6% of Iowans who voted in the Breitbart Primary, he received more total votes (10%) than Paul or Carson.\n\nThe last two winners of the Iowa caucus\u2013former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum\u2013 barely registered, receiving 1% each.\n\nIowa\u2019s results for June\u2019s Breitbart Primary are below:\n\nTed Cruz \u2014 36%\n\nScott Walker \u2014 20%\n\nRand Paul \u2014 10%\n\nCarly Fiorina 8%\n\nRick Perry \u2014 6%\n\nBen Carson \u2014 5%\n\nMarco Rubio \u2014 3%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 3%\n\nMike Huckabee \u2014 2%\n\nJohn Kasich \u2014 2%\n\nJeb Bush \u2014 1%\n\nBobby Jindal \u2014 1%\n\nRick Santorum \u2014 1%\n\nMitt Romney \u2014 1%\n\nChris Christie \u2014 0%\n\nLindsey Graham \u2014 0%\n\nGeorge Pataki \u2014 0%\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nIn New Hampshire, Cruz edges Walker by three points (32%-29%) while Paul is a distant third at 15%. Though Donald Trump placed second, three points behind Jeb Bush, in a recent CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll, Trump finished with 4% support in the Breitbart Primary, tied with Carson and behind Fiorina (6%). Though New Hampshire may be a \u201cmust-win\u201d state for Bush and Christie, both candidates received 0% total support in the state.\n\nBut Bush and Christie, along with former New York Governor George Pataki, still received more votes cast than Huckabee and Santorum, showing the uphill battle that social conservatives often face in the Granite State.\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s results are below:\n\nTed Cruz \u2014 32%\n\nScott Walker \u2014 29%\n\nRand Paul \u2014 15%\n\nCarly Fiorina \u2014 6%\n\nDr. Ben Carson \u2014 4%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 4%\n\nRick Perry \u2014 3%\n\nBobby Jindal \u2014 1%\n\nMarco Rubio \u2014 1%\n\nMitt Romney \u2014 1%\n\nJeb Bush\u2013 0%\n\nChris Christie \u2014 0%\n\nMike Huckabee \u2014 0%\n\nRick Santorum \u2014 0%\n\nLindsey Graham \u2014 0%\n\nGeorge Pataki \u2014 0%\n\nJohn Kasich \u2014 0%\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nIn the crucial first-in-the-South primary state of South Carolina, Cruz again edged Walker by four points (29%-25) while Carson finished in third with 10%. Fiorina was third in total votes. Five candidates\u2013Carson, Fiorina, Walker, Rubio, Cruz\u2013received double-digit percentages in third place votes.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s results are below:\n\nTed Cruz \u2014 29%\n\nScott Walker \u2014 25%\n\nBen Carson \u2014 10%\n\nRand Paul \u2014 8%\n\nRick Perry \u2014 8%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 4%\n\nCarly Fiorina \u2014 4%\n\nMarco Rubio \u2014 4%\n\nMitt Romney \u2014 2%\n\nJohn Kasich \u2014 2%\n\nBobby Jindal \u2014 1%\n\nRick Santorum \u2014 1%\n\nJeb Bush \u20131%\n\nMike Huckabee \u2014 1%\n\nLindsey Graham \u2014 0%\n\nJohn Kasich \u2014 0%\n\nGeorge Pataki \u2014 0%\n\nBecause the GOP field will winnow and likely leave four or five candidates standing, the second-place preferences of Breitbart Primary voters may reveal which candidates may benefit the most if certain candidates drop out of the race.\n\nFor instance, if Carson exits the race, Cruz (24%) would be the top choice of his first-place voters, followed by Walker (20%), and Fiorina (13%). But 7% of Carson\u2019s first-place voters are undecided about whom they would support if Carson is no longer in the race, which is the second highest undecided percentage in the field.\n\nThirteen percent of Paul\u2019s supporters are undecided about their second choice and 32% are undecided about their second- or third-choice options, which means Paul\u2019s supporters may stay at home if the libertarian-leaning candidate, who has polled the best against Hillary Clinton in hypothetical general election match-ups, is not on the ballot in the general election.\n\nThirty-one percent of Paul\u2019s supporters, though, would back Cruz if Paul drops out while 15% would back Walker. Thirteen percent of Paul\u2019s supporters would vote for Carson without Paul in the race. In fact, Paul\u2019s supporters are the least likely of the top six candidates to support Walker and the most likely of the top six candidates to support Carson if Paul gets knocked out of the race.\n\nWalker\u2019s supporters seem to be satisfied with alternative options, as he had the lowest number of undecideds when it came to second- and third-choice votes. Thirty percent of Walker\u2019s supporters would back Cruz if Walker drops out while Perry, Rubio, and Fiorina each received more than 10% support. Walker\u2019s voters were also 50% less likely to vote for Paul than the general population.\n\nCruz\u2019s first-place supporters will not vote for Jeb Bush as their second (0%) or even third choice (0%) under any circumstances. Thirty-nine percent of Cruz\u2019s supporters would back Walker, though, if Cruz drops out, followed by Paul (13%) and Perry (12%).\n\nIf Rubio drops out of the race, Walker would by far be the greatest beneficiary, as the Wisconsin governor is the second choice of 40% of Rubio\u2019s supporters, followed by Fiorina (12%) and Cruz (11%). Rubio\u2019s voters do not like Paul, as they are four times less likely to vote for the Kentucky Senator than the general population. Rubio\u2019s supporters are also the most likely to vote for Bush as their second choice. But in a sign that their supporters may actually not overlap that much, that number is only 3%.\n\nIf Perry, who may be running in part to rehabilitate his image from his disastrous 2012 bid for the White House, does not gain traction and drops out of the race, 33% of his supporters would back Walker, followed by Cruz (23%) and Fiorina (12%).\n\nVoting in the Breitbart Primary will be reset every month, and Breitbart News readers are encouraged to vote now in July\u2019s Breitbart Primary here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz, Scott Walker Battle to Top Breitbart Primary", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz, Scott Walker Battle to Top Breitbart Primary", "title": "Ted Cruz, Scott Walker Battle to Top Breitbart Primary - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Breitbart-Primary-June-Ted-Cruz-Scott-Walker-.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-06T07:01:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/06/ted-cruz-scott-walker-battle-to-top-breitbart-primary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz, Scott Walker Battle to Top Breitbart Primary", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Breitbart-Primary-June-Ted-Cruz-Scott-Walker-.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz, Scott Walker Battle to Top Breitbart Primary - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-07-06T06:45:05-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T07:01:55-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf93f\"", "article_summary": "Voting in the Breitbart Primary will be reset every month, and Breitbart News readers are encouraged to cast their ballots in July\u2019s Breitbart Primary here.\nVoting in the Breitbart Primary will be reset every month, and Breitbart News readers are encouraged to vote now in July\u2019s Breitbart Primary here.\nThe complete national results for June\u2019s Breitbart Primary are below, and results from Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina follow.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn June, 55,000 people voted in the Breitbart Primary, and they preferred Sen.
