From the fictional, floundering Jonathan Ames in \u201cBored to Death\u201d to the heartsick Jack in \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited\u201d (which Schwartzman wrote with Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola) to the abrasive titular novelist in \u201cListen Up Philip,\u201d Schwartzman nails the neuroses of the lonely, isolated world of writers. Philip is a tricky balancing act, as writer/director Alex Ross Perry (\u201cThe Color Wheel\u201d) essentially dares the audience to spend time with Philip, a young New York author riding the steam from a successful debut, and essentially dismantling all efforts toward sophomore commercial success. In the process, Philip alienates his girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss) and nearly everyone else with his self-righteousness and egotism. But Schwartzman softens the character\u2019s poisonous humor and self-destructiveness with his typical boyish likability and quiet charisma.\n\nDo you think Philip finds redemption in his journey?\n\nRedemption? That\u2019s a big word and probably not. Alex said to me when we first started doing the movie, \u201cDon\u2019t think of Philip as a writer. Think of him as an asshole.\u201d I was like, \u201cOK\u201d [laughs]. I admired him. My first reading of the script is probably exactly what your first viewing of the movie was like, which is kind of like you can\u2019t believe someone could be that way, and how do you feel about that? I didn\u2019t really like the guy my first time. I was like, \u201cWhat a dick.\u201d\n\nHe was placed in a world that kept me in its gravitational pull, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Oddly enough, this idea of redemption is so interesting because that\u2019s something that I feel like in movies, at least I am, wanting or conditioned to see in modern movies one of the main guys learn something. He figured it out, or rides off into the sunset. I came to New York a month before shooting and sat with Alex every day. We talked about all that stuff, and messed around with versions of Philip where maybe there\u2019s a moment that makes him sympathetic or less abrasive. We were open to trying different things, but when we did, they worked against the goal of the movie, and against Philip. Instead of making him more likable, it made him more detestable and he ended up becoming passive-aggressive.\n\nI love playing him because I think it\u2019s much more honorable to be direct. With most people\u2019s feelings, it\u2019s kind of like champagne or wine. You don\u2019t know where you stand with them. You can drink champagne, you\u2019re having a great time and it tastes like alcoholic soda. The next thing you know you\u2019re sick and feel terrible. Vodka is more astringent, you drink less of it but you feel it immediately. That\u2019s like Philip. You know where you are.\n\nI was at the film\u2019s L.A. Q&A screening with Bret Easton Ellis. It seemed like you and Alex bristled a bit when the moderator described Philip as a misanthrope. Has that been a common reaction?\n\nI bristle really at nothing. He is and he isn\u2019t. I think he does have redeeming qualities. Clearly he\u2019s trying, but I think that he\u2019s just in a really bad place in his life. He\u2019s on a bit of a downward spiral and not treating people well. He\u2019s mishandling the success from his first book and is unapologetic about it. I think he\u2019s definitely going to get his comeuppance at some point. He can be a prick and sometimes a bit of a brat, but I didn\u2019t want him to be a brat, and I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t come off as even more bratty. I think the reason why is because he\u2019s not sugarcoating anything. So misanthrope? I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a writer! He\u2019s lonely. Part of the story is about solitude and people that are lost in their own heads and worlds. It\u2019s portraits of loneliness. Writing is at the top of that list occupationally. He is a misanthrope in that way, and is a lonely man. It\u2019s not helping with his social skills, for sure. He does seem to do very well with the ladies. The wall in the production office had a picture of me, Jonathan (Pryce) and all the people from the movie. Beside me are eight women, and they\u2019re all beautiful, intelligent, incredible creatures and it was like, \u201cFuck. What the fuck? How did Philip do that?\u201d\n\nIn your personal experience, have you had many interactions with real-life authors?\n\nWhat I think was fun about the writers I\u2019ve played is they\u2019re sort of different. In the Jonathan Ames character, and I just realized I play a writer in \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited\u201d as well, they slide into the writer who is struggling to write and have success. Those guys would be jealous of Philip. His book was published and well-regarded. It was a minor hit, which is really a big hit. In the movie, we don\u2019t really have any scenes of him going, \u201cWhat am I gonna write about?\u201d I think that\u2019s an interesting choice. Instead of being a writer who can\u2019t find anything to write about, he\u2019s probably going through a notebook a week, full of stuff that\u2019s maybe good or bad. But he\u2019s seriously going at it. I know Jonathan Ames, not only know him, but he\u2019s one of my closest, best friends in the world. The amount of alone time that a writer must endure is clearly different than acting or music. You can say, \u201cI\u2019m in a band but I write all these songs alone,\u201d but at a certain point you\u2019re probably going to go tour. If you\u2019re a writer, sometimes they\u2019ll go tour but it\u2019s pretty lonely. Paul Auster had some line, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, \u201cEvery great work of art is the result of someone\u2019s solitude.\u201d Jonathan Ames told me that quote, I think.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actor talks \"Listen Up Philip,\" identity crises and the gravitational pull of misanthropes", "title": "Jason Schwartzman on why he keeps playing neurotic authors", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The actor talks \"Listen Up Philip,\" identity crises and the gravitational pull of misanthropes", "title": "Jason Schwartzman on why he keeps playing neurotic authors", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/19/jason_schwartzman_on_why_he_keeps_playing_neurotic_authors/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/jason_schwartzman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The actor talks \"Listen Up Philip,\" identity crises and the gravitational pull of misanthropes", "title": "Jason Schwartzman on why he keeps playing neurotic authors", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/jason_schwartzman.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Drew Fortune", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alex Ross Perry, Bored to Death, elisabeth moss, jason schwartzman, jonathan ames, Listen Up Philip, Movies, the darjeeling limited", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca837\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Alex Ross Perry, Bored to Death, elisabeth moss, jason schwartzman, jonathan ames, Listen Up Philip, Movies, the darjeeling limited, Entertainment NewsJason Schwartzman has carved out a nice little niche playing insecure, anxiety-riddled authors.\nI know Jonathan Ames, not only know him, but he\u2019s one of my closest, best friends in the world.\nDo you think Philip finds redemption in his journey?\nI think he\u2019s definitely going to get his comeuppance at some point.\nAlex said to me when we first started doing the movie, \u201cDon\u2019t think of Philip as a writer."}
