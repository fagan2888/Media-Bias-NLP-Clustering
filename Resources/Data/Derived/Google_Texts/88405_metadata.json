Set the tone early, or shut it down late.\n\n\u201cComing out and winning the first two, I was just ready to get back out there and close this thing out,\u201d Cole said. \u201cEither get a sweep or get a series win.\u201d\n\nCole pitched the finale of the Pirates\u2019 four-game series against the Washington Nationals Sunday, a 3-1 Pirates victory at PNC Park. The Pirates took three of the four games against the National League East Division-leading Nationals and sold out all four, drawing a four-day total of 151,952 fans and setting a ballpark record for a four-game series.\n\nBy pitching the final game of the series, Cole also benefited from three live looks at the Nationals lineup. He knew Ian Desmond, who homered in each of the first three games, was swinging the bat well, and that Yunel Escobar, who went 3 for 5 with two doubles Saturday, didn\u2019t miss a beat after missing a few games because of a wrist/hand injury.\n\n\u201cThe first two looks are a little tough,\u201d Cole said. \u201cJeff [Locke] pitches quite differently than I do. Frankie's [Francisco Liriano] kind of a wild card. You don't know really what he's going to throw in any count. You definitely kind of get a feel for who's swinging it.\u201d\n\nCole (14-4) allowed one run and seven hits without walking a batter in 7\u2154 innings Sunday and struck out eight. In his past two starts, he has 14 strikeouts and no walks in 15 innings, and 12 hits and three earned runs allowed.\n\n\u201cKansas City [Tuesday], it was really sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had all four [pitches] working. Couldn't get the curveball really working as sharp as we wanted [Sunday], nor the changeup. Came out with a fastball up, which was good.\u201d\n\nThe only Nationals run came on Michael Taylor\u2019s third-inning home run. Taylor, who homered for the second game in a row after going 4 for 5 with three RBIs Saturday night, put a good swing on a 1-0 fastball just below the bottom of the strike zone and hit it out to right-center field.\n\n\u201cI don't know what the heck Taylor did on that pitch,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHe was pulling off all day from the first pitch of the game. \u2026 The second at-bat he went underneath the zone and went [opposite field]. It was just a different swing than he had taken.\u201d\n\nCole allowed a one-out single to pinch-hitter Anthony Rendon in the eighth. He struck out Taylor, but gave up a hit to Danny Espinosa. Rather than let Bryce Harper face Cole for the fourth time, manager Clint Hurdle replaced him with left-hander Tony Watson.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice, he pitched a great game, to go through all that, but skipper thought it'd be best to get him out,\u201d Watson said. \u201cCome in, try to be sharp, make your pitches and keep it right there for him.\u201d\n\nHarper grounded to first, where Sean Rodriguez, who replaced Pedro Alvarez for defensive purposes, made a sliding stop, turned and threw to Watson covering the bag.\n\n\u201cI wish they wouldn\u2019t have made that defensive change,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI think Pedro probably vacates back to the bag and the ball\u2019s through the hole. Sean made a great play on that play and I tip my cap.\u201d\n\nCole benefited from strong defense all game: Gregory Polanco threw out Harper at second to end the first inning and Jung Ho Kang started an inning-ending double play with runners on the corners and one out in the seventh.\n\nMark Melancon saved his 32nd game and 30th in a row. He has not allowed a run in 19\u2153 innings.\n\n\u201cHe's in a very good place,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cAnd he's using all his pitches. \u2026 He has been as efficient as I've ever seen him.\u201d\n\nPolanco and Andrew McCutchen had run-scoring singles in the third inning against Nationals starter Joe Ross (2-3). Ross allowed three runs in six innings.\n\nWalker led off the Pirates fourth with his ninth home run of the season into the Pirates bullpen. Walker homered for the second time in three games.\n\nBill Brink: bbrink@post-gazette.com and Twitter @BrinkPG.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gerrit Cole pitched 7 2/3 strong innings and Neil Walker homered to help the Pirates hold off Washington.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Two of the most exciting times to pitch, Gerrit Cole told Tony Watson recently, are the first game of a series or the last game of a series.
