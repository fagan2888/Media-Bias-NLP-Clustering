Bobby Jindal's push to privatize most of the university-run public hospital system. The foundation had never previously run a patient facility.\n\nThe audit was conducted by Postlewaithe and Netterville of Baton Rouge.\n\nThe period audited covers Oct. 1, 2013, when BRF assumed control of the privatized hospital, through Sept. 30, 2014, the end of BRF\u2019s first full fiscal year operating the hospital.\n\nUnder terms of the professional service agreement with LSU Health System, the BRF paid a total of $83 million to LSU to fund the work of LSU-employed physicians and allied health professionals in hospital and clinic patient services. An additional $19 million was paid for services prior to Oct. 1, 2013.\n\nFor leasing hospitals, clinics and medical equipment, the BRF paid the $44.7 million to the state.\n\nThere were no findings of material deficiencies of accounting or financial operations issues in the audit.\n\nBy the close of the fiscal year, BRF had cash equivalent of $15.7 million; total assets of $314 million; total liabilities of $268 million. BRF had total revenues of $502 million, but total expenditures of $503 million, resulting in an operating loss of $710,164.\n\nDespite the operational loss, BRF officials responded to the audit, saying the state\u2019s privatization of the Monroe and Shreveport hospitals has been proven to be efficient and effective.\n\n\u201cTo go from essentially a complete business start-up in hospital operations in 135 days, and then from October 2013 to September 2014 essentially achieve a break-even operation is indeed remarkable. Current financial results since the audit period show a continuing trend of efficiency and sound fiscal policy in the BRF\u2019s management of the north Louisiana hospitals,\u201d BRF said in a prepared statement.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1D4tmBL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "BRF had total revenues of $502 million, but total expenditures of $503 million", "og": {"site_name": "thenewsstar.com", "description": "BRF had total revenues of $502 million, but total expenditures of $503 million", "title": "Biomedical Research Foundation audit shows operational loss", "url": "http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/local/2015/04/04/biomedical-research-foundation-audit-shows-operational-loss/25293093/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thenewsstar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BRF had total revenues of $502 million, but total expenditures of $503 million", "creator": "@thenewsstar", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b965a0e8d13188640ae400aae188d21868ac24b4/c=632-0-4376-3744&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Monroe/2015/04/04/B9316852986Z.1_20150404143026_000_GSAABM46P.1-0.jpg", "title": "Biomedical Research Foundation audit shows operational loss", "site": "@thenewsstar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820377811", "fb": {"app_id": 174541472579431}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5fc\"", "article_summary": "The research foundation took control of the two hospitals in October 2013 and operates them as University Health System, as part of Gov.\nBy the close of the fiscal year, BRF had cash equivalent of $15.7 million; total assets of $314 million; total liabilities of $268 million.\nBuy Photo University Health Conway (Photo: Dacia Idom/The News-Star)Buy PhotoA legislative audit of Biomedical Research Foundation, the organization that operates University Health Conway and the Shreveport hospital, found BRF sustained a loss of $700,000 over its first 12 months of operations.\nBobby Jindal's push to privatize most of the university-run public hospital system.\nBRF had total revenues of $502 million, but total expenditures of $503 million, resulting in an operating loss of $710,164."}
