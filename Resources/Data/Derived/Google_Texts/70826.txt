On Saturday, March 14 the Roseville City School District joined with educators across the nation to celebrate National Pi Day. Chilton Middle School held activities to commentate the occasion, including offering actual pie awards for students who were the best in their class in memorizing the most random digits. Back in 2014, three different students at Chilton memorized over 250 digits and one memorized 500. According to school officials, this year 8th grade student Ammar Al-Qura’n memorized 700 random digits of Pi during the first day, and eventually memorized 1000 by Tuesday.
