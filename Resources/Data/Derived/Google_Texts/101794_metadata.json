I believe him. He leads by example.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has moved up to 2nd place behind Trump in the GOP primary, with an average of 11 percent according to Real Clear Politics, and taking 11 percent to Trump\u2019s 35 percent in Public Policy Polling\u2019s most recent. Kasich & Co. have dumped millions into TeeVee ad buys in New Hampshire to get these low double-digit scores, and we can only imagine how thrilled they are.\n\nMeanwhile, in the national polls, Kasich\u2019s average is now in a three-way tie for 8th with Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee at 4.3 percent. In the Iowa caucus averages, he\u2019s in 10th at 2.7 percent, and in the South Carolina primary, he is again in 10th, this time with 3 percent.\n\nWhat is unknown now, however, is what kind of play Kasich will get from the Deez Nuts bump, as reported at Cleveland.com.\n\nDeez Nuts is a 15-year-old Presidential candidate from Iowa named Brady Olson who has said while he endorses himself for the general election, he\u2019s throwing the weight of bofa behind Kasich in the Republican Primary and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary. Finally we can all get some sleep; I know we\u2019ve all been up at night wondering.\n\nMeanwhile, those benevolent benefactors of American Democracy, the Brothers Koch, Charles and David, held their Americans for Prosperity summit in Columbus, Ohio, and Kasich wasn\u2019t invited to the cool kids\u2019 pool party in his own backyard.\n\nOf course, Kasich being the downtrodden outcast, the other kids took the opportunity to make fun of him behind his back for (what else?) accepting Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPerry called Kasich\u2019s justification for accepting $13 billion from the federal government to expand Medicaid \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat money doesn\u2019t come from an endless vault of money in Washington. It is borrowed from bankers in China and children in Cleveland and Columbus,\u201d Perry told attendees.\n\nEvery Captain Hook must have a Smee, and this Perry stuff put Kasich\u2019s Smee all in a huff.\n\n\u201cRick Perry defended taking billions in Obama stimulus money to fill the Texas state budget holes caused by his own faulty projections, but now says using federal dollars to improve people\u2019s health is bad?\u201d (Katich spokesperson) Rob Nichols said.\n\nForgive First Mate Nichols for apparently being away in Neverland these past six years as the whole raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Republican Party has been the theme that using federal dollars to improve people\u2019s health is bad. I believe the Republican U.S. House\u2019s Obamacare repeal attempts are up to 56 or 57.\n\nFinally, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced the titles for November\u2019s statewide ballot initiatives in a press release Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHusted, who is gearing up for a run for governor in 2018 and a likely Republican primary against Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, should win a national award for gratuitous bullshittery by a state chief elections officer with these titles.\n\nFrom Husted:\n\nState Issue 1: \u201cCreates a bipartisan, public process for drawing legislative districts\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll leave that one be for now because the fun really starts with Issues 2 and 3, which we will take in reverse order:\n\nState Issue 3: \u201cGrants a monopoly for the commercial production and sale of marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes.\u201d State Issue 2: \u201cAnti-monopoly amendment; protects the initiative process from being used for personal economic benefit.\u201d\n\nHoly hell, is this electoral craps table being run by Nathan Detroit? Somebody check those dice. I think we\u2019re playing on a loaded roll.\n\nDavid Charles DeWitt is a writer and man of sport and leisure based out of Athens, Ohio.
