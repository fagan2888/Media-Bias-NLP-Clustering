There’s no denying the shellacking that voters delivered upon Democratic candidates last Tuesday. Exploiting President Obama’s 53-percent disapproval rating, the GOP retook the U.S. Senate and strengthened its control of the House. Contrast this with Congress’ current 87-percent disapproval rating — 34 points worse than the President’s — and no one can be blamed for scratching their head.

As it happened, though, Tuesday results were as much a function of dissatisfaction with the “direction of the country” (whatever that means) as with turnout, which GOP voters did and Democratic voters did not when compared to 2012 figures. And when you don’t vote, you generally don’t win.
