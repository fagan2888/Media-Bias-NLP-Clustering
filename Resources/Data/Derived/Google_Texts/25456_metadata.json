That is nonsense,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nHillary Clinton, in her response to the moderator\u2019s question, described her support for building on President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare bill, the Affordable Healthcare Act, and avoiding repealing and replacing it. She suggests Sanders would like to repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act and replace it with Universal healthcare.\n\nWhile both Clinton and Sanders support Universal healthcare, Clinton proposes building on Obamacare to achieve such goal. However, Sanders challenges the allegations made by Clinton that he wants to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely inaccurate. Nobody wants to tear up [Obamacare]. We should move forward,\u201d Sanders repeated after Clinton\u2019s continued to push the idea that Sanders would like to \u201cstart over.\u201d\n\nThe two democratic presidential candidates have been going back and forth lately since polls show the two campaigns are closely tied in the early voting state of Iowa.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders called allegations from Hillary Clinton regarding Sanders\u2019 Healthcare proposal \u201cnonsense\".", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Alex Vander", "og": {"site_name": "U.S. Politics News", "description": "Bernie Sanders called allegations from Hillary Clinton regarding Sanders\u2019 Healthcare proposal \u201cnonsense\".", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Claim is \"Nonsense\"", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.uspolitics.news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-at-NBC-debate.jpg", "url": "https://www.uspolitics.news/2016/01/19/news/2016-elections/bernie-sanders-hillary-clintons-nonsense/2419", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders called allegations from Hillary Clinton regarding Sanders\u2019 Healthcare proposal \u201cnonsense\".", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Claim is \"Nonsense\"", "url": "https://www.uspolitics.news/2016/01/19/news/2016-elections/bernie-sanders-hillary-clintons-nonsense/2419", "image": "https://www.uspolitics.news/wp-content/plugins/premium-seo-pack/timthumb.php?src=https://www.uspolitics.news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-at-NBC-debate.jpg&w=120&h=120&zc=2", "creator": "@", "site": {"identifier": "@uspoliticsnews2", "id": 3287140518}, "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "69e301bbe9b83db5b885819464ced885"}, "fb": {"app_id": 500921743428809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.uspolitics.news/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-FaviCon-300x300.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Politics, 2016 elections, Democrats, Democratic Party", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-19T14:26:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T14:26:30+00:00", "author": "https://www.uspolitics.news/author/alex-vander"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders called allegations from Hillary Clinton regarding Sanders\u2019 Healthcare proposal \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\u201cIs it fair to say Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare,\u201d debate moderator Andrea Mitchell asked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nAfter dodging the question, Bernie Sanders called out Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cShe did not answer the question,\u201d Bernie Sanders said.\nWhile both Clinton and Sanders support Universal healthcare, Clinton proposes building on Obamacare to achieve such goal."}
