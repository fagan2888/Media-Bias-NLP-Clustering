Former President Bill Clinton Bill ClintonMichelle Fields to Clinton camp: 'Don’t treat Trump as serious candidate’ Trump on '90s suicide of top Clinton aide: ‘Very fishy’ The Trail 2016: Dems struggle for unity MORE was the butt of more jokes from late night host Jay Leno than any other politician, according to a new report.

The “Tonight Show” host used Clinton in his jokes 4,607 times during his tenure, according to a study released Tuesday by George Mason University’s Center for Media and Public Affairs.

Presidential candidates —win or lose — dominate the list. The past four presidential and vice presidents make the top-20 list, as well as the past six losing presidential candidates.

Leno’s political jokes tend to focus on power and scandal, according to GMU Professor Dr. Robert Lichter, who is director of the group. Clinton straddled that line amid his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinski.

“Bill Clinton was the top twofer,” he said in a release.

Former President George W. Bush ranks second with 3,239 jokes, while Al Gore, President Obama and Hillary Clinton round out the top five.

Lewinski ranked seventh with 454 jokes about her.

Democrats receive Leno’s treatment 15 percent more than their Republican counterparts. Seven Democrats made the top-20 list, while 10 Republicans made the list. Former Independent candidate for president Ross Perot was the only independent on the list. Lewinski and Osama bin Laden — who ranked 20th — were the only non-politicians to make the list.

Jay Leno first began hosting the “Tonight Show” in 1992, the year Clinton was elected. Thursday is his last day. Jimmy Fallon will replace him later this month.
