About 1.8 million already are covered by the program.\n\n\u201cEverything is on the table except Medicaid,\u201d Clark said.\n\n+ John Spink PHOTO: John Spink / jspink@ajc.com / June 28, 2010 / Atlanta John Spink \u00d7\n\nThe issue of Medicaid expansion has divided Georgia lawmakers since the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.\n\nMedicaid is the federal and state insurance program for low-income children, pregnant women, the disabled and elderly. Obamacare called for states to expand Medicaid to very low-income people, with the federal government picking up no less than 90 percent of the tab. In Georgia, that would have meant the federal government would have given the state about $35 billion during the first decade of expansion.\n\nBut dozens of states, including Georgia, bucked that part of the law in their opposition to Obamacare.\n\nGeorgia \u201cis leaving a lot of dollars on the table,\u201d said state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler (R-Rome).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to tell our hospitals, particularly our rural ones, that they can\u2019t have that money,\u201d said Hufstetler, who was an Obamacare opponent.\n\nRural hospitals, struggling under the strain of treating the poor and uninsured, in particular could benefit from Medicaid dollars.\n\nSince 2013, five rural hospitals have closed, and a sixth, Hutcheson Medical Center in Fort Oglethorpe, is scheduled to close by the end of the month unless a deal is struck.\n\nThe governor remains opposed to Medicaid expansion because \u201cGeorgia can\u2019t afford the program,\u201d said Jen Talaber, a spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more flexibility from the federal government, Georgia could provide more and greater coverage to vulnerable populations through innovative solutions,\u201d Talaber said.\n\nBut improving health care access across the state is \u201cnot just (about) Medicaid,\u201d said Monty Veazey, president of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals. It includes access to doctors, telemedicine and first responders as providers in areas underserved by hospitals and by doctors.\n\nBill Custer, health care policy expert at Georgia State University, said he agrees that the Chamber study should not be solely about expansion.\n\n\u201cThere are other components, workforce issues, distance health care. You have to finance the health care, and you have to have access to health care,\u201d Custer said.\n\nGeorgia is falling behind in both.\n\n\u201cOne of the points that we\u2019re going to be stressing is that the coverage gap doesn\u2019t just affect those without insurance,\u201d said Chamber spokesman Brian Robinson. For example, say a person with medical insurance has a stroke. If that person lives in an underserved area, he or she still might not be able to reach a hospital in time for life-saving treatment.\n\nNot having a hospital also \u201cmakes economic development in these areas much harder,\u201d Robinson said.\n\n\u201cEmployees and employers pick up the cost. It\u2019s one of those things that affects us all as a family, as Georgians, and we need to come up with a long-term strategy that is going to be fiscally responsible and sustainable,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nClark, the Chamber president, said the health care study should take about nine months. He does not yet know the final cost, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concerned about the growing lack of health care access across the state, one of the state\u2019s largest pro-business groups is stepping in to launch a nine-month study to come up with solutions to what is becoming a health care crisis, particularly for those in rural areas.", "author": "By Virginia Anderson", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local/search-for-georgia-health-care-solutions-wont-look/npGP5/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/11/04/4d/ea/Leghealth.0107_3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Concerned about the growing lack of health care access across the state, one of the state\u2019s largest pro-business groups is stepping in to launch a nine-month study to come up with solutions to what is becoming a health care crisis, particularly for those in rural areas.", "title": "Group seeking Georgia health care answers won't consider Medicaid"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/11/04/4d/ea/Leghealth.0107_3.jpg", "description": "Concerned about the growing lack of health care access across the state, one of the state&rsquo;s largest pro-business groups is stepping in to launch a nine-month study to come up with solutions to what is becoming a health care crisis, particularly for those in rural areas.", "card": "summary", "title": "Search for Georgia health care solutions won\u2019t look at Medicaid"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local/search-for-georgia-health-care-solutions-wont-look/npGP5/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3124085/news/news/local/search-for-georgia-health-care-solutions-wont-look/npGP5/", "keywords": "localnews,healthcare,georgia news,ajc-dsl,Georgia Obamacare", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "You have to finance the health care, and you have to have access to health care,\u201d Custer said.\nBill Custer, health care policy expert at Georgia State University, said he agrees that the Chamber study should not be solely about expansion.\nClark, the Chamber president, said the health care study should take about nine months.\nBut improving health care access across the state is \u201cnot just (about) Medicaid,\u201d said Monty Veazey, president of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about economic development,\u201d said Chris Clark, president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber."}
