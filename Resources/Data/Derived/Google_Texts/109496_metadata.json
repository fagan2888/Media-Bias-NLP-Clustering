But the Leftmedia stopped one question short of finding the real reason for this discontent.\n\n\u201cDissatisfaction with government\u201d now beats out concerns of the economy, terrorism, illegal immigration and unemployment, despite the direct influence of these pocketbook and kitchen-table issues. Don\u2019t underappreciate these rankings. Survey participants most frequently respond to questions through the prism of, \u201cI\u2019m concerned because this issue impacts me directly.\u201d\n\nSo why, Mr. or Mrs. American, do you have this increasing dissatisfaction with government?\n\nIt boils down to one word, and, no, it\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s \u201cObama.\u201d\n\nWhen Barack Obama declared with glee that we are \u201cdays away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d most voters failed to fully realize the magnitude of his plans. Few understood that a community organizer raised on the milk of anger, hate and socialist indoctrination would so quickly shred the Constitution. But our Founders warned of such tyranny.\n\nHow many Democrats or even Republicans back in 2008 imagined Obama would so egregiously overstep the jurisdiction of the executive branch through ObamaCare\u2019s implementation and effective amnesty? Or that today he would be on the verge of a nuclear agreement with Iran, giving the world\u2019s leading terrorist sponsor much of what it wants?\n\nHave you ever dined at a restaurant described as some delightful experience or marketed to fulfill your culinary dreams only to leave with an excessive tab, disastrous service and a meal you could\u2019ve cooked better at home?\n\nObama marketed himself with promises of transparency, a government that serves all Americans, and all-around, feel-good \u201cHope \u2018n\u2019 Change\u2122.\n\nYet after six years, the American people have endured lie after lie. To name but a few:\n\n\"If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t set a red line on Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t call the Islamic State a \u2018JV team.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans have filibustered 500 pieces of legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sequester is not something I\u2019ve proposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what happened [at Benghazi]. \u2026 You had a video that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy character who \u2013 who made an extremely offensive video directed at \u2013 at Muhammad and Islam.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was, for example, the political targeting by the IRS and the politicization of the Department of Justice by his criminal co-conspirator, Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe distrust that has been sown, watered, fertilized and is now at full harvest is a testament to Obama\u2019s successful \u201ctransformation\u201d of America. He has left Americans with buyer\u2019s remorse of monumental proportions. Voters didn\u2019t bargain for this mess \u2013 even if some of us tried to warn them.\n\nDemocrats were walloped in two straight midterm elections, which served notice to everyone but a petulant Obama that his policies, his tactics and his results were rejected. Those Democrats who remain in elected office either have to distance themselves from the radical in the White House, or they represent districts where voters embrace Obama\u2019s radical policies.\n\nThe Obama approach to elections has been to place each voter in some interest group \u2013 black, homosexual, pro-abortion, illegal immigrant, etc. \u2013 and win by mobilizing those groups nationally. Identity politics worked for Obama but failed most Americans.\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining, it\u2019s that Chief Radical Obama\u2019s failed policies have resulted in a weak bench of leftist extremists down the ballot. The Republican wave was so thoroughly successful that it wiped out vast numbers of state and local Democrats around the nation, from whom the next generation of the party\u2019s leaders will come. It is by no means a permanent defeat, but it\u2019s most certainly a real setback.\n\nAmericans are fed up by government because Obama overpromised and under-delivered. His solution to everything is a government program, and, increasingly, Americans are seeing that as the wrong approach.\n\nNow, imagine a nation led by those who say what they mean, mean what they say, and follow through on principled policy. Americans want that type of government leadership and are waiting, impatiently.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It boils down to one word, and, no, it's not racism.", "csrf-token": "VShm2TNPHl2HsPtFzMqSZ5+wPz8NFoOh8AmpeHrjgUs=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "It boils down to one word, and, no, it\u2019s not racism.", "title": "How One Man Turned Americans Against Government", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/33901", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-03-16-ff76d9d1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1116\"", "article_summary": "Government & Politics How One Man Turned Americans Against GovernmentGallup conducted a poll of 1,025 Americans March 5-8 that captured the nation\u2019s growing disgust with the federal government.\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining, it\u2019s that Chief Radical Obama\u2019s failed policies have resulted in a weak bench of leftist extremists down the ballot.\nThe distrust that has been sown, watered, fertilized and is now at full harvest is a testament to Obama\u2019s successful \u201ctransformation\u201d of America.\nVoters didn\u2019t bargain for this mess \u2013 even if some of us tried to warn them.\nObama marketed himself with promises of transparency, a government that serves all Americans, and all-around, feel-good \u201cHope \u2018n\u2019 Change\u2122."}
