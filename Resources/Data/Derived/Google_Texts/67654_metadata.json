Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience \u2013 and in a free society, the answer is no.\n\nBush did not specifically discuss gay marriage in his address, but he did make a reference to the Little Sisters of the Poor Catholic charity, who took their case to the Supreme Court fighting for an exemption from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. Bush exclaimed:\n\nYou might even say it\u2019s a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother \u2013 and I\u2019m going with the Little Sisters.\n\nBush made his remarks at Liberty University, the fundamentalist Southern Baptist private university founded by the late evangelist Jerry Falwell. Liberty University is also the location where Texas right-wing Senator Ted Cruz made his official announcement that he was running for President. Visiting the college has become an obligatory stop for GOP presidential candidates hoping to court Christian evangelical voters, who make up a key component of the Republican primary base.\n\nJeb Bush calling President Obama \u201cintolerant\u201d while speaking at a school founded by Jerry Falwell is beyond ironic. Reverend Falwell was infamous for trying to establish a theocracy in the United States, insisting that the nation should be governed by Biblical principles as he understood them. Falwell also blamed gays, feminists and \u201cabortionists\u201d for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThat Jeb Bush would pander to Christian bigots at Liberty University, and then figuratively turn the world upside down by accusing President Obama, rather than Falwell\u2019s disciples, of intolerance is a testament to how weak Mr. Bush is as a leader.\n\nJeb Bush will not stand up for the rights of American citizens to be free from the theocratic directives of religious fundamentalists. Instead, he embraces the Religious Right\u2019s bizarre persecution complex, and he insists that denying them to the right to discriminate against gays, lesbians, and women of reproductive age, is somehow a form of intolerance. That kind of sophistry might fool a room full of Christian evangelicals at Liberty University, but it isn\u2019t likely to convince the rest of America. They recognize intolerance when they see it, and it is far more visible in Bush\u2019s address to Liberty University than it is in the Obama White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking at Liberty University, Jeb Bush accused President Obama of being small-minded and intolerant on issues of \"religious freedom.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Speaking at Liberty University, Jeb Bush accused President Obama of being small-minded and intolerant on issues of \"religious freedom.\"", "title": "Jeb Bush Calls President Obama Intolerant On Religious Freedom", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/09/jeb-bush-calls-president-obama-intolerant-religious-freedom.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jeb_bush.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-09T18:02:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Commentary,Featured News,Republican Party,White House,Barack Obama,Bush family,Conservatism in the United States,Jeb Bush,liberty university,Presidents of the United Nations Security Council,Ted Cruz,United States,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "White House", "published_time": "2015-05-09T18:02:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T18:02:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Bush family, Conservatism in the United States, Jeb Bush, liberty university, Presidents of the United Nations Security Council, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, United States"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush calling President Obama \u201cintolerant\u201d while speaking at a school founded by Jerry Falwell is beyond ironic.\nBush made his remarks at Liberty University, the fundamentalist Southern Baptist private university founded by the late evangelist Jerry Falwell.\nThat kind of sophistry might fool a room full of Christian evangelicals at Liberty University, but it isn\u2019t likely to convince the rest of America.\nLiberty University is also the location where Texas right-wing Senator Ted Cruz made his official announcement that he was running for President.\nJeb Bush will not stand up for the rights of American citizens to be free from the theocratic directives of religious fundamentalists."}
