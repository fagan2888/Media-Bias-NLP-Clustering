But Dunlap\u2019s office invalidated nearly 48,000 signatures for a range of problems.\n\nCampaign leaders had 10 days to file a lawsuit challenging the decision in Superior Court, and they announced Thursday that they would file the suit in Kennebec County and release more details at an afternoon news conference in Augusta.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake for marijuana advocates, who want to make Maine just the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana. Here\u2019s your soundtrack. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nCorrection: Maine would be the fifth, not the fourth, state to legalize marijuana. The post has been updated.\n\nDemocrats to release welfare reform plan\n\nDemocratic legislative leaders called a Thursday morning news conference to unveil a welfare reform agenda, but they didn\u2019t release details ahead of time.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that Republicans have hammered them on in recent elections: Gov. Paul LePage won re-election in 2014 largely on that issue and since then, his administration has been aggressively pushing changes on that front.\n\nDemocrats have groped for a message to match, but in particular, Senate Minority Leader Justin Alfond, D-Portland, has gotten more muscular on it this session, pushing for limits on lottery ticket purchases with welfare money.\n\nThat came after the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting found in December that public assistance recipients got more than $22 million in lottery prizes since 2010, which likely means they spent hundreds of millions on the lottery.\n\nAlfond, House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, and other top Democrats will speak at the State House news conference at 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nQuick hits\n\nCommunity Health Options, a Maine-based healthcare cooperative, is eyeing a premium increase after losing $31 million in 2015, according to the Portland Press Herald. Once one of the top-performing groups that were created under the Affordable Care Act, the cooperative saw an enrollment and claims explosions that forced it to suspend sales of individual plans.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a Republican from Maine\u2019s 2nd District, has introduced a bill that would give National Guard members and reservists a tax deduction now available to federal employees who travel 50 miles or more for work. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nReading list\n\nBest of Maine\u2019s Craigslist\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "State & Capitol", "description": "Good morning from Augusta, where proponents of marijuana legalization will announce today that\u00a0they're suing the Maine secretary of state's office over its\u00a0decision to disqualify the issue\u00a0from\u00a0the...", "title": "Maine marijuana advocates to sue state over ballot disqualification", "url": "http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2016/03/10/maine-marijuana-advocates-to-sue-state-over-ballot-disqualification/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-22-at-8.27.15-PM.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@bdnmaineblogs", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-10T13:52:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-10T19:40:53+00:00", "author": "http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/author/mshepherd/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s a lot at stake for marijuana advocates, who want to make Maine just the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\u2014 Michael ShepherdCorrection: Maine would be the fifth, not the fourth, state to legalize marijuana.\nDemocrats to release welfare reform planDemocratic legislative leaders called a Thursday morning news conference to unveil a welfare reform agenda, but they didn\u2019t release details ahead of time.\nGood morning from Augusta, where proponents of marijuana legalization will announce today that they\u2019re suing the Maine secretary of state\u2019s office over its decision to disqualify the issue from the 2016 ballot.\nBackers of the initiative, led by the national Marijuana Policy Project, submitted more than 99,000 signatures \u2014 well above the just over 61,000 valid signatures needed to get on the ballot."}
