Photo by Mark Wemple\n\nIn its annual end-of-the-year survey, Suncoast Credit Union asked its members the usual questions: Are you satisfied? How did you hear about us? What else would you like to see us offer?\n\nOne of the results was a little off for the Tampa-based credit union, a nonprofit giant with $6.5 billion in assets, more than 600,000 members and at least 1,200 employees. That result: scores of people requested health insurance.\n\nThe credit union, one of the largest in Florida, responded to the demand.\n\nThe organization, in partnership with a for-profit subsidiary, Members Insurance Center, launched an online health insurance portal available to anyone, member and nonmember. The portal is basically a one-stop-shop where participants can comparison-shop and enroll online for individual health coverage. But it doesn\u2019t stop at basic health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe found that often times if you\u2019re looking for one type of insurance, you want others, like vision and dental,\u201d says Melva McKay-Bass, senior vice president of business development at Suncoast. \u201cYou can do that with the portal.\u201d\n\nCredit unions traditionally are known for car loans and other small financing deals, serving a population the industry says big banks don\u2019t reach. But to some in the industry a credit union adding a health insurance portal isn\u2019t much of a stretch.\n\n\u201cMost credit unions are always looking for ways to enhance the experience of their members and add value,\u201d says Chip Coberly, vice president of member sales for GTE Financial, another Tampa-based credit union. \u201cThe trend right now is toward self-service and technology.\u201d\n\nSuncoast\u2019s move, adds Sozon Vatikiotis, CEO of AllTrust Insurance in Palm Harbor, is also part of a larger overall trend in the health insurance industry where distribution is direct to consumers. When the pre-existing conditions limitation went away for those interested in purchasing health insurance, \u201canyone can buy it anywhere at anytime,\u201d Vatikiotis says.\n\nCoberly says GTE looked into creating a portal when the Affordable Care Act was rolled out. But there was doubt about how members would comprehend the offerings. \u201cThe problem I see is you\u2019re making the assumption they know what they\u2019re doing and what they\u2019re buying,\u201d Coberly says. \u201cThat\u2019s the big concern.\u201d\n\nSuncoast attempted to navigate that challenge with its offering.\n\nThe process at Suncoast starts by selecting what you need and getting quotes, says Mona Russell, vice president of insurance at Members Insurance Center. If a customer wishes to continue, he can save the quote, talk to an agent and ultimately, if satisfied, make a purchase.\n\n\u201cThis was purely about adding convenience and minimizing uncertainty and helping our members save money,\u201d says McKay-Bass.\n\nAlso, when a portal like Suncoast\u2019s is implemented, the credit union buys what\u2019s called a mother platform, Vatikiotis says. HealthPlan Services, a service provider for the insurance and managed care markets, developed the Suncoast portal.\n\nOnce the mother platform is in place, it can be customized from a branding perspective, and in this case, to \u201cgive it the Suncoast Credit Union feel,\u201d McKay-Bass says. Part of that feel is making the process as smooth and member-oriented as possible.\n\n\u201cWhat makes what we offer different is we provide access to a licensed agent that can answer any questions throughout the process,\u201d McKay-Bass says.\n\nSuncoast doesn\u2019t have a specific number of users it\u2019s aiming for, or any target reach at all. The goal of the portal, say credit union officials, is simply to provide another to members at no extra cost.\n\nFollow Steven Benna on Twitter @Steve_Benna", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.review.net/images/uploads/articles/14473618451.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "JalKV1popb1teFf_ssEuY-my27ipKpHj0ufGnPXNYU0", "Description": "One of the largest lenders in the region is getting into a new line of business \u2014 a complicated side of insurance.
