John Walsh, of wanting to privatize Social Security.\n\nAnd both candidates trade jabs in competing TV ads on Medicare \u2014 a political hot-button issue that our regular readers know is rife with distortions from both sides.\n\nThe Daines ad features a 67-year-old woman claiming that \u201cWalsh also believes that privatizing Social Security should be on the table,\u201d a proposal she considers \u201cjust too risky.\u201d On screen, we see the quote, \u201cPrivatize Social Security, Walsh Says.\u201d\n\nExcept, Walsh did not say that. The small print attributes that quote to a Dirk Adams letter to the editor of the Missoulian on May 26. Adams was Walsh\u2019s opponent in the Democratic primary, which Walsh won the following week on June 3.\n\nIn that letter, Adams claimed Walsh is \u201copen to privatizing Social Security for young workers\u201d based on an answer Walsh provided to a reporter\u2019s question at a roundtable meeting with seniors about Medicare and Social Security in Great Falls, Montana, on April 17. Here\u2019s the entirety of the question and Walsh\u2019s response (which you can listen to by clicking here):\n\nReporter: Congressman Ryan is still sort of pushing for the privatization of Social Security. Do you think there would ever be a circumstance where the privatization of Social Security would make sense? Walsh: You know, I\u2019d have to take a look at all the options \u2014 but not for those that are currently in Social Security right now. I can see, you know, maybe if there may be an option where they look at it for new employees coming into the workforce \u2014 that they may look at that \u2014 but it\u2019s not something that I\u2019m going to support with those that are currently on the program or currently working in the program.\n\nThe reporter was referencing Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. And it\u2019s true that, back in 2005, Ryan co-authored a plan to partially privatize Social Security. Ryan\u2019s bill would have given workers under the age of 55 the option to allocate about half of their payroll tax contributions to a private account invested in bonds and stock funds. The plan enjoyed widespread support among Republicans, at the time, but ultimately fizzled due to near unanimous opposition from Democrats (which makes the claim of Walsh\u2019s support so unorthodox).\n\nRyan, who has chaired the House Budget Committee since 2011, persisted with his partial privatization plan, including a version in his \u201cRoadmap for America\u2019s Future\u201d plan in 2010. But his more recent budget plans have been silent on personal accounts. In fact, Ryan\u2019s most recent 2015 budget plan calls on Congress to offer legislation \u201cto ensure the sustainable solvency\u201d of Social Security, but specifically states, \u201c[t]o be clear, nothing in this budget calls for the privatization of Social Security.\u201d\n\nMore germane to the ad\u2019s claims, however, is that Walsh\u2019s answer never endorsed privatization. Rather, when asked about Republican efforts to partially privatize Social Security, Walsh responded that he would oppose any such plans for current workers. To be sure, Walsh could have been more unequivocal that he opposed any kind of privatization for everyone, including new employees coming into the workforce. But the Daines camp makes the leap that Walsh saying he would oppose privatization for current employees was the same as saying it \u201cshould be on the table\u201d for new employees. His comments could be interpreted to mean that it \u201ccould\u201d be on the table, but not that it \u201cshould\u201d be.\n\nIn an attempt to clear up any confusion on the point, Walsh\u2019s campaign told us that Walsh opposes privatization of Social Security, period, even for new employees.\n\nThe campaign emailed us this statement from Walsh: \u201cWe need to reduce the national debt and cut our spending, but it absolutely cannot come at the expense of Medicare and Social Security and I will not support efforts to privatize these programs.\u201d\n\nThe campaign further notes that Walsh was endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, a group that adamantly opposes privatization of Social Security.\n\nWe would also note that the woman featured in the ad, Pat Lawrence of Billings, Montana, is 67 years old, and even the partial privatization plans offered by Republicans in the past would not have affected current seniors.\n\nA Dollop of Mediscare from Both Camps\n\nIn addition to Social Security, the Daines ad, and a competing ad from the Walsh campaign, exchange accusations about Medicare \u2014 with each claiming the other would weaken it.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the Daines ad. Lawrence, a 67-year-old breast cancer survivor, warns that Walsh would put her Medicare benefits at risk.\n\nLawrence in Daines ad: I\u2019m a breast cancer survivor. That\u2019s why I dyed my hair pink. I really depend on Medicare. When I heard that John Walsh said Obamacare wouldn\u2019t hurt seniors, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Obamacare cuts billions of dollars from Medicare, putting my care at risk.\n\nWalsh, who was not in the Senate when the Affordable Care Act was passed, has been cagey about his thoughts on the controversial law. He has said that he does not support repeal, but adds that he thinks it ought to be fixed.\n\nThe Daines campaign bases its claim that \u201cWalsh said Obamacare wouldn\u2019t hurt seniors\u201d on an April 17 interview in which \u2014 in response to a question about the most important thing seniors should know about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Walsh said, \u201cWell most of the seniors would be involved with Medicare so really there should not be that much impact to our seniors with regards to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t his full response. He went on to say in the next sentence, \u201cBut we want to make sure it stays that way. We don\u2019t want our seniors to have to pay higher premiums or higher medical costs out of their pocket. That\u2019s one of the concerns I have with the Affordable Care Act. I want to make sure it\u2019s not going to have a negative impact on Montana seniors.\u201d\n\nThe Daines campaign claim about the Affordable Care Act hurting seniors is chiefly based on the tired attack that Democrats cut more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. It\u2019s a line that we deemed a whopper in 2012, and before. As we repeated when a similar claim was made recently in the Kentucky Senate race, the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t slash $700 billion from the current Medicare budget; instead, this is a cut in the future growth of spending over a decade.\n\nFurthermore, the reductions apply to payments made to hospitals and other non-physician providers, and it remains to be seen whether those would translate into reduced services.\n\nThe reductions would, however, extend the solvency of the program. Indeed, Daines has voted twice in favor of Republican budget proposals from Ryan, in 2013 and 2104, both of which included the same $700 billion in \u201ccuts.\u201d\n\nIn terms of breast cancer, the ACA expanded benefits for breast cancer screenings. Before the ACA, mammograms were also covered by Medicare, but with 20 percent cost-sharing. Now, they\u2019re free. Traditional Medicare began fully paying for mammogram screenings (one every 12 months) in 2011, and all Medicare Advantage plans were required to do so as of 2012.\n\nThe ACA also stipulated (see section 3601) that guaranteed Medicare benefits can\u2019t be reduced by the law. That would exclude extras offered by private Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nThe Walsh ad, meanwhile, features three senior women also worried about Medicare.\n\nOne claims: \u201cWe were so disappointed when Congressman Daines voted to cut Medicare benefits.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to Daines\u2019 vote in April for this year\u2019s Ryan plan. The plan would nix the ACA\u2019s free preventive care \u2014 including mammograms and other screenings \u2014 and the law\u2019s closing of the prescription drug doughnut hole.\n\nBut, as we explained recently, relatively few seniors have drug costs high enough to place them in the Part D doughnut hole coverage gap.\n\nUnder the doughnut hole this year, Medicare Part D covers prescription costs, minus a deductible and copays, up to $2,850 in total costs for a beneficiary. Coverage doesn\u2019t pick back up again until a beneficiary reaches $4,550 in total out-of-pocket expenses, or $6,691 in total drug costs. The ACA began offering discounts on drugs purchased in the gap in 2011 and slowly closes the gap by 2020.\n\nSo far, this increase in drug coverage has affected roughly 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Of the more than 49.4 million covered by Medicare, about 7.9 million saved money on prescriptions because of the ACA, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In Montana, in 2013, the ACA discounts saved 10,952 beneficiaries an average of $785, HHS said.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and Lori Robertson\n\nCorrection, Aug. 28: We originally wrote that the no-cost preventive care for Medicare beneficiaries under the Affordable Care Act included flu shots. The ACA requires private plans on the individual and small-group markets to cover flu shots without cost-sharing, but Medicare already had done so since 1993.
