Drinking copious amounts of alcohol over a long period of time can increase the risk for dementia, but adding a fish oil compound protects brain cells against inflammation and neuronal cell death, the researchers found.\n\nIn the study, researchers exposed adult rat brain cells to alcohol amounts equivalent to about four times the legal amount for driving. These cells were then compared to cells that had been exposed to alcohol in addition to a certain fish oil compound known as omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The study showed that the cells that had been exposed to the fish oil compound had about 90 percent less neuroinflammation and neuronal death, compared to those exposed to alcohol by itself. \u201cFish oil has the potential of helping preserve brain integrity in abusers,\u201d Michael A. Collins, lead author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cAt the very least, it wouldn\u2019t hurt them.\u201d\n\nFish oil is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for brain health, growth, development, and regulating inflammation. Omega-3 deficiencies have been associated with various health problems, like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and arthritis. Advocates of fish oil claim that taking supplements can help boost your health in these areas; as a result, many food companies have added it to their products and sold fish oil supplements.\n\nFish Oil: A Subject of Debate\n\nBefore you jump on the fish oil bandwagon, however, you might need to do some of your own research and discover that plenty of studies out there actually point to its myriad of potential negative effects. For example, a 2013 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggested that fish oil was linked to a 43 percent higher risk of prostate cancer. Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine measured its effects on cardiovascular health, and found that fish oil did not actually benefit patients as previously imagined.\n\nWhether you\u2019re struggling with excessive alcohol consumption, or you simply want to use fish oil for its other so-called health benefits, it might be better to simply eat fish or other sources of fish oil as opposed to taking the supplement. Eating regular fish will provide you with your essential serving of omega-3s while also giving you various other important nutrients that fish oil on its own doesn\u2019t contain. \u201cIf you are taking [fish oils] on your own because you believe they are good for you, it\u2019s time to rethink that strategy,\u201d Dr. Howard LeWine writes on Harvard Health Publications. \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat fish or other seafood, you can get omega-3s from ground flaxseed or flaxseed oil, chia seeds, walnuts, canola oil, and soy oil. One to two servings per day can help you avoid a deficiency of omega-3s.\u201d\n\nLeWine also notes that the controversy over fish oil will probably not be resolved any time soon: \u201c[D]on\u2019t expect any clarity about what to do any time soon,\u201d he writes. \u201cI expect other studies with flip-flopping results in the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fish oil benefits, fish oil, alcohol", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Omega-3 fish oil might help alcoholics protect themselves from dementia caused by excessive alcohol consumption.", "title": "Fish Oil Helps Alcoholics Preserve Their Brain Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fish-oil-may-benefit-alcoholics-reducing-risk-brain-cell-loss-and-dementia-293858", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fish-oil_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Omega-3 fish oil might help alcoholics protect themselves from dementia caused by excessive alcohol consumption.", "title": "Fish Oil Helps Alcoholics Preserve Their Brain Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fish-oil-may-benefit-alcoholics-reducing-risk-brain-cell-loss-and-dementia-293858", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fish-oil_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fish-oil_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-18T16:03:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-18T16:03:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Omega-3 fish oil might help alcoholics protect themselves from dementia caused by excessive alcohol consumption."}, "article_summary": "Fish Oil: A Subject of DebateBefore you jump on the fish oil bandwagon, however, you might need to do some of your own research and discover that plenty of studies out there actually point to its myriad of potential negative effects.\nA study published in PLOS ONE shows that omega-3 fish oil could help protect excessive drinkers against the neurodamage and dementia that\u2019s caused by alcoholism.\nAdvocates of fish oil claim that taking supplements can help boost your health in these areas; as a result, many food companies have added it to their products and sold fish oil supplements.\nFish oil has been touted in the past for its various health benefits, and now researchers also believe that it can have a positive effect on alcoholics.\nDrinking copious amounts of alcohol over a long period of time can increase the risk for dementia, but adding a fish oil compound protects brain cells against inflammation and neuronal cell death, the researchers found."}
