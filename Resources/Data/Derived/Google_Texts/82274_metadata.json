In the first couple of days before the online system was up, people waited hours for their turn.\n\n\u201cTo see this kind of response \u2026 is remarkable in a positive way and I think has a lot of lessons to teach us,\u201d said Nisha Agarwal, the city\u2019s commissioner for immigrant affairs.\n\nThe card, dubbed IDNYC, is aimed at those who do not currently have a government-issued identification including the elderly, homeless and an estimated 500,000 immigrants in the city who live in the U.S. without legal documentation. Cardholders are eligible for free memberships at many of the city\u2019s signature cultural institutions as well as other discounts.\n\nThe program\u2019s success since its launch caught the city off guard and prompted complaints. Officials hustled to add more processing centers to reduce the waiting time for appointments, which in some sites around the city still extends into the summer months. More than 30,000 people have already received their cards and more are waiting for them to come in the mail.\n\nAgarwal said the city followed the example of cities like San Francisco when it started the ID program, but figured that that if other places had about 1 percent of their eligible population sign up, New York City would see about two or three times that per year. Officials expected some hesitance among immigrants and other populations without legal documentation.\n\n\u201cIn the lead up to the launch of the card, we heard many advocates say that individuals may be nervous about stepping forward and interacting with the government,\u201d Agarwal said.\n\nThose worries didn\u2019t stop Melida Guevara, an immigrant from Honduras, who plans to use her new card to send money to relatives back home. \u201cThis is really useful for all of us,\u201d she said through a translator at a Queens community organization where a constant flow of people were either coming for their appointments or coming by to make them. \u201cIt is better to have this ID than to have an ID from my country,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "author": "Deepti Hajela", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "title": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/nyc_id_program_starts_off_with_a_bang/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-nyc-municipal-id.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-nyc-municipal-id.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "NYC ID program starts off with a bang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfee5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is better to have this ID than to have an ID from my country,\u201d she said.\nCity officials have scrambled to keep up with the demand as residents have made more than 260,000 appointments in just the first month since the city IDs became available.\nIn the first couple of days before the online system was up, people waited hours for their turn.\nMore than 30,000 people have already received their cards and more are waiting for them to come in the mail.\nAgarwal said the city followed the example of cities like San Francisco when it started the ID program, but figured that that if other places had about 1 percent of their eligible population sign up, New York City would see about two or three times that per year."}
