Is Barack Obama the coolest President ever? On Thursday, Barack Obama shared a Michael Fox GIF to express his joy at with a tweet: “17.6 million Americans have gained coverage under #Obamacare—that’s a BFD.”

Incidentally, BFD stands for ‘Big Fu***** Deal’ so we guess the leader of the free world used a GIF and a swearword to celebrate Obamacare.

Recently, President of the United States Barack Obama (we mention the title to remind ourselves that he’s the most powerful leader of the free world), actually compared the Republicans to a ‘grumpy cat’! He was quoted saying: “Why is it that Republican politicians are so down on America? Have you noticed that? I mean they are, they are gloomy. They're like grumpy cat."

The 2016 forecast represents an increase of about 900,000 people next year. The government has said it expects that about 9.1 million people would have effectuated coverage at the end of 2015 through the state-based exchanges created through President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law. Such plans first took effect at the beginning of 2014.

About 17.6 million people have gained insurance coverage through the exchanges and through the expansion of Medicaid plans for the poor since early 2014. The exchange-based plans are sold by private insurers including Aetna Inc, Anthem Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc. More than 85 percent of individuals with these plans receive a government subsidy based on their income, aimed at making them more affordable

Rock on Mr Obama, rock on.
