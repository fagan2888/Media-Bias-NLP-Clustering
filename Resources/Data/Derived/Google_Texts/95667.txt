Alexandria, SD

A Hutterite colony is celebrating the completion of a new 10,000-head hog operation south of Alexandria.



The Mitchell Daily Republic reports that the Oak Lane Hutterite Colony held an open house Friday evening that drew hundreds of people from the region.



Business manager John Wipf says that all-natural and drug-free hogs raised in a nursery elsewhere on the colony will be moved to the four finishing barn buildings, where they will be raised until slaughter,



Wipf says the colony has been raising its hogs for two years on various Iowa farms with open barns but wanted to move the operation to the colony.



He says it's better to have the hogs on site so colony members can use their own feed.



Construction began in July 2014.
