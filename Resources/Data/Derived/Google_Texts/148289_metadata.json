Florida\u2019s famed oranges are most at risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s running rampant,\u201d said Thonotosassa grower Tom Folsom, whose family has farmed for more than 100 years. \u201cWe have hundreds of acres just standing there dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to push down other trees standing since the 1800s,\u201d he added. \u201cMy great-granddaddy planted them. It\u2019s hard to imagine.\u201d\n\nHe has lost 1,200 acres of groves in the last three years.\n\nThe disease, which scientists refer to by its Asian name of \u201chuanglongbing,\u201d is now all over the world and in all 32 citrus-producing counties in Florida, according to the state Department of Agriculture.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that this is an existential threat to the industry,\u201d Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said in June.\n\nWith growers reporting losses of up to 40 percent of their fruit, at risk are more than 75,000 jobs and $9 billion in revenue that citrus generates in the state. Florida accounts for 65 percent of all U.S. citrus, with California a distant second at 32 percent.\n\nFolsom didn\u2019t give numbers but said he drastically cut hiring for picking season over the years as his orange production plummeted: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m making any money at it anymore.\u201d\n\nFor next year, the Florida Department of Citrus asked lawmakers for a $58.3 million budget \u2014 down $3.8 million from the current year \u2014 because of lower revenue from declining citrus crops. The budget request includes about $4 million for greening research.\n\nThe enemy is an invader from Asia called a psyllid, or jumping plant louse, and the killer bacteria it harbors. It was first noticed in Florida about eight years ago.\n\nThe bugs, about the size of a printed letter \u201co,\u201d feed on citrus leaves and infect the trees with the bacteria as they go.\n\nResearchers are looking into ways to cure the disease or to grow a strain of citrus resistant to the bacteria.\n\nIn September, Bayer CropScience and Florida Specialty Crop Foundation announced a three-year grant program for greening research. A $200,000 grant was given to Florida\u2019s Citrus Research and Development Foundation in Lake Alfred.\n\nThat\u2019s after growers put more than $60 million of their own money into the fight against greening over the last seven years. The Legislature approved another $8 million last session.\n\nFor now, Folsom is spraying his crops with insecticide every 30 days \u2014 a costly and mostly ineffective effort, he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to find something resistant to the greening,\u2019\u2019 Folsom said. \u201cIf not, well, I just don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier this year, the Coca-Cola Co. announced it will spend as much as $2 billion to plant 25,000 acres of new orange groves in Florida, or about 5 million trees.\n\nThe company, which owns the Minute Maid brand, has a significant interest; 96 percent of Florida oranges is turned into orange juice, also the official state beverage.\n\nLast month, Putnam\u2019s office said sales of Florida oranges, honey and other agricultural commodities actually increased in 2012 from the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe value of the orange crop continued to rise, with $1.5 billion in sales, up from $1.3 billion,\u201d the department reported. \u201cCitrus growers produced 146.7 million boxes of oranges, up from 140.3 million.\u201d\n\nBut results of the state\u2019s yearly Commercial Citrus Inventory, put out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in September, tell a different story.\n\nTotal citrus acreage is now about 524,000, according to the inventory, down 1 percent from the last survey and the lowest since 1966.\n\n\u201cOrange, grapefruit, and specialty acreage set new lows in the series,\u201d it said. \u201cAll production areas showed decreases in orange acreage.\u201d\n\nThe USDA\u2019s Citrus Summary report, also released in September, says the \u201con-tree\u201d value of the 2012-13 citrus crop is $1.12 billion, down 32 percent from 2011-12. Orange production decreased 9 percent to nearly 134 million boxes.\n\nFlorida Citrus Mutual, the trade group that represents more than 8,000 growers, is holding out hope that a turn against the disease is just around the corner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s agriculture and part of that is always battling Mother Nature,\u201d spokesman Andrew Meadows said. \u201cShe giveth and she taketh away.\u201d\n\nSome developments show promise, he said, such as covering and heating the trees, root stocks that are at least tolerant to greening, and a wasp that seems to be an effective psyllid predator.\n\n\u201cIt depends on whom you talk to, on which day,\u201d Meadows said of growers\u2019 attitudes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some negative people but also some optimists. We have third-, fourth-, fifth-generation growers who are in it for the long haul.\u201d\n\nFolsom, one of those with a heritage of orange growing, said he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can hold on.\n\n\u201cWe survived (citrus) canker, we survived freezes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re just trying to hold on to what we have. It\u2019s almost impossible. It\u2019s a bleak situation.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 09 Nov 2013 15:20:29 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 It\u2019s the looming disaster many Floridians still don\u2019t know about, the equivalent of a \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar c", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 It\u2019s the looming disaster many Floridians still don\u2019t know about, the equivalent of a \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar c", "title": "Citrus greening threatens Florida orange industry", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/citrus-greening-threatens-florida-orange-industry-20131109/", "image": {"width": 3640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131109/ARTICLE/131109216/EP/1/1/EP-131109216.jpg", "height": 2625}, "updated_time": "2013-11-09T15:20:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 It\u2019s the looming disaster many Floridians still don\u2019t know about, the equivalent of a \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar", "title": "Citrus greening threatens Florida orange industry", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131109/ARTICLE/131109216/AR/0/AR-131109216.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-09T15:20:29Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T15:20:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "An incurable malady called citrus greening attacks the fruit, causing it to turn green and bitter, and eventually kills the tree.\nLast month, Putnam\u2019s office said sales of Florida oranges, honey and other agricultural commodities actually increased in 2012 from the previous year.\nThe company, which owns the Minute Maid brand, has a significant interest; 96 percent of Florida oranges is turned into orange juice, also the official state beverage.\nFlorida Citrus Mutual, the trade group that represents more than 8,000 growers, is holding out hope that a turn against the disease is just around the corner.\nFlorida accounts for 65 percent of all U.S. citrus, with California a distant second at 32 percent."}
