The North Dakota Republican convention doesn't always get national attention.

However, with a tight Republican presidential primary fight, all three remaining candidate's camps are in Fargo.

Senator Ted Cruz is the only presidential candidate who is in Fargo speaking for himself.

He delivered the keynote speech on Saturday.

Cruz spoke about supporting North Dakota energy infrastructure, repealing the Waters of the US, and repealing the Affordable Care Act.

""I will not compromise away your religious liberty and I will not compromise your Second Amendment right to keep and bare arms," said Cruz.

North Dakota will send 28 delegates to the Republican National Convention. All are unbound, meaning they can vote for whoever they want.

Dr. Ben Carson will speak on behalf of Donald Trump on Sunday. Former Senator Gordon Humphrey will address the convention for John Kasich.
