In one picture, he playfully sticks out his tongue while he photobombs three members of his team on the pitch. In a video, he dances happily to Spanish ska music.\n\nForget Coach Herrera\u2019s success in turning around the troubled Mexican team, which faces off Sunday against the Netherlands after becoming one of the international soccer tournament\u2019s biggest surprises. Soccer fans around the global have fallen in love with Herrera\u2019s colorful antics, which are often as absorbing as the goal replays.\n\n\u201cHe is so authentic, so expressive and so genuine,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and World Cup commentator. \u201cHe\u2019s becoming the representation of the Mexicans\u2019 ability to celebrate and party. That is very seductive.\u201d\n\nAlthough he wears a suit and a tie, Herrera rumbles up and down the sidelines like a classic Mexican wrestler. When his players score, he shakes his arms in the air and seemingly goes into a state of euphoria, throwing his short, stout body up and down the sidelines.\n\nHe jumps atop one player like a friendly puppy, carries another team member in his arms like a proud father or simply kneels down on the sideline, face up, eyes closed, ecstatic.\n\nDuring the World Cup, sportscasters have affectionately compared Herrera to a cartoon monster \u2014 Tweety Bird\u2019s version of Mr. Hyde, from an animated short by Warner Bros. There is unquestionably a humorous resemblance, right down to the shock of sandy hair.\n\nHerrera\u2019s theatrical gestures are not new to Mexican fans who followed him through his two years as a coach for Mexico City\u2019s America soccer club. But his performances on the pitch during the World Cup have won new admirers for the man known as \u201cPiojo,\u201d or louse, since he played for Mexico\u2019s professional Atlante soccer team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "author": "Adriana Gomez Licon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "title": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/mexicos_coach_theatrical_style_excites_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-wcup-soccer-miguel-herrera.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-wcup-soccer-miguel-herrera.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mexico\u2019s coach theatrical style excites World Cup", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c8b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe is so authentic, so expressive and so genuine,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and World Cup commentator.\nBut his performances on the pitch during the World Cup have won new admirers for the man known as \u201cPiojo,\u201d or louse, since he played for Mexico\u2019s professional Atlante soccer team.\nDuring the World Cup, sportscasters have affectionately compared Herrera to a cartoon monster \u2014 Tweety Bird\u2019s version of Mr. Hyde, from an animated short by Warner Bros.\nHerrera\u2019s theatrical gestures are not new to Mexican fans who followed him through his two years as a coach for Mexico City\u2019s America soccer club.\nIn one picture, he playfully sticks out his tongue while he photobombs three members of his team on the pitch."}
