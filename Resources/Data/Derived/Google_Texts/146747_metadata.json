That policy would ensure the agency is gathering and documenting the correct cost information for programs like the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s risk map and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s strategic air and marine program.\n\nWhen the office does document program information, that data is usually error-ridden and outdated \u2013 even more so by the time it makes its way to Congress.\n\nThe report said that PARM\u2019s report on 82 programs it evaluated last year contained data that was inaccurate and out of date. \u201cAs a result, Congress may not have received accurate program information,\u201d the auditors wrote.\n\n\u201cThe report also found that PARM isn\u2019t tracking costs for 42 programs that are in the \u2018sustainable phase,\u2019\u201d meaning they\u2019re already operational.\n\nRelated: DHS Whistleblowers Save $100 Million a Year\n\nThe department was technically exempt from keeping track of programs in the \u201csustainable phase\u201d in 2013. But auditors say that should never be the case, since those programs make up about 80 percent of total costs.\n\n\u201cThe waiving of documentation requirements for the 42 programs in sustainment in 2013 resulted in a lack of oversight of costs for these programs,\u201d the GAO said. \u201cWithout an identified oversight body, DHS lacks insight into those programs\u2019 performance and the execution of their funding, which could potentially be billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe auditors recommend that DHS ramp up its oversight and documentation for its acquisition programs. The report comes after President Obama signed a budget to fund the department through September \u2013 with more than $10 billion going to acquisition programs.\n\n\u201cGood oversight is needed to ensure that our tax dollars are well spent,\u201d said the author of the report, Michele Macklin, in a podcast on Monday. \u201cWithout documented roles and responsibilities and good info on the individual systems, that oversight can\u2019t be as effective as it should be.\u201d\n\nDHS, agreeing with the GAO\u2019s recommendations, said it had already taken steps to address the issues.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The sprawling Department of Homeland Security with its annual budget of $60 billion ca", "title": "The Costly, Dysfunctional Lack of Oversight at DHS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Costly-Dysfunctional-Lack-Oversight-DHS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Costly-Dysfunctional-Lack-Oversight-DHS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The sprawling Department of Homeland Security with its annual budget of $60 billion ca", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWithout an identified oversight body, DHS lacks insight into those programs\u2019 performance and the execution of their funding, which could potentially be billions of dollars.\u201dThe auditors recommend that DHS ramp up its oversight and documentation for its acquisition programs.\n\u201cAs a result, Congress may not have received accurate program information,\u201d the auditors wrote.\nRelated: DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Unearned OvertimeThe Program Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) office doesn\u2019t have a sufficient policy in place, apparently.\nRelated: DHS Whistleblowers Save $100 Million a YearThe department was technically exempt from keeping track of programs in the \u201csustainable phase\u201d in 2013.\n\u201cThe waiving of documentation requirements for the 42 programs in sustainment in 2013 resulted in a lack of oversight of costs for these programs,\u201d the GAO said."}
