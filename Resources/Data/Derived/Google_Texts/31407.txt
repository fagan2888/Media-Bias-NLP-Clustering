Hours before the CNBC airing, the late-night show shot a new "Lie Witness News" and told passerbys that Trump showed off his muscles and said "I have the strength to lead this country."

At Wednesday's Republican GOP debate, Donald Trump reiterated his points on immigration and took shots at other candidates.

He did not do any push-ups, do a backflip to demonstrate his intended actions on Obamacare or have his intern start building his U.S.-Mexico border wall onstage.

Hours before the CNBC airing, Jimmy Kimmel Live polled Hollywood Boulevard strollers for a "Lie Witness News" segment, telling them the debate actually happened the night before.

For instance, passerbys were asked about made-up onscreen moments, such as when Trump showed off his muscles and said "I have the strength to lead this country" (which one found "actually kind of inspiring") and was caught adjusting his toupee.
