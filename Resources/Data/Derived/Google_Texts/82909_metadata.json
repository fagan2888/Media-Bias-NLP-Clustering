It\u2019s a new spotlight for Barrasso who frequently appears on CSPAN or cable news railing against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee he\u2019s got one of the largest portfolios in Congress because of all the daunting issues facing Indian Country.\n\n\u201cHealth, issues of housing, issues of education, the economy in general where unemployment is very high you also see incredible substance abuse, you see high instance of suicide and as a doctor that to me all fit under the umbrella of health.\u201d\n\nThe committee is known for its history of being one of the most bipartisan places on Capitol Hill. Still, Barrasso is a staunch conservative, which seems to be working well in his dealings with the nation\u2019s tribes \u2013 sovereign nations that have a long and often ugly history in their dealings with U.S. federal officials.\n\n\u201cA committee working together and what we\u2019ve all found is that the best solutions are not ones that come from the government, they come from the people right there on the ground they know what works best it\u2019s just a way to try and get the government out of the way,\u201d said Barrasso.\n\nIn that vein, the chairmanship is giving Barrasso a new venue to rant and rail against Washington bureaucrats. Take his anger on water issues in Indian Country.\n\n\u201cYou know the government almost 100 years ago started many irrigation projects on reservations all over the country then the depression hit and it never got completed. The built up maintenance backlog is huge, the money isn\u2019t there to do it and yet Washington dropped the ball and that was 100 years ago so we\u2019re stilling trying to deal with Washington getting too involved.\u201d\n\nBarrasso is proud that in this gridlocked Congress his committee has been active, passing 20 bipartisan bills thus far. One bill that\u2019s passed out of the committee would help with housing needs in Indian Country while another that passed the full Senate addresses the spike in suicides in elementary and secondary schools in Indian Country.\n\n\u201cSeven have gone through the Senate and a lot of it has to do with giving Native American communities opportunities to make decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nBarrasso is garnering praise thus far. Former Chairman of the committee, John McCain of Arizona, said Barrasso is a great fit as chairman.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a superb job I really do. I think he\u2019s doing a great job he\u2019s one of the most active chairmen we\u2019ve ever had and frankly he\u2019s addressing some of the fundamental issues that affect Indian Country, like alcohol and other problems to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Republicans. Montana Senator Jon Tester is the top Democrat on the committee. He said there\u2019s been a lot of continuity between Barrasso\u2019s tenure as chairman and when Democrats were in charge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bills that he\u2019s taking up that we took up that were important issues so I got no complaints.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to tribal issues, lawmakers matter less than Native Americans themselves. Some tribal leaders and native activists report being dubious when Barrasso took over the gavel this year. Jaqueline Pata is the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians and she admits that Barrasso has done well.\n\n\u201cWell actually I\u2019ve been very pleasantly pleased with you know his leadership and their strategy about moving forward.\u201d\n\nPata said Barrasso hit the ground running on issues ranging from Indian health care to drug use, even though she initially thought he was biting off too much.\n\n\u201cI mean he made it very clear at the beginning of his term you know if he becoming the chair that he had an agenda that he wanted to priority list of issues that he wanted to look at and it was a pretty hefty list and you know through hearings and other work they\u2019ve really tackled that list and moving on those issues even though some of them are pretty challenging.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s one big problem hanging over Barrasso\u2019s head: getting floor time for his committee\u2019s priorities. Republican Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma is one of two Native Americans currently in Congress. Cole knows how tough it is to make the priorities of Indian Country important in Washington.\n\n\u201cWell it is you know and that\u2019s a tough thing because again many members don\u2019t have significant tribal presence or Native American population, so there\u2019s large portions of the Congress that are not directly concerned with these issues and frankly are not particular knowledgeable about them.\u201d\n\nNow leaders across Indian Country are watching to see if Barrasso can use his perch as a member of the Republican leadership team in the Senate to get his committee\u2019s bills quickly considered in a chamber known for being bottled up.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Open Spaces", "description": "This year Wyoming\u2019s Junior Senator, John Barrasso, took the gavel as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
