Michael Harrison and Scott Adzick, the problem was death\u2014and in their minds, avoidable death that could be prevented by upending science as the world knew it.\n\n\u201cThe idea arose from the frustration of caring for babies after birth and realizing it was too late,\u201d says CHOP\u2019s chief of surgery.\n\n\u201cThe idea arose from the frustration of caring for babies after birth and realizing it was too late: the damage was already done,\u201d said Adzick, chief of surgery at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cWe had to get to the baby earlier, while still inside mom.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, Adzick, eager to solve the problem, asked Harrison if he could work under him at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nHarrison, known as the \u201cfather\u201d of fetal surgery, had never had a research fellow before.\n\n\u201cI wanted to serve as the creative force to solve unsolved surgical problems for children,\u201d Adzick told The Daily Signal.\n\nScience succeeded.\n\nSurgeons have been operating on fetuses for more than two decades.\n\n>>> Elijah\u2019s Journey: A Story of Science, Miracles and Love\n\nIn 1981, Harrison conducted the first open fetal surgery to correct a dangerously advanced urinary tract obstruction, a condition that likely would have turned fatal if treated after birth.\n\nToday, surgeons can fix even nonfatal birth defects before birth, for defects such as spina bifida.\n\nIn the future, medical professionals expect to be able to use stem cell and gene therapies to treat an even wider range of diseases in utero, with less risk.\n\nTo get to where they are today, Adzick, Harrison and others had to overcome people who viewed fixing a birth defect in the womb as \u201cscience fiction.\u201d\n\nThey had to set selection criteria to determine what and who would be eligible for operations before birth.\n\nWhat do the conditions need to be to make risking the life of an unborn baby\u2014and the mother carrying it\u2014worth it?\n\n\u201cWe learned that we had to be selective,\u201d Adzick said. \u201cThere were some fetuses\u2014unborn patients\u2014who we wanted to treat before birth whose kidney damage was already so severe that we couldn\u2019t help them. They were too severe. On the other hand, you wouldn\u2019t want to treat a fetus that was too good, who didn\u2019t\u2019 really didn\u2019t need fetal therapy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big-time intervention. Not only for the fetus, who in these circumstances would have everything to gain because otherwise the baby was going to die, but also an operation on the mother who is really medically an innocent bystander.\u201d\n\nThe goal, as fetal surgery evolved over time, has always been to increase the pool of birth defects that are treatable in utero.\n\nAlan Flake, a pediatric surgeon at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Adzick\u2019s colleague, has been pursuing the science of using cell therapy in the womb for 30 years.\n\nMedical experts believe that succeeding in that science\u2014redefining the future of medical care for birth defects yet again\u2014would allow more patients a chance at life.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine the payoff if it worked,\u201d Adzick said. \u201cThe payoff could be huge\u2014helping this new cohort of unborn patients.\u201d\n\n\u2018Controversial\u2019 to \u2018Established\u2019 Field\n\nFrom 1983-85, as a fellow, and from 1988-95, as an attending surgeon, Adzick worked with Harrison to develop the fetal surgery enterprise\u2014first testing on animals, graduating to clinical trials, and then, the real thing.\n\nThe two men studied at Massachusetts General Hospital 10 years apart\u2014Harrison before Adzick\u2014sharing an ambition to help children.\n\nIn 1995, Adzick left San Francisco to launch the fetal surgery program in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt was a very controversial concept, to do something before birth,\u201d Adzick said. \u201cMost of the response [from people] was one of being flabbergasted. \u2026 With time, applying things cautiously clinically in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and with a lot of failure, we got better and better and better. And now it\u2019s sort of an established field.\u201d\n\nAlthough fetal surgery is no longer experimental, because of the danger to both mother and child, the procedure is still rare.\n\nThis year, the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia will evaluate 1,500 mothers carrying babies with severe birth defects.\n\nThe hospital performs only 150 fetal surgeries per year.\n\nSo only 5 percent to 10 percent of patients at the hospital\u2019s Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment get fetal surgery.\n\nAdditionally, the hospital reports that 20 percent of mothers who receive treatment at the center\u2014including both those who pursued fetal surgery and those who didn\u2019t\u2014lose their babies.\n\n\u201cThe payoff could be huge,\u201d if stem cell therapy can be used to treat birth disorders in utero, says Dr. Scott Adzick\n\nMedical experts say if they can expand the types of defects that can be treated before birth, more babies can be saved.\n\nAs of 2011, about 2 in every 100 pregnancies involve birth defects that could be repaired prenatally, according to a review by the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research.\n\nFetal surgery for spina bifida\u2014now the most frequent operation done at CHOP\u2014was the first to be done for a defect that is not fatal but can cause lifelong disabilities.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the first to be validated by a large study in which women were randomly assigned to fetal surgery or treatment after birth.\n\nThe study found that babies with spina bifida are more likely to walk if treated before birth.\n\nProgress is happening from experience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that if a baby is very, very hydropic\u2014[is having] severe heart failure\u2014and the mother is already getting sick, we can\u2019t help those babies because we put the mother\u2019s health in jeopardy,\u201d Adzick said.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve learned different ways to monitor the fetus during the operations, because, in some cases, we\u2019ve lost the baby during fetal surgery. We\u2019ve [also] gotten much better at preventing or treating preterm labor. We\u2019ve learned lessons to standardize the protocol for care, so the care is better and we can have, in the end, better results.\u201d\n\nSolving the Unsolved\n\nScience means always seeking a solution for the unsolved.\n\nFlake\u2019s work with cellular and gene therapy could dramatically expand the use of fetal intervention.\n\nFlake, through a spokesperson at his hospital, turned down a request for an interview.\n\nAn article this year in the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery\u2014co-written by Flake\u2014reports that despite encouraging results in studies of animal models, including sheeps and dogs, the clinical phase of implementation for such therapies has been constrained by \u201cpoor efficacy\u201d and safety concerns.\n\nThe idea behind stem cell therapy would be to treat a fetus early in gestation, when the fetus has a poorly developed immune system and won\u2019t reject the cells.\n\nAdzick says the therapy would apply to fetuses with a cellular deficiency disease, such as sickle cell anemia, which can be diagnosed in high-risk families very early in gestation.\n\n\u201cHis [Flake\u2019s] concept is to give normal blood-forming stem cells to the fetus through a fetoscope into the umbilical cord,\u201d Adzick said. \u201cThose cells then engraft. The fetus does not recognize them as foreign, and, because it is preimmune, those cells proliferate and take over the missing function. [It] is an extraordinarily promising area of fetal therapy. It\u2019s not like doing a big operation.\u201d\n\nAdzick and Flake insist that fetal stem cell therapy will be ready for clinical trials soon.\n\nGene therapy is \u201cnot close,\u201d Adzick says.\n\nA 2008 article in the journal Nature Medicine reports that gene therapy is still considered dangerous.\n\nIt shows that the inserted gene could interfere with fetal development and that such therapy could be limited to life-threatening diseases.\n\nAlthough questions remain, science won\u2019t stop trying.\n\n\u201cCellular therapy before birth and gene therapy before birth would allow us to treat successfully thousands and thousands and thousands of patients,\u201d Adzick said. \u201cTo treat what is expressed as disease after birth to treat before birth is the ultimate preventive therapy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fetal surgery enterprise came to life like most innovations do: from an idea inspired by a problem.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The fetal surgery enterprise came to life like most innovations do: from an idea inspired by a problem.", "title": "Fetal Surgery: The Evolution of Saving a Life Before Birth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141215_FetalSurgery.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-30T15:27:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uFFCjD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The fetal surgery enterprise came to life like most innovations do: from an idea inspired by a problem.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141215_FetalSurgery.jpg"}, "title": "Fetal Surgery: The Evolution of Saving a Life Before Birth", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "fetal surgery", "published_time": "2014-12-15T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-30T15:27:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "fetal surgery, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of California, San Francisco, Scott Adzick, stem cell therapy, gene therapy, Michael Harrison, Alan Flake, PBS, Twice Born, PBS Twice Born"}, "article_summary": "Today, surgeons can fix even nonfatal birth defects before birth, for defects such as spina bifida.\nMedical experts believe that succeeding in that science\u2014redefining the future of medical care for birth defects yet again\u2014would allow more patients a chance at life.\nThe fetal surgery enterprise came to life like most innovations do: from an idea inspired by a problem.\n\u201cTo treat what is expressed as disease after birth to treat before birth is the ultimate preventive therapy.\u201d\n\u201cCellular therapy before birth and gene therapy before birth would allow us to treat successfully thousands and thousands and thousands of patients,\u201d Adzick said."}
