Upshur County has experienced it before, as health care systems have struggled to maintain a hospital there.\n\nEast Texas Medical Center Gilmer joins several other hospitals around the country closing primarily because of declining reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nSince January 2010, at least 43 rural hospitals have closed across the country, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d find that most small cities don\u2019t have hospitals anymore,\u201d said Jeff Ellington, Gilmer city manager. \u201cThere was a time when it was pretty common, but it\u2019s becoming less and less common.\u201d\n\nIn October, the hospital ceased its inpatient care. By December, officials closed the emergency department, laboratory and imaging services. Most recently, ETMC First Physicians Clinic closed. Four of the clinic\u2019s providers went to nearby facilities, including ETMC hospitals in Quitman and Pittsburg, both deemed critical access hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe problem with rural areas is you don\u2019t have the population density to create the demand,\u201d said Steve Dean, a Gilmer resident involved with economic development efforts. \u201cWhat a hospital needs to survive is a very large customer base of middle-aged people or younger who are well insured.\u201d\n\nGilmer is Upshur County\u2019s largest city, with a population of more than 5,000. There are many in the bedroom community who are aging, on Medicare or uninsured \u2014 challenging factors that can cut into a hospital\u2019s financial viability.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the population ranks low for health behaviors, according to the County Health Rankings \u2014 an annual project of the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nIt ranks 231 out of the 232 rated counties because of a high adult smoking rate, a high adult obesity rate at 31 percent, among other measures.\n\nETMC EMS had also planned to pull their ambulance services, but city officials fought to keep it there. They\u2019ve worked with a service in Camp County, which will take over ETMC EMS\u2019 contract through 2018 and will be housed in a new facility already under construction. Of all of the services that closed with the hospital, potentially ending an ambulance service was most troubling for residents there.\n\n\u201cThat transition has been made on paper,\u201d Ellington said. \u201cETMC is still the ambulance service and the changeover to Camp County EMS is going to be at the end of this month, on or about March 1.\u201d\n\nDean has worked with the city\u2019s economic development corporation as a member of the Gilmer Industrial Foundation, a private group that promotes business.\n\nHe called a meeting with the group upon news that ETMC would close the location to offer support in finding solutions.\n\n\u201cI wish they\u2019d find a way to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nRURAL HOSPITALS ON LIFE SUPPORT\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, rural hospitals were financially stressed and 460 closed, research analysis shows. Of the hospitals, 35 percent were in rural areas. Nineteen hospitals would later reopen as acute care hospitals.\n\nRural hospitals were more likely than larger hospitals to receive Medicare payments under the prospective payment system that were less than the costs associated with treating Medicare patients.\n\nAs a response, the federal government modified the system so that rural hospitals would get more funds. Today, rural hospitals face the struggle again. Since 2013, at least 24 rural hospitals have closed.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was designed to provide more access to health care, helping rural hospitals stay afloat. However, new penalties for performance-based measures, such as re-admission rates, stifled already strapped hospitals.\n\nETMC Gilmer had a loss of more than $2 million in fiscal year 2014, according to Perry Henderson, senior vice president of affiliate operations.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2014, there are also fewer funds allotted for indigent care, or disproportionate-share hospital payments, which were based on the premise that more people would be insured through the ACA. However, states such as Texas that chose not to expand Medicaid suffer the most. Of the 15 states where these hospitals have closed since 2013, 10 did not expand Medicaid.\n\nTHE VULNERABLE\n\nIn Upshur County, about 15.8 percent live below the federal poverty line and 25 percent of children live in poverty. Seniors are vulnerable, too.\n\nNadine Southerland, 74, is worried because she is prone to falls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame they couldn\u2019t keep it open,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Al and Doris Szameit, moved to Gilmer five months ago, they didn\u2019t imagine they\u2019d live in a community without a hospital. They moved there because of the proximity of the hospital to their senior living complex. Szameit, 83, feels it\u2019s a strange twist of fate.\n\n\u201cThis is the third community we\u2019ve moved to where the hospital closed,\u201d he said, noting that they left Brady and Llano after hospitals closed there.\n\n\u201cThe reason we want to be near a hospital is I had quadruple bypass heart surgery and I came out of it in very good shape,\u201d Szameit said. \u201cBut the doctor said you really should be near a good hospital facility just in case something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s lived in large cities around the country but he and his wife wanted to retire in a quiet town. Even with a clean bill of health, there is still an uncertainly.\n\n\u201cSo, now we\u2019re frustrated to tears because there\u2019s no hospital and Pittsburg is the closest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a good hospital but that\u2019s 13, 14 miles away.\u201d\n\nSince Szameit left Brady, he\u2019d learned that another hospital was built, but he can\u2019t handle another move.\n\n\u201cIf we had known that we would have stayed there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not moving no more. Moving gets harder.\u201d\n\nSherry Wadlington, 45, of Avinger, is uninsured with little income. In Marion County where she lives, there is no hospital and only one clinic. Most clinics and hospitals nearest her are a 20- to 45-minute drive.\n\nShe visited the Gilmer hospital frequently because she has upper respiratory problems. She previously sought primary care in Ore City, which has one physician in private practice and is closer to her Mims community. However, since she\u2019s uninsured and paying cash, her medical bills piled up. Today, she pays what she can as set by her Gilmer doctor\u2019s sliding scale.\n\nShe\u2019s not surprised by the hospital closure but will miss the care there. Like many who are uninsured, it was often an alternative to primary care.\n\n\u201cI went to Gilmer because it was usually quicker and closer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could get in and out easier. When you\u2019re broke, it\u2019s easier just to go on and go.\u201d\n\nEven with help through indigent care funds, her emergency room visits still reached the thousands.\n\nShe now goes to Good Shepherd Medical Center for emergencies but notes that it\u2019s a challenge to travel between Gilmer and Longview.\n\n\u201cAll of my prescriptions are filled in Gilmer, so having to run back and forth is a hassle,\u201d she said.\n\nHer physician is associated with Wellness Pointe, a group that offers medical and dental services in Longview, Kilgore and Gilmer. It\u2019s seen an increase in the patient load since the hospital closing. They\u2019ve also seen more patients presenting with emergencies.\n\nJeff Brown, director of business development with Wellness Pointe, said the group is considering adding services for minor emergencies.\n\nATTRACTING HOSPITALS, DOCTORS\n\nThe first major effort to bring a hospital to the county was with the Ragland-Fenlaw- Ford Clinic Hospital in 1933. It closed in 1981 and for the next two decades, Baylor Health Care System and Columbia/HCA (now Hospital Corporation of America) both operated the hospital but both struggled to keep it open. During the closings, local doctors had no choice but to send patients to Longview or Tyler hospitals.\n\n\u201cRelationships were created with the Longview and Tyler health care community and the customers basically left Upshur County and went that way,\u201d Dean said.\n\nBefore it closed its doors recently, the hospital averaged about two to four patients per day. ETMC officials have said less than 10 percent of the hospitalizations in Upshur County were at the Gilmer hospital.\n\nDean said it\u2019s difficult to attract new industry to a county with no hospital. Employers may have a hard time enticing potential employees.\n\n\u201cYou show him the schools,\u201d he said. \u201cYou drive down through town and you see the churches. You drive through the neighborhoods and you get a general feel for the pride that may or may not be there in the town and then you drive by the hospital. Oops, we don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nMaking a town attractive for health care systems to come in isn\u2019t an easy feat, either.\n\n\u201cIn larger cities, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Ellington said. \u201cBut in smaller cities it\u2019s not practical. It\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not interested. We\u2019re not in the position to go out and seek someone to come in.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @CDillard_TMT", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "When a county is without a hospital, that has lasting effects on the most vulnerable residents. ...", "title": "Dying rural hospitals affect most vulnerable - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/213794/dying-rural-hospitals-affect-most-vulnerable", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "RURAL HOSPITALS ON LIFE SUPPORTIn the 1980s and 1990s, rural hospitals were financially stressed and 460 closed, research analysis shows.\nSince January 2010, at least 43 rural hospitals have closed across the country, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program.\nFour of the clinic\u2019s providers went to nearby facilities, including ETMC hospitals in Quitman and Pittsburg, both deemed critical access hospitals.\nThe Affordable Care Act was designed to provide more access to health care, helping rural hospitals stay afloat.\nRural hospitals were more likely than larger hospitals to receive Medicare payments under the prospective payment system that were less than the costs associated with treating Medicare patients."}
