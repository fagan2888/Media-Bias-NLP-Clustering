I think the question comes down to a bigger one, which is, are we going to create a society where one hundred percent of everything is digitized and under central control?\u0094\n\n\u0093Who is the governance system, and why are they behaving the way they are behaving? What we see is literally a psychopathic effort and intensity\u0097whether it is in the energy area, whether it is in the currency area, whether it is in the food area, whether it is in the healthcare area\u0097to get 100% central control and to use digital means to do it, and the question is why?\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, you have a complete breakdown of internal financial controls in the US government. You had over $4 trillion of what is called undocumentable adjustments and to this day, [these agencies] have never, as required by law, produced audited financial statements.\u0094\n\n\u0093In my experience, government is not incompetent at all. Gridlock is a cover story, incompetence is a cover story. There is a plan, you just can\u0092t see what it is.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gold News, Gold Stocks, Gold Market Updates, Buying Gold, Gold Prices, Precious Metals, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, News, Quotes, Stocks, Commentary, Forums, Markets, Free, Mining, Newsletter, Links, Trading, Price, International, Live, Seek, Vote, Wire", "description": "Since 1995, news.GoldSeek.com publishes the leading gold news commentaries, gold market updates and reports providing gold investors with the most updated gold and silver prices, news & precious metals information!"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1eae\"", "article_summary": "Gridlock is a cover story, incompetence is a cover story.\nHere are a few excerpts:\u0093I don\u0092t see Obamacare as something designed to offer healthcare.\nThere is a plan, you just can\u0092t see what it is.\u0094\nYou had over $4 trillion of what is called undocumentable adjustments and to this day, [these agencies] have never, as required by law, produced audited financial statements.\u0094\u0093In my experience, government is not incompetent at all.\nI think the question comes down to a bigger one, which is, are we going to create a society where one hundred percent of everything is digitized and under central control?\u0094\u0093Who is the governance system, and why are they behaving the way they are behaving?"}
