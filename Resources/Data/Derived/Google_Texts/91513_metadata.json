Meanwhile, HHS estimates that about 10.5 million uninsured U.S. residents are eligible to enroll in coverage through the ACA's exchange (Korte, \"The Oval,\" USA Today, 11/7).\n\nChallenge Details\n\nThe competition, called the \"Healthy Communities Challenge,\" aims to target cities that have a high number or percentage of uninsured residents, according to the Times (Washington Times, 11/6).\n\nFor the competition, HHS will compare the number of uninsured residents eligible for exchange coverage in the cities at the start of open enrollment with the number of new exchange enrollees at the end of the open enrollment period (White House release, 11/6). The city that enrolls the highest percentage of uninsured residents will win the challenge (Richardson, \"The Briefing Room,\" The Hill, 11/7). Obama will visit the winning city. The winner will be posted after the open enrollment period ends on Jan. 31 (Washington Times, 11/6).\n\nThe participating cities include:", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The Obama administration has launched a challenge designed to increase enrollment through the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges in 20 cities during the third open enrollment period.
