The stock has risen 64 percent this year to Wednesday's close, including a 4 percent rise since Oct. 1.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare,csi,profits,soar,developer", "pubdate": "2013-11-14T08:50:39", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "CGI Group Inc, the Canadian software company partially blamed for the flawed launch of the website of President Barack Obama's new healthcare program, posted a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the fourth quarter.\r\nCGI said its results were helped by its acquisition...", "title": "Obamacare Website Developer Sees Profits Soar", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-csi-profits-soar/2013/11/14/id/536593/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=5aac18d3-5111-48e9-9228-515b24940325&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-csi-profits-soar/2013/11/14/id/536593/", "title": "Obamacare Website Developer Sees Profits Soar", "description": "CGI Group Inc, the Canadian software company partially blamed for the flawed launch of the website of President Barack Obama's new healthcare program, posted a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the fourth quarter.\r\nCGI said its results were helped by its acquisition...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1384419039, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "obamacare,csi,profits,soar,developer", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2013-11-14T08:50:39"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-csi-profits-soar/2013/11/14/id/536593/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "CGI Group Inc, the Canadian software company partially blamed for the flawed launch of the website of President Barack Obama's new healthcare program, posted a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the fourth quarter."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8ed\"", "article_summary": "The company's net income was C$141 million ($135 million), or 44 Canadian cents per share, compared with a loss of C$168 million, or 58 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, CGI's profit was 67 Canadian cents per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the average analyst estimate of 62 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCGI is at the center of a political storm in Washington over the rollout of the healthcare.gov website, through which uninsured Americans can sign up for health insurance.\nHowever, U.S. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in October that the private contractors for the website had not requested a delay to its launch.\nThe company completed its acquisition of Logica in August last year, becoming the world's fifth-largest independent IT services firm."}
