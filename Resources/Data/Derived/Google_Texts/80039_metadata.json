Mark Begich in four separate polls released in the last few days, lending more drama to a race that could decide control of the Senate.\n\nAfter trailing early on, Mr. Sullivan led the incumbent in all four surveys by anywhere from 2 to 6 percentage points. What\u2019s more, those polls were underway before a 30-second television ad began airing this week in which popular GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski asks Alaskans to elect Mr. Sullivan.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most popular public figure in the state\u2014by far,\u201d Anchorage pollster Marc Hellenthal said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an eyeball-to-eyeball endorsement. She\u2019s talking to the camera the entire time, about how she wants somebody who can help her take on [President] Obama. And she wants Dan Sullivan,\u201d Mr. Hellenthal said. \u201cThere are no ifs, ands or buts. It\u2019s a very strong endorsement.\u201d\n\nMr. Hellenthal\u2019s independent poll of 400 Alaska voters found Mr. Sullivan leading by 46 to 42 percent. A Rasmussen Reports poll of likely Alaska voters showed Mr. Sullivan ahead by 48 to 43 percent, while a Public Policy Polling survey showed the Republican up by 43 to 41 percent.\n\n\u201cMaking life more difficult for Begich is Barack Obama\u2019s continued unpopularity in the state,\u201d said the analysis by PPP polling director Tom Jensen. \u201cOnly 40 percent of voters approve of the job he\u2019s doing to 56 percent who disapprove.\u201d\n\nBegich spokesman Max Croes chalked up the polls to the volatility of the race. Mr. Begich had been ahead in most polls taken before the Aug. 19 primary, and led Mr. Sullivan in surveys commissioned earlier this month by the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC and the AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a number of numbers that have changed over the course of time, sure,\u201d Mr. Croes told the Alaska Dispatch New. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go up and they\u2019re going to go down.\u201d\n\nAnother poll released last week, conducted by Anchorage-based Dittman Research for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had Mr. Sullivan with a 49 to 43 percent lead. The chamber also endorsed Mr. Sullivan at a Thursday press conference, according to the Alaska political website AmandaCoyne.com.\n\n\u201cThe momentum in this race just keeps breaking our way,\u201d said a Thursday post on the Sullivan campaign Facebook page.\n\nA first-term senator, Mr. Begich is regarded as a tough, smart competitor who\u2019s being hobbled by anti-Obama sentiment in the solidly red state. He doesn\u2019t make many unforced errors, but he pulled an attack ad earlier this month that referred to a highly publicized 2013 double murder after a backlash from the victims\u2019 family.\n\nThe website FiveThirtyEight\u2019s forecasting model updated Friday gives Mr. Sullivan a 72 percent chance of winning, up from 67 percent. Shortly before the latest slew of polls were released Thursday, the Rothenberg Political Report moved the race from \u201ctoss-up/tilt Democrat\u201d to \u201cpure toss-up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan has pulled ahead of Democratic Sen.
