In accordance to their religious beliefs, they do not provide contraceptives to their female employees, but this violates a regulation stemming from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThe new site aims to provide information to the public about their case and to counteract what they allege is government misinformation about it.\n\nThe government\u2019s brief says the Little Sisters need to just file a form stating they\u2019re a religious non-profit that objects to providing coverage for contraceptive services on religious grounds, and all will be solved.\n\nBut as Matt Bowman pointed out in National Review, that\u2019s simply not the case: \u201cThe government deliberately added more language to the Little Sisters\u2019 form. Because their plan is \u2018self-insured,\u2019 in addition to stating their religious objection, the government requires their form to also specifically tell their insurance administrator that he has \u2018obligations\u2019 to provide the abortifacient and contraceptive coverage himself.\u201d\n\nSome of the other key facts included in the website are as follows:\n\n1 in 3 Americans do not have a plan that is subject to the mandate HHS is fighting so hard to force the Little Sisters of the Poor to follow.\n\nExxon, Chevron and Pepsi as well as other large corporations are exempt from the mandate.\n\nThe US military, which employs millions offers a family insurance plan exempt from the mandate.\n\nThere is an easy solution that protects the Little Sisters\u2019 religious freedom and the right of the government to offer these services to women who want them. Rather than trying to force religious plans to offer these services, the better solution is for the government to provide these services through the ACA healthcare exchange to any employees who want them but can\u2019t get them through employer plans. The website also features a comic explaining the battle between Health and Human Services and the Little Sisters. Here\u2019s an excerpt.\n\nIn the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, the balance of the court has been thrown off, so it likely will be more difficult for the Little Sisters to see a victory.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 07:40:01 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Little Sisters of the Poor respond to government misrepresentations in a legal battle that's about to go to the Supreme Court.", "title": "Little Sisters Of The Poor Respond To Gov Falsehoods", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/little-sisters.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-17T07:50:33+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2016/02/17/little-sisters-of-the-poor-prepare-to-defend-themselves-before-the-supreme-court/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Little Sisters of the Poor respond to government misrepresentations in a legal battle that's about to go to the Supreme Court.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/little-sisters.jpg"}, "title": "Little Sisters Of The Poor Respond To Gov Falsehoods", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Law", "tag": "Antonin Scalia,Beckett Fund,Burwell,contraceptives,HHS,Hobby Lobby,Little Sisters of the Poor,Obamacare,SCOTUS", "published_time": "2016-02-17T07:40:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T07:50:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Little Sisters of the Poor respond to government misrepresentations in a legal battle that's about to go to the Supreme Court."}, "article_summary": "The Little Sisters are a Catholic organization that provides housing and care for the elderly poor.\nBut as Matt Bowman pointed out in National Review, that\u2019s simply not the case: \u201cThe government deliberately added more language to the Little Sisters\u2019 form.\nThe website also features a comic explaining the battle between Health and Human Services and the Little Sisters.\nThere is an easy solution that protects the Little Sisters\u2019 religious freedom and the right of the government to offer these services to women who want them.\nIn the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, the balance of the court has been thrown off, so it likely will be more difficult for the Little Sisters to see a victory."}
