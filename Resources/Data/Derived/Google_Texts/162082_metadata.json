At least one of the people involved in that massacre was reported to have slipped into the country among Syrian refugees, which has led to sweeping concerns about the nation\u2019s security from the refugees.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be vulnerable, too,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte Bob GoodlatteIRS head vows to finish term despite impeachment push House Republicans press case for impeaching IRS commissioner Saudis scramble for Washington allies MORE (R-Va.) told Lynch.\n\nThe House will likely vote later this week on legislation to halt the Obama administration\u2019s plans for the refugees. That action on Capitol Hill comes as more than half the nation\u2019s governors have expressed opposition to the government\u2019s plans.\n\nIn particular, critics of the refugee proposal point to FBI Director James Comey\u2019s remarks earlier this year, when he worried that \u201cgaps\u201d in U.S. intelligence would make it difficult to fully screen refugees.\n\n\u201cThere is risk associated of bringing anybody in from the outside, but specifically from a conflict zone like that,\u201d Comey told a Senate panel earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Syria, you can\u2019t go to the government offices in that country,\u201d Goodlatte said on Monday. \u201cYou can\u2019t go and interview people who are applying for this status.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country is in disarray.\u201d\n\nRoughly 2,000 refugees have come to the U.S. since the civil war began in Syria more than four years ago \u2014 a far lower number than the hundreds of thousands of people that have streamed into Europe and the millions scattered across neighboring countries in the Middle East.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The attorney general defended Obama's \"significant and robust screening.\"", "description": "The attorney general defended Obama's \"significant and robust screening.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The attorney general defended Obama's \"significant and robust screening.\"", "title": "Lynch concedes \u2018challenges\u2019 in refugee screening", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/260404-ag-lynch-acknowledges-challenges-in-refugee-screening", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/lorettalynch_042115gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T12:35:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-11-17T12:35-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/260404-ag-lynch-acknowledges-challenges-in-refugee-screening", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-17T11:01-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-17T11:01:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T12:35:01-05:00"}, "keywords": "Syrian refugees,Loretta Lynch, Bob Goodlatte,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/260404-ag-lynch-acknowledges-challenges-in-refugee-screening", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The attorney general defended Obama's \"significant and robust screening.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Lynch concedes \u2018challenges\u2019 in refugee screening"}, "dcterms.title": "Lynch concedes \u2018challenges\u2019 in refugee screening"}, "article_summary": "Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday defended the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to screen the thousands of Syrian refugees set to enter the U.S., though she acknowledged there were \u201cchallenges\u201d posed by the country\u2019s chaotic civil war.\n\u201cThere is a screening process that has data from several different agencies\u201d including the FBI and intelligence officials, Lynch told the House Judiciary Committee, \u201cand much information is vetted and queried.\u201dADVERTISEMENT\u201cCertainly there are challenges to that process because of the situation in Syria,\u201d she added.\n\u201cIn the case of Syria, you can\u2019t go to the government offices in that country,\u201d Goodlatte said on Monday.\nAt least one of the people involved in that massacre was reported to have slipped into the country among Syrian refugees, which has led to sweeping concerns about the nation\u2019s security from the refugees.\nThe House will likely vote later this week on legislation to halt the Obama administration\u2019s plans for the refugees."}
