Stephen Schwarzman’s ranking among the world’s richest people, as compiled by Forbes Media, climbed 60 rungs to No. 122 as the Blackstone Group co-founder and chief executive raked in more than $2 billion in personal worth in the past year thanks to higher prices of the New York’s firm’s stock.

Sharing the 122nd place with such billionaires as Chinese online commerce entrepreneur Jack Ma and U.S. hedge fund manager David Tepper, 67-year-old Mr. Schwarzman tops the wealthiest private equity executives on the list–as he did in the Forbes billionaire list for 2013.

He is followed by Apollo Global Management chief Leon Black—who, with a $5.8 billion net worth, came in as No. 240 on the world billionaire list, also up nearly 60 rungs from last year’s 299th place.

Carlyle Group’s three co-founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway Jr., and Daniel D’Aniello are ranked No. 520, with $3.1 billion of net worth each.

Apollo co-founders Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan aren’t doing too shabby, either, each coming in at No. 580 with $2.9 billion net worth.

Henry Kravis and George Roberts, the 70-year-old cousins who co-founded Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., both came in at the 281st place, each with $5 billion in net worth. Mr. Kravis’s ranking edged down from last year’s 276th place, while Mr. Roberts was up from 316th place for 2013.

Other billionaire private equity executives include Tom Gores ($2.9 billion), Wilbur Ross ($2.8 billion), Ron Burkle, ($2.7 billion), Howard Marks ($2 billion) and Alec Gores ($2 billion).
