Fourteen percent declined to answer.\n\nOf the nearly 1,000 Muslim registered voters planning to vote, half said they support the Democratic Party, and 15 percent said they back the Republican Party. About one-quarter of the registered voters did not want to share their political affiliation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a general trend of Muslims slowly shifting toward the Democratic Party post-2000 and the election of [George W.] Bush,\u201d said Robert McCaw, CAIR government affairs manager. \u201cThere has always been Muslim support for Republicans \u2014 that 15 percent is pretty constant. What we also see, though, is 23 percent declined to answer or are unaffiliated. Their votes are up for grabs.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted only in the five states with the largest Muslim populations: California, New York, Illinois, Florida and Texas.\n\nCAIR also polled Muslims living in Virginia, a \u201cfuture toss-up state,\u201d Mr. McCaw said.\n\nMr. McCaw said CAIR has been conducting pre-election surveys for presidential races in an effort \u201cto trace Muslim voting behavior to a greater degree and draw more attention to Muslim voters who are well positioned in swing and battleground states.\u201d\n\nBut Geoffrey Skelley, spokesman for the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Republicans might not need to worry just yet about winning back the Muslim vote, noting that Muslims compose about 1 percent of the national voting population.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Muslim voters as having a major influence on the outcome of elections this cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking at the states they pulled none of those states have particularly competitive statewide races going on.\u201d\n\nParties should care, however, because there are a lot of young Muslims, which means a lot of new voters, said Kathleen Moore, professor and chairwoman of the Religious Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cLook at the Hispanic population. They came of age and wanted to be part of the democratic process,\u201d Ms. Moore said.\n\nEven though Muslims only make up 1 percent of voters, in a swing state \u201ctheir vote will matter, because it\u2019s such a marginal difference,\u201d Ms. Moore said.\n\n\u201cSo Florida being a swing state, Ohio being a swing state, if they constitute as much as 2 or 3 percent, that will matter in the outcome,\u201d she said.\n\nMore specific numbers for each state are set to be released Monday, but the national trends \u201cdo reflect the local environment,\u201d Mr. McCaw said.\n\nSimilar to the 2012 results, the top issues for voters are the economy, health care and civil liberties.\n\nFor the first time, the survey added in the issue of Islamophobia \u201cto see how the community responded to that,\u201d Mr. McCaw said. \u201cWith recent headlines and fears, it ranked higher than [civil rights] in past years.\u201d\n\nNationally, 15 percent of Muslim voters said Islamophobia is the most important issue for them.\n\nMr. McCaw said the shift in Muslim support comes due to anti-Shariah legislation and negative comments \u201cthat pop up here and there,\u201d and that also contributes to the shifting of support from the Republican to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThe party has to distance itself from individuals who are going to speak hatred and bigotry to Muslims or any other minority,\u201d Mr. McCaw said. \u201cYou see the 15 percent base is well settled in the [Republican] party. I hope the party does more to cultivate that base. Republicans can do a better job. Our votes are still up for grabs; we just have to be approached.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two-thirds of Muslim voters plan to visit the polls on Election Day, and more than half of them are Democratic Party supporters, according to a new survey.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two-thirds of Muslim voters plan to visit the polls on Election Day, and more than half of them are Democratic Party supporters, according to a new survey.", "title": "Muslims increasingly moving away from GOP", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/muslims-increasingly-moving-away-from-gop/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/26/10262014_ap1148352191428201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/26/10262014_ap1148352191428201.jpg", "description": "Two-thirds of Muslim voters plan to visit the polls on Election Day, and more than half of them are Democratic Party supporters, according to a new survey.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Muslims increasingly moving away from GOP"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Robert Mccaw, Democratic Party, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2c9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo Florida being a swing state, Ohio being a swing state, if they constitute as much as 2 or 3 percent, that will matter in the outcome,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Muslim voters as having a major influence on the outcome of elections this cycle,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere has always been Muslim support for Republicans \u2014 that 15 percent is pretty constant.\nTwo-thirds of Muslim voters plan to visit the polls on Election Day, and more than half of them are Democratic Party supporters, according to a new survey.\n\u201cWith recent headlines and fears, it ranked higher than [civil rights] in past years.\u201dNationally, 15 percent of Muslim voters said Islamophobia is the most important issue for them."}
