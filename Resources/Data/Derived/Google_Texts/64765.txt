Glenn Beck said Friday that “nobody” in the media is covering Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) decision to join Mercury One’s border relief effort because the media is already starting to play “presidential games.”

Mercury One, the charity Glenn Beck founded, will be in McAllen, Texas, on Saturday, passing out roughly $2 million in food, water, clothing and toys to illegal immigrant children. Beck and a number of volunteers will be there to help.

But as Beck said, while many news outlets, including MSNBC, have reported on the relief effort, few have said anything about Cruz’s involvement.

“Why is nobody covering this?” Beck asked on his radio program Friday. “This came out yesterday. This is a big deal. Why is no one covering that Ted Cruz is going down to the border for a relief program?”

Beck said Cruz’s involvement is scarcely being mentioned because the left has to paint the senator as a “hater,” and some on the right don’t want to help a conservative that is not part of the Republican “establishment.”

“They cannot cover Ted Cruz going down to the border,” Beck said. “This gives Ted Cruz the ammo to be tough on immigration, to be tough on justice. Once you have mercy established, you have credibility to talk about justice.”

“If [former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush] were going down, I guarantee you Fox News would be covering it,” Beck added. “NBC would have cameras there.”

“It’s amazing,” Beck said. “And the lack of coverage should tell you everything you need to know: We are already playing presidential games. We’re already playing presidential games. Can’t we not play games?”
