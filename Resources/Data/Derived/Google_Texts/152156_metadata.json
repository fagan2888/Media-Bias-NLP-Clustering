But people who may have legitimate concerns about whether they were exposed say they can\u2019t get information that calms their worries.\n\nA Florida lawyer who Tuesday flew on the Frontier Airlines plane that a day earlier carried Ebola patient Amber Joy Vinson said he later placed precautionary calls to his doctor and to the Ohio health department after he realized he was seated close to where Vinson had been seated. He was referred to the CDC.\n\n\u201cI wanted someone to answer if there was any risk and if I should self-quarantine for 21 days and what to tell my employer,\u201d said the lawyer, who provided copies of his flight vouchers to The Denver Post but asked that his name not be used\n\n.\n\nHe says a CDC employee told him, \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I was surprised, because (she\u2019s) going to get a call from about 500 people on these other flights,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I have much more chance of getting influenza, but it would be nice to have some communication.\u201d\n\nAt 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, he was told that someone would be in touch. On Friday, he was still waiting.\n\nNone of this is helping to assuage public fear.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the saddest examples of bad communications I\u2019ve seen in 25 years of public relations,\u201d said Wendy Aiello of Aiello Public Relations in Denver. \u201cOn a scale of \u2018Fantastic\u2019 to \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u2019 this all weighs heavily to the side of \u2018What in God\u2019s name is going on?\u201d\n\nAs happens with other major national health crises \u2014 such as the SARS outbreak in 2003 \u2014 the CDC activates a joint information center that controls communications, public affairs director Barbara Reynolds said.\n\nPart of the mission is to move questions from the public through a triage system that helps to sort out people with legitimate concerns about exposure from those who have general questions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like disease detective work,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cOur job is to make sure that we can contain any spread of Ebola or disease.\u201d\n\nThe CDC, she said, has been focused on finding people who were passengers on the two flights that actually carried Vinson. But the system has been overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt does take more time because you\u2019re building up through a triage that can\u2019t handle it all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the CDC is responsible for answering the questions that come to the CDC.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday,\n\nFrontier Airlines president Barry Biffle said he was still waiting for answers to crucial questions, including how best to dispose of material removed from the plane during a precautionary decontamination process.\n\nReynolds said a CDC liaison has been in constant contact with the airline. But since the agency did not recommend Frontier rip out seats and carpeting, it is not offering guidance on how to dispose of them.\n\n\u201cThis is a really frustrating situation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt probably seems like we\u2019re not helping them, but we\u2019re giving answers based on our recommendations. We didn\u2019t believe the plane needed to be out of service.\u201d\n\nThis approach may be a good idea from the perspective of conserving resources, Aiello said. However, crisis communications involves delivering a consistent message and answering questions immediately.\n\n\u201cThere is not a leadership voice,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s the CDC, which deals with fear and trauma and confusion, and that it appears there is not an integrated communications plan in place is troubling. And if there\u2019s one in place, it\u2019s not being implemented in an effective manner.\u201d\n\nReynolds said the CDC is trying. On Thursday, the agency fielded 155 questions in one hour via Twitter chat.\n\nStill, she admits there is room to improve.\n\n\u201cI want this to go better, and I want people to get the information they need when they need it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe CDC opened a 24-hour help line Friday.\n\nAlso, Reynolds said she will propose an online Ebola FAQ page to the joint information center.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Some say CDC failing crisis communications 101 in face of Ebola panic", "title": "Some say CDC failing crisis communications 101 in face of Ebola panic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/17/some-say-cdc-failing-crisis-communications-101-in-face-of-ebola-panic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141014_111405_Tom-Frieden-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141014_111405_Tom-Frieden-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-17T20:20:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:25:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But people who may have legitimate concerns about whether they were exposed say they can\u2019t get information that calms their worries.\nAlso, Reynolds said she will propose an online Ebola FAQ page to the joint information center.\nAnd if there\u2019s one in place, it\u2019s not being implemented in an effective manner.\u201dReynolds said the CDC is trying.\n\u201cThis is one of the saddest examples of bad communications I\u2019ve seen in 25 years of public relations,\u201d said Wendy Aiello of Aiello Public Relations in Denver.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to assure the public there is nothing to fear."}
