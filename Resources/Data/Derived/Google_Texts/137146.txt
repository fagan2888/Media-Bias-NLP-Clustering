Booker T. Washington High School received an official state of Mississippi historic marker. The class of 1965 put together a ceremony to celebrate the rich history that lives inside the school. Their goal is to preserve the building. Their hope is to raise money to renovate the building. Class of 65 president, Jerome Miller says it's important to preserve history.

"We are here today to dedicate this marker to Neshoba County and the citizens and the people that attended this school. When they come back home, they can come back and with their grandchildren or whoever and they will be able to see some history from the school."

Booker T. Washington school opened in 1948 and closed in 1970 due to integration.
