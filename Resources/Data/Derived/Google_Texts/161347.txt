The rapid growth of clinical and consumer health information technology has kept pace into 2015, fueled largely by the billions of dollars hospitals and clinics are investing in electronic health records.

According to a report on health care information technology by BBC Research, a market research firm, the market for clinical health IT grew to $15.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $1.5 billion over the previous year. The firm projects the market for healthcare IT to continue to grow faster than the overall U.S. economy in the coming years, pegging the industry's anticipated compound annual growth rate between now and 2019 at 4.8 percent.
