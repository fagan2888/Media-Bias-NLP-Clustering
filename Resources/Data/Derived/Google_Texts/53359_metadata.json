Week after week, month after month, this post \u2014 Flunking The Insanity Workout But Coming Away Wiser \u2014 tends to top the WBUR Web traffic stats.\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery why: The inescapable Insanity infomercials continue to populate the late-night TV airwaves, and viewers tantalized by their amazing before-and-after photos, and the charismatic energy of trainer Shaun T., proceed to google \u201cInsanity workout\u201d to try to discern whether the set of DVDs is really worth more than $140. And there, on the first Google search page, is our CommonHealth post, and the lively, long, occasionally rough exchange of pro-and-con comments that follow.\n\nThis week, The Checkup, our podcast on Slate, revisits the Insanity workout, with a brief recap of Carey\u2019s sad tale of flunking it and additional wisdom from experts. In particular, we spoke with Dr. John Richmond, chair of orthopedics at New England Baptist Hospital, which specializes in orthopedics. The original post mentions fear of injury, but Dr. Richmond delves into the nitty-gritty of which particular moves are most dangerous, particularly for older exercisers.\n\nAnd for an added dose of sanity, the podcast also features Dr. Eddie Phillips, director of the Institute of Lifestyle Medicine, and his data-driven depiction of the overwhelming health benefits of exercise \u2014 even in far lower doses than you might expect.\n\n(To listen to The Checkup now, click on the arrow above; to download and listen later, press Download; and to get it through iTunes click here.)\n\nBelow, a full transcript of Dr. Richmond, lightly edited:\n\nCG: So I hear that orthopedic specialists are often very grateful to workouts like Insanity because they send you a lot of customers. Is that true?\n\n\n\nJR: It definitely drives business. There\u2019s no question that there are a number of people that end up in offices and actually, ultimately in operating rooms because they\u2019ve torn things or worn things out by doing over-aggressive exercise.\n\nSo what would be your top tips of what to avoid?\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a couple. One that we see a lot of is lunges, or deep-knee bends, deep squats . . .\n\nWhat do they do to you?\n\nThey beat up your knees, big time. And they can damage the joint\u2019s surface cartilage, they can overload that cartilage and cause it to wear, and it\u2019s particularly problematic in the scenario you described as not being a youngster anymore, being a little more in the middle-age realm, when people oftentimes have already accumulated some wear-and-tear damage in their joints. And then to really overload it with lots of squats and lunges tends to exacerbate problems and cause further damage.\n\nSo do you stop doing deep-squats or lunges altogether? Just don\u2019t do them very deeply? Or really avoid the whole move?\n\n\n\nIf you have any pre-existing knee problems, avoid the whole move. Just stay away from them. It\u2019s kind of a good test to do a squat down, come up and feel them, and if they have any grinding \u2014 crepitus is the medical term \u2014 but any grinding sensation, that\u2019s probably a joint that shouldn\u2019t be put through repetitive lunges or squats.\n\nOkay, what\u2019s your other top one?\n\nThe other top one is shoulder problems with over-use. With doing above-shoulder activities, with lifting, pushups, chin-ups, all of those things that are oftentimes tossed into these mega-workout programs.\n\nSo pushups, even?\n\nEven pushups. Again, pushups are great if you\u2019re 18, 24, 26 and healthy and have no issues, but to all of a sudden jump into a strenuous program as somebody who\u2019s in the over 40 crowd, you may in fact find that that puts enough stress on your shoulders to lead to tendonitis of the rotator cuff, and, rarely, tearing of the rotator cuff.\n\nAnd again, is this a move that you can modify? Or should you just stay away from it, those of us in the over-40 crowd?\n\n\n\nI\u2019d stay away from the pushups; I think you can do the equivalent by doing bench-press activities, but you can adjust the weight. The problem with a pushup is you\u2019re stuck with half your body weight on your arms, the other half being on your toes, so that you can\u2019t adjust the weight. But you can do bench-presses with much lighter weight and therefore be able to get the same physical benefit from it, but at a lower pressure on your joints.\n\nRight, the only thing is, you can\u2019t do that in a DVD-workout that requires no equipment.\n\nThat\u2019s correct! That needs a weight bench, and some weights.\n\nAnother thing that seems to be very typical of Insanity and workouts like it is that they\u2019re going for this super intensity. So they tell you, \u2018Okay, here\u2019s the move, it\u2019s a pretty basic move, NOW DO IT REALLY FAST! Now do it as fast as you can!\u2019 And so you\u2019ll be inevitably losing form, right? You\u2019ll be doing things with worse form than slowly?\n\n\n\nYes. You\u2019re going to do them in worse form, and you\u2019re going to do more reps than you may be prepared to do. One of the principles of training up to a high-performance exercise program is to start gradually and go up slowly. You start at an intensity that\u2019s very tolerable, and I tell folks, never increase what you\u2019re doing by more than 10% per week. So, if you\u2019re doing 10 of one thing one week, the next week you only go to 11, you don\u2019t go to 20.\n\nAlso, workouts like \u201cInsanity\u201d do vary the exercises somewhat, but you\u2019re doing a lot of very similar and particularly high-impact moves, like jumping up and down, day after day after day, without resting those specific muscles. Is that known to be problematic as well, or more likely to lead to injury?\n\n\n\nIt is. And you need some time to recover. How much time you need to recover depends on your exercise history: Are you well-trained beforehand, and somewhat on your age, but you don\u2019t do something like that necessarily five days a week. You maybe do it three days a week. You try not to push it too, too hard. You can maybe ultimately work to five days a week if you\u2019re young, and you build up gradually to it, but there aren\u2019t very many, say in the over-50 crowd, that ought to be doing something like that on a daily basis.\n\nHave you ever seen the amazing before-and-after photos on the Insanity ads? What do you think?\n\n\n\nWell, you certainly can train yourself to lose a lot of weight \u2014 or they\u2019re not actually losing that much weight, they\u2019re gaining so much muscle tone and conditioning that they\u2019re replacing fat with muscles, they look great. You can do that, but that\u2019s probably more the exception than the rule if you follow their training programs. I think they\u2019re just too quick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'The Checkup' podcast explores the risks of the Insanity Workout and other extreme exercise -- but also the tremendous health rewards of exercise, even at lower levels than you might think.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "'The Checkup' podcast explores the risks of the Insanity Workout and other extreme exercise -- but also the tremendous health rewards of exercise, even at lower levels than you might think.", "title": "The Checkup: Flunking The Insanity Workout But Coming Away Wiser", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/09/insanity-workout-checkup", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-25-at-2.59.09-PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/09/insanity-workout-checkup", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-25-at-2.59.09-PM.png", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "The Checkup: Flunking The Insanity Workout But Coming Away Wiser"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-16", "date": "Mon, 16 Sep 2013 05:50:02 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3d4\"", "article_summary": "Week after week, month after month, this post \u2014 Flunking The Insanity Workout But Coming Away Wiser \u2014 tends to top the WBUR Web traffic stats.\nThe Checkup: Flunking The Insanity Workout But Coming Away WiserIt\u2019s getting embarrassing.\nThis week, The Checkup, our podcast on Slate, revisits the Insanity workout, with a brief recap of Carey\u2019s sad tale of flunking it and additional wisdom from experts.\nSo, if you\u2019re doing 10 of one thing one week, the next week you only go to 11, you don\u2019t go to 20.\nYou\u2019ll be doing things with worse form than slowly?"}
