CLEVELAND, Ohio -- President Barack Obama is heading to Cleveland next week to speak at the City Club of Cleveland, the White House announced Friday.

Obama will speak on Wednesday about "on the importance of middle class economics," according to an emailed statement. No further details were available.

Obama last visited Cleveland in November 2013, when he toured the ArcelorMittal steel mill in the city's industrial valley and delivered a 25-minute speech on the economy. The Democrat had been a staple in battleground Ohio during his successful re-election campaign the year before.

"We bet on American ingenuity and American workers," Obama said during the 2013 visit. "And assembly lines started humming again, and automakers started to make cars again. And just a few months after this plant shut down, your plant manager got the call: Fire those furnaces back up, get those workers back on the job."

Obama also used the visit to address problems with the messy rollout of the Affordable Care Act, his signature health care reform program.

"I am going to see this through," Obama pledged then. "I want millions of Americans to make sure that they're not going broke when they get sick and they can go to a doctor when their kids get sick. And we're not apologizing for that."

Obama's City Club speech will continue a City Club tradition dating to 1988. Every sitting U.S. president since Ronald Reagan has addressed the club.

Other presidents who have spoken there, either before or after their terms in the White House, include Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter.
