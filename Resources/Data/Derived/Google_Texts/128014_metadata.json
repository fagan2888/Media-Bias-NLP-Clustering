He loves the tea party. And his lawsuits opposing same-sex marriage and lifting a deportation ban on illegal immigrants made recent headlines.\n\nExpect to hear none of that Tuesday.\n\nWhen Texas\u2019 new Republican governor is sworn in and offers his inaugural speech and his legislative agenda, close advisers say, Abbott will hew to broader issues with wider appeal: relieving snarled traffic, improving education, easing taxes and keeping Texas\u2019 economic engine churning.\n\nAbbott is not about waving red banners, they said. He is more into dog-earing a 420-page blueprint of priorities developed during his campaign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be a no-drama governor,\u201d said top political adviser David Carney. \u201cHe\u2019ll be somebody focused and prioritized and will work with the Legislature.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, in the sunshine of the Capitol steps and in the shadow of Rick Perry \u2014 the longest-serving and most powerful governor the state has known \u2014 Abbott is expected to lay out an agenda that reflects his methodical campaign.\n\nGone will be Perry\u2019s flair for declaring as legislative \u201cemergencies\u201d controversial topics such as requiring pre-abortion sonograms or cracking down on immigration. And while Abbott might not lend rhetorical flourish to those issues, he is likely to succeed on them without having to take the lead \u2014 or the heat \u2014 thanks to a Legislature in which staunch conservatives have unprecedented clout.\n\nAbbott\u2019s entire political career has been in the legal arena, as a judge and, for the last 12 years, as the state attorney general. His policy and political chops are about to be tested, and neither lawmakers nor voters know what style of governing to expect.\n\nBut so far, Abbott appears ready to put his shoulder behind big, potentially bipartisan, issues, albeit in bite-size pieces crafted to keep government spending low. He will let partisan, politically charged issues take care of themselves.\n\n\u201cThere are core issues that are very important to the citizens of Texas,\u201d said Angela Hale, a longtime Abbott adviser who is now a media consultant. \u201cTransportation, education and some kind of tax relief. Making sure Texas is No. 1 in economic development.\u201d\n\nHale and others pointed out that a cadre of GOP lawmakers are ready to jab at hot-button issues. And Abbott will likely sign their bills if they hit his desk.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where they expect his attention to be as governor.\n\nHale said he\u2019ll keep promises to social conservatives. \u201cYou can pass the things you promised, but the focus and vision is about making Texas a better place that will keep Texas moving,\u201d she said.\n\nCarney agreed. \u201cOpen carry [of handguns] will pass the Legislature in some form. There would be no need to make that an emergency item,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the inauguration, Abbott has met with contingencies of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, to discuss issues.\n\nVeteran Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston, said Abbott met with the Legislative Black Caucus. Dutton said he\u2019s also worked with Abbott in the past to develop legislation to help the attorney general\u2019s office better collect child support.\n\n\u201cThe minority party here has a place trying to develop a policy for all of Texas,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be open to that. I\u2019m really trying to listen to his ideas, and I think he\u2019s sincere in listening to ours.\u201d\n\nLone Star Project director Matt Angle, a leading Democratic consultant, said he is not soothed by Abbott\u2019s conciliatory words but is more anxious about his actions.\n\n\u201cIf meeting with a Democrat counts as being bipartisan, we really have sunk to a new low,\u201d Angle said.\n\nHe pointed out that Democrats in the Legislature represent about 9 million Texans. Angle said he had little faith that their voices will be heard.\n\n\u201cPolitically and substantively, they\u2019re going to shut those people out. They won\u2019t do anything to accommodate policy positions by Democrats,\u201d Angle said.\n\nOn education, for instance, Abbott has rejected Democratic calls for universal early childhood education and instead is proposing modest improvements with relatively little new money \u2014 $59 million a year.\n\nAngle noted that while Abbott publicly reaches out to Hispanics, he has refused to settle three lawsuits \u2014 two on redistricting and one on voter identification \u2014 in which federal courts have found intentional discrimination against Latinos.\n\nAnd he expects Abbott will encourage \u201cthe tea party wing of the Legislature to do the dirty work for him\u201d on guns, abortion and cuts to vital programs, adding: \u201cThen he\u2019ll sign them if they get on his desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of bipartisanship. It\u2019s easy to list a number of issues people care about; it\u2019s what you do about them,\u201d Angle said.\n\nCal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political scientist who closely monitors state government and politics, said he sees Abbott as a mix of a leader who wants to solve big problems and a staunch social conservative.\n\nBut because he was never seriously challenged during last year\u2019s campaign, Abbott has never had to identify himself as more in line with either the GOP\u2019s traditional business wing or the tea party, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about Abbott. He was like a sailor, tacking back and forth as the winds permitted and seemed to require,\u201d Jillson said.\n\nIn his speech and dealings with the Legislature, Abbott will work to get transportation and education programs accomplished and then sign some of the hot-button issues without expending much political capital on them, Jillson predicted.\n\nBut his rhetoric of accomplishment is likely to be inflated, he said.\n\n\u201cAbbott says, \u2018I want Texas schools to be the best in the country.\u2019 Then he wants to spend this tiny amount on pre-K education enhancement. Well, you don\u2019t get from the lower middle ranks of public schools to No. 1 by tinkering at the margins,\u201d Jillson said.\n\n\u201cYou have to go at it with both guns blazing, and he just can\u2019t do that based on the ideological shape of his Republican majority,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Abbott is far from the guns-blazing type, or even \u201cbold declarations,\u201d said adviser Carney.\n\nHe is measured and cool. But he will be driven to get his priorities done, Carney said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played poker with Abbott, but I wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d Carney said. \u201cI know his ultimate goal is to take my money. But he\u2019s just a guy who won\u2019t show his cards all at once.\u201d\n\nFollow Christy Hoppe on Twitter at @christyhoppe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a no-drama governor,\u201d said top political adviser David Carney. \u201cHe\u2019ll be somebody focused and prioritized and will work with the Legislature.\u201d", "og": {"description": "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a no-drama governor,\u201d said top political adviser David Carney. \u201cHe\u2019ll be somebody focused and prioritized and will work with the Legislature.\u201d", "title": "Abbott likely to stress roads and schools, not guns and abortion", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150117-abbott-likely-to-stress-roads-and-schools-not-guns-and-abortion.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150117-abbott_if_small.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/abbott_if_small.jpg", "height": 936}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-01-18T06:31:39Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-01-18T05:06:11Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Abbott likely to stress roads and schools, not guns and abortion\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150117-abbott-likely-to-stress-roads-and-schools-not-guns-and-abortion.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150117-abbott_if_small.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/abbott_if_small.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2141791\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-18T05:06:11Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"CHRISTY HOPPE\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150117-abbott_if_small.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/abbott_if_small.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-18T05:06:11Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd467b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAbbott says, \u2018I want Texas schools to be the best in the country.\u2019 Then he wants to spend this tiny amount on pre-K education enhancement.\nIn the weeks leading up to the inauguration, Abbott has met with contingencies of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, to discuss issues.\nAnd Abbott will likely sign their bills if they hit his desk.\nBut so far, Abbott appears ready to put his shoulder behind big, potentially bipartisan, issues, albeit in bite-size pieces crafted to keep government spending low.\n\u201cThere are core issues that are very important to the citizens of Texas,\u201d said Angela Hale, a longtime Abbott adviser who is now a media consultant."}
