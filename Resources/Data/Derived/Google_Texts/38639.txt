COTIA, Brazil (AP) — Colombia complained to FIFA on Sunday about its security detail in Sao Paulo, saying police escorts are intentionally slowing down the team’s World Cup movements.

Brazil’s Justice Ministry responded by saying it has taken “adequate” measures to guarantee the team’s movements during the tournament. Colombia’s football federation has asked FIFA to make changes to its security detail.

The team’s press officer, Mauricio Correa, said there have been “repeated incidents” of delays, including the team’s arrival at Mineirao Stadium on Saturday. Colombia beat Greece 3-0.

Correa said the security detail, which is overseen by federal police in Sao Paulo state, is intentionally going too slowly at 20-25 kph and the situation is bothering Colombia’s staff and players.

The Justice Ministry said all teams receive the same treatment.
