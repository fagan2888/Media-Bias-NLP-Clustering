A 54-year-old Village of Jackson man was killed in a single vehicle rollover around 11 a.m. Saturday on Bark Lake Road just west of Amy Belle Lane, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

Sheriff's deputies found the man trapped inside the vehicle and unresponsive. The Richfield Fire Department arrived and freed the driver, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene by the Washington County Medical Examiner.

The man was the only occupant in the vehicle.

The Sheriff's Office reported that initial investigation indicates the vehicle was eastbound on Bark Lake Road and traveling at a high rate of speed when it became airborne, and left the road, striking a utility pole and then several trees.

This accident remains under investigation by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Officials said speed appears to be a contributing factor.
