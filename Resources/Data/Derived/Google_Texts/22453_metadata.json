Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), that he lags behind her significantly in the competition for the black vote. Sanders responded that African-American voters are getting to know him and will eventually support his campaign.\n\nClinton holds a 25-point lead over Sanders in the national polls. But he\u2019s closing the gap in the first two primary contests: Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nWith Sanders rising in the polls, some political strategists say Clinton must reinforce her support among black voters in South Carolina. A win in the Palmetto State could prevent a disaster if Sanders upsets the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.\n\nSanders and Clinton sparred onstage over health care, arguably President Obama\u2019s major political legacy. The Vermont senator unveiled his Medicare-for-All (pdf) universal health care plan just hours before the debate.\n\nIn appealing to the Democratic base, he said that guaranteeing universal health care has been a goal for the party since President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He added that Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u201cwas a critically important step toward the goal.\u201d\n\nClinton embraced the achievements of Obamacare and pounced on Sanders\u2019 plan, saying that it would increase taxes on the middle class and reignite the legislative war over health care.\n\n\u201cTo tear it [Obamacare] up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/505436954-democratic-presidential-candidates-hillary-clinton-and.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "The Democratic candidates discuss the value of black lives, health care and guns as Clinton fights off Sanders\u2019 surge in the polls.", "title": "Clinton Backs Obamacare Appeals Black Voters Final Debate", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/articles/news/2016/01/clinton_backs_obamacare_appeals_black_voters_final_debate", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/505436954-democratic-presidential-candidates-hillary-clinton-and.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-18 08:24:00", "sailthru.title": "Clinton Backs Obamacare Appeals Black Voters Final Debate", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.tags": "News", "sailthru.description": "<p>Hillary Clinton defended President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy and appealed to African-American voters during last night\u2019s debate in Charleston, S.C., sponsored in part by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. \u00a0</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/505436954-democratic-presidential-candidates-hillary-clinton-and.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Vermont senator unveiled his Medicare-for-All (pdf) universal health care plan just hours before the debate.\nWith Sanders rising in the polls, some political strategists say Clinton must reinforce her support among black voters in South Carolina.\nHillary Clinton defended President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy and appealed to African-American voters during last night\u2019s debate in Charleston, S.C., sponsored in part by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.\nSanders and Clinton sparred onstage over health care, arguably President Obama\u2019s major political legacy.\nIn appealing to the Democratic base, he said that guaranteeing universal health care has been a goal for the party since President Franklin D.
