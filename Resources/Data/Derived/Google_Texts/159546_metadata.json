Governments should take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to borrow money and invest in grand infrastructure projects. Pension schemes \u2013 seeking an alternative to expensive-looking equities and record low bond yields \u2013 should be encouraged to join in the fun and help fund big transport, technology and renewable energy projects.\n\nOn paper at least it looks like the perfect win-win-win situation: countries get lots of shiny new stuff, the projects will stimulate economic growth and investors get access to just the kind of steady, long-term, inflation-linked assets that best match their liabilities.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the view of the International Monetary Fund which last week encouraged governments to go on an infrastructure spending spree . In a chapter of its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said: \u201cIn advanced economies an increase in infrastructure investment could provide a much-needed fillip to demand. It is one of the few remaining policy levers available to support growth, given already accommodative monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe evidence, however, suggests that the reality can be a little more disappointing than the theory.\n\nSome of the European countries that spent most on infrastructure prior to the credit crunch were among the worst hit by the sovereign debt crisis.\n\nAthens spent billions on hosting the Olympics in 2004 and then yet more on a new airport with good links to the city. Spain also splurged plenty of taxpayer euros on transport, including a high-speed rail link between Madrid and Barcelona, while the quality of the roads in Cyprus is matched only by the island\u2019s superb new airport at Larnaca.\n\nThese countries didn\u2019t, of course, get into trouble because of the money they spent on infrastructure, but it certainly didn\u2019t protect them either. On the contrary, the spending didn\u2019t stimulate growth when it was needed and left government finances in a more precarious position when trouble struck. Equally, Japan\u2019s countless \u201cbridges to nowhere\u201d prove that infrastructure alone cannot jump-start moribund economies.\n\nThe IMF, to its credit, does caution governments not to spend money blindly. It said countries have to choose the right projects, conduct rigorous cost-benefit analysis and invest efficiently.\n\nThat\u2019s a good idea because, as this interactive graphic from Podio shows, these projects have a nasty habit of exceeding their budgets and their timetables.\n\n(via Podio).\n\nWork started on the Edinburgh trams system, for example, in 2003. It was due to be completed in 2009 and cost a shade over \u00a3600m. But it only carried its first passenger in May this year having cost \u00a31.7bn, 167pc over budget.\n\nThe Obamacare website came in at triple the original budget and was plagued with so many technical issues that the Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart bet the US health secretary he could download every movie ever made before she could sign up.\n\nThen there is the most cautionary of infrastructure tales: the Montreal Olympic Stadium, which ended up costing 1,990pc more than was budgeted \u2013 work on its retractable roof wasn\u2019t finished until after the closing ceremony.\n\nNone of this is to say that governments shouldn\u2019t be spending money on infrastructure; of course they should. Modern economies need state-of-the-art transport links, high-speed internet and cutting-edge energy provision.\n\nBut projects need to be considered on their own merits rather than as some kind of economic panacea.\n\nInfrastructure projects are already political enough. You only need look at the brouhaha kicked up by the question of airport expansion in the South-East of England to see that the decisions about vital long-term infrastructure projects can by stymied by short-term political considerations.\n\nYou can do all of the cost-benefit analysis you like, but politicians will still end up choosing projects for political, rather than economic, reasons.\n\nThat\u2019s why institutional investors have been slow to embrace infrastructure investment. Their equity investments may be buffeted by macroeconomic forces and their bond yields squeezed by central banks, but they know that infrastructure investment is no shelter from political risk \u2013 indeed it might be the most political asset class of them all.\n\nAnd if you looked at things through a purely economic lense, the evidence suggests that you get more productivity bang for every pound that goes towards tax cuts than you do from spending it on infrastructure.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "DCSext.articleId": 11142608, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02419/roads_2419537k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@_BenWright_"}, "keywords": "Economics,Finance", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Finance;Comment;Economics;Finance_Headlines;Ben_Wright", "DCSext.Channel": "finance", "DCSext.MLC": "/finance/economics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "finance", "title": "Infrastructure projects alone cannot save the world's fading economies", "section-id": 3115, "GSACategory": "economics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "finance-economics", "GSAMLC": "finance/economics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 11142608, "WT.cg_s": "economics", "description": "Evidence suggests that you get more for every pound spent on tax cuts", "tmgads.channel": "finance", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "economics", "DCSext.Level": 3, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-05", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "finance-economics", "last-modified": "2014-10-05", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "Finance", "wordcount": 734, "embedcount": 1, "authorName": "Ben Wright", "tag": "Ben Wright", "subsection": "Economics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 4, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 2}, "tmgads.articleid": 11142608, "tmgads.level": 3, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Infrastructure projects alone cannot save the world\u2019s fading economies \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11142608/Infrastructure-projects-alone-cannot-save-the-worlds-fading-economies.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02419/roads_2419537k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11142608\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-05T21:50:00Z\",\"section\": \"Finance\",\"authors\": [\"Ben Wright\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Finance\",\"Comment\",\"Economics\",\"Finance Headlines\",\"Ben Wright\"]}", "GSAChannel": "finance", "GSAChannelName": "Finance", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Evidence suggests that you get more for every pound spent on tax cuts", "title": "Infrastructure projects alone cannot save the world's fading economies", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11142608/Infrastructure-projects-alone-cannot-save-the-worlds-fading-economies.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02419/roads_2419537k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "finance.economics", "DCSext.author": "Ben Wright", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-10-05 22:50"}, "article_summary": "Governments should take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to borrow money and invest in grand infrastructure projects.\nThat\u2019s certainly the view of the International Monetary Fund which last week encouraged governments to go on an infrastructure spending spree .\nInfrastructure projects are already political enough.\nNone of this is to say that governments shouldn\u2019t be spending money on infrastructure; of course they should.\nThese countries didn\u2019t, of course, get into trouble because of the money they spent on infrastructure, but it certainly didn\u2019t protect them either."}
