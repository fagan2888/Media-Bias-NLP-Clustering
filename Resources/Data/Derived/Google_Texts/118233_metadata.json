Judge Sotolongo says the move to compel arbitration violated the NLRA. Judge Sotolongo also says the hospital must tell the court that it no longer opposes the plaintiff\u2019s claims on the basis of the mandatory arbitration agreement, which has been rescinded or revised because it was found unlawful.\n\nJudge Sotolongo\u2019s decision is based on decisions in other cases which says its illegal for companies to force individual arbitration on employees seeking class labor law claims. Even though the Fifth Circuit has scrapped the decision in these cases, Judge Sotolongo says they\u2019re both still in effect, for now. \u201cI am compelled to follow the board\u2019s decisions unless the Supreme Court overrules the board,\u201d the Judge says.\n\nA Cedars-Sinai spokesman said it believes its agreements are legal and that the NLRB judge rendered his decision without all of the facts. \u201cWe believe that our agreement fully protects employee rights and complies with the law, and we are examining our options regarding the judge\u2019s decision,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe are particularly disappointed that the administrative law judge would not permit us to introduce factual and expert evidence demonstrating the ability of Cedars-Sinai employees to understand our agreement, and that he made his determination without the benefit of that important information.\u201d\n\nArbitration agreements can eliminate unnecessary trials and significantly lighten a heavy court docket. However, an arbitration agreement that says this is the only remedy an individual has robs a person of their day in court. There is nothing wrong with arbitrating first to determine if a resolution can be reached. But when arbitrating is the \u201conly\u201d option at a resolution, that is when arbitration becomes unfair.\n\nSource: NLRB Judge Orders Cedars-Sinai To Change Arbitration Pacts\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ruled that LA based Cedars-Sinai Medical Center must stop using its mandatory arbitration agreements to bar employees from bringing class action lawsuits and needs to fix provisions in its agreements that could lead employees to think they cannot file unfair labor charges.
