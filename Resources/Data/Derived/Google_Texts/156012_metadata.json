The short version is that somewhere around 0.1 percent of Americans ages 12 and older use junk in the past month - a vanishingly small number that was exactly the same a decade ago. When it comes to 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, the numbers for annual use are tiny to begin with (0.6 percent or less) and substantially lower than they were in the 1990s.\n\nBut what about Vermont, supposedly Ground Zero in the new heroin epidemic? Here's a snippet from my latest Time.com column, which should give much-needed perspective on the matter:\n\nEarlier this year, the Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont made news when he devoted his annual \u201cstate of the state\u201d address to what he called \u201ca full-blown heroin crisis.\u201d Shumlin testified that \u201cwe had nearly double the number of deaths in Vermont from heroin overdose as the prior year.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that there can be regional spikes even if national usage rates are flat. But according to Vermont\u2019s Department of Health, in 2012 there were just nine deaths classified as \u201cheroin involved\u201d (a category that doesn\u2019t mean heroin was the sole or even the principal cause of death). Taking the governor at his word, that means there were fewer than 18 deaths last year in Vermont in which heroin was a factor. (2013 data were not available.)\n\nThe Green Mountain State has about 626,000 people in it. It's a damn shame that anyone dies of a heroin overdose (I count one old friend among the casualties), but nobody in their right mind should be setting national or state policy based on a dozen-and-a-half deaths.\n\nBut drug panics are like no other in American life. Thirty years ago, the drug-related death of an NBA hopeful ushered in a long national nightmare that we're only barely getting around to waking up from:\n\nThe history of crusades and legislation related to drug deaths teaches us that lawmakers should proceed with caution and resist overreaction. In 1986, liberal Democratic lawmakers used the high-profile, cocaine-related death of Len Bias, a college basketball star who had signed to play with the Boston Celtics, to show that they could be just as tough on drugs as conservative Republicans during the \u201cJust Say No\u201d era. The result was a series of mandatory-minimum sentences that had no clear effect on drug use or black markets but helped the United States become the biggest jailer country on the planet.\n\nRead the whole Time.com piece, which includes links to all the stats cited above.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman's death, my colleague Jacob Sullum has done great work in calling attention to the flat and declining trends in", "title": "Journalists, Politicians More Likely to Overdose on Heroin Than Junkies", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/06/journalists-politicians-more-likely-to-o", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_02/philip-seymour-hoffman-rip.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman's death, my\ncolleague Jacob Sullum has done great work in calling attention to\nthe flat and declining trends in heroin.
