For me, it\u2019s wanting to be proactive. \u2026 I\u2019m concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\n\u201c(T)o be the type of player I want to be in football, I think I\u2019d have to take on some risks that, as a person, I don\u2019t want to take on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don\u2019t want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.\u201d\n\nThese are not comments that can fill the stakeholders in the National Football League with confidence in terms of being on top of the concussion issue. They were all made by 24-year-old 49ers linebacker Chris Borland after announcing his retirement yesterday, after just one year in the league. Borland, a player who was thought to have a bright if bone-rattlng future in the NFL, did the research on player concussions and decided the risk was just too great. (You can watch his interview with ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines,\u201d where he first announced his decision, here.)\n\n49ers color analyst Tim Ryan, someone steeped in the game, couldn\u2019t help but betray a feeling of disbelief even as he praised Borland.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what is so shocking with Chris,\u201d he said on KNBR 680-AM. \u201cYou look at all the GMs and they go to the combines and do all the interviews. Usually when a player leaves the game with a very promising career in front of them, there are warning signs in their behavior and you kind of see it coming. That\u2019s why you see the GMs go to the draft and ask all the questions. You always hear the famous quote: \u2018This guy loves football. Football is important to him.\u2019 With Borland, all of those things were right in your face, that he was all of that. That\u2019s what makes this confusing \u2013 the guy was all ball, all the time.\u201d\n\nThe Concussion Issue\n\nConcussion-induced brain trauma has been a dominant issue in football over the past several years. In 2013, the NFL agreed to pay more than 4,500 players $765 million to settle claims of ex-players who said they\u2019d suffered from such injuries..\n\nBrain damage was also at the center of a landmark $765 million settlement between the NFL and more than 4,500 players, which was granted preliminary but not final approval by a federal judge last year.\n\nUnder the settlement, all NFL players who retired prior to July 7, 2014, are eligible. From the NFL Concussion Settlement site, you can see the array of debilitating illnesses that NFL players have suffered:\n\nThe Settlement recognizes two separate groups (\u201cSubclasses\u201d) of Settlement Class Members based on the Retired NFL Football Player\u2019s injury status prior to July 7, 2014:\n\nSubclass 1 includes: Retired NFL Football Players who were not diagnosed with ALS, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Level 2 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., moderate Dementia), Level 1.5 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., early Dementia) or Death with CTE prior to July 7, 2014, and their Representative Claimants and Derivative Claimants. Subclass 2 includes: Retired NFL Football Players who were diagnosed with ALS, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Level 2 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., moderate Dementia), or Level 1.5 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., early Dementia) prior to July 7, 2014, and their Representative Claimants and Derivative Claimants; and Representative Claimants of deceased Retired NFL Football Players who were diagnosed with ALS, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Level 2 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., moderate Dementia), or Level 1.5 Neurocognitive Impairment (i.e., early Dementia) prior to death or who died prior to July 7, 2014 and received a diagnosis of Death with CTE.\n\nThe concussion issue got further attention from the PBS documentary and related book \u201cLeague of Denial,\u201d both of which explored the history of concussions in football, their devastating consequences, and what some would say was a cover-up by the NFL, which made $6 billion in revenue in the 2013-14 season.\n\nThe big question now: If a player has made this decision who had reached the very pinnacle of athletics, leaving potential fame and fortune only partially realized, what decisions will young players and their parents make, who have much less at stake?\n\nA much publicized 2013 report by Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada, the authors of \u201cLeague of Denial,\u201d said that youth participation in Pop Warner football had declined 9.5 percent between 2010-12. And an Associated Press-GFK poll last year found \u201cnearly half of parents said they\u2019re not comfortable letting their child play football amid growing uncertainty about the long-term impact of concussions.\u201d But \u201conly five percent \u2026 said they have discouraged their child from playing in the last two years as concern over head injuries has increased at all levels of the game.\u201d\n\nAnd high school football participation last year was actually up.\n\nAs for the NFL,in reaction to Borland\u2019s announcement, it said concussions were down 25 percent last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another sign for the NFL that the concussion issue is not going away anytime soon.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"49ers Wunderkind Retires After 1 Year, Brings Concussion Issue Again to Fore\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/17\\/49ers-wunderkind-retires-after-one-year-brings-concussion-issue-to-fore-again\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-17 14:26:49\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-19 09:24:27\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24508,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/Borland-e1426627065620.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Another sign for the NFL that the concussion issue is not going away anytime soon.", "title": "49ers Wunderkind Retires After 1 Year, Brings Concussion Issue Again to Fore", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/17/49ers-wunderkind-retires-after-one-year-brings-concussion-issue-to-fore-again/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/03/Borland-640x442.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f34\"", "article_summary": "Under the settlement, all NFL players who retired prior to July 7, 2014, are eligible.\nThey were all made by 24-year-old 49ers linebacker Chris Borland after announcing his retirement yesterday, after just one year in the league.\n49ers color analyst Tim Ryan, someone steeped in the game, couldn\u2019t help but betray a feeling of disbelief even as he praised Borland.\nThat\u2019s what makes this confusing \u2013 the guy was all ball, all the time.\u201dThe Concussion IssueConcussion-induced brain trauma has been a dominant issue in football over the past several years.\nAs for the NFL,in reaction to Borland\u2019s announcement, it said concussions were down 25 percent last year."}
