(AP) - Missouri lawmakers passed a budget last week that spends millions in state money to block Planned Parenthood from accessing federal funding.\n\nThe plan puts Missouri alongside at least a dozen other states in a national effort to strip public money from the country\u2019s largest abortion provider. The federal government says states don\u2019t have the authority to steer Medicaid funding away from Planned Parenthood, and courts have blocked some of those efforts. But Missouri\u2019s budget writers say eliminating federal dollars from women\u2019s health programs means federal restrictions no longer apply.\n\nThe Legislature rejected more than $8.3 million in federal Medicaid funding the state was slated to receive for family planning, sexually transmitted disease testing and pelvic exams at county health departments, other clinics and Planned Parenthood. They replaced it with money from Missouri\u2019s general revenues, leaving the total unchanged at $10.8 million, and stipulated that none of it could go to organizations that provide abortions, as Planned Parenthood does.\n\nGovernment money cannot fund non-emergency abortions, but states are prohibited from otherwise blocking Medicaid dollars from abortion providers for services such as vaccinations and cancer screenings - a rule the federal government reiterated Tuesday in a letter to state Medicaid directors.\n\nWhen lawmakers initially proposed blocking Medicaid payments from Planned Parenthood in March, budget staffers estimated less than $400,000 in Medicaid payments go to Missouri\u2019s 13 Planned Parenthood clinics for procedures and drugs.\n\nPlanned Parenthood serves more than 50,000 patients per year in Missouri, and about 7,000 of them are on Medicaid, said Sarah Felts, a spokeswoman for the organization. Planned Parenthood will continue accepting Medicaid patients \u201cno matter what,\u201d she said.\n\nMedicaid patients can still go to county health departments, rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers, said Sen. Kurt Schaefer, the Columbia Republican who chairs the appropriations committee.\n\n\u201cIf someone wants to go to Planned Parenthood, they\u2019re free to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cTaxpayers in Missouri just aren\u2019t going to pay for it anymore.\u201d\n\nRep. Stacey Newman, a St. Louis Democrat, said it was reckless for the Legislature to refuse more than $8 million from the federal government \u201cjust because we feel like it.\u201d\n\nSchaefer pointed to Texas, which cut Planned Parenthood out of the state\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Program in 2013. Like Missouri, Republican officials chose to fund the program entirely with state money so it would not run afoul of federal law.\n\nNevertheless, Planned Parenthood in Texas still receives some Medicaid funding from other programs.\n\nFamily planning is the easiest public funding stream for lawmakers to target because it\u2019s the biggest, said Emily Horne, a legislative associate with Texas Right to Life. Texas lawmakers are now looking at cutting Planned Parenthood out of smaller government programs, such as HIV and AIDS testing, she said.\n\nTexas\u2019 decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from family planning programs resulted in over 30 percent fewer claims for long-acting and injectable contraceptives among low-income patients using the Women\u2019s Health Program, according to a study published in February in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study found claims for short-term hormonal contraceptives did not significantly change.\n\nTexas Republicans have called that study misleading.\n\nOther than Texas and Missouri, Felts said Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t aware of any other state declining federal Medicaid funds for women\u2019s health programs.\n\nThe $27 billion budget goes into effect July 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Missouri lawmakers passed a budget last week that spends millions in state money to block Planned Parenthood from accessing federal funding.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/24/state-pays-millions-to-bar-medicaid-from-planned-p/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Missouri lawmakers passed a budget last week that spends millions in state money to block Planned Parenthood from accessing federal funding.", "title": "State pays millions to bar Medicaid from Planned Parenthood"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Missouri lawmakers passed a budget last week that spends millions in state money to block Planned Parenthood from accessing federal funding.", "card": "summary", "title": "State pays millions to bar Medicaid from Planned Parenthood"}, "Author": "ADAM ATON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "When lawmakers initially proposed blocking Medicaid payments from Planned Parenthood in March, budget staffers estimated less than $400,000 in Medicaid payments go to Missouri\u2019s 13 Planned Parenthood clinics for procedures and drugs.\n(AP) - Missouri lawmakers passed a budget last week that spends millions in state money to block Planned Parenthood from accessing federal funding.\nOther than Texas and Missouri, Felts said Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t aware of any other state declining federal Medicaid funds for women\u2019s health programs.\n\u201cIf someone wants to go to Planned Parenthood, they\u2019re free to do that,\u201d he said.\nThe federal government says states don\u2019t have the authority to steer Medicaid funding away from Planned Parenthood, and courts have blocked some of those efforts."}
