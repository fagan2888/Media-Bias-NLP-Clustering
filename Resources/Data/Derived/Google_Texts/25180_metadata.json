She has gone to prison twice, for drug trafficking and drunken driving.\n\nBut obtaining her prescribed medications is a constant struggle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried now that I got a doctor, I can\u2019t afford my meds,\u201d said Richardson, who has no permanent address. \u201cNow they want to put me on another mood stabilizer, because I worry.\u201d\n\nDespite the wake-up call sounded nationwide by recent mass shootings, huge gaps remain in how Wisconsin treats people with mental illnesses who run afoul of the law. State and county officials blame a shortage of psychiatrists, growing demand for services and high medication costs.\n\nAbout a third of the men and two-thirds of the women in Wisconsin prisons have mental health conditions, according to a 2012 state prison report. Of the approximately 21,700 prisoners in the state system, more than 5,000 are taking medications to treat mental illnesses.\n\nState prison inmates are generally released with two weeks of pills and a four-week prescription. County jail inmates often get less than that, as little as three days of pills. They may run out before they get through the wait lists for county mental health services.\n\nJule Cavanaugh, reentry director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, acknowledges that many inmates with mental illnesses are not getting sufficient post-incarceration care.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they need psychiatric care in the community and access to medications,\u201d Cavanaugh said. \u201cWithout being stable, it\u2019s very difficult for them\u201d to address their criminal histories and tendencies.\n\nKeisha Russell, founder of Infallible Helping Hands in Milwaukee, an advocacy group that aids female offenders, said newly released inmates must jump through numerous hoops and may prioritize food and shelter over refilling their psychiatric medications.\n\n\u201cA lot of times (offenders) end up going back to get drugs, and end up re-offending,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle that keeps going and going.\u201d\n\nMissed opportunities\n\nFour years ago, a state Legislative Audit Bureau report concluded that \u201crecidivism may be reduced by improved management of mental illnesses and continued emphasis on release planning.\u201d But advocates for people with mental illnesses say re-entry services remain inadequate.\n\n\u201cWhen they leave here, most people don\u2019t have insurance. Most people don\u2019t have a doctor,\u201d said Dan Barth, a social worker at the Portage County Jail. They may struggle to prioritize mental health needs and \u201crekindle an interest in drugs and alcohol\u201d on release.\n\n\u201cTo keep them properly medicated is really a challenge,\u201d said Barth, who helps get inmates on waiting lists for county mental health services before their release. \u201cIf we haven\u2019t connected with a psychiatrist, got on that waiting list, that\u2019s where there can be a problem.\u201d\n\nBarth said county mental health services in and out of jail \u201chave shrunk because of fiscal pressure.\u201d The wait lists in some counties, including Dane, can extend for months.\n\nKristin Kerschensteiner, managing attorney for Disability Rights Wisconsin, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the state\u2019s pool of psychiatrists is already small, and a significant portion do not accept patients on BadgerCare, the state\u2019s Medical Assistance program, because of low reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cIt all comes back to the dollar,\u201d she said, referring to psychiatrists. \u201cIf you got the money, they got the time.\u201d\n\nKerschensteiner said ex-prison inmates have a better shot at getting mental health resources than those exiting county jails.\n\nOnly a few of the state\u2019s county jails, Barth said, have someone like him working to help former inmates find services.\n\nMina and Tony Esser of Madison said their 22-year-old son, who has been repeatedly jailed for charges including theft and drug possession, always struggles to get connected with services. He suffers from depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\u201cEvery time he\u2019s released, he\u2019s just in survival mode,\u201d Mina Esser said.\n\n\u201cIt was easier to get street (drugs) than go to a doctor,\u201d Tony Esser added.\n\nGetting the treatment\n\nDr. Kevin Kallas, mental health director for the state Department of Corrections, said the state tries to bridge the gap between prison and the community. For instance, the Milwaukee region\u2019s Community Corrections office employs a psychiatrist and the Dane County region contracts with a psychiatrist.\n\nAccording to Kallas, \u201cevery state struggles with this as an issue\u201d and few if any states offer more than a month of medication in hand to released inmates.\n\nKallas and Cavanaugh, the DOC\u2019s reentry director, agree that Wisconsin needs more mental health resources in the community.\n\nFollowing the 2009 Legislative Audit Bureau report on the advantages of treating inmate mental illnesses, the Legislature created the Becky Young Community Corrections Recidivism Reduction Plan. This $10 million annual appropriation helps medium and high-risk offenders with significant mental illnesses transition back to their communities.\n\nOne initiative, Opening Avenues to Reentry Success, began in the Fox Valley and southeast Wisconsin in 2010. OARS seeks to connect individuals with housing, employment and psychiatric resources. In 2011 the estimated cost was $15,000 a year per person, compared to $32,000 for incarceration.\n\nAnd Green Lake County is using a grant from the Becky Young fund to improve the mental health treatment of county jail inmates.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create a milieu that facilitates recovery,\u201d said Philip Robinson, the county\u2019s deputy director for health and human services.\n\n\u2018Right now I can focus\u2019\n\nBonnie Richardson\u2019s last offense, in January 2011, was for drunken driving. She was released in April 2012 after spending time in Taycheedah Correctional Institution and the Dane County Jail. She is homeless and moves from house to house among friends and the elderly clients she cleans for.\n\nRichardson, who used to be treated for bipolar disorder, is now seen at the Shalom Holistic Health Services in Stoughton for attention deficit disorder and anxiety. She fidgets and seems slightly agitated as she shares her experiences in an interview.\n\nRichardson is optimistic that her situation may improve under the Affordable Care Act, which will allow her to obtain health insurance.\n\n\u201cRight now I can focus, but it was really bad when I first got out,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI was just setting myself up for a failure again, because of mental health.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism (www.WisconsinWatch.org) collaborates with Wisconsin Public Radio, Wisconsin Public Television, other news media and the UW-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication.\n\nAll works created, published, posted or disseminated by the Center do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of UW-Madison or any of its affiliates.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Hometown News LLC", "description": "For Bonnie Richardson, taking her medication is an important part of staying out of trouble.", "title": "Mentally ill ex-inmates lack treatment, medication", "url": "http://www.hngnews.com/waterloo_marshall/news/article_83a933b0-787d-11e3-aacf-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 420, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hngnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/06/c0640db6-787d-11e3-a13b-0019bb30f31a/52cd75ee4994b.preview-500.jpg?resize=420%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "For Bonnie Richardson, taking her medication is an important part of staying out of trouble.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "mentally ill,ex-inmates,news,regional", "google-site-verification": "b5DWcQyZo6r6p_nbm7JxnBBpvsgvDVW9i1lP4_VFXhM", "news_keywords": "mentally ill,ex-inmates,news,regional"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0c8\"", "article_summary": "They may run out before they get through the wait lists for county mental health services.\nAnd Green Lake County is using a grant from the Becky Young fund to improve the mental health treatment of county jail inmates.\nCounty jail inmates often get less than that, as little as three days of pills.\nThis $10 million annual appropriation helps medium and high-risk offenders with significant mental illnesses transition back to their communities.\nThey may struggle to prioritize mental health needs and \u201crekindle an interest in drugs and alcohol\u201d on release."}
