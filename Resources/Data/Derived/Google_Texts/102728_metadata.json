John Cornyn says fellow Texan Ted Cruz had a specific goal in mind when he was elected to the Senate: Running for president.\n\nIn an interview with KERA this week, Cornyn said that\u2019s why they have different political styles, despite having similar conservative goals. As the Senate\u2019s No. 2 leader, Cornyn falls in line with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to carry out broader party initiatives. Cruz, however, famously drew the ire of many Republicans when he helped instigate a government shutdown to try to block Obamacare.\n\n\u201cClearly, he didn\u2019t come here to remain in the Senate. He came here to run for president,\u201d Cornyn said, according to the report. \u201c\u2026That perhaps explains the difference in tactics.\u201d\n\nThe comments are uncharacteristically blunt for the pragmatic three-term senator.\n\nCornyn rarely criticizes his Texas colleague, despite Cruz having called McConnell a liar \u2014 a breach of Senate etiquette \u2014 and lambasting establishment leaders as weak.\n\nCornyn told KERA radio in Dallas that the men have a \u201cgood working relationship\u201d and that they agree on issues of \u201csubstance.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy goal has always been to figure out, how we can advance the conservative cause, even incrementally at times,\u201d Cornyn said, according to KERA. \u201c\u2026He\u2019s taken a more immediate, shorter-term view of things.\u201d\n\nCornyn has yet to endorse a Republican candidate for president, saying repeatedly this cycle that he plans to support whoever emerges from the national convention this July as the nominee. This week, he again said that Cruz hasn\u2019t asked for his support, either.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC9zZW4tY29ybnluLXRlZC1jcnV6LXdlbnQtdG8td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi10by1ydW4tZm9yLXByZXNpZGVudC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Katie Leslie", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Sen.
