Bocce to booms at Festa Italiana

Whether your approach to ethnic culture is participatory, gustatory or auditory, Festa Italiana has you covered.

Play bocce with friends young and old (then watch the champs compete in a tournament Sunday). Watch cooking demonstrations and sample cuisine at the Cucina Showcase. Enjoy Henry Prego's musical tribute to Frank Sinatra and Dove c'è Musica's salute to Eros Ramazzotti daily.

Grab an espresso so you're wide-eyed for a Festa tradition: fireworks at 10:15 p.m. Friday and Sunday, 10 p.m. Saturday.

Festa takes place 11:30 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday at Maier Festival Park. Gates open at 10:15 a.m. Sunday for Mass, which begins at 11 a.m. in the Marcus Amphitheater. Mass attendees are encouraged to bring nonperishable food items for Hunger Task Force.

Advance tickets are $10 through Thursday at festaitaliana.com. At the gate, admission is $13, with children 12 and under admitted free when accompanied by an adult. Visit the festival's website for info on discount promotions.
