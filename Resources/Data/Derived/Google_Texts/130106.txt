MURFREESBORO — The staff for U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais touted how their polling last week showed that 61 percent of 400 Republican voters support his job performance.

"These numbers are really good," said Richard Vaughn, the chief of staff for the Republican congressman from South Pittsburg. "If I was against Scott DesJarlais, I'd be very demoralized. I'm willing to predict that the 4th District is going to re-elect Scott DesJarlais and reject a candidate who just moved to the 4th District."

DesJarlais hired pollster Rob Autry, president of Meeting Street Research, to conduct the survey three months before the Aug. 4 primary, and the poll of 200 males and 200 females has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points, Vaughn said.

The survey also shows that Republican challenger Grant Starrett only had support from 8 percent of those surveyed while the other GOP candidates had less, Vaughn said.

The others who qualified to run as Republicans are Doc Fapas and Erran Persley. Democrat Steven Reynolds also qualified to run for the 4th Congressional seat and would face the GOP nominee in the Nov. 8 general election.

Starrett campaign manager Tommy Schultz also boasted about the results of a recent poll they conducted.

"And the results we found weren't quite as happy for Congressman DesJarlais," Schultz said. "Our polling predicts astatistical dead heat between Grant Starrett and Scott DesJarlais in August."

Schultz said that 60 percent "of our 401 Republican primary voters are angry about DesJarlais' vote for $700 billion in food stamps."

"But Grant Starrett is not just content with an outside firm calling a few hundred people," Schultz said. "Our campaign talks to a few thousand people every week at their doors. We've recently recorded over 13,000 conversations and found Scott DesJarlais enthusiasm to be in the single digits. In contrast more people are signing pledges to vote for Grant Starrett every single day, and we're going to keep on fighting to earn every vote until Aug. 4."

Starrett grew up in California and came to Tennessee to attend law school at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He moved to Murfreesboro after becoming a lawyer and announced his candidacy for Congress in spring 2015.

DesJarlais grew up in South Dakota before he moved to Tennessee. He was working as a physician in Jasper, Tenn., when he won his congressional seat in the 2010 election at a time when many of his patients and voters were upset with "Obamacare," Vaughn said.

"Scott ran for office because of Barack Obama," said Vaughn, who noted that 94 percent of those polled said the country is on the wrong track.

Vaughn also noted that those surveyed like DesJarlais, despite 64 percent of them disapproving of Congress.

The survey showed that 86 percent of those polled know about DesJarlais, with 61 percent having a favorable impression and 25 percent unfavorable, Vaughn said.

"That's the highest rating he's had since he became a candidate for Congress in 2010," Vaughn said. "He's solidified his support."

Starrett only had 11 percent of those polled recognizing him, with 6 percent being favorable and 5 percent unfavorable, Vaughn added.

The DesJarlais poll does show the incumbent in a strong position, said Kent Syler, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University.

"That’s a strong favorable rating," said Syler, who served for 26 years as the Tennessee chief of staff for former Democratic U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon of Murfreesboro. "You typically want your favorable to be twice as high as your unfavorable. Congressman DesJarlais' numbers accomplished that with room to spare."

When it comes to Starrett, he may be unknown at this point in the campaign, but his name recognition should improve once he begins advertising, Syler said.

"Nevertheless, Congressman DesJarlais' favorability and numbers in the head to head are a strong place to start," Syler said.
