CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WTVR) -- East of Central Virginia, a group of women are gathering to make dresses for girls in need.

For the second year in a row, women from Community Church in Chesapeake are teaming up to make more than 100 dresses from pillowcases. Dresses will be distributed to underprivileged girls as far as the Philippines and Haiti.

"pillow cases we just toss and throw away are such a delight to them"

The church plans to continue their mission by having a monthly sewing meeting, where the group will make additional clothing items for the needy.
