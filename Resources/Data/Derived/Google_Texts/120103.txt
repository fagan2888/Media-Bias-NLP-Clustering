MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — A Somalia government spokesman says that CCTV video footage at Mogadishu airport shows two men handing what looks like a laptop computer to the suspected suicide bomber after he passed through the security checkpoint.

Spokesman Abdisalam Atto said at least one of the men delivering the laptop was an airport employee and that 20 people, including airport employees and others, have been arrested.

The man who received the laptop is the suspected suicide bomber who was blown from the Daallo Airlines jet creating a gaping hole in the fuselage and forcing the plane to make an emergency landing back at the Mogadishu airport. It is believed the laptop-like device was the bomb that caused the explosion. The plane’s pilot said that if the explosion happened when the aircraft was at a higher altitude it could have caused the jet to crash.
