PARK CITY, Utah (AP) - Though Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult remain quiet about the status of their relationship, the actor says he couldn’t be prouder of the Oscar winner.

The couple co-starred together in “X-Men: First Class” and will be in the sequel as well. Hoult was on hand when Lawrence, last year’s best-actress winner at the Academy Awards, won best supporting actress at the Golden Globes last weekend.

“She deserves it all,” Hoult said Saturday of Lawrence, who is nominated for another Oscar this year. “It’s fun to watch.”

Hoult has been having his own fun at the Sundance Film Festival; it’s the actor’s first time at the event. He’s promoting his movie “Young Ones,” which also stars Elle Fanning and is directed by Jake Paltrow, Gwyneth’s brother. On Friday, Hoult attended the premiere of the drama “Camp X-Ray.” The film stars Kristen Stewart, who will star with Hoult in Drake Doremus’ upcoming fantasy love story “Equals.”

Hoult said Lawrence read the “Equals” script with him.

“We both loved the script. It’s epic in proportion, but centered on these specific relationships,” he said.

“Young Ones” premieres at Sundance on Saturday.
