They\u2019re the people who were happy with their health insurance and their doctors and are now losing at least one of them. Now they\u2019re mad as hell and they\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening right now is exhibited through the above 37-year-old film clip.\n\nPeter Finch was posthumously awarded best actor at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for his portrayal of somewhat-crazed TV news anchor Howard Beale in the 1976 movie, \u201cNetwork.\u201d\n\nAbove was the film\u2019s most memorable scene, and probably what sealed the deal for Finch\u2019s well-deserved accolades. It\u2019s usually referred to as the \u201cmad as hell\u201d scene.\n\nForget about the HealthCare.gov website debacle. That\u2019ll get ironed out sooner or later in the only way government knows \u2014 by throwing more money at it. It\u2019s the dropping of the second shoe that\u2019s going to have the lasting effects \u2014 loss of coverage and sticker shock on new policies.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing now began with the big lie: \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan \u2014 period,\u201d followed by, \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor \u2014 period.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times tried to pawn those promises off as presidential misstatements, but as talk radio host and conservative pundit Dana Loesch asked in a tweet, \u201cCan teleprompters misspeak?\u201d To that, I would only add, can it misspeak at least 36 times?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a little lie about a dalliance with an addle-brained White House intern. This is a great big lie.\n\nThis is a lie that concerns a government take-over of one-sixth of the U.S. economy. This is a lie about millions of Americans losing health plans that they\u2019ve been happy with, and physicians they trust and rely on.\n\nAfter their disbelief is replaced by acceptance and the newly-booted policyholders start shopping around on the HealthCare.gov exchange, the sticker shock will set in.\n\nWhat happened to the \u201caffordable\u201d in the Affordable Care Act?\n\nEconomist and author Thomas Sowell answered that question in a Townhall column.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that people who think we cannot afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, and medication somehow think that we can afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, medication and a government bureaucracy to administer it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute released its findings that premiums under Obamacare will increase by an average of 41 percent in its 49-state analysis, as reported by Forbes.\n\nMeanwhile, consumers are being hit at the worst of times. In the five-year economic doldrums, real household income is down, while inflation marches on and taxes have risen.\n\nThese elements are now coming together to create the perfect storm of political change. Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer predicted that if Obamacare fails, it could set liberalism back a decade. And it\u2019s failing \u2014 big time.\n\nBack to that \u201cNetwork\u201d film clip: Think of the people shouting out of their windows as the newly-booted policyholders.\n\nPresident Obama set out to fundamentally transform the United States of America. Instead, it\u2019s possible he singlehandedly created a whole new bloc of voters that are mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore.\n\n[poll id=\u201d135\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Share Tweet The Affordable Care Act is creating a brand new bloc of voters who will be a powerful voice in 2014 and probably beyond.
