As Republicans continued to saber-rattle about shutting down the government in protest of Obamacare, Jon Stewart called them out for wanting a program that would provide health insurance to millions of Americans to fail.

After first taking a look at their ludicrous new ad campaign , featuring Uncle Sam readying to give an unnecessary rectal exam to one of the unfortunate beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, Stewart responded to Ted Cruz's claim that Obamacare would create an "addiction" to the "sugar:"

"But the sugar in your metaphor is, in this case, health insurance. Something that can literally battle the affects of too much sugar.... I don't understand any of this. You're protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that, once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without. You only win if the program fails. Obamacare is your 'Springtime for Hitler.'"
