Everyone sort of fled quietly the next morning, hoping not to see each other for a very, very long time after what all agreed was a regrettable moment. But because the American holiday calendar is weird, you \u2014 at least you Christians and various other non-religious people who nevertheless enjoy trading consumer goods wrapped in decorated paper with relatives \u2014 may be gathering once again with your extended family only a few weeks later.\n\nSay you\u2019re sitting around the tree on Christmas morning and opening presents. You mostly give people gift cards of varying denominations, depending on familial proximity, because what the hell is Christmas presents between adults even about? It\u2019s a mandatory cash transfer among family members, so you figure you might as well give the closest thing there is to cash without it being actual cash, even though that would be better, if people just took out their wallets and exchanged equal amounts of cash, to show off the absurdity of it all \u2026\n\n\u2026 So anyway, you give your uncle his $25 iTunes gift card. You hope that he will give you a $25 iTunes gift card in return, the equivalent of neither of you giving each other anything but instead shaking hands and pledging to spend $25 on the iTunes store, because it\u2019s sort of funny when you think about it like that.\n\nBut nope, the gift you\u2019re getting isn\u2019t a slender parcel of about 10 square inches. It\u2019s has the width and length of a book and the depth of one really long book. Is your uncle giving you \u201cWar and Peace\u201d? Peculiar choice, but OK, been meaning to get around to that at some point. You start unwrapping. Oh wow, it\u2019s several books \u2014 quite the expenditure. It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s \u2026 a Bill O\u2019Reilly book bundle! \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d \u201cKilling Lincoln,\u201d \u201cKilling Kennedy\u201d and a second copy of \u201cKilling Jesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne for you to give out to one of your commie friends,\u201d he says, chuckling.\n\nWhat an elaborate way for him to imply that he wants to continue talking about politics at this family gathering. Ugh, just get it over with \u2026\n\nSo now Osama bin Bama\u2019s making kissy with the Castro brothers, the Cuban Communists. You see him surrendering to the Communists? He\u2019d love to turn us Communist; he already has.\n\nHe reestablished diplomatic relations with an island country 90 miles miles away, although he can\u2019t fully end the embargo without congressional sign-off. Since the embargo has been in place for over 50 years and the Castro regime hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, maybe it\u2019s time to admit that the policy was a failure and try something else? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s been much of a pawn in the global chess match since the end of the Cold War. Plenty of presidents have only kept the embargo in place because they were worried about losing Florida\u2019s electoral votes, but attitudes in the Florida exile community aren\u2019t what they used to be. It was a policy continued out of nothing more than its own inertia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Your right-wing uncle is all excited to talk about politics this Christmas.
