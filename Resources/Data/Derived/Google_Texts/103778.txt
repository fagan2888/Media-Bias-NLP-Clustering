Donald Trump is vowing he will win Florida as campaigning intensifies little more than a week before the state's presidential primary March 15th. The GOP front runner spoke Saturday during a raucous rally at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.

Trump spoke for more than an hour before thousands of supporters.

"If we win Florida believe me it's over", declared Trump. "If we win. And we're going to win, and you're going to have a great president, and you're going to have a great country again."

The crowd cheered as Trump paused every few sentences for the latest protester to be ejected.

As president Trump promised to come down hard on terrorists and illegal immigrants, end Obamacare and Common Core and shrink the nation's multi-trillion-dollar debt.
