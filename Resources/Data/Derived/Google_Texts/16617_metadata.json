I have no idea. But as this column went to press, practically the whole Republican establishment was pleading with Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to become speaker. He is, everyone says, the only man who can save the day.\n\nWhat makes Mr. Ryan so special? The answer, basically, is that he\u2019s the best con man they\u2019ve got. His success in hoodwinking the news media and self-proclaimed centrists in general is the basis of his stature within his party. Unfortunately, at least from his point of view, it would be hard to sustain the con game from the speaker\u2019s chair.\n\nTo understand Mr. Ryan\u2019s role in our political-media ecosystem, you need to know two things. First, the modern Republican Party is a post-policy enterprise, which doesn\u2019t do real solutions to real problems. Second, pundits and the news media really, really don\u2019t want to face up to that awkward reality.\n\nOn the first point, just look at the policy ideas coming from the presidential candidates, even establishment favorites like Marco Rubio, the most likely nominee given Jeb Bush\u2019s fatal lack of charisma. The Times\u2019s Josh Barro has dubbed Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax proposal the \u201cpuppies and rainbows\u201d plan, consisting of trillions in giveaways with not a hint of how to pay for them \u2014 just the assertion that growth would somehow make it all good.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just taxes, it\u2019s everything. For example, Republicans have been promising to offer an alternative to Obamacare ever since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, but have yet to produce anything resembling an actual health plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet most of the news media, and most pundits, still worship at the church of \u201cbalance.\u201d They are committed to portraying the two big parties as equally reasonable. This creates a powerful demand for serious, honest Republicans who can be held up as proof that the party does too include reasonable people making useful proposals. As Slate\u2019s William Saletan, who enthusiastically touted Mr. Ryan but eventually became disillusioned, wrote: \u201cI was looking for Mr. Right \u2014 a fact-based, sensible fiscal conservative.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul Ryan played and in many ways still plays that role, but only on TV, not in real life. The truth is that his budget proposals have always been a ludicrous mess of magic asterisks: assertions that trillions will be saved through spending cuts to be specified later, that trillions more will be raised by closing unnamed tax loopholes. Or as the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center put it, they\u2019re full of \u201cmystery meat.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been very good at gaming the system, at producing glossy documents that look sophisticated if you don\u2019t understand the issues, at creating the false impression that his plans have been vetted by budget experts. This has been enough to convince political writers who don\u2019t know much about policy, but do know what they want to see, that he\u2019s the real deal. (A number of reporters are deeply impressed by the fact that he uses PowerPoint.) He is to fiscal policy what Carly Fiorina was to corporate management: brilliant at self-promotion, hopeless at actually doing the job. But his act has been good enough for media work.\n\nHis position within the party, in turn, rests mainly on this outside perception. Mr. Ryan is certainly a hard-line, Ayn Rand-loving and progressive-tax-hating conservative, but no more so than many of his colleagues. If you look at what the people who see him as a savior are saying, they aren\u2019t talking about his following within the party, which isn\u2019t especially passionate. They\u2019re talking, instead, about his perceived outside credibility, his status as someone who can stand up to smarty-pants liberals \u2014 someone who won\u2019t, says MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, be intimidated by \u201cnegative articles in The New York Times opinions page.\u201d (Who knew we had such power?)\n\nWhich brings us back to the awkward fact that Mr. Ryan isn\u2019t actually a pillar of fiscal rectitude, or anything like the budget expert he pretends to be. And the perception that he is these things is fragile, not likely to survive long if he were to move into the center of political rough and tumble. Indeed, his halo was visibly fraying during the few months of 2012 that he was Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. A few months as speaker would probably complete the process, and end up being a career-killer.\n\nPredictions aside, however, the Ryan phenomenon tells us a lot about what\u2019s really happening in American politics. In brief, crazies have taken over the Republican Party, but the media don\u2019t want to recognize this reality. The combination of these two facts has created an opportunity, indeed a need, for political con men. And Mr. Ryan has risen to the challenge.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151012032104, "twitter": {"description": "The media haven\u2019t recognized what has happened to the Republican Party, and that\u2019s where Paul Ryan sees his opportunity to shine.", "title": "The Crazies and the Con Man", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/opinion/the-crazies-and-the-con-man.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003969357"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/opinion/the-crazies-and-the-con-man.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003969357", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/opinion/the-crazies-and-the-con-man.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The Crazies and the Con Man", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 12, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Ryan  Paul D Jr,United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Republican Party", "CN": "paul-krugman", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Ryan, Paul D Jr", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The media haven\u2019t recognized what has happened to the Republican Party, and that\u2019s where Paul Ryan sees his opportunity to shine.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "The media haven\u2019t recognized what has happened to the Republican Party, and that\u2019s where Paul Ryan sees his opportunity to shine.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 12, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Republican Party", "published": "2015-10-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "12krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160104000001, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/opinion/the-crazies-and-the-con-man.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The media haven\u2019t recognized what has happened to the Republican Party, and that\u2019s where Paul Ryan sees his opportunity to shine.", "title": "The Crazies and the Con Man"}, "pdate": 20151012, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003969357, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Crazies and the Con Man", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17a2\"", "article_summary": "In brief, crazies have taken over the Republican Party, but the media don\u2019t want to recognize this reality.\nAs Slate\u2019s William Saletan, who enthusiastically touted Mr. Ryan but eventually became disillusioned, wrote: \u201cI was looking for Mr.\nMr. Ryan is certainly a hard-line, Ayn Rand-loving and progressive-tax-hating conservative, but no more so than many of his colleagues.\nHow will the chaos that the crazies, I mean the Freedom Caucus, have wrought in the House get resolved?\nFirst, the modern Republican Party is a post-policy enterprise, which doesn\u2019t do real solutions to real problems."}
