The deficit has been \u201ccut by more than half since 2009,\u201d a 2013 blog post by the White House Office of Management and Budget declared, pointing to the shrinking of the deficit as a percentage of the economy. The budget office trotted out the same line last week. \u201cUnder the President\u2019s leadership, the deficit has been cut by more than half as a share of the economy, representing the most rapid sustained deficit reduction since World War II, and it continues to fall,\u201d an OMB official said. The president himself has downplayed the deficit problem, saying last year, \u201cWe don't have an urgent deficit crisis. The only crisis we have is one that's manufactured in Washington, and it's ideological.\u201d\n\nIt is unquestionably true that, judged relative to overall size of the economy, the deficit\u2014the annual gap between federal spending and revenue\u2014is down significantly since 2009.\n\nBut when thinking about the burden of debt and deficits on our economy, now and in the future, that\u2019s not the only factor to consider. Yes, annual deficits are down since 2009, but in no small part because the deficit that year\u2014which was not exclusively Obama\u2019s doing\u2014came in at a record-breaking $1.4 trillion. Deficits in subsequent years came in over $1 trillion as well. Deficits have dropped significantly under Obama only because they were unusually elevated during his first years in office.\n\nMeanwhile, even out reduced annual deficits are still adding to the sky-high federal debt. They\u2019re just adding somewhat less each year to the total federal tab.\n\nWhat that means is that, even if the budget picture isn\u2019t as gloomy at this very moment, the longer-term debt problem remains. As the Congressional Budget Office notes in a report today on the long-term budget outlook:\n\nIf current laws remained generally unchanged in the future, federal debt held by the public would decline slightly relative to GDP over the next few years, CBO projects. After that, however, growing budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high level. Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by the public would exceed 100 percent of GDP, CBO projects. Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative to the size of the economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely. Via the CBO, here\u2019s what that looks like:\n\nAnd here are the major spending components driving the long-term rise in debt:\n\nThe health care component is the most talked about. That\u2019s part of what President Obama was getting at when he argued that there\u2019s no \u201curgent deficit crisis.\u201d Instead, he said, the nation has \u201ca long-term problem has to do with our health care programs.\u201d Even with some recent downward revisions, they are still the biggest part of the problem. But what gets less attention is that the growing role of interest. We\u2019re set to pay more and more on our debt\u2014just to keep carrying ever-larger amounts of debt. Whether or not that's an urgent crisis, it's one that our current budget path doesn't address.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In the past year or so, the White House has become increasingly aggressive in touting President Obama\u2019s achievements in reducing the deficit.
