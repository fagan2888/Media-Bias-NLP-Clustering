Many of us have assumed that as long as you eat about 2,000 calories per day, it doesn\u2019t always matter what you eat.\n\nBut researchers are now discovering that obesity isn\u2019t always caused by a large intake of calories; rather, it has a lot to do with \u201cmetabolically disruptive\u201d foods, according to a new study review published in Public Health Nutrition. The review, led by cardiovascular research scientist James DiNicolantonio of St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, argues that keeping count of calories is useless when you\u2019re not paying attention to the metabolic effects of certain foods, like simple carbohydrates and sugars.\n\n\u201cEvery country around the world is having a problem with obesity, and so far nothing has worked,\u201d DiNicolantonio told the Huffington Post. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re not dying of obesity, we\u2019re dying of chronic metabolic disease.\u201d\n\nNot All Calories Are Created Equal\n\nDiNicolantonio says that the prevailing ideas regarding diets is that \"a calorie is a calorie,\" and that it doesn\u2019t matter what you eat as long as you don\u2019t eat too much of it. But this isn\u2019t always true, he argues, calories are not all equivalent. Calories from sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, potatoes, white rice, cereal, and anything made from white flour affect the body differently than calories from vegetables or whole grains. They spike blood sugar and cause insulin levels to rise, then drop blood sugar again and trigger more carb cravings in the person. This ultimately creates a \u201cloop for overconsumption,\u201d DiNicolantonio said.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that some calories will squelch a person\u2019s appetite and promote energy utilization, while others will promote hunger and energy storage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while some calories send messages to the brain and body that say 'I\u2019m full and ready to move,\u2019 other calories send messages that say \u2018I\u2019m still hungry and just want to lie down on the couch.\u2019 Not all calories are the same, and in order to promote healthy weight and better health, we need to take special note of the calories we are choosing to consume.\u201d\n\nMetabolic Health\n\nThe important thing, then, is to focus on your metabolic health and the metabolic healthiness of the foods you eat instead of the amount of calories, DiNicolatonio said. Or, in other words, to switch your \u201ccalorie-focused thinking\u201d to \u201cmore-nuanced thinking.\u201d If this were the case, you\u2019d be consuming fewer fruit juices, breads, pastas, cereals, and even low-fat dairy items like sugary yogurts (which might seem calorie-sensible), while embracing some calorie-rich but metabolically healthy foods like nuts and nut butters, avocados, olives, and whole-dairy products.\n\nMetabolic syndrome, or chronic metabolic disease, refers to a group of risk factors that can cause a higher risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and other health issues, according to the National Institutes of Health. The risk factors include a large waistline or abdominal obesity, a high triglyceride level (a type of fat in the blood), a low HDL cholesterol level (the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol), high blood pressure, and high fasting blood sugar.\n\nInterestingly, there are some obese people who are considered fit and metabolically healthy, and who don\u2019t have any of these risk factors. In a study published in the European Heart Journal in 2012, researchers found that obese and overweight people who were deemed metabolically healthy were no more likely to develop chronic disorders like diabetes and high cholesterol than skinny but unfit people. \u201cIt is well known that obesity is linked to a large number of chronic disease such as cardiovascular problems and cancer,\u201d said Dr. Francisco Ortega, an author of the 2012 study, in a press release. \u201cHowever, there appears to be a subset of obese people who seem to be protected from obesity-related metabolic complications. They may have greater cardio-respiratory fitness than other obese individuals, but, until now, it was not known the extent to which these metabolically healthy but obese people are at lower risk of diseases or premature death.\u201d It\u2019s possible that these obese-yet-fit people focus more on calorie-rich, healthier foods.\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that not all calorie sources have equivalent effects in the body is crucial, and the \u2018calorie is a calorie\u2019 theory actually prevents this,\u201d Tulane University nutrition professor Lydia Bazzno told HuffPost. \u201cThese macro-nutrients, carbohydrates, fats, and protein go down different metabolic pathways in our bodies and produce different feelings, trigger different hormones and cellular messengers, producing different outcomes in terms of weight and disease risk.\u201d\n\nSo, before you fill your shopping cart with low-fat, empty-calorie items, think smart and perhaps a bit \u201cmore nuanced\u201d about your metabolism.\n\nSource: Lucan S, DiNicolantonio J.
