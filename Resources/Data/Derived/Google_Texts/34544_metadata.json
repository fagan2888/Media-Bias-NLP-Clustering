Eichler (pictured) focuses on investments in digital health and medical device companies, and he currently is the board chair of Gamma Medica and Caregiver Services.\n\nAmong the themes that emerged in our e-mail exchange: more health IT companies are starting to have positive, measurable impact on healthcare quality; investors are returning to medtech after a post-recession drop-off; and it\u2019s often harder and takes longer to build a \u201cunicorn\u201d startup in digital health than some other sectors, Eichler says.\n\nThe following is a transcript of our conversation, edited for style and length.\n\nXconomy: What\u2019s your boldest prediction for healthcare investments in 2016?\n\nDavid Eichler: Digital health will emerge as the top performer across the venture investment landscape. Today, healthcare companies account for only around 7 percent of the total number of private companies valued at $1 billion and greater. Most of these are in the biotechnology or molecular diagnostics sectors. Next year, health IT companies will catch up and account for nearly a quarter of the newly minted \u201cunicorns\u201d in 2016.\n\nIn the past five years, more than $13 billion has been invested in venture-stage digital health companies (according to the most recent data from Rock Health); 247 companies raised over $4 billion just this year alone. Most of this activity has been in seed or Series A rounds. However, the best of these new digital health companies are starting to emerge as legitimate growth equity opportunities pursuing very large addressable markets.\n\nHealthcare has stubbornly remained decades behind other industries when it comes to the adoption of modern information technologies. This new wave of innovation is finally driving large-scale transformation of the $3 trillion healthcare economy. The current generation of digital health companies leading this disruption will raise the capital necessary to stay independent and privately held for longer in pursuit of valuations well above the magic $1 billion threshold.\n\nX: Fewer dollars were funneled into medical devices and diagnostics in the years following the recession. Do you see that starting to change, and why?\n\nDE: Yes, I do see a change happening now. Venture capital activity in the medical device and equipment sector fell nearly 40 percent from its peak in 2008. The recession certainly played a role generally, but cost and reimbursement pressure on hospitals\u2014and the uncertainty created by Obamacare\u2014contributed to the lack of investment in medtech companies. The pendulum has begun to swing back a bit over the past couple of years.\n\nToday we are seeing more activity and larger financing rounds being done in this sector. But this renewed interest is aimed at medtech opportunities that are characterized by commercial and execution risk, as opposed to the achievement of key development, regulatory, and reimbursement milestones. And from a valuation standpoint, it\u2019s definitely been a buyer\u2019s market for these companies that still need growth capital, but have not yet reached a stage where they can go public or strategic acquirers start to emerge.\n\nAlso, today\u2019s medtech entrepreneurs by and large are focused on game-changing technologies that deliver real value to \u2026 Next Page \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Xconomy", "description": "As 2015 winds down, it\u2019s a good time to look into the crystal ball for one of the toughest industries to predict: healthcare.
