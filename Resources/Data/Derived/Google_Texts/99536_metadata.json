Whether this was a long time coming was the least of her cares.\n\nThe biggest star in women\u2019s golf had her name on the biggest trophy.\n\nShe never looked happier.\n\n\u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t even think straight,\u201d Wie said Sunday after a two-shot victory over Stacy Lewis to claim her first major.\n\nThe final three holes at Pinehurst No. 2 were filled with ups and downs that Wie knows as well as anyone in golf. She responded with a performance worthy of the hype that had been heaped on her since she was a teenager.\n\nWith a three-shot lead on the 16th hole, Wie nearly threw it all away with one poor decision, only keeping the lead by making a nervy 5-foot putt for double bogey. And right when it looked as though this would end badly, the 24-year-old from Hawaii responded with the putt of her life that made her a Women\u2019s Open champion.\n\nFacing a 25-foot birdie putt on 17 that was fast and dangerous, Wie pumped her fist when it fell, then pounded her fist twice to celebrate the moment.\n\n\u201cThat kind of emotion, that kind of pressure \u2026 I\u2019ll think of that putt as one of the best putts I\u2019ve ever hit in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nA par on the 18th gave her an even-par 70 to beat Lewis, the No. 1 player in women\u2019s golf who made Wie earn it. Lewis made eight birdies \u2014 the most in a final round by a male for female in the U.S. Open \u2014 and closed with a 66.\n\nLewis was on the range preparing for a playoff when her caddie told her Wie made birdie on the 17th. Moments later, Lewis was on the 18th green to hug Wie. Like most players, she was perplexed why Wie would spend so much time trying to compete against the men when she still didn\u2019t have an LPGA Tour card.\n\nThey are friends now and practice frequently. Lewis said she wasn\u2019t the last bit surprised that Wie delivered such a clutch moment.\n\n\u201cI think that scene on 18, being on network TV, as many people as we had around there at Pinehurst No. 2 and Michelle Wie winning the golf tournament, I don\u2019t think you can script it any better,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great for the game of golf. I think it\u2019s even better for women\u2019s golf. I\u2019m so happy for Michelle Wie. I mean this has been such a long time coming for her.\u201d\n\nWie had chance to win this title when she was a 15-year-old amateur at Cherry Hills, and a 16-year-old pro at Newport. The last time she was in this area, she opened with an 82 at Pine Needles in 2007 and walked off the course the next day because of injuries.\n\nShe had been one of the biggest stars in women\u2019s golf since she was 13 and played in the final group of a major. Her popularity soared along with criticism when she competed against the men on the PGA Tour while still in high school and talked about wanting to play in the Masters.\n\nThat seems like a lifetime ago.\n\nThe 6-foot Wie is all grown up. She is a Stanford graduate, popular among pros of both genders, and now a major champion.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d Wie said.\n\nIt almost didn\u2019t.\n\nJust like her so much of her life, the path included a sharp twist no one saw coming.\n\nWie started the final round tied with Amy Yang, took the lead when Yang made double bogey on No. 2 and didn\u2019t let anyone catch her the rest of the day.\n\nIn trouble on the tough fourth hole, she got up-and-down from 135 yards with an 8-iron into 3 feet. Right when Lewis was making a big run, Wie answered by ripping a drive on the shortened par-5 10th and hitting a cut 8-iron into 10 feet for eagle and a four-shot lead.\n\nShe had not made a bogey since the first hole \u2014 and then it all nearly unraveled.\n\nFrom a fairway bunker on the 16th, holding a three-shot lead, she stayed aggressive and hit hybrid from the sand.\n\n\u201cI was kind of a dummy for not laying up when I was in that situation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it kind of bit me in the butt. But I laughed it off. Stuff like that does happen.\u201d\n\nThe only time panic began to set in was when no one could find her ball. It finally was located after a three-minute search, buried in a wiregrass bush. She quickly and wisely took a penalty drop behind her in the fairway to limit the damage, chipped to about 35 feet and ran that putt some 5 feet by the hole.\n\nMiss it and she would be tied.\n\nBent over in that table-top putting stance, she poured it in to avoid her first three-putt of the week. Smiling as she left the green, she hit 8-iron to 25 feet and delivered a putt that will surely rank among the highlights in U.S. Women\u2019s Open history.\n\nWie finished at 2-under 278, the only player to beat par in the second week of championship golf at Pinehurst. Martin Kaymer won by eight shots last week at 9-under 271, the second-lowest score in U.S. Open history.\n\nJuli Inkster, playing her 35th and final U.S. Women\u2019s Open, closed with a 75 to tie for 15th. She received the loudest ovation of the week walking up the 18th, until Wie arrived as the winner.\n\nWhat a journey.\n\n\u201cI think that without your downs, without the hardship, I don\u2019t think you appreciate the ups and much as you do,\u201d Wie said, the gleaming trophy at her side. \u201cI think the fact that I struggled so much, the fact that I kind of went through a hard period of my life, the fact that this trophy is right next to me, it means so much more to me than it ever would have when I was 15.\n\n\u201cI feel extremely lucky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wie has been one of the biggest names in women's golf since she was 13 and played in the final group of a major.
