A large crowd is expected to attend the 57th Annual Memorial Day Service at Resthaven Cemetery.

The service starts at 11:00 a.m. and will feature Congressman Mike Pompeo, Mayor Jeff Longwell and other notable people. There will also be a flyover of World War II planes.

Resthaven is known for their display of American flags on military graves and along the roadsides.

"We take the time to put a flag on each grave and that means a lot to people," Mark Hanson of Resthaven Mortuary and Cemetery said.

Hanson says that over 5,000 veterans are laid to rest on the grounds.

He suggests that attendees bring an umbrella because of the chance on wet weather.

Other Memorial Day services in the Wichita area include;

Pratt 10:30 a.m. at Municipal Airport

Greenwood Cemetery 11:00 a.m.
