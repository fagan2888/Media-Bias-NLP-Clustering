Defenseman Tyson Barrie and forwards Matt Duchene and John Mitchell couldn\u2019t get back to defend Boedker.\n\nThe Avs, who led 1-0 early on Iginla\u2019s goal, had several chances to win it moments before Boedker ended it \u2014 including a slap shot off the crossbar by defenseman Francois Beauchemin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good things about this game. Our PK was sharp. Our power play scored a nice goal. I thought we had a lot of good chances,\u201d Roy said. \u201c(But) I wasn\u2019t happy about the way we played 3-on-3. The length of our shifts were way too long and we had no energy coming back.\u201d\n\nIginla, who is looking to become the 19th member of the 600 club, scored the 181st power-play goal of his career, tying Mike Bossy for 26th all time. Iginla\u2019s shot was a backhander that caromed in the net off a defenseman\u2019s skate at 17:07 of the first period. It was earmarked for the corner.\n\n\u201cEvery goal feels good,\u201d Iginla said after the first intermission. \u201cIt was a good break.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Iginla said No. 599 would have felt better with a win attached to it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re disappointed. You\u2019re out there trying to contribute to a win,\u201d said Iginla, who had six shots, including three in the third period. \u201d I thought I actually had some decent chances later that I thought I could get the next one. But it definitely feels good to get within one (of 600), and hopefully I\u2019ll get it over with soon and not think too much about it.\u201d\n\nThe Avs led 1-0 until Michael Stone tied it 2:34 into the third period with a giant slap shot that beat Varlamov high to the blocker side. Varlamov stopped Arizona\u2019s previous 20 shots.\n\n\u201cThe whole night, I thought we did a lot of good things, had a lot of great chances. We generated almost 40 shots \u2014 that\u2019s a good night,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cI think after they got that one in the third, we got back at them to were pushing to get that winner. I thought we were going to find it. But their goalie played great. Both goalies played great.\u201d\n\nThe Avs are four games into a stretch that has them playing nine of 10 games at home. Following Sunday\u2019s game, they departed for San Jose, where they play the Sharks on Monday night.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nCOLORADO AT SAN JOSE 8:30 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Brent Burns\n\nThe shaggy-bearded Sharks defenseman leads the NHL in goals among blue-liners, and he scored two of them against the Avalanche on Nov. 1 in Denver, where San Jose won 4-3.
