Obamacare is once again in the news as the Supreme Court has began to hear oral arguments in the case of King v. Burwell.

For those unfamiliar with the case, the question being debated is whether tax subsidies can be extended to people who bought insurance on a federal exchange, rather than one set up by the individual states.

Obamacare supporters argue that a ruling for the plaintiff would be at the expense of millions of newly-insured Americans. They suggest that the overall goal of expanding coverage would be completely undermined, and cost millions of people their coverage, drive up the cost of health insurance premiums and insurers will suffer major financial losses.
