He attended a 4th of July bbq Saturday night, and began feeling ill shortly thereafter. He thought he had contracted food poisoning, but things got worse as the evening progressed ... and at 3 AM Sunday his partner, Susie, called 911.\n\nOur sources say doctors quickly determined Weintraub had a bowel obstruction. Weintraub got a CT scan shortly after he was admitted, but we're told doctors determined there was nothing alarming.\n\nWeintraub laid in the hospital bed for 30 hours, but we're told doctors were still not able to identify the problem. Weintraub -- who hated hospitals after nearly dying 6 years ago from an infection after back surgery -- insisted at around 4 AM Monday that he be discharged. We're told the staff told him he could not be discharged and continued to monitor him.\n\nJust after 6 AM Monday Weintraub had a heart attack, and a 2nd CT scan revealed he had suffered a bowel rupture. Doctors don't know when the rupture occurred, but it sent poison throughout his body. Weintraub was taken to ICU, where he suffered a 2nd heart attack, 2 hours after the first.\n\nWe're told prior to the initial heart attack, Weintraub was not only conscious ... but joking with people in the room.\n\nAs we reported, Weintraub died at the hospital at 12:45 PM Monday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "TMZ.COM", "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jerry Weintraub died after a 30-hour hospital stay that ended with a bowel rupture that triggered 2 heart attacks ... family sources tell TMZ.
