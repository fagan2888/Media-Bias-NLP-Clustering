REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4061941\n\nAutomated payment systems for the federal Obamacare exchange still haven\u2019t been built, a top Obama administration official told a House subcommittee.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations heard testimony from Gary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, which helps oversee HealthCare.gov, Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe automated process for payments is still being built,\u201d Cohen admitted upon questioning from subcommittee chairman Rep. Tim Murphy. \u201cBut we have a process in place that is working and payments will be going out next week.\u201d\n\nCohen was unable to tell Murphy when HealthCare.gov\u2019s payment systems will be finally built.\n\nThe automated payment system will directly transfer federal Obamacare subsidies to insurance companies. The temporary system Cohen referenced simply allows insurers to calculate the amount of federal payments they\u2019re owed for HealthCare.gov customers.\n\nCohen told the subcommittee that the first set of subsidy payments will be made next week.\n\nIt was revealed during a November 19 House hearing that HealthCare.gov\u2019s back-end operations had gone unfinished even after the Obamacare exchange launched October 1. Henry Chao, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services\u2019 Chief Information Officer, told Congress that 30 to 40 percent of HealthCare.gov still hadn\u2019t been built.\n\nAt that point, HHS officials had yet to begin constructing the payment systems.\n\nNow, HealthCare.gov\u2019s payment process still hasn\u2019t been completed, although the exchange has been live for over three months and the federal government is days away from making its first subsidy payments.\n\nInsurers will be receiving a hefty amount of federal payments as well. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released its first demographic information regarding exchange signups Monday, revealing that a whopping 79 percent of Obamacare customers nationwide will receive some federal subsidies to offset their premiums.\n\nThe site was launched on October 1 with just basic customer-facing functions, including the abilities to make an account, determine subsidy eligibility, and select a plan, while the parts of the site the public couldn\u2019t see were left unfinished. The Obama administration had hoped to gain extra time to build the rest of the site before HHS would have to communicate coverage and send payments to insurance companies.\n\nEven these simple functions failed to work and HealthCare.gov continued having problems correctly calculating the amount of subsidies consumers were eligible for into December.\n\nCohen told the subcommittee that HealthCare.gov\u2019s drastic and immediate breakdown took him by surprise.\n\n\u201cI had no indication prior to October 1 that we were going to have the major, major problems with the website that we ended up having,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
