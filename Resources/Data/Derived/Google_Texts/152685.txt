It was the "year of the big" at this spring's Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, both in terms of the installations and the crowds.

And the final weekend was no exception, as thousands of visitors flocked to the Bondi-Bronte coastline on Saturday for a last-minute look at the collection.

Unseasonably warm weather helped draw more than half a million people over three weeks, making it one of the most successful Sculpture by the Sea events in its 18 years.

A 24-metre fry pan, three large bronze babies and a 45 metre-long "sunrise" were among the crowd favourites at this year's event, which featured 109 installations from 16 countries.

Sadly one of the artworks - a fibreglass tribute to the famous Icebergs pool - was damaged in a minor act of vandalism on Friday.

"It was not a happy incident, but fortunately, it is quite easy for the artist to repair," founding director David Handley said, adding that visitors had generally been "a pleasure".

"Everyone's in high spirits, enjoying the art. That makes for a really nice start to summer."
