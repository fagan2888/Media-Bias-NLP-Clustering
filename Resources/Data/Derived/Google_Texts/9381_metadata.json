(IBISWorld doesn\u2019t count Target as part of the pharmacy market because its operations differ from the pharmacy business.)\n\nThe combined Walgreens and Rite Aid would operate 13,000 U.S. stores in its footprint, nearly three times as many pharmacies than Wal-Mart and more than double Walgreens' existing store count. CVS currently operates more than 7,800 stores, which would add 1,600 Target pharmacies if a current deal between the two companies goes through.\n\nGiven the size of the proposed company, the biggest obstacle for the merger appears to be antitrust concerns as regulators address a market footprint that would swell with thousands of new stores.\n\nWhen asked about those concerns, Turk wasn't sure the merger would pass muster with regulators.\n\nRite Aid and Walgreens will argue that the expanding healthcare market, which now includes competition from big-box chains, grocery stores, independent pharmacies and mail-order services, should make their merger acceptable in the eyes of regulators.\n\n\u201cI believe that [the U.S. healthcare industry] is the most fragmented,\u201d Pessina said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThere are so many players in the market that I don\u2019t believe the change between Walgreens and Walgreens plus Rite Aid could be big enough to change the rules of the game.\u201d\n\nStill, analysts say the companies could be forced to shed stores in an effort to address antitrust concerns. During a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Walgreens executives refused to discuss if they would divest stores to avoid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIf the deal goes through, Walgreens plans to at least initially operate Rite Aid stores under the existing brand name, but wants to \"further transform Rite Aid's stores to better meet consumer needs,\" hinting at possible renovations.\n\nIs the deal about retail footprint or market leverage?\n\nAccording to Turk, one of the main motivators for the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would be to increase Walgreens' market leverage when negotiating with pharmacy-benefits managers (PBMs) \u2014 intermediaries of sorts between drug manufactures and retailers. But this would again be a concern for antitrust regulators, and would most likely attract scrutiny, according to Barclays analyst Meredith Adler in a research note cited by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOn a call with investors on Wednesday, Pessina dismissed the suggestion that the move was orchestrated to gain better bargaining power against PBMs, saying that it was purely an effort to expand Walgreens\u2019 retail footprint in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWith this acquisition, we are accelerating a long-term objective that we knew we needed to address: to strengthen our presence and coverage nationally across the U.S.,\u201d Pessina said.\n\nBut the reality is a larger footprint would still give Walgreens greater clout when purchasing drugs, with help from Rite Aid\u2019s EnvisionRx benefits management unit. This could be a key advantage when negotiating with PBMs, Turk noted, which have themselves consolidated in recent years to give them greater sway when dealing with pharmacies.\n\n\u201cDue to their strong market power, a PBM can exclude a pharmacy from its network, and that can severely hamper the pharmacy\u2019s sales,\u201d said Turk.\n\nThe hot dealmaking climate in retail health\n\nThe Walgreens-Rite Aid deal is no outlier in the current healthcare market, as big drugstore chains and retailers have been actively pursuing deals to increase their presence over the last few years.\n\nThe hot dealmaking climate in retail health right now extends to all corners of the market. $427 billion in merger deals have been recorded so far this year between drug makers, hospital chains, and health insurers, according to Dealogic and as reported by the Wall Street Journal. These deals can largely be attributed to the new healthcare landscape ushered in by the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare).\n\nThe law has compelled healthcare retailers to find ways to deal with price pressures while simultaneously expanding their offerings.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies have focused on becoming a one-stop-shop for wellness,\u201d Turk said.\n\nCVS, the current drugstore market leader, announced its Target deal in June, just a few months after it revealed that it would acquire drug fulfillment company Omnicare for $10.4 billion. And Rite Aid this year bought pharmacy benefits management company Envision Pharmaceutical Services (also known as EnvisionRx) for $2 billion, while also boosting its RediClinic walk-in centers.\n\nWal-Mart has also been inching into the healthcare retail space with a recent event that offered free health screenings like blood pressure readings at its stores. The nation\u2019s largest retailer has also started to place protein bars near checkout counters as it moves to increase its market share in the healthcare space.\n\nAfter orchestrating the deal between Walgreens and his European drugstore and pharmaceutical distribution company Boots Alliance late last year, Pessina made it clear that he was on the hunt for more deals in the U.S. market.\n\n\u201cThis market, the American market, is ready for another round of consolidation,\u201d Pessina said in an earnings call in April.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nLooking towards the future of the retail pharmacy business, Turk expects healthcare retailers will likely partner with physicians as they focus on becoming wellness providers for consumers.\n\n\u201cWith the physician shortage, the access to primary care physicians will likely be lowered for many patients,\u201d Turk said. \u201cInstead of seeing your primary care provider, you may have to interface with someone at Walgreens to help you dispense your medication.\u201d\n\nAs the role of the pharmacist becomes more crucial, retailers will need to effectively train these employees, especially as they handle drugs like biologics, which are very expensive to dispense. Turk said that retailers could also look at helping lower noncompliance costs, as many hospitals have started being penalized for readmission rates. This could include developing a technological infrastructure to monitor high-risk patients, or asking patients if they are compliant, and if not, figuring out why.\n\n\u201cIf a patient doesn\u2019t take their medicine, it\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s a significant cost in terms of healthcare costs,\u201d said Turk, \u201cSo if they can help mitigate that, there is definitely an opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kelsey Lindsey", "twitter": {"domain": "Retail Dive", "site": "@retaildive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "retail,type-newspost,retail-corporate-news", "description": "Retail industry news, voices and jobs.
