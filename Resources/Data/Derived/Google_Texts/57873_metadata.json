Justin Phillips put up the ad asking his girlfriend of nine years to marry him and it worked.\n\n\"We had kind of tossed around the idea of a billboard, I have a friend that owns some billboards here and decided to go big,\" Phillips said.\n\nPhillips and his girlfriend, Dawn Freeborn, were out driving Friday evening. Freeborn thought that the pair were out to pick up some surveillance video from a deer stand Phillips had. When Phillips turned his truck around and faced it towards the billboard, Freeborn had a near immediate reaction. \"It was a very quick yes,\" she said.\n\nThe billboard is located just south of 101st St. along Interstate 135 and can be seen from the southbound lanes of traffic.\n\nThere is no date set for the wedding. The pair say that once married, they want to have children.\n\nThe billboard's total cost for Phillips was less than $500.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Newton man took out ad space on a billboard asking his girlfriend to marry him.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "A Newton man took out ad space on a billboard asking his girlfriend to marry him.", "title": "Man proposes using billboard ad", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-Proposes-Using-Billboard-Ad-291968961.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D74/6D7/D746D763936F4CDDB9884BD772D90486", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C6F/59E/C6F59E3311464C67A3B4914E5F6A76EF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Newton man took out ad space on a billboard asking his girlfriend to marry him.", "title": "Man proposes using billboard ad", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-Proposes-Using-Billboard-Ad-291968961.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Billboard+Proposal.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Man proposes using billboard ad", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Man proposes using billboard ad"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca4c\"", "article_summary": "When Phillips turned his truck around and faced it towards the billboard, Freeborn had a near immediate reaction.\nAn ad placed on a billboard along I-135 in northern Sedgwick County hit its' targeted market.\nJustin Phillips put up the ad asking his girlfriend of nine years to marry him and it worked.\nThe billboard is located just south of 101st St. along Interstate 135 and can be seen from the southbound lanes of traffic.\n\"We had kind of tossed around the idea of a billboard, I have a friend that owns some billboards here and decided to go big,\" Phillips said."}
