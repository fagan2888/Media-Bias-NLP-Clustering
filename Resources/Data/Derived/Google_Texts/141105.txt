Chubbies shorts — the kind of throwback, Martha’s Vineyard-looking apparel that you’d expect any guy from the University of Alabama to wear — has just gotten a special presidential endorsement.

They got this amazing letter in reply:

Completely baller, of course, because we can now assume the former two-term Republican president is running around looking like this:

The Chubbies team sent a personal letter and the ‘Mericas to G.W. as a thank you for his support of veteran organizations. “In the letter we wrote to the president, we thanked him for his own efforts and contributions to veteran’s causes, shared ours and thanked him for serving our country as president and Commander-in-chief,” said Kit Garton, the PR and events manager at Chubbies. The company had just finished a special Veteran’s Week campaign, donating $5-$10 to veteran and active duty charities for every pair of shorts sold, as well as telling the stories of Service members deployed abroad. “The main point of us celebrating Veteran’s Week (in lieu of Veteran’s Day) was to dedicate an entire week to honoring & giving back to our country’s heroes – like Travis Mills and the men of the 9th Infantry Regiment – who are the reason we get out of bed and come to work every morning,” said co-founder Kyle Hency. “To have President George W. Bush recognize our efforts was beyond amazing and is truly a highlight of our young company’s history.”
