Snooki Polizzi is pregnant yet again.

The Jersey Shore star and fiance Jionni LaValle are ready for baby No. 2, reports have cited. Neither Snooki nor Jionni have verified the reports yet, but sources close to the could said that the couple is expecting a child later this year.

Snooki already has one child, a son named Lorenzo Dominic LaValle who was born in August 2012.

Assuming the report is true, then Snooki Polizzi is pregnant just in time to join her friend and reality show castmate Jenni Farley, better known as JWoww. Farley and fiance Roger Mathews are expecting a baby, and announced last month that it will be a girl.

Snooki, once a wild partier who fit right in with the rest of the Jersey Shore cast, has said motherhood has flipped her world completely.

“Before I had the baby, I was very selfish, and all I wanted to do was go to Vegas with my boyfriend and party,” Polizzi said. “Once you have a kid, everything changes…. It changes how you look at the world.”

Snooki even went on to release a book about motherhood, Baby Bumps: From Party Girl to Proud Mama, and all the Messy Milestones Along the Way.

She has also come quite a ways since her first pregnancy, when Snooki Polizzi admitted she was quite anxious.

“Oh, I was scared to tell my dad, of course!” Snooki told People magazine back in 2012, before Lorenzo was born.

At the time, Snooki added that she would be willing to step back from her realty show duties if she needed to.

“As long as he’s comfortable with everything, I would,” she said about including Jionni on her reality shows. “If not, I might have to step back a little. Now we have a child so there are other factors involved.”The source that said Snooki Polizzi is pregnant with No. 2 did not have any further details about the baby’s sex or possible due date.
