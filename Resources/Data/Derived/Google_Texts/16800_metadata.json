But it is Russia\u2019s insistence on escalating the Ukraine crisis that is driving the economic sanctions that have so damaged the Russian economy.\n\n\u201cTo some extent the Russian government is in denial about how bad things could potentially get,\u201d said Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\u201cPart of what is going on, in Ukraine in particular, is an effort by the Kremlin to deflect attention from what\u2019s happening to the economy \u2013 which was already slowing down before the sanctions were applied,\u201d said Mankoff.\n\nRelated: Russia Hikes Interest Rates as Sanctions Slam Economy\n\nMonday\u2019s gloomy outlook came as part of the Bank of Russia\u2019s annual report on the country\u2019s monetary policy. It found that international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and its continued support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine have created a major drag on the economy, as have declining oil prices. The Russian government gets nearly half its revenue from taxes on oil exports.\n\nThe central bank also revealed that it now expects $128 billion in capital to flow out of the Russian economy in 2014, as investors look for better, more stable opportunities elsewhere. The net outflows in 2013 totaled only $61 billion.\n\nIn a separate announcement, officials said they would abandon attempts to keep the value of the ruble within a certain \u201ccorridor\u201d but would instead allow it to float freely in the foreign exchange market. This was, in effect tantamount to conceding defeat. Russian officials have been spending tens of billions of dollars a month in an effort to prop up the ruble, to no avail.\n\nRussian officials did, however, say that they remain prepared to intervene in the currency markets if they believe speculators \u2013 who the government is officially blaming for the ruble\u2019s fall \u2013 drive the exchange rate much lower.\n\nRelated: A U.S. Deal with Iran Could Reset the Balance of Mideast Power\n\nThe ruble made modest gains against other foreign currencies on the news Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, according to various wire reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing, said the ruble\u2019s slide is \u201cabsolutely not connected\u201d to the state of the Russian economy. \u201cWe have seen speculative fluctuations of the rate, but I think it will end soon in the face of action taken by the central bank in response to action by speculators,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that the ruble is currently undervalued and added that he expects it to rise against foreign currencies again by yearend.\n\nHowever, Russian officials have reported a massive effort among Russian citizens to exchange the ruble for dollars and euros, in the hope of preserving the value of their savings. In addition, sanctions have sharply raised food prices and made some good Russian consumers have become accustomed to unavailable.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Legacy Extends to Possible Deal with Iran\n\nWhat this means for Putin and his government is unclear.\n\n\u201cRussia and the Soviet Union before it managed to go on for quite a while in pretty parlous economic conditions,\u201d Mankoff said. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is that expectations have changed. People have experienced a decade of economic growth. How much privation people are willing to accept and for how long is an unknown and it is something that must be on the mind of Russian leaders.\u201d\n\nWhy This Matters: The continued decline of the Russian economy could deliver some political cushion to President Obama, who next year will have to face a Republican-led Congress with influential members who have criticized his approach to dealing with Russia. Further evidence of economic turmoil, or a continued slide for the ruble would be an effective counter to arguments that the administration\u2019s response to the Russian aggression in Ukraine was not forceful enough.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid terrible economic news, Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to claim that the Russian economy is in good shape.
