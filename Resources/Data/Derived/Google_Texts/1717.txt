Move over, Monopoly. There’s a new board game that’s sure to be your family’s next favorite (or not), thanks to President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the other delusional Democrats still having fun with our money.

According to the game’s creators:

“Obamacare: The Game” is a satire of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The object of the board game is to be the last player standing. The game highlights actual taxes and penalties of Obamacare, and references specific sections of the law – along with funny exaggerated penalties. Being taxed out of existence has never been so much fun!

The game, which is made in the USA, sells for $30 on etsy.com, along with a slew of accessories for all the loved ones on your list.

Only one question: How do the players tell their pieces apart from one another if we all have to be the ass?
