But \u201cadded sugars\u201d declares the industry\u2019s strategy of pumping up the volume on \u201cpalatability,\u201d making ketchup, yogurt and granola bars, for example, as sweet and high-calorie as jam, ice cream and Snickers. Added sugar turns sparkling water into soda and food-like objects into candy. Added sugar, if you can forgive the hyperbole, is the enemy. This is not to say you shouldn\u2019t eat a granola bar, but if you know what\u2019s in it you\u2019re less likely to think of it as \u201chealth food.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of other significant changes, including more realistic \u201cserving sizes\u201d (a serving of ice cream will now be a more realistic cup instead of a half-cup, for example), the deletion of the \u201ccalories from fat\u201d line, which recognizes that not all fats are \u201cbad,\u201d and some changes in daily recommended values for various nutrients.\n\nMrs. Obama, who is sometimes seen (by me among many others) as overly industry-friendly, was behind the push for these changes, or at least highly supportive of them. And she deserves credit: It\u2019s a victory, and no one on the progressive side of this struggle should see it as otherwise.\n\nThe label is hardly messianic. In fact, the F.D.A. tacitly acknowledges this by offering an alternative, stronger label, which approaches the kind of \u201ctraffic light\u201d labeling I\u2019ve advocated for, and which there\u2019s evidence to support. The alternative has four sections, including \u201cAvoid Too Much\u201d and \u201cGet Enough\u201d; the first includes added sugars and trans fat, for example, and the second, fiber and vitamin D.\n\nMichael Taylor, the F.D.A.'s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine \u2014 and the guy who supervised the new label\u2019s development \u2014 told me that the alternative label is essentially a way to further \u201cstimulate comments.\u201d It may be that it\u2019s also a demonstration of the agency\u2019s will, designed to show industry how threatening things could get so Big Food will swallow the primary label without much complaint.\n\nAlthough the ultimate decision is the F.D.A.'s, the Grocery Manufacturers\u2019 Association statement last week said in part, \u201cIt is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science.\u201d These are, and marketers are going to have a tough time claiming otherwise. In other words, we\u2019re going to see some form of new and stronger label, period.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIntroducing the label, Mrs. Obama said, \u201cOur guiding principle here is very simple: that you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it\u2019s good for your family.\u201d\n\nThis label moves in that direction, but it could be much more powerful. Kessler would like to see a pie chart on the front of the package: \u201cThat would help people know what\u2019s real food and what\u2019s not.\u201d Michael Pollan also suggests front-of-the-box labeling: \u201cI think the U.K. has the right idea with their stoplight panel on the front of packages; only a small percentage of shoppers get to the nutritional panel on the back.\u201d And the N.Y.U. nutrition professor Marion Nestle (who called this label change \u201ccourageous\u201d) says that \u201cA recommended upper limit for added sugars would help put them in context; I\u2019d like to see that set at 10 percent of calories or 50 grams (200 calories) in a 2,000-calorie diet.\u201d (I wrote about my own dream label, which includes categories that probably won\u2019t be considered for another 10 years \u2014 if ever \u2014 back in 2012.)\n\nWhat else is wrong? The label covers a lot of food, but it has no effect on restaurant food, takeout, most prepared food sold in bulk (do you have any idea what\u2019s in that fried chicken at the supermarket deli counter, for example?) or alcohol.\n\nThe Obama administration and the F.D.A. have made a couple of moves here that might be categorized as bold, but they could have done so three or four years ago; these are regulations that can be built upon, and do not require Congressional approval. But by the time they\u2019re in effect it may be too late for this administration to take them to the next level.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not a case of too-little-too-late but one of \u201cit could\u2019ve been more and happened sooner.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s looking backward instead of forward. If we see a decline in obesity rates, more curbs on food marketing and greater transparency in packaged food, that\u2019s progress. Let\u2019s be thankful for it, then get back to work pushing for more.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140304203224, "twitter": {"description": "Let\u2019s be thankful for the
