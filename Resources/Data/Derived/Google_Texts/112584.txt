A new flyover ramp attached to the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge has now opened.

The ramp, under construction since summer 2014, will connect drivers from the Second Street bridge to Interstate 65.

“The flyover ramp is a very big deal for drivers who are headed from Louisville to southern Indiana in the afternoon who are using the Clark Memorial Bridge … or any other time for that matter,” said spokeswoman Mindy Peterson. “This is restoring to those drivers direct access from 31 North to 65 North.”

Peterson said during construction of the ramp, drivers were detoured through Jeffersonville to the 10th Street ramp.

"This is going to be a big deal for those drivers,” Peterson said.

Peterson said the Abraham Lincoln Bridge is still scheduled to open to traffic by Monday morning.
