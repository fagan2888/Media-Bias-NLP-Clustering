Keith Williams for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a committee of Manhattan Community Board 2 recommended against allowing Boots & Saddle to transfer its liquor license to a vacant space at 47 Seventh Avenue South. The location was most recently a Chinese restaurant.\n\nFor 40 years, Boots & Saddle has been an institution, a gay bar in an area where \u201cgay bar\u201d was, for decades, a redundancy. Seven nights a week, locals and tourists alike revel in its drag show, a song-and-dance spectacle that has grown over the past few years thanks to positive word of mouth.\n\nDespite the bar\u2019s popularity, its owners say they can\u2019t afford the latest rent increase on their Christopher Street home. An attempt to transfer its license to a new space on Barrow Street two blocks south had already failed at the hands of the Community Board\u2019s liquor committee.\n\nDozens of concerned Village residents, hoping to see it fail again, packed Tuesday\u2019s meeting; with more than 100 seats filled, a security guard had to turn some people away so as not to violate the fire code.\n\nAfter intense questioning of bar owners from the committee, the floor opened to those assembled. One by one, they shared a litany of familiar fears: the bar would wake the elderly and scar the youths; vehicular traffic would increase and drunken hooligans would cause trouble on foot.\n\n\u201cThey will be bringing back the mayhem we have worked so hard to eliminate,\u201d said Dave Poster, founder of the Christopher Street Patrol, a volunteer watch group.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine anything less appropriate for this part of our enclave than this particular application,\u201d said Greg Jackson, president of another group. \u201cPlease do not accuse the Morton Street Block Association of homophobia,\u201d he added, pointing to two previous presidents of the organization who were gay.\n\nAfter nearly a dozen residents spoke against the application, John Philip, the bar\u2019s lawyer, rose to allay their concerns. The bar, he said, could add soundproofing to address noise and tinted windows to address children\u2019s prying eyes. \u201cThe very character of the Village was created by these cabaret spaces,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take that away, you\u2019ll destroy something ineffable in the community.\u201d\n\nHis paean to history was insufficient; the advisory vote was unanimous, and the owners plan to withdraw their application. On Wednesday, however, a lead for another space\u2014one suggested in an off-hand comment by a committee member\u2014had begun to show promise.\n\nBy midnight Tuesday evening, word of the rejection had made its way around the crowd inside Boots & Saddle\u2014\u201dYou should move to Brooklyn!\u201d one regular told a bartender\u2014but the mood was still riotous. A performer named Brenda Dharling was working an extraordinarily diverse crowd with an extraordinarily diverse set.\n\nA packed house watches as a committee of Manhattan Community Board 2 questions the owners of Boots & Saddle. Keith Williams for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn between lip-synching to medleys featuring Judy Garland and Jessie J, Tina Turner and Adele, she toyed with the two recent college graduates from Dallas, a middle-aged regular from the Bronx and the fifty-something straight couple from Melbourne, who had, improbably, heard about Boots & Saddle all the way from Australia, and who had, even more improbably, resolved to pay a visit.\n\nPatrons took advantage of the dollar shots\u2014grapefruit juice and liquor, the identity of which was unclear\u2014but at 12:30 a.m., when Brenda\u2019s 90-minute, Jazzercise-fueled set concluded, the bar returned to a relative quiet.\n\nDespite the unbridled glee from the drag queen\u2019s performance, there was one awkward moment. Brenda had chosen to mime the scene from the 1981 film \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d in which Faye Dunaway beats her daughter in a swimming race. Over the girl\u2019s protests, Ms. Dunaway retorts: \u201cNobody ever said life was fair!\u201d\n\nAn eerie silence fell over the bar. On the wall, a clock ticked, one second closer to homelessness. But before it could tick again, Brenda shifted into another song, and every worry in Boots & Saddle seemed to fade away.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home.", "title": "Village Institution Boots & Saddle Struggles to Lasso a New Location", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/10/village-institution-boots-saddle-struggles-to-lasso-a-new-location/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EM193_NYBOOT_P_20140910143157.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Village Institution Boots & Saddle Struggles to Lasso a New Location", "description": "For the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Keith Williams", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "For the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-10T20:26:51-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/10/village-institution-boots-saddle-struggles-to-lasso-a-new-location/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "For the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home.", "title": "Village Institution Boots & Saddle Struggles to Lasso a New Location", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/10/village-institution-boots-saddle-struggles-to-lasso-a-new-location/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EM193_NYBOOT_P_20140910143157.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21606", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-11T21:54:25-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f59\"", "article_summary": "For 40 years, Boots & Saddle has been an institution, a gay bar in an area where \u201cgay bar\u201d was, for decades, a redundancy.\nBut before it could tick again, Brenda shifted into another song, and every worry in Boots & Saddle seemed to fade away.\nA packed house watches as a committee of Manhattan Community Board 2 questions the owners of Boots & Saddle.\nBrenda Dharling performs at Boots & Saddle Tuesday.\nKeith Williams for The Wall Street JournalFor the second time, a legendary Greenwich Village establishment has been stymied in its hunt for a new home."}
