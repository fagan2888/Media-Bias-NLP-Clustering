And the dilemma will likely become amplified the further the U.S. advances in soccer\u2019s premier tournament.\n\nFormer U.S. coach Pia Sundhage, now the head coach of Sweden, summed the dichotomy best earlier this week when she called Solo \u201ca piece of work,\u201d while in the same breath praising her at the \u201cbest goalkeeper in the world.\u201d\n\nSolo is quietly on the job in Canada. It\u2019s a contrast to the World Cup in Germany four years ago, where she was everywhere, held up as one of the team\u2019s biggest stars. And deservedly so: She would win the Golden Glove award as goalkeeper of the tournament. The performance landed her on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Her star would rise higher with an appearance on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\nLast June she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault stemming from an altercation with her sister and 17-year-old nephew at a family gathering in Kirkland, Washington. A judge dismissed the charges earlier this year.\n\nU.S. Soccer has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with some calling for Solo to be benched while the case played out.\n\nSolo was suspended from the team for 30 days earlier this year after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California for driving under the influence in a U.S. Soccer team van. Solo was his lone passenger.\n\nFollowing the suspension, Solo wrote on her blog that she had taken the time to work on herself and issues that were vexing her. But an ESPN investigative report released on the eve of the U.S. team\u2019s World Cup opener against Australia raised new questions about the assault and reignited the controversy.\n\nU.S coach Jill Ellis maintains the issue not a distraction in Canada: \u201cI know our team and we have each other\u2019s backs. I think it was something a long time ago and we\u2019ve put it to bed.\u201d\n\nSolo made three spectacular saves in the 3-1 victory over the Matildas. She spoke briefly afterward about her performance, but was short when a reporter asked her about her focus in the face of what had transpired off the field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly focused, sir, perfectly focused,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the team\u2019s 0-0 draw against Sweden, Solo walked past reporters smiling but did not speak. It was her 85th career shutout, an ongoing U.S. team record. It was also the first World Cup shutout for the U.S. since July 2, 2011, when the team defeated Colombia 3-0 in group play.\n\nSolo has six World Cup shutouts behind Brianna Scurry\u2019s 10. Her next start will tie her with Scurry for the most international appearances for a U.S. goalkeeper at 173. That will likely come Tuesday, when the United States plays Nigeria in Vancouver, British Columbia, in the final match of the group stage.\n\nAnyone tasked with promoting Solo would be best served to keep the attention squarely on the field, said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing specialist for Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. Nike is Solo\u2019s most prominent sponsor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get interesting if she\u2019s just fantastic in goal, as kind of the difference maker, where it\u2019s hard to ignore her,\u201d Dorfman said.\n\nSolo herself has been carrying on as the tumult swirls around her. While in Winnipeg for the first two matches of the group stage. Solo met with a 13-year-old Canadian girl, herself a goalkeeper on a youth team.\n\nA teacher at Julianna Raposo\u2019s school contacted a representative for Solo months ago, inquiring about a possible meeting during the World Cup. Given what Solo has been facing off the field, there wasn\u2019t much optimism the request would be granted.\n\nBut Solo invited the girl to the team hotel last week and gave her tickets for the match against Sweden Friday night. Raposo turned the meeting into a school project at Henry G. Izatt Middle School.\n\nSolo talked to Raposo about the criticism she\u2019s facing.\n\n\u201cShe said that of course, she\u2019s a person and it does hurt her, but she\u2019s got to brush it off,\u201d Raposo said before the Sweden match. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what I look up to. You can\u2019t let other people you don\u2019t know bother you. She was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to push your way through it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked if Solo\u2019s off-field behavior had any impact on her opinion of her, Raposo emphatically shook her head no.\n\nMost of the fans who attend the U.S. team\u2019s first two matches Winnipeg were also decidedly pro-Solo, with an obvious bias.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I kind of feel sorry for her. It kinda feels like piling on at this point,\u201d said U.S. fan Maggie Pressley about the renewed attention put on Solo\u2019s off-field trouble. \u201cI\u2019m going to root for the U.S. no matter who is in goal, but she is really great. I think she gives us the best chance to go far, if not all the way to the championship here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Solo poses a difficult problem for U.S. Soccer as the women seek an unprecedented third World Cup title: How to laud Solo's performances on the field while not fueling the attention on her behavior off it.
