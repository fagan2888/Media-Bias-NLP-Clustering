On the one hand, according to the Pew report those religions that are losing the most members are overwhelmingly liberal, not conservative. One could say without fear of contradiction that the more a religion resembles reigning liberal culture, the less likely it is to keep its members.\n\nMainline Christian denominations that have been willing to bend with every new cultural trend have suffered devastating losses in recent years. As a group, it has been \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant churches that have lost the most members, falling by 3.4% between 2007 and 2014. First among the list are the Episcopalians, who have embraced divorce and remarriage, contraception, abortion, and gay sex.\n\nAccording to its own statistics, the Episcopal church has shown a steady decline in numbers, with falling membership every single year since 1965. In that year, the church had 3,615,000 baptized members, but by 1970 the number had already dropped to 3,475,000. In 2001, the total number of baptized Episcopalians had dropped to 2,317,000, a whopping decrease in 35 years of 1,300,000 baptized members.\n\nThe Pew study found, in fact, that of the all the major subgroups within American Christianity, it was mainline Protestantism\u2014a tradition that includes the United Methodist Church, the American Baptist Churches USA, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the Episcopal Church\u2014that \u201cappears to have experienced the greatest drop in absolute numbers.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals, on the other hand, who have generally held to biblical morality, have barely experienced any decline at all, falling less than a single percentage point from 2007 to 2014.\n\nBut Miller\u2019s erroneous logic doesn\u2019t end here. She sees the salvation of America in the religious \u201cnones,\u201d souls who claim no affiliation with any particular religion whatsoever.\n\nCatholic defection, says Miller, \u201cis the single greatest factor driving the much-heralded rise of the nones, who now account for just under 23 percent of the population.\u201d Nones, writes Miller, are \u201cliberal-leaning on social issues\u201d and now make up a larger share of the population \u201cthan the share of Catholics.\u201d\n\nWhat Miller fails to mention, is that religious \u201cnones\u201d are not freethinking intellectuals who have carefully examined the proposals of different religions and rationally embraced an irreligious creed. They are overwhelmingly high-school educated, white males who earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\nAccording to the Pew survey, the number of religiously unaffiliated adults describing themselves as \u201cnones\u201d increased significantly in the seven-year period between 2007 and 2014, adding some 20 million to their numbers, and they now account for nearly 23% of the US population.\n\nAmong the religiously unaffiliated, however, only a small fraction possesses a college degree. According to the Pew report, 45% of religious \u201cnothing in particulars\u201d have a high school diploma or less, while only 15% have a college degree and even fewer\u20149%\u2014a post-graduate degree. The numbers change only slightly when taking into account all religious \u201cnones,\u201d with 38% having a high school education at most.\n\nSo yes, a decline in the numbers of Catholics may signal a positive trend where your yardstick is a greater openness to killing unborn children in the womb. But if you are actually concerned about the future of the nation, a drop in Catholics may not be the blessing that liberals assume it is.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
