One-third actively fought for independence; one-third were loyalists who supported King George; one-third were apathetic and uninvolved.\n\nOf the one-third who actively supported independence, only 85 percent, or approximately 63,000, were able-boded men. Their opposition was formidable: 40,000 British soldiers, 75,000 loyalists and 75,000 apathetic, uninvolved neighbors. Those fighting for independence were the minority.\n\nThey faced greater dangers than those of the Civil War era. During the Civil War, Americans generally supported the side where they lived: the North or South. Yet, in 1775 the patriots, loyalists, and apathetic lived next door to each other \u2014 even in the same home or family.\n\nA single street in any town was the battleground for civil war with spies as neighbors. Fighting the enemy literally meant hand-to-hand combat and firing at close range mostly on one\u2019s own property.\n\nTheir struggle was insurmountable. Boston was occupied and a do-nothing unresolved delegation in Philadelphia would not act, fearful of upsetting King George.\n\nThe colonial 1775 delegation was no different than what Winston Churchill said of Stanley Baldwin\u2019s 1936 government: \u201ca strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.\u201d\n\nAnd George Washington would have none of it.\n\nWashington commissioned six ships, creating what became America\u2019s first navy, known as \u201cWashington\u2019s Secret Navy.\u201d And Washington pointed to the wisdom offered by the previous century\u2019s political philosopher, John Locke. Everyone at the time would have understood Washington\u2019s \u201cAppeal to Heaven.\u201d Locke wrote:\u201d\u2026 where the body of the people is deprived of their right; or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven.\u201d\n\nWashington, Locke and everyone else at the time fundamentally understood human rights were not manmade; they were God-given. Washington saw a government removing God-given rights and knew his responsibility was to act, to defend those rights. The appeal to heaven meant action on earth.\n\nWashington\u2019s appeal to heaven is needed today. The crises Americans face are equally dire, if not more so. Neighbors and family members are nearly as divided as they were in 1775. One-third recognizes the necessity for immediate action to confront unprecedented tyranny, one-third denies any problems exist at all, and one-third is apathetic, fearful, and expresses helplessness over problems they know exist but feel incapable to resolve.\n\nTyranny exists in a 2015 American government actively seeking to destroy the family.\n\nTyranny exists under the guise of \u201cfamily planning\u201d that aggressively denies parental rights. Unelected bureaucrats from local and state government agencies assert a \u201cGovernment Knows Best\u201d policy: The government takes better care of children than their parents. In nearly every state, \u201cchild protective services\u201d agencies and judicial administrators are actively denying parental rights to make decisions about their children\u2019s health, well-being and education. In all cases when medical practitioners disagree with parents\u2019 decisions to accept or reject second opinions related to treating their sick child, the government takes their child from them without due process. Parents must legally prove they are \u201cfit\u201d to regain custody, and are subject to gag orders while their child remains in state custody. The results are catastrophic: Children held by the state, some for years, become increasingly ill or die.\n\nGovernment tyranny extends to authorizing medical procedures on minors without parental consent, as well as actively targeting home-schoolers and parents who reject mandatory vaccinations not yet even approved by the FDA.\n\nIn 2015 America, parents are now being forced to advocate for their right to be a parent without interference from bureaucrats who are acting like Nazis and secret police.\n\nTyranny exists under the guise of \u201cfamily planning\u201d that authorizes and advocates birth control medication for women knowing it will kill them. Big Pharma and politicians gain hundreds of millions in profit while unelected and corrupt bureaucrats unethically and illegally approve medications they know cause blood clots, strokes, pulmonary embolisms, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and other irreversible blood-related problems, heart attacks, and death \u2014 mostly among healthy women in their 20s.\n\nAdditionally, the government refuses to protect pregnant women from the No. 1 cause of their death: homicide. Few states have laws to protect women from their fathers, brothers, husbands and boyfriends who kill them because they refuse to have abortions.\n\nTyranny exists under the guise of \u201cprotecting civil rights\u201d violations allegedly caused by \u201creligious liberty\u201d claims. The government actively targets one faith group \u2014 Christians and especially ministers and ignores imams, mosques and non-profit \u201creligious\u201d organizations that receive tax-exempt status and tax-funded subsidies that are known front groups for terrorism. The government refuses to shut down organizations and jihad camps on American soil solely focused on attacking Americans, chief among them, Christians and Jews.\n\nTyranny exists in 2015 America under the guise of a government no different than that of the German government the majority of citizens elected in 1936. A majority voted for Hitler (99 percent) and a majority of Austrians voted to annex (98 percent). Six million Germans (7 percent) were registered members of the Nazi Party. Six million German voters were responsible for the death of nearly 60 million people within 10 years.\n\nThree generations later, more than 50 percent of Americans voted \u2014 twice \u2014 for another Hitler in a different form. This man doesn\u2019t need to openly conquer other countries; instead he funds Islamists to do far worse. This man orchestrates giving rights to non-citizens for which citizens must pay financially, forfeiting their own rights. This man and Congress choose not to protect law-abiding citizens from illegal immigrants and repeated criminal offenders who receive better benefits than military veterans.\n\nTyranny exists because bureaucrats and non-citizens are intentionally destroying nearly every area of citizens\u2019 rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. Like George Washington, Americans must recognize that no appeal on earth exists today. Americans must act, to stand against a corrupt tyrannical government and protect their families and God-given liberties from foreign invaders.\n\nThe only question is: Where are the one-third who are desperately needed to defend America now and protect citizens\u2019 life, liberty and freedoms?", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's crises today are as dire as those the colonists faced in 1775 and Nazi-era evil.", "Author": "Bethany Blankley", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "America\u2019s crises today are as dire as those the colonists faced in 1775 and Nazi-era evil.", "title": "BETHANY BLANKLEY: Protect families and God-given rights", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/7/bethany-blankley-protect-families-and-god-given-ri/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/07/AP815206853472.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/07/AP815206853472.jpg", "title": "BETHANY BLANKLEY: Protect families and God-given rights", "description": "America's crises today are as dire as those the colonists faced in 1775 and Nazi-era evil.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, George Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe57ec\"", "article_summary": "One-third actively fought for independence; one-third were loyalists who supported King George; one-third were apathetic and uninvolved.\nAmericans must act, to stand against a corrupt tyrannical government and protect their families and God-given liberties from foreign invaders.\nThe only question is: Where are the one-third who are desperately needed to defend America now and protect citizens\u2019 life, liberty and freedoms?\nWashington saw a government removing God-given rights and knew his responsibility was to act, to defend those rights.\nTyranny exists because bureaucrats and non-citizens are intentionally destroying nearly every area of citizens\u2019 rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness."}
