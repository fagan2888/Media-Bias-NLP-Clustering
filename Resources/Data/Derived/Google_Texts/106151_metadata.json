Kennedy\u2019s assassination threatens to be a little redundant: Conspiracy theories aside, we probably know about as much as we\u2019ll ever get to know about that awful November day.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Leisure Newsletter\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that remembering the tragedy isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s just to point out that the most interesting of the JFK-themed programs scheduled to air in the run-up to the Nov. 22 anniversary will be the ones that take a fresh approach.\n\nJFK: The Final Hours, which premieres Nov. 8 on the National Geographic Channel, is one of those. The documentary focuses solely on the 24 hours preceding the moment the shots were fired at Dealey Plaza. In that span, the president and first lady visited San Antonio, Houston and Fort Worth before touching down at Love Field in Dallas.\n\nAlternating with fascinating behind-the-scenes footage, historians and biographers give context to the speeches and early re-election campaign glad-handing. But the most gripping testimony comes from everyday folks who were accidental witnesses to history.\n\nThere\u2019s a member of the Texas Boys Choir, who as a nine-year-old sang for the First Couple at a breakfast that morning; women who were teenagers when they lined the Dallas motorcade route and strained to make eye contact with their idol; and Mexican immigrants who attended a fundraiser where the Kennedys made a surprise visit on the eve of the tragedy, with Jackie giving an impromptu speech in Spanish.\n\nThe firsthand connection of the film\u2019s narrator, actor Bill Paxton, adds poignancy. A photo shows Paxton, age 8, perched atop his father\u2019s shoulders as Kennedy makes a speech outside a Ft. Worth hotel the morning of Nov. 22.\n\n>> Get entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nAs the hours peel away and Dealey Plaza approaches, the sense of dread builds. The two-hour special beautifully summons an innocence that America has never recaptured, and a sadness that lingers half a century on.\n\n>>More on JFK and the anniversary, including a remembrance by CBS journalist Bob Schieffer, and a slideshow of Kennedy family life starting in the late 1950s.\n\nNatGeo Channel\u2019s other, glitzier JFK entry, Killing Kennedy, isn\u2019t quite as successful. Premiering Sunday, Nov. 10, it\u2019s based on the bestseller by Bill O\u2019Reilly and Martin Dugan. This isn\u2019t a documentary, but a feature film \u2013 and an impressive-looking one at that. Despite Rob Lowe\u2019s star power in the role of JFK, it feels rushed, cramming too much into its 90 minutes, without adding much that we haven\u2019t seen before.
