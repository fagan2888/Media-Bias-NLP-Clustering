CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Plain Dealer reporter Casey Ross will moderate a public forum in Beachwood Tuesday night about how rapid changes in the health care industry are affecting consumers.

The forum, free and open to the public, will bring together several local experts to discuss a range of issues, including consolidation by health care providers and insurers, increases in out-of-pocket costs for patients, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

The discussion will run from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Case Western Reserve University's Siegal facility at 26500 Shaker Blvd. in Beachwood.

Panelists include Dr. Todd Zeiger, vice president of University Hospitals' Primary Care Institute; Heather Thiltgen, a senior vice president at Medical Mutual; and Sarah Hackenbracht, executive director of the Cuyahoga Health Access Partnership.

The event is the first in a series of public policy forums to be held throughout the year. Future events will address economic development, the 2016 presidential primaries, the Republican National Convention, pre-school education, and more.

The series is being sponsored by Case Western Reserve University, the League of Women Voters, The Plain Dealer, cleveland.com, and the Lakewood and Cuyahoga County library systems. The corporate sponsor for the series is First Interstate Properties Ltd.
