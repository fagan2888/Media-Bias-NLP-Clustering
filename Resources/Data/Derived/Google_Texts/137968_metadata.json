Here are just a few things that are already at work and will be for the rest of the Obama administration. The odd part of this matrix is that no one in a lame-duck administration will likely acknowledge the reality that they are on their way out, and hence will not to be taken very seriously by most anyone.\n\nMost taxpayers do not generally understand the dynamics of a lame-duck administration detailed above \u2013 nor would they agree with the inefficiencies caused thereby. Most foreign governments do understand, however, and they simply go into temporary hibernation insofar as their willingness to do serious business with us during this awkward period of political transition.\n\nDoes it also mean that the president and his key staff are increasingly isolated from political and practical reality? While they might never admit it \u2013 as it\u2019s very hard on the political ego to accept the reality of diminished influence, especially indifference \u2013 it\u2019s simply a political fact of life in Washington.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s also the way we want it to be \u2013 we are famous for loving our presidents when they first come in and then being glad to see them go, especially toward the end of two terms. It\u2019s not personal so much as it is simply overexposure and media fatigue. In fact, many \u2013 if not most of us \u2013 believe that it\u2019s already time for a new show in town, and that 2016 can\u2019t be here soon enough.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "A Lame-Duck Administration Means More Travel, Less Substance for Appointees", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Life in the final years of a presidential administration abides by its own set of logic and inefficiencies.", "title": "Lame Duck and Cover", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/12/04/a-lame-duck-administration-means-more-travel-less-substance-for-appointees", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/02/bfe59aa0271e93fbb03e177ef14088/media:2d1f158cd20046869d3c661313f3f896ObamaImmigration.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Life in the final years of a presidential administration abides by its own set of logic and inefficiencies.", "card": "summary", "title": "A Lame-Duck Administration Means More Travel, Less Substance for Appointees"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Daniel J.
