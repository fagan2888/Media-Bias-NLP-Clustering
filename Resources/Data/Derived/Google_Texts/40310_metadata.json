Stetson\u2019s mother stayed with a family while she waited for help.\n\nMeanwhile, the rain started falling again.\n\nThe convoys picked up the residents stranded by floodwaters in Lyons and brought them to drier ground, where the people got on buses to go to an evacuation center at LifeBridge Church.\n\nBuses dropped off dazed people, then turned around to get more.\n\nThe evacuees carried boxes, animals, suitcases \u2014 whatever they were able to grab. Some elderly people were helped with wheelchairs, and children were still in pajamas.\n\nAs they got off the buses, volunteers at the church were crying, watching families reunite.\n\nJamie and Nate Mohatt had only been in Lyons 10 days when the sirens woke them up in the middle of Wednesday night. They came from Connecticut, where they lived through two hurricanes.\n\nThey lost power and sewer service, but their home is on high ground and they stayed in place with daughters Lucia, 3, and Esme, 8.\n\n\u201cThe scariest thing was, you never knew when it was going to hit,\u201d Jamie Mohatt said, referring to smelling natural gas through the rain for two days.\n\nWhen the girls got off the bus, they had on shoes and socks and their pajamas, and they were hungry.\n\nRob and Lynda Clayton live in a mobile home park in Lyons. They woke up in the middle the night Wednesday and knew there was trouble, so they went to the church in town. When that was evacuated, they went to the shelter set up at the elementary school\n\n\u201cAt first, it was all chaos and terrifying,\u201d Rob Clayton said.\n\nThey said the people in the community rallied together to get meals, blankets and clothes for everyone.\n\nLynda Clayton works at the organic market in town. She said she recognized items from the shelves of the market, which had flooded.\n\nFor the couple, leaving Lyons was a relief, but also worrisome.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we have anything,\u201d Lynda Clayton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get to go home. It\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s the scariest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado floods: Lyons residents rescued by National Guard", "title": "Colorado floods: Lyons residents rescued by National Guard", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/colorado-floods-lyons-residents-rescued-by-national-guard/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__national_guard_lyons_school_busp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__national_guard_lyons_school_busp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T09:41:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:40:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6f1\"", "article_summary": "She found her mother, Cheron Boland, in one of the National Guard trucks coming out of town.\nBOULDER COUNTY \u2014 The first of three convoys came from Lyons on Friday morning carrying loads of residents smiling and waving as they passed the roadblocks amid cheers.\nJamie and Nate Mohatt had only been in Lyons 10 days when the sirens woke them up in the middle of Wednesday night.\nStetson is still looking for her father, Jerry Boland, who did not evacuate with his wife .\nThey woke up in the middle the night Wednesday and knew there was trouble, so they went to the church in town."}
