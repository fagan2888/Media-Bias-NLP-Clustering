She threw down a blistering sub-60-second last lap and won her second consecutive U.S. title.\n\nThe victory came in 4 minutes, 14.86 seconds at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., just ahead of Shannon Rowbury, who placed second in 4:14.99. Kerri Gallagher finished third in 4:15.81.\n\nIt was an uncharacteristic race for Simpson and mirrored tactics taken by her training partner, Emma Coburn, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase Saturday.\n\n\u201cI get nervous still,\u201d Simpson, a former University of Colorado distance runner, told NBC after the race. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in that crowd and think, \u2018Trust yourself, trust yourself.\u2019 But this is exactly what we practice for \u2014 to be able to win in any type of tactical race. But I\u2019ll tell you what: It felt good the last 400 that I just had to run strong and I would come home with the win. It made the last 400 a little easier.\u201d\n\nSimpson had earned a bye into the Aug. 22-30 world championships in Beijing because she was last year\u2019s Diamond League champion in the event. So she didn\u2019t need to race, but wanted to go through the preliminaries and finals regardless. OTC Elite\u2019s Lauren Johnson, who finished fourth in the race, will compete in Beijing because of Simpson\u2019s bye.\n\nIt was Simpson\u2019s eighth overall U.S. title: She earned two in the steeplechase (2007 and 2009) while with the Buffaloes and was the 2013 U.S. 5K champion.\n\nIn the 110-meter hurdles, Denver East High School product David Oliver, who also earned a bye into worlds as the 2013 defending champion, won another U.S. title in 13.04 seconds \u2014 a season best.\n\nOliver did not get out as fast as others, but he made up ground quickly \u2014 cleanly making it over all hurdles but fifth and ninth. He might have dipped under 13 seconds with a cleaner race.\n\nRonnie Ash finished second in 13.13, Aries Merritt was third in 13.19 and Aleec Harris was fourth in 13.25. Harris will go to Beijing because Oliver has an automatic bid.\n\nOliver, now a four-time U.S. outdoor champion, was the world champion in 2013.\n\nThis win comes after he recently fired his coach, 81-year-old legend Brooks Johnson, who didn\u2019t approve of Oliver attending his best friend\u2019s wedding a week before the Prefontaine Classic, an important meet in early June. Johnson let the media know how he felt, and Oliver responded with an e-mail to Johnson that eventually went public.\n\n\u201cI had to let Brooks go,\u201d Oliver told The Denver Post last week. \u201cIt was time for a change. He sent a nasty text message out to the media, and I just had enough. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it face to face, so I had to e-mail him my feelings on things and how this just wasn\u2019t going to work anymore.\u201d\n\nIn the women\u2019s 5,000 meters, Kara Goucher finished a disappointing 18th. Her performance came just weeks after she alleged in a joint story published by the BBC and ProPublica that her former coach, Alberto Salazar of the Nike Oregon Project, had skirted anti-doping rules and forced runners to take medications they weren\u2019t prescribed while she was a part of the team. She said his tactics caused her to leave the team several years ago.\n\nThe story has ricocheted through the insular world of track and field, and moved the Colorado Springs-based U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to open an investigation into Salazar and his team.\n\nGoucher is living once again in Boulder and trains with Simpson and former Colorado runners Coburn and Shalaya Kipp.\n\n\u201cToday it definitely kind of caught up with me,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cI\u2019m human like everybody else. Much as I\u2019ve tried to separate myself from it and focus on all the positives that have come from it, I think I\u2019m very tired.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jenny Simpson, David Oliver win 1500, 110 hurdles at USA Track and Field Championships", "title": "Jenny Simpson, David Oliver win 1500, 110 hurdles at USA Track and Field Championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/28/jenny-simpson-david-oliver-win-1500-110-hurdles-at-usa-track-and-field-championships/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150629__david-oliver-usa-outdoor-championshipsp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150629__david-oliver-usa-outdoor-championshipsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-28T19:46:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:53:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc60\"", "article_summary": "Watching Jenny Simpson race in the 1,500-meter final Sunday at the U.S.\nRonnie Ash finished second in 13.13, Aries Merritt was third in 13.19 and Aleec Harris was fourth in 13.25.\nOliver, now a four-time U.S. outdoor champion, was the world champion in 2013.\nIt was an uncharacteristic race for Simpson and mirrored tactics taken by her training partner, Emma Coburn, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase Saturday.\nJohnson let the media know how he felt, and Oliver responded with an e-mail to Johnson that eventually went public."}
