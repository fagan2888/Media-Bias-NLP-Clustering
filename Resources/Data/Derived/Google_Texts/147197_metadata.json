Berwick, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.\n\nThe injunction will prevent the government from enforcing the mandate as the suit makes its way through the legal system. However, the groups still must comply with all of the other ObamaCare regulations.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the ministries object to providing four out of 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives, including the morning-after pill and the week-after pill, which they allege may cause early abortions.\n\nThe groups include Reaching Souls International, which trains pastors and cares for orphans in Africa, India and Cuba, and Truett-McConnell College, a Georgia Baptist college.\n\nIn his 16-page decision, Judge Timothy DeGiusti said the ministries have the right to challenge the health care law's contraceptive mandate and that an injunction is needed to prevent the federal government from enforcing it on them.\n\nThe lawsuit is similar to one filed in Oklahoma City last year by Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which calls itself a \"biblically founded business.\" That lawsuit also challenges the mandate that employers provide coverage for the morning-after pill and similar drugs. In July, a federal judge granted a temporary exemption to the Oklahoma City-based arts and crafts chain, a ruling the government has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHobby Lobby's lawsuit claims the government mandate is forcing the Christian family that owns the chain \"to violate their deeply held religious beliefs under threat of heavy fines, penalties and lawsuits.\" Failure to provide the drugs in the company's health insurance plan could lead to fines of up to $1.3 million a day, the company said.\n\nHobby Lobby's owners have said they believe life begins at conception, and they oppose birth control methods that can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, such as an intrauterine device or forms of emergency contraception.\n\nDeGiusti repeatedly referred to the Hobby Lobby case in his ruling and said the ministries who refuse to provide the contraceptives also \"face substantial financial penalties, and their refusal will cause a substantial financial loss to GuideStone if it excludes nonexempt, noncompliant organizations from the GuideStone plan.\"\n\n\"Here, as in Hobby Lobby, the court finds that plaintiffs have made a threshold showing of a substantial burden, and, thus, a likelihood of success,\" the ruling states.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
