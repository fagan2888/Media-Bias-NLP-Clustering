Romley, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Southern California's Price School of Public Policy and an economist at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, who co-authored four of the new papers.\n\nThere are more than one million people in the U.S. living with HIV/AIDS. Romley explains that a \u201cgeneration free of HIV\u201d means that over time, HIV would become very rare. \u201cIt\u2019s something that would happen gradually,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo have that prospect in sight is a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Romley notes that there are still significant barriers to overcome. As of 2010, only 17 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS had private health insurance. And while the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, could expand access to testing and early treatment, the researchers are concerned that existing care programs could face budget cuts.\n\nTaken as a whole, the new research\u2014which includes contributions from scientists at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics; the University of California, Los Angeles; Stanford University; and Bristol-Meyers Squibb\u2014highlights the benefits of early HIV treatment and advocates for policies to ensure that those who need it get it.\n\nTruvada for PrEP: Experts Weigh In on the Newest Way to Prevent HIV/AIDS \u00bb\n\nAdding Years to Patients\u2019 Lives\n\nIn two studies on life expectancy and the prevention of new HIV cases, the researchers focused on the period between 1996\u2014the year a highly effective treatment known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) became available\u2014and 2009, when U.S. medical guidelines began recommending cART at earlier stages of the disease.\n\nThe stages of HIV are determined based on a patient\u2019s CD4 white blood cell count, measured per milliliter of blood. Falling CD4 counts mean that the disease is worsening.\n\nSince being introduced, cART has been the standard treatment for patients with advanced HIV, who have CD4 counts below 350. However, the new research examined the benefits of cART for patients who received \u201cearly treatment\u201d when their CD4 counts were between 350 and 500.\n\n\u201cThere was reason to believe [in 1996] that early treatment could be beneficial, and some doctors were recommending it,\u201d notes Romley.\n\nStarting treatment early added years to HIV patients\u2019 lives. The researchers estimate that patients who received early treatment gained six years of life, compared to those who waited until their CD4 counts fell below 350. Patients who had \u201cvery early\u201d treatment\u2014at CD4 counts above 500\u2014experienced even greater benefits: an additional nine years of life.\n\nGo In-Depth with Truvada Patient Patient Michael Rubio \u00bb\n\nNearly 25 Percent Fewer HIV Cases\n\nTo determine how many HIV cases cART prevented during the study period, researchers used a model that predicts the incidence of HIV based on sexual transmission and progression of the disease. The study assumes\u2014conservatively, based on past research\u2014that a patient who receives cART is 90 percent less infectious than an untreated person with early-stage HIV.\n\nThe findings highlight the benefits of cART: without early treatment, the model predicts that there would have been 962,000 new HIV cases between 1996 and 2009. The actual number was nearly 25 percent lower, at roughly 772,500 new cases. \u201cVery early\u201d treatment accounted for four-fifths of the prevented cases.\n\n\u201cBecause some people with HIV got treatment early, [from] 1996 to 2009, almost 190,000 people in the U.S. never had to bear the burden of HIV, nor their families and loved ones,\u201d says Romley.\n\nNewly Diagnosed With HIV? 'You've Got This' \u00bb\n\nThe \u201cTest and Treat\u201d Strategy\n\nScientific advances like cART have led to the development of the \u201ctest and treat\u201d strategy for reducing the spread of HIV. In one of the new papers, the researchers claim, \u201cthese changes raise the prospect that for the first time since the 1980s, an entire generation might be free of HIV.\u201d\n\nThe basic idea of the test and treat strategy, Romney explains, is to implement widespread testing to reach the more than 18 percent of people with HIV/AIDS who don\u2019t know they have it. Once diagnosed, the goal is for patients to start cART immediately and stay in treatment.\n\nHowever, of the 1.1 million people living with HIV or AIDS in the U.S., only one in three is currently receiving cART.\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage greater testing,\" says Romley. \"For people who test positive, we need to make sure they get linked to good doctors who will see them regularly. We need to make sure they have access to treatment in the form of antiretroviral therapy.\u201d\n\nThere is evidence that the test and treat strategy is effective. One of the new studies found that a strategy focused on getting HIV patients to start and stick with treatment is the most likely to meet public health goals in Los Angeles County, including reducing the number of new HIV infections.\n\nRead More: Scientists Discover How HIV Becomes Drug Resistant \u00bb\n\nThe Promise\u2014and Pitfalls\u2014of the ACA\n\nLack of health insurance is a barrier that keeps people with HIV from starting and adhering to treatment, the researchers note.\n\nThe ACA has the potential to improve access to testing and early treatment. One of the new studies found that the ACA will result in nearly 500,000 more people being tested for HIV by 2017, along with a 22 percent drop in the proportion of people who don\u2019t know they have HIV.\n\nHowever, in another new study, researchers note that nearly 60,000 uninsured, low-income people with HIV/AIDS live in states that have opted not to expand Medicaid under the ACA. If people in this group can\u2019t access early treatment, the evidence suggests that they will lose multiple years of life, Romley says.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of Medicaid as gold-plated insurance\u2014and it isn\u2019t,\u201d adds Romley, \u201cbut the evidence is that even modest public insurance has benefits relative to not having insurance for the HIV population.\u201d\n\nOne alternative is the federal Ryan White Program, which serves more than 500,000 HIV/AIDS patients each year, operating as a \u201cpayer of last-resort\u201d to facilitate access to cART and other services. However, Romley says that the program isn\u2019t as comprehensive as Medicaid and that some states have waiting lists.\n\nThere is also concern among healthcare providers that once the ACA is fully implemented, lawmakers may cutback or terminate the Ryan White Program.\n\nIn addition to cART, the program offers important secondary services that health insurance doesn\u2019t usually provide, such as case management and housing supplements. These services help patients stay healthy and in treatment.\n\n\u201cEven as we move toward\u2014maybe not quite getting there, but substantially toward\u2014universal coverage in the U.S., the Ryan White program should not be forgotten,\u201d says Romley.\n\nRelated News: 50,000 HIV Patients Will Gain Coverage Under Obamacare, Medicaid \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "HIV, AIDS, cART, ART, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA, test and treat, life expectancy", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "New research stresses the benefits of early treatment for HIV patients and points to a possible future in which HIV is rare or nonexistent.", "title": "A Generation Free of HIV May Be Within Reach, New Research Suggests", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hiv-a-generation-without-hiv-is-on-the-horizon-030314", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/HIVdrugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/HIVdrugs.jpg", "description": "New research stresses the benefits of early treatment for HIV patients and points to a possible future in which HIV is rare or nonexistent.", "card": "summary", "title": "A Generation Free of HIV May Be Within Reach, New Research Suggests"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-03", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "New research stresses the benefits of early treatment for HIV patients and points to a possible future in which HIV is rare or nonexistent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94fc\"", "article_summary": "Romley explains that a \u201cgeneration free of HIV\u201d means that over time, HIV would become very rare.\nThe stages of HIV are determined based on a patient\u2019s CD4 white blood cell count, measured per milliliter of blood.\nRelated News: 50,000 HIV Patients Will Gain Coverage Under Obamacare, Medicaid \u00bb\nStarting treatment early added years to HIV patients\u2019 lives.\nIf people in this group can\u2019t access early treatment, the evidence suggests that they will lose multiple years of life, Romley says."}
