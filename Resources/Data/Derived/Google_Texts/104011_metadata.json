The natural job for him, at his alma mater, Nebraska, went to Oregon State\u2019s Mike Riley.\n\nBut after checking out who might be interested, or be talked into being interested, and fielding calls and communications from those advocating for their clients or staff members, CSU could weigh everything, decide to strike \u201cinterim\u201d from Baldwin\u2019s job title and be in good shape.\n\nAfter McElwain\u2019s three-season stint, the Rams have a good thing going.\n\nFormer CSU tight end Crockett Gillmore of the Ravens and former CSU center Weston Richburg of the New York Giants both weighed in:\n\nI hope to see @CoachBaldwinTD become the Head coach @CSUFootball it was an honor to play for him! pic.twitter.com/SBQigEoXir \u2014 Crockett Gillmore (@CrockettG7) December 4, 2014\n\nI would really like to see @CSUFootball hire from within. Keep some continuity and keep this thing rollin. Some quality men on that staff \u2014 Weston Richburg (@westonrichburg) December 4, 2014\n\nBaldwin, McElwain\u2019s offensive coordinator, is well-liked and respected by the players. He oversaw an offense that averaged 497.8 yards per game this season, and his tutelage helped Garrett Grayson claim virtually all CSU career passing records \u2014 with the bowl game remaining. The offense was a bit of a hybrid, with McElwain bringing a lot of what he did at Alabama, but also with both he and Baldwin being adaptive to piece together what would work here.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re smart enough to understand that you have to adjust to the talent you have,\u201d Baldwin said in September. \u201cI think at Alabama, you could line up and say you were going to pound it against anybody and stay in the game and have great defense.\n\n\u201cHere, we\u2019re going to have to explode on offense. You see very creative formations with us, which I don\u2019t think they\u2019d allow (at Alabama). \u2026 A lot of the play-action and everything is the same. We\u2019re trying to flavor things and look different, but football doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nSometimes forgotten is that he was McElwain\u2019s boss, so to speak, during their time together at Michigan State, when he was offensive coordinator and McElwain was wide receivers coach. And after getting the job at CSU, McElwain hired Baldwin away from Utah State.\n\nBaldwin, 59, is from the Jack Elway coaching tree, having worked for John\u2019s father on staffs at Cal State-Northridge, San Jose State and Stanford. Here\u2019s my story during the season on Baldwin. He has been a head coach at Santa Barbara City College (1990-93), Santa Rosa Junior College (1995), Cal State-Northridge (1995) and San Jose State (1997-2000).\n\nYes, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit weird, if both CU and CSU\u2019s coaches were former San Jose State head coaches?\n\nThe Spartans were 18-27 under Baldwin in four seasons, but there\u2019s much more to that than meets the eye. They were 4-7, 4-8 and 3-7 in Baldwin\u2019s first three seasons, then 7-5 in 2000, losing their final two games. They beat both Stanford and then seventh-ranked Texas Christian. But all in all, in an underfunded program with horrible facilities in what then was a decent Western Athletic Conference, that was impressive work and he had the Spartans moving in the right direction.\n\nHis exit was bizarre and amounted to a contract dispute over what now seems to be a relatively minuscule amount of money and Baldwin and his agent balking at ridiculous terms as well. He was offered a three-year contract with a base salary of $160,000. If the Spartans went 8-0 in the WAC, a year would have been added to the deal. If they went 4-4, a year would have been knocked off the term. And if they went 3-5 or worse, the contract was over \u2014 meaning he would have have been fired under the terms of his contract.\n\nThis is oversimplifying, but rather than accept that ridiculous offer, Baldwin and his agent submitted a counteroffer of a $185,000 three-year deal, but San Jose State\u2019s posture was take it or leave it, and Baldwin was shocked when he heard the university had issued a release saying he no longer was the Spartans\u2019 coach.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to look over the San Jose Mercury News clips about his exit.\n\n\u201cThis is utterly amazing to me,\u201d Baldwin said the night the news broke. \u201cI was still in negotiations, I thought \u2026 We did everything right for this university. Seven wins is the most in the state of California. I have raised the GPA of the football team. I have graduated the student-athletes at a higher rate than they have ever graduated. We had nine all-WAC players, the most ever.\u201d\n\nBut he moved on, to Cincinnati, Baylor, Michigan State, New Mexico and Utah State.\n\nAnd now he deserves to be considered a bona fide candidate for the CSU job.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true if CSU for whatever reason wants to avoid a repeat of the McElwain departure circumstances, which is the risk of going with a \u201chot\u201d younger coordinator, whether one with CSU ties or otherwise. (Frankly, I see nothing wrong with a repeat of what happened with McElwain because it will be a sign of on-field success, but it seems to offend many, and that\u2019s even before you get to the issue of what kind of buyout, including other escape provisions, will be in the contract.)\n\nBaldwin deserves to be considered simply on merit. He was an integral part of what got this program going, and he could carry on that momentum. The other in-house candidates could be co-defensive coordinators Al Simmons and Marty English, and assistant head coach/linebackers Tim Skipper.\n\nBaldwin met with the media Thursday after being named the interim coach.\n\n\u201cThe goal for us is to finish the season the way we want to finish it, and that\u2019s a bowl win that will take this program, whether it\u2019s me or anybody, to the next level,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nI asked him if he wanted to be considered for the full-time job, and \u2014 as was included in the stories from that day \u2014 he said \u201cdefinitely,\u201d and gave examples of programs that benefited from staying in-house after coaching departures. (He could have added Oregon, where Mike Bellotti, Chip Kelly and Mark Helfrich were on the staff before moving up.)\n\nHe said of his messages to the players about moving on: \u201cI told them this program has always been and always will be about players. There\u2019s going to be another head coach come in and another one after that and another one after that. The players make the program and if we stay together as a family and create that continuity and stick to that continuity, we\u2019ll have a great chance \u2026 Truthfully, why we won this year and were 10-2, it was a great atmosphere and the kids stuck together. And that\u2019s what we need to make sure happens for the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nBaldwin noted: \u201cI\u2019ve been through this so many times. In the long run, you love a head coach. But when that head coach goes and somebody else comes in, they adapt. That\u2019s what life\u2019s all about, and these kids are going to understand that there\u2019s changes. If they only came for a head coach, they didn\u2019t come to Colorado State for the right reason. If you came for the family atmosphere here, if you came for the education, if you came for the climate and where we are, then you came for the right reasons. If you came for a head coach, you made the wrong decision because those changes are going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe said of his relationship with McElwain: \u201cI really learned the procedure of what he got out of being at Alabama and just attention to detail \u2026 There\u2019s not a stone unturned.\u201d\n\nAsked again about \u201cwhose\u201d offense this was at CSU, he said, \u201cHe was the head coach and the head coach gets the credit. It\u2019s a combination of this offensive staff \u2014 Art Valero (tight ends coach), Derek Frazier (offensive line), Alvis Whitted (wide receivers), Jeff Hammerschmidt (running backs) \u2014 that put it together. \u2026 But if you called anyone in this conference and talked about what our offense is, they\u2019re going to say it\u2019s Dave Baldwin\u2019s. They\u2019re going to tell you the influence there is Dave Baldwin\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI was that head coach and I walked away \u2026 I left Gary Andersen (then the Utah State coach, and he moved on to Wisconsin) and who knows if I didn\u2019t leave, what would have happened. We turned that offense around. I think I made coach Mac a better coach, too, and I think each experience makes you a better football coach too.\u201d\n\nI asked him if he got the job, would he consider it his dream job and would he view it as his last stop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a procedure down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make guarantees in life for anything. I don\u2019t see myself leaving any place if I get the head job. I bought a house in town. But there\u2019s no guarantees in life. You just have to go on and see what happens.\u201d\n\nHe said of the upcoming bowl game, most likely the Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 20: \u201cWe want to go out as winners. This isn\u2019t an audition for Dave Baldwin. This isn\u2019t an audition for our coaching staff. \u2026 This is for us to finish the way we should finish.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado State,Crockett Gillmore,Dave Baldwin,Jim McElwain,Weston Richburg", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "The case for Dave Baldwin as Colorado State's next football coach is rooted in his past, the unlikeliness of his leaving, and having program continuity.", "title": "The case for Dave Baldwin as Colorado State's next coach", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/12/06/colorado-state-explore-sure-dave-baldwins-job-lose/32872/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/12/dave-baldwin-495x373.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The case for Dave Baldwin as Colorado State's next football coach is rooted in his past, the unlikeliness of his leaving, and having program continuity.", "creator": "@TFrei", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/12/06/colorado-state-explore-sure-dave-baldwins-job-lose/32872/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/12/dave-baldwin-495x373.jpg", "title": "The case for Dave Baldwin as Colorado State\u2019s next football coach", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The case for Dave Baldwin as Colorado State's next football coach is rooted in his past, the unlikeliness of his leaving, and having program continuity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1db9\"", "article_summary": "The case for Dave Baldwin, the Rams\u2019 interim head coach for the upcoming bowl game, is not just based on the man himself, but also the concept of continuity and stability.\nIf they only came for a head coach, they didn\u2019t come to Colorado State for the right reason.\nYes, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit weird, if both CU and CSU\u2019s coaches were former San Jose State head coaches?\nBut when that head coach goes and somebody else comes in, they adapt.\nThere\u2019s going to be another head coach come in and another one after that and another one after that."}
