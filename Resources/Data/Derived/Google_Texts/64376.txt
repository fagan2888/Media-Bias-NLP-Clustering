It’s been twelve years since the deadly workplace shooting at Lockheed Martin.

On July 3, 2003 gunman Doug Williams shot and killed six people and injured eight others before turning on himself. The whole thing lasted around ten minutes. That tragic morning was said to be the result of a depressed racist man who made threats to his black co-workers before finally snapping.

Since the deadly shooting, family members of the victims have held a reconciliation week to mark the anniversary. For families of the victims, Reconciliation Week is about bridging the gap between cultural differences, and moving forward to become a more equal and diverse country and to rid the mindset of those who would commit such cowardly acts. The Reconciliation Committee’s goal is to bring healing and unity among races.

Over the last twelve years, the events that take place during reconciliation week have grown, along with the cry for equality.
