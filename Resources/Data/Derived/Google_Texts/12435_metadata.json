In an interview with The Economist last week aboard Air Force One, which was supposed to focus on foreign policy, Mr Obama introduced the subject of business and launched a strident defence of his record. Bosses, he argued, have not given him due credit for running the economy well. And rather than grumbling about the burden of regulation and casting him as a class warrior, chief executives should think harder about society as a whole.\n\nThe full interview is here. But Mr Obama\u2019s impatience with Main Street is interesting, because the feeling is mutual. His administration provokes quiet fury from many corporate leaders: even Democrat-voting bosses moan about a White House that \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it\u201d. Some cite a president bent on redistribution and red tape as a reason not to invest in America.\n\nBut who is correct? The president\u2019s strongest card is macroeconomic policy (see chart). Mr Obama points to such measures as high stockmarket values, record corporate profits and job growth. How much of this he can claim credit for is a question debated by economists (see article). But, given the mess that he inherited, it is hard to claim that he has done badly. Indeed, CEOs tend to give fairly high marks to his economic team: they may not have enjoyed being lectured about Keynesian stimulus by Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, both now departed, but they sensed the economists knew their subject.\n\nThe main complaints from business are threefold. First, Mr Obama rarely misses a chance to cast them as the bad guys. In a speech in Kansas City just before the interview, he raised whoops by lambasting \u201cunpatriotic\u201d companies which (perfectly legally) register their headquarters overseas for tax purposes\u2014or, as he puts it, \u201cstash their money offshore\u201d. A fairer stance would be that America\u2019s corporate-tax system is a mess, which the president deserves part of the blame for failing to fix.\n\nThe second element is more personal. In face-to-face meetings, the White House\u2019s starting point is contempt. Bosses exchange horror stories about being herded in for photo-opportunities or being invited to the White House to suggest policy ideas\u2014only to find themselves accused of special pleading. Sooner or later the CEOs mention Valerie Jarrett, who many depict as the commissar of the West Wing.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Obama half fell into this stereotype, talking about CEOs only being motivated by shareholder value\u2014a caricature that infuriates business leaders who spend much of their time dealing with \u201cstakeholders\u201d of one sort or another. Mr Obama duly retreated, but only a little. Yes, he accepted that CEOs spend a lot of time on corporate social responsibility, but he still sees a gap between their professed values and how their firms lobby in Washington: \u201cMy challenge to them consistently is, is your lobbyist working as hard on those issues as he or she is on preserving that tax break that you\u2019ve got? And if the answer is no, then you don\u2019t care about it as much as you say.\u201d\n\nThe third complaint is over-regulation. Businesses moan that the White House has become a red-tape machine. Mr Obama responds that businesses will always find some regulations inconvenient, which is fair. Asked about the crushing complexity of flagship laws passed on his watch, such as the Dodd-Frank financial reforms or the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d), he is defensive. Given a blank canvas and a calmer political environment, they could have been \u201cfar more elegant\u201d. But democracy is \u201cmessy\u201d, he explains.\n\nEven allowing for that, many commercial sorts would say that the White House underestimates the cost of complexity. Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard (and a Republican) says large companies might be able to hire professionals to navigate America\u2019s over-complex, uncompetitive tax and regulatory systems, but small firms and entrepreneurs cannot. Other CEOs argue that Mr Obama\u2019s failure to rein in spending and simplify laws\u2014typified by his decision to ignore the bipartisan reforms to entitlements and the tax system suggested by the Simpson-Bowles commission\u2014will haunt America for a long time.\n\nBehind most of the antipathy sits one big issue and a lot of counter-productive language. The big issue is inequality. The president dismisses the idea that he is a class warrior. \u201cFeel free to keep your house in the Hamptons and your corporate jet,\u201d he assures the wealthy. That may be hard to take from a politician who has cited tax breaks on private planes in many a campaign speech. But there is no doubt where his sympathies lie. In Kansas City Mr Obama declared that the \u201cchallenge of our time\u201d is creating an economy that works for all America, which he defines as one in which workers earn enough to send their kids to college and\u2014after 20 or 30 years\u2014retire with dignity.\n\nTo the president, after two decades of middle-class wage stagnation, the best-paid need to avoid sounding ungrateful. \u201cThe folks who don\u2019t have a right to complain are the folks at the top,\u201d he said.\n\nThat will always put Mr Obama to the left of many corporate leaders. But the man on Air Force One was also plainly a long way from the socialist ogre that boardrooms fear. On a lot of issues, from immigration to infrastructure and even climate change, this generally pragmatic president is closer to Main Street than the Republicans are. But his language\u2014about tax-dodging companies and Hamptons swimming pools\u2014does not help him.\n\nHere is one piece of advice:\n\nBusinessmen have a different set of delusions from politicians, and need, therefore, different handling. They are, however, much milder than politicians, at the same time allured and terrified by the glare of publicity, easily persuaded to be \u201cpatriots\u201d, perplexed, bemused, indeed terrified, yet only too anxious to take a cheerful view, vain perhaps but very unsure of themselves, pathetically responsive to a kind word. You could do anything you liked with them, if you would treat them (even the big ones), not as wolves or tigers, but as domestic animals by nature, even though they have been badly brought up and not trained as you would wish. It is a mistake to think that they are more immoral than politicians. If you work them into the surly, obstinate, terrified mood, of which domestic animals, wrongly handled, are so capable, the nation\u2019s burdens will not get carried to market; and in the end public opinion will veer their way.\n\nThis is from a private letter that John Maynard Keynes sent to Franklin Roosevelt. Business bosses often clash with politicians, but today\u2019s gulf of mutual distrust is unusually wide. Mr Obama could probably do more to bridge it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140809_USD001_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Barack Obama\u2019s message to business", "description": "The president wants CEOs to play ball.
