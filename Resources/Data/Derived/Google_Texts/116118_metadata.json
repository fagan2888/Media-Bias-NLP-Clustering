Set-up will begin at 8 a.m. Friday; community members who would like to be included in the farmers market can pick up registration forms at the CRYP office in the Cokata Wiconi Teen Center.\n\nOn Saturday at 6 p.m., the grassroots, nonprofit youth project will host a 25th Anniversary Community Give-Away at the Eagle Butte wacipi grounds. Staff and volunteers will be hard at work assembling a 25th anniversary float for Eagle Butte\u2019s Labor Day Parade, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very 25th anniversary weekend,\u201d noted Julie Garreau, CRYP\u2019s executive director, with a laugh. \u201cThe year is winding down, and with it, our 12 months of 25th anniversary celebrations. This is a special weekend for the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation and for the Eagle Butte community, so we want to go all-out.\n\n\u201cThe float, in particular, is a big deal,\u201d she added. \u201cOur parade contribution has become a community favorite, and we\u2019re really looking forward to unveiling it on Monday morning.\u201d\n\nIn addition, CRYP\u2019s acclaimed Keya Cafe will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout the holiday weekend.\n\nRELATED: Social Enterprise Caf\u00e9 Builds Life Skills of Reservation Youth\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be offering our regular breakfast and lunch menus, as well as Indian tacos, menudo, wojapi, frybread, nachos, panini sandwiches, and soups,\u201d Garreau said. \u201cWe\u2019ll also have a build-your-own burger menu, including jalape\u00f1o cheddar burgers, cheeseburgers and chili burgers.\u201d\n\nGarreau said she\u2019s pleased that the youth project can play such a significant role on what has proven to be Cheyenne River\u2019s biggest weekend of the year.\n\n\u201cNot only does our entire community look forward to the fair for months, we welcome dancers, riders and visitors from around the country to share in our reservation-wide celebration,\u201d she said. \u201cOur mission is to ensure that CRYP is a true gathering place. A positive, safe place for our youth to socialize and play ball, yes, but also a place for our family, friends, neighbors, and guests to come together, enjoy good food and great company, and share this happy annual experience.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Cheyenne River Youth Project and its programs, and for information about making donations and volunteering, call 605-964-8200 or visit LakotaYouth.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor Day weekend is less than two weeks away, and that means it\u2019s time to start thinking about \u201cThe Fair\u201d on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/24/cheyenne-river-youth-project-prepares-25th-anniversary-festivities-156458", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cryp-20-anniversary.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Cheyenne River Youth Project Prepares for 25th Anniversary Festivities"}, "abstract": "Labor Day weekend is less than two weeks away, and that means it\u2019s time to start thinking about \u201cThe Fair\u201d on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation.", "dc": {"title": "Cheyenne River Youth Project Prepares for 25th Anniversary Festivities"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/24/cheyenne-river-youth-project-prepares-25th-anniversary-festivities-156458", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cheyenne River Youth Project, Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, Native American youth", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-24T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Cheyenne River Youth Project Prepares for 25th Anniversary Festivities"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3f4\"", "article_summary": "On Saturday at 6 p.m., the grassroots, nonprofit youth project will host a 25th Anniversary Community Give-Away at the Eagle Butte wacipi grounds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very 25th anniversary weekend,\u201d noted Julie Garreau, CRYP\u2019s executive director, with a laugh.\nEach year, Cheyenne River residents and visitors congregate in Eagle Butte, South Dakota for the annual Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Fair, Rodeo & Powwow\u2014this year\u2019s festivities are scheduled for Friday, August 29 to Monday, September 1.\n\u201cThe year is winding down, and with it, our 12 months of 25th anniversary celebrations.\nThis is a special weekend for the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation and for the Eagle Butte community, so we want to go all-out."}
