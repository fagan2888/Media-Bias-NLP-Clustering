Greve, a professor at George Mason University\u2019s law school, previously served as chairman of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), where he remains a board member. According to CEI\u2019s website, the organization that Greve used to chair is \u201ccoordinating and funding\u201d King v. Burwell, a case currently pending before the Supreme Court that is likely to strip health insurance away from at least 13 million people if it succeeds.\n\nGreve made his Holocaust comparison in a blog post criticizing various arguments raised by groups that filed amicus briefs explaining why the justices should not take health care away from millions of people. Though Greve spends fairly little time discussing a brief filed by America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the leading health insurance industry group, he does spend a paragraph analogizing AHIP\u2019s decision to back the Affordable Care Act to the network of railroad cars and death camps that Nazi Germany used to conduct much of the Holocaust:\n\nNumerous briefs come from hospital associations, doctors\u2019 groups, and of course America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. By helping the ACA over the hurdle, AHIP signed its corporate members\u2019 death warrant in exchange for the individual mandate, risk corridors, and a few other placebos. AHIP had the railroad cars to the camps neatly lined up; now, some plaintiffs are messing\u2014after NFIB, a second time\u2014with the tracks: how dare they.\n\n\u201cNFIB\u201d refers to National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the 2012 case asking the Supreme Court to repeal Obamacare, where the Court instead upheld most of the law. ThinkProgress discovered Greve\u2019s piece comparing Obamacare to the Holocaust after a link to it was retweeted by Jonathan Adler and Michael Cannon, two other key figures in the King litigation.\n\nThis is hardly the first time that Greve has used overblown rhetoric while talking about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 although we are not aware of another instance where he compared Obamacare to one of the greatest acts of state-sponsored evil in human history. At a 2010 panel where another panelist presented an early version of the legal theory behind King, Greve spoke of destroying the law that enabled millions to obtain health insurance as a matter of such superseding importance that it must be achieved by any means necessary:\n\nThis bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene. I do not care how this is done, whether it\u2019s dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart, whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town, whether we strangle it. I don\u2019t care who does it, whether it\u2019s some court some place, or the United States Congress. Any which way, any dollar spent on that goal is worth spending, any brief filed toward that end is worth filing, any speech or panel contribution toward that end is of service to the United States.\n\nTaken together, Greve\u2019s two statements about the Affordable Care Act go a long way towards explaining the motivations behind the King lawsuit. The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in King lack much legal support. They ask the Court to read a just a few words of the Affordable Care Act out of context to cut off tax credits intended to help people pay for health insurance in most of the country, when the statute as a whole does not support this interpretation. Just as importantly, the King plaintiffs ask the Court to ignore its own previous decisions, which establish that \u201ca reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation\u201d as the \u201cmeaning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d\n\nThe King plaintiffs have also been called out for misrepresenting the history of Obamacare\u2019s passage. One of their central claims, for example, is that former Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) insisted that the law be designed in a counterintuitive way that denies tax credits to the residents of many states. But their brief offers no evidence to support this claim beyond a citation to a news article discussing an irrelevant policy debate, and Nelson recently explained that he \u201calways believed that tax credits should be available in all 50 states regardless of who built the exchange, and the final law also reflects that belief as well.\u201d\n\nIn a must-read article published Thursday, the New York Times\u2018s Linda Greenhouse lays out how the justices\u2019 apparent willingness to allow themselves \u201cto be recruited into the front lines of a partisan war\u201d endangers the legitimacy of the Supreme Court itself. Greenhouse explains that a decision against Obamacare in King would not simply depart from accepted principles of statutory interpretation, it would depart from principles long-embraced by the Court\u2019s most conservative members. She bolsters her argument with quotes from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, as well as a citation to one of Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s most important federalism opinions. \u201cTo reject the government\u2019s defense of the law,\u201d Greenhouse explains, \u201cthe justices would have to suspend their own settled approach to statutory interpretation as well as their often-stated view of how Congress should act toward the states.\u201d\n\nAnd if the justices are willing to suspend their own principles to achieve a partisan end, that raises profound questions about why the one unelected branch of government should have this power in the first place.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it would be simply extraordinary for a litigant to ask the Supreme Court to, as Greenhouse suggests the King plaintiffs do, tear down its own institutional legitimacy for the sake of a single case. It would be even more extraordinary to imagine that the justices themselves would be willing to do so. But, at least according to Greve, this is not a normal circumstance. If you truly believe that extending health insurance to millions of Americans is an evil worthy of comparison to the Holocaust, then the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019s moral and intellectual credibility \u2014 the sole currency the justices can bring to bear when they ask the nation to obey their decisions \u2014 is a small price to pay for the sake of what Greve describes as \u201cpolitical hygiene.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If you are about to compare something to the Holocaust, and it isn't an act of mass genocide, don't.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "If you are about to compare something to the Holocaust, and it isn't an act of mass genocide, don't.", "title": "Leader Of Group Funding Supreme Court Case Against Obamacare Compares Health Reform To The Holocaust", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/02/05/3619545/leader-group-funding-supreme-court-case-obamacare-compares-health-reform-holocaust/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auschwitz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you are about to compare something to the Holocaust, and it isn't an act of mass genocide, don't.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auschwitz-321x214.jpg", "title": "Leader Of Group Funding Supreme Court Case Against Obamacare Compares Health Reform To The Holocaust", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auschwitz.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auschwitz.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-05T11:47:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0ed\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNFIB\u201d refers to National Federation of Independent Business v.
