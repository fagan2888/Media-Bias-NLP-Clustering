Scotland will remain a part of the United Kingdom following a historic vote Thursday, when 55 percent of voters declined to split Scotland from the U.K. versus 45 percent who voted for autonomy.\n\n\u201cThe people of Scotland have spoken, and it is a clear result. They have kept our country of four nations together, and like millions of other people, I am delighted,\u201d British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a news conference Friday. \u201cIt would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end.\u201d\n\nInstead, the broken hearts fall to a surprisingly strong Yes campaign for Scottish Independence. Led by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, the Yes campaign gained ground in recent weeks, creating a much closer final vote than many had expected. An early September poll from YouGov market research firm showed that a majority of Scots \u2013 51 percent \u2013 were in favor of Scottish secession.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the country voted Thursday in a historic election in which 97 percent of the country\u2019s 5.3 million people were registered to vote, according to The Guardian. A reported 84.6 percent turned out to the polls, according to CBC News, which far outstrips the about 56 percent of Americans who turned out in the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\u201cScotland has by majority decided not, at this stage, to become an independent country,\u201d Salmond said Friday, according to CBC News. \u201cI accept that verdict of the people, and I call on all of Scotland to follow suit in accepting the democratic verdict of the people of Scotland.\u201d\n\nOne voting center remained uncounted Friday morning, but the majority of Scots had by then voted not to pursue independence. The first six centers counted were all No-majority, according to CBC News. Only four centers were Yes-majority.\n\n\u201cThere can be no disputes, no reruns,\u201d Cameron said Friday, according to Reuters. \u201cWe have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.\u201d\n\nA final Ipsos-Mori poll released Thursday showed 53 percent of Scottish voters in the No camp, with 47 percent pro-Independence, according to the Guardian.\n\nScotland votes to keep the United Kingdom united. http://t.co/Fs749bbcN8 #indyref #5Things #NewDay pic.twitter.com/yxuJXpsuVO \u2014 New Day (@NewDay) September 19, 2014\n\n\n\nSalmond and Cameron signed a referendum back in 2012 that guaranteed Scotland a right to vote for its independence by the end of 2014, threatening to break up a relationship with England that dates back to 1707.\n\n\u201cToday is a momentous result for Scotland and also for the United Kingdom as a whole,\u201d said Alistair Darling, chair of the Better Together campaign, according to USA Today. \u201cBy confirming our place within the Union, we have reaffirmed all that we have in common and the bonds that tie us together. Let them never be broken.\u201d\n\nPro-secession Scots argued independence from the U.K. would allow for more autonomy in social and domestic affairs related to economic, energy and social policies, according to the Scottish National Party.\n\nThe Scots already have their own Parliament, along with their own judicial and education systems. But energy and economic policies are still shaped by the U.K., in which Scotland only accounts 59 seats in the 650-member Parliament, according to CBC News.\n\nCameron has been criticized by some Scottish business leaders for budget-slashing, according to The Associated Press. Some Scottish business leaders in support of the Yes campaign argued that independence would allow for more freedom to tap and price Scotland\u2019s oil and gas reserves.\n\nAs the Yes campaign gathered steam, British politicians hurriedly promised more economic and social freedoms to Scotland, along with Wales and Northern Ireland, according to Reuters. As he accepted defeat Friday, Salmond told British politicians that he had not forgotten about their promises.\n\nWe know there'll be a majority for 'No'. I call on all of Scotland to \"accept the democratic verdict\" - @AlexSalmond pic.twitter.com/T3tuUTei2f \u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) September 19, 2014\n\n\n\n\u201cScotland will expect these to be honored in rapid course,\u201d Salmond said Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nSalmond\u2019s defeat ended up being a victory for the British pound, which had been on a roller coaster path in the build up to a secession that could have had serious implications on economic policy beyond affording Scotland more freedom.\n\nThe pound rose sharply Friday morning before dipping off to $1.6394, according to The New York Times. The pound plummeted in early September to its lowest value since November 2013 as the financial world eyed Scotland\u2019s potential divorce from the United Kingdom.\n\nLondon stock index FTSE 100 gained 0.8 percent Friday, while the Nikkei index shot up 1.6 percent and the Hang Seng rose 0.6 percent. The news of a unified U.K. was a good one for institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Lloyds Banking Group and other firms that had threatened to reincorporate out of Scotland and into London in the event of a successful secession.\n\n\u201cThat contingency plan is no longer required,\u201d the R.B.S. said in a statement Friday, according to the Times. \u201cFollowing the result, it is business as usual for all our customers across the U.K. and R.B.S.\u201d\n\nThe same cannot be said for Cameron and the British Parliament, who may now face the daunting task of reconstructing the U.K.'s political system as it relates to Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Cameron said Friday he believed the individual regions' should be able to vote \"on their [independent] issues of tax, spending and welfare,\" according to Reuters.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "Scotland's Secession Unsuccessful as Voters Support the U.K.", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Friday was not the Scottish Independence Day that many had hoped for.
