He has attended a number of religious events with the Obama administration, offering a prayer at President Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and taking part in the 2014 National Prayer Breakfast.\n\nMateo Williamson, a cross-dressing woman and former co-chairman of the Transgender Caucus for Dignity USA, has also received an invitation to the White House for Pope Francis\u2019 visit. Williamson says that though she now thinks of herself as a man, she continues to be attracted to males. \u201cToday I identify as a gay man and before that was difficult to understand because I thought that in order to be transgender, in order to be a transgender male that I had to be attracted to females but I never have throughout my entire life.\u201d\n\n\u2026Another White House invitee for the Pope\u2019s visit, Sister Simone Campbell, is the pro-abortion executive director of the social justice lobby NETWORK.
