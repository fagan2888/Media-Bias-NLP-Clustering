Brown signed legislation that will allow doctors to practice with three years of medical school instead of four.\n\nIt\u2019s Ngabo Nzigira\u2019s sixth week of medical school, and he\u2019s already interacting with patients.\n\n\u201cSo we have the norco, you still taking that?\" he asks.\n\nNzigira is being trained by a doctor at Kaiser Permanente in South Sacramento. Normally he wouldn\u2019t be in a clinic until his third year. In this accelerated program, students can shave sixty thousand dollars off their medical school debt. But Nzigira had hesitations.\n\n\u201cI thought, 'Oh man, you want me to put the intensity and stress that is medical school in four years, you want me to condense it down to three years. I\u2019m not sure about that,'\u201d he says.\n\nThe UC Davis program is designed for students who know they want to be a primary care physician. It cuts out summer vacations and electives to get them into the field faster.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge problem, a huge shortage of primary care physicians,\" says Dr. Tonya Fancher who directs the program.\n\nUC Davis says it\u2019s meant to increase the supply of family doctors under the Affordable Care act.\n\n\u201cIt seems like students come into medical school and they\u2019re passionate about patients, passionate about primary care, part of it is the debt that they accrue, and part of it is the models of primary care that they\u2019re exposed to,\" says Fancher.\n\nOne patient says he\u2019s not concerned about shortened medical school - as long as students meet the same standards as other doctors.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "UC Davis has launched a three-year medical school program to get primary care physicians in the field faster.", "author": "Pauline Bartolone", "og": {"url": "http://www.capradio.org/28926", "image": {"width": 1333, "identifier": "http://www.capradio.org/media/2274929/Ngobo_Hallway_4109_primary.jpg", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "description": "UC Davis has launched a three-year medical school program to get primary care physicians in the field faster.", "title": "UC Davis is Trailblazer in Three-Year Medical School Model"}, "has_audio": 1, "robots": "index, follow", "nid": 28926, "keywords": "Capital Public Radio, CPR, UC Davis is Trailblazer in Three-Year Medical School Model", "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f8c\"", "article_summary": "A handful of UC Davis students are trailblazers in a new medical school model that has won the approval of Californian Governor Jerry Brown.\nIt\u2019s Ngabo Nzigira\u2019s sixth week of medical school, and he\u2019s already interacting with patients.\nThe UC Davis program is designed for students who know they want to be a primary care physician.\nBrown signed legislation that will allow doctors to practice with three years of medical school instead of four.\nIn this accelerated program, students can shave sixty thousand dollars off their medical school debt."}
