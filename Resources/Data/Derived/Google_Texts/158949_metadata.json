The City Council subsequently adopted a $96 million budget.\n\nWhatever the number, any new recruits would be a boon for a department that last welcomed 38 new firefighters in 2010. The city now has about 600 firefighters, fire apparatus operators, fire captains and deputy chiefs, down from 824 before Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNews of the possibility of more personnel was welcome to New Orleans Firefighters Association President Nick Felton, whose organization has long fought with the city over back pay, pension fund payments and upkeep of the department\u2019s equipment.\n\nBut Felton said even 40 new firefighters might not stem the department\u2019s bleeding. He has insisted for years that the city needs to make sure there are at least four firefighters on every engine that heads to a fire - two to get the water flowing and two more to head inside a burning structure.\n\n\u201cOfficially, we need new firefighters. No doubt about that. But I question their methodology,\u201d Felton said, implying that City Hall may be low-balling how many recruits are necessary.\n\nThough McConnell originally proposed two recruit classes, Felton said three or four would be better because up to 30 firefighters retire a year, and another 10 or 12 leave because of better job opportunities elsewhere.\n\nAn entry-level New Orleans firefighter, classified as a Firefighter I, makes about $32,000 annually, according to the city\u2019s job portal website. After one year of service and a certification, they receive $6,000 in supplemental pay. They also gain more pay boosts over time.\n\nFelton argues that\u2019s not competitive. In Austin, Texas, base firefighter pay starts at $50,922.\n\nAnyone interested in working for the Fire Department may visit www.joinnofd.org or call its Office of Community Relations at 504- 658-4713.\n\nApplicants must be at least 18 and have a high school diploma or general equivalency degree.\n\n\u201cArrests and convictions for felonies or numerous misdemeanors are disqualifying,\u201d the city said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The New Orleans Advocate, http://www.neworleansadvocate.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a five-year hiring freeze, the New Orleans Fire Department has started accepting applications for new recruits.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/10/new-orleans-fire-department-seeks-applicants/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "After a five-year hiring freeze, the New Orleans Fire Department has started accepting applications for new recruits.", "title": "New Orleans Fire Department seeks applicants"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "After a five-year hiring freeze, the New Orleans Fire Department has started accepting applications for new recruits.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Orleans Fire Department seeks applicants"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) - After a five-year hiring freeze, the New Orleans Fire Department has started accepting applications for new recruits.\nAn entry-level New Orleans firefighter, classified as a Firefighter I, makes about $32,000 annually, according to the city\u2019s job portal website.\nWhatever the number, any new recruits would be a boon for a department that last welcomed 38 new firefighters in 2010.\nIn Austin, Texas, base firefighter pay starts at $50,922.\nAnyone interested in working for the Fire Department may visit www.joinnofd.org or call its Office of Community Relations at 504- 658-4713."}
