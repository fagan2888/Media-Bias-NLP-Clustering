(NYSE:UNH) and Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM) \u2014 which would it be?\n\nIs there really that much of a difference? Both are leading healthcare stocks and both have been doing very well. ANTM has a slightly better price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 16 to 19 and its stock has done better slightly better in the past year.\n\nBoth companies are massive players in the healthcare sector, but how they are building their companies for the future is the differentiator.\n\nThere are two major trends happening for healthcare stocks right now, both thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, regardless of your opinion of Obamacare in general, the fact is, that major shifts in national policy signal huge opportunities for large companies that are able to capitalize on these shifts on a national level, and smart niche players that can offer unique solutions to new challenges.\n\nYou can also add to that the fact that some of these large players will also snap up some of these smaller players to increase their ability to profit from the new playing field.\n\nIn the case at hand, UNH has chosen to expanding its technology base, while ANTM has chosen to expand its customer base.\n\nHealthcare Stocks Showdown: UNH\n\nUNH has spent the past few years focused on growing its IT base and systems to be able to offer better solutions to its professional services clients as well as individual customers. The key aspect here is EMRs (electronic medical records).\n\nAll healthcare providers are mandated to transition to EMRs in coming years and this is an enormous commitment of time, money and labor. This alone is changing the face of the current healthcare system, as smaller players can\u2019t afford the conversion and look to merge with larger networks that can foot the bill.\n\nFor insurers it means they can offer services to healthcare providers in conversion, maintenance and analysis of the provider\u2019s health records to maximize their operations. They can also help the providers assure payment from insurers and state and federal government for their services.\n\nAnd most importantly, they can provide this information in the securest environment possible.\n\nThis is path UNH is taking to growth. The risk here is, where does the growth come from when all the records have been converted over and there is a new breed of EMR management firms that can do UNH\u2019s job better and cheaper?\n\nHealthcare Stocks Showdown: ANTM\n\nIf you recall the massive data breach Anthem \u2014 and 69 million of its clients \u2014 experienced earlier this year, you\u2019ll know that ANTM isn\u2019t looking for growth in the IT arena.\n\nANTM is looking for people. If the federal government is moving toward universal coverage for all its citizens, then finding a way to get as many people enrolled in health insurance as possible puts you on a parallel path with nation\u2019s most powerful employer and engine of growth.\n\nTo be sure, ANTM\u2019s bet on building its base has paid off handsomely up to now. But can it keep growing this way for much longer. Plus, data breach shows that ANTM hasn\u2019t done a great job unifying all the systems of its acquisition targets into one secure database; there may be other back doors left in some of these smaller systems that gave hackers access to the big prize of ANTM\u2019s main database of names.\n\nAnd if lawsuits question ANTM\u2019s liability in any of this, it could mean an unwanted diversion from its intended growth path. But that is all speculation.\n\nHealthcare Stocks Showdown: The Verdict\n\nSo, in our smackdown duel betwn UNH and ANTM, do we have a winner?\n\nNo, not really. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with either of these healthcare stocks for the next few years. But after that, you simply have to ask yourself whether you see more growth in the tech side of healthcare management or the subscriber side.\n\nLouis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.
