The U.S. spent an average of $9,086 per person on health care in 2013, which translated to more than 17 percent of gross domestic product, the fund noted.

That level of health spending relative to GDP is about 50 percent more than any of the countries studied for the report, which are Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The Commonwealth Fund said that in the U.S., the life expectancy in 2013 was an average of 78.8 years. By contrast, in Switzerland, which had the second-highest health spending per capita at $6,325, life expectancy was more than four years higher, at 82.9 years.

U.S. spending on government-sponsored health care was also significantly higher per capita than the other countries, "despite being the only country in the study without universal health coverage," the Commonwealth Fund said.

The U.S. government spent $4,197 per person in 2013 on health care, primarily for Medicare and Medicaid benefits. That's in contrast to the U.K., where all residents are covered by the National Health Service, and where the government's health-care spend was just $2,802 per person.
