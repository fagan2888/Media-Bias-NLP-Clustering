Cigar City Brewing's fifth annual Hunahpu's Day Release Party didn't go as planned on Saturday, and there were lots of disgruntled beer fans.

To make up for the trouble after the brewer was swamped with customers, the company is offering free beer in the tasting room today. And, refunds are available, according to a post on its Facebook page.

“If you purchased a ticket to Hunahpu's Day directly through Eventbrite.com, you will automatically be refunded your money,” Cigar City said in its post. “ We will begin these refunds starting Monday.

“If you paid for your ticket with cash or credit card in person, please email refund@cigarcitybrewing.com and we will directly communicate with you to determine the best way to get your money back.”

Video posted on the website Beerpulse.com shows angry customers after the brewer ran out of Hunahpu Imperial Stout, even though patrons were promised three bottles each.

According to the brewer's website, it brews the award-winning beer only once a year.

The brewer at 3924 W. Spruce St. acknowledged the event's shortcomings Saturday on its Facebook page: “So, today did not go as expected. We realize that there were a lot of issues with duplicate tickets, way too long waits in lines, and all of that. ...

“We're completely sorry for all issues that happened today. It really sucked. We completely understand how much it sucked and hate how much it sucked. We don't want it to suck ever again. We will do what we can to make it right.”

And, then the company made the free beer offer available today.

“We will not charge a dime for any beers served in the tasting room tomorrow. We are going to try and tap all of the remaining kegs leftover from today, too,” the posting said.
