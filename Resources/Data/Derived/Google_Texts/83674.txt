Top three issues:

On Obamacare/Medicaid expansion: “The continued growth of government has led our country into crippling debt. Obamacare and Medicaid expansion have set states on the same course as our federal government. We must have leaders who recognize that more government is not the answer. (As in) other states that have expanded Medicaid, Obamacare and Medicaid expansion in Tennessee would lead our state into unsustainable costs, while not truly addressing the health care need of those who are not able to obtain health insurance today.”

On a gas tax: “Tennessee has a $550 million surplus through the first 11 months of the state’s year. We do not need another tax. The solution is to utilize the surplus for the most critical issues facing our road systems today.”

On protecting the sanctity of life: “I have been asked more about my pro-life convictions over the last two weeks than at any other time in the last three years. I will always be a voice for the voiceless and defend those who are unable to defend themselves. I’m honored to have received the formal endorsement from Tennessee Right to Life and have a received a 100 percent pro-life rating.”
