Pearl is very happy to become a big sister. She diligently reads her \u2018I\u2019m a big sister\u2019 books every night & recites to me her plans of bathing, feeding, singing to, and holding the baby. We are more than halfway through this thing & are very excited to be parents again! Thanks for all the well wishes.\u201d\n\nJack, 29, and Lisa, 27, who married in 2012, sadly experienced a late-term miscarriage in 2013. But the couple, who\u2019ve faced other hurdles, including Jack\u2019s relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis diagnosis, have kept a positive outlook, focusing on Pearl\u2019s mini-moments.\n\n\u201cThe best has been Pearl hitting these major milestones from crawling to walking to talking,\u201d Jack told PEOPLE last year. \u201cThat\u2019s been really enjoyable for me to come home to after work.\u201d\n\nAs the couple looks toward the future, will more children be in sight? As grandma Sharon told PEOPLE in 2013, Jack \u201cwants about five kids and Lisa comes from a big family, too. They both want to have a whole brood.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kate Hogan\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Who\u2019s Due Next?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We are more than halfway through this thing and are very excited to be parents again,\" the mom-to-be writes on her blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "TITLE": "Jack Osbourne, Lisa Osbourne Pregnant Expecting Another Baby \u2013 Moms & Babies \u2013 Celebrity Babies and Kids - Moms & Babies - People.com", "HEADLINE": "Jack Osbourne, Lisa Osbourne Pregnant Expecting Another Baby \u2013 Moms & Babies \u2013 Celebrity Babies and Kids - Moms & Babies - People.com", "SECTION": "Moms & Babies", "og": {"site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "description": "\"We are more than halfway through this thing and are very excited to be parents again,\" the mom-to-be writes on her blog ...", "title": "Jack and Lisa Osbourne Expecting Another\u00a0Baby", "url": "http://celebritybabies.people.com/2015/02/21/jack-osbourne-lisa-osbourne-pregnant-expecting-again/", "image": "http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/cbb/blog/150301/jack-osbourne-300x400.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DATE_PUBLISHED": "February 21, 2015 | 9:20 pm", "fb": {"admins": "500091559,636967203,500060514,508981852,672882124"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://celebritybabies.people.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Celebrity Babies and Kids - Moms & Babies - People.com", "google-site-verification": "NhBIQ2SuMUQuLEbPGE1mK4WcRl1iIxGk0lVduuYKTfk", "keywords": "expecting, jack osbourne, lisa osbourne, news,", "PATH": "http://celebritybabies.people.com/2015/02/21/jack-osbourne-lisa-osbourne-pregnant-expecting-again/", "viewport": "width=1168px", "news_keywords": "jack osbourne baby, jack osbourne wife, lisa stelly osbourne, lisa osbourne baby, lisa osbourne miscarriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc393\"", "article_summary": "Jack Osbourne and wife Lisa announced Saturday that they\u2019re expecting again, posting a cute Instagram of their daughter, 2\u00bd, cradled on Mom\u2019s belly.\n\u201cThe best has been Pearl hitting these major milestones from crawling to walking to talking,\u201d Jack told PEOPLE last year.\nAs grandma Sharon told PEOPLE in 2013, Jack \u201cwants about five kids and Lisa comes from a big family, too.\nPaul Archuleta/FilmMagicPearl Clementine is going to be a big sister!\nLisa elaborated on her blog, RaddestMom.com, writing, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant!"}
