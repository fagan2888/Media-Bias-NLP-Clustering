I can\u2019t ride the bike or treadmill.\n\nMcGee said he\u2019s encouraged by this step, \u201cbeing able to get a sweat anaerobically\u201d which has coincided with good returns from x-rays done on his tibia, but was quick to make it known that it remains very early in the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an early step,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI\u2019m just staying positive and trying to stay in shape and get stronger.\n\nThere remains no timetable for his return.\n\n\u201cThe biggest step is just for it to heal,\u201d McGee said. \u201cSo, either way, if I get on the elliptical and go an hour, it doesn\u2019t matter if my shin doesn\u2019t heal.\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Danilo Gallinari,JaVale McGee", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Nuggets center JaVale McGee, who has been out since early November with a stress fracture in his left tibia, is making progress in rehab.", "title": "JaVale McGee injury steadily making progress for Denver Nuggets", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/01/21/javale-mcgee-steadily-making-progress-in-stress-fracture-rehab/10004/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2013/10/JAVALEMCGEETRAININGCAMP-495x328.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nuggets center JaVale McGee, who has been out since early November with a stress fracture in his left tibia, is making progress in rehab.", "title": "JaVale McGee steadily making progress in stress fracture rehab", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/01/21/javale-mcgee-steadily-making-progress-in-stress-fracture-rehab/10004/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2013/10/JAVALEMCGEETRAININGCAMP-495x328.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nuggets center JaVale McGee, who has been out since early November with a stress fracture in his left tibia, is making progress in rehab."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9af\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an early step,\u201d McGee said.\nWhile the news of Danilo Gallinari\u2019s need for another ACL surgery still was sending waves through the Nuggets organization, they are gradually getting good returns on another player out for an indefinite period of time.\n\u201cSo, either way, if I get on the elliptical and go an hour, it doesn\u2019t matter if my shin doesn\u2019t heal.\u201dFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t put any pain on my shin because my foot is never leaving the platform,\u201d McGee said.\n\u201cThe biggest step is just for it to heal,\u201d McGee said."}
