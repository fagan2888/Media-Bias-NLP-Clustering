It isn\u2019t about Trump and the present; it\u2019s about the future and themselves.\n\nRyan delivered his speech in the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s hearing room, and his audience was \u201ca couple hundred\u201d interns on Capitol Hill. The theme of the speech, he said, was \u201cthe state of American politics.\u201d That was only true in a technical sense; the real subject was Donald Trump. How can you be sure? Because, paradoxically, Ryan didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name even once.\n\nHere\u2019s what he mentioned instead: A future, better America in which politics isn\u2019t about \u201cplaying to [voters\u2019] anxieties\u201d but rather \u201cappeal[ing] to your aspirations\u201d; in which politicians \u201cdon\u2019t resort to scaring you\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t just oppose someone or something\u201d; in which voters and politicians alike \u201cdon\u2019t lock ourselves in an echo chamber\u201d or \u201ctake comfort in the dogmas and opinions we already hold.\u201d\n\nAn America, in other words, that would never cotton to the likes of Donald Trump.\n\nBut if that were the sum total of Ryan\u2019s speech, it wouldn\u2019t be noteworthy. You could easily boil all of the above down to a generic \u201cKumbaya\u201d platitude. A fair number of those criticisms could indeed be leveled against \u201cboth sides.\u201d In the end, it was when Ryan started talking not about Trump, but about himself \u2014 specifically, his previous \u201cmakers vs. takers\u201d rhetoric \u2014 that things got interesting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan never mentioned Trump, but his target was obvious.
