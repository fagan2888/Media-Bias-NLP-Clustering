GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz says if the nuclear weapons deal with Iran goes through, the White House will become directly responsible for supporting terrorism around the globe.

“The Obama administration will become the world’s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism,” Cruz tells The Daily Signal. “Billions of dollars will flow to Iran. Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. That means billions of dollars will go to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.”

The deal between Iran and the Obama administration has come under a barrage of criticism on various fronts. Lawmakers are especially critical when it comes to the provision of lifting the economic sanctions against Iran. “We will be allowing American dollars to go to jihadists who will use our money to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, to murder Europeans,” Cruz says.

Congress is set to weigh in on the deal in the next two months, but already the Obama administration has taken the deal’s framework to the United Nations for approval, infuriating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Cruz believes that the deal has the word “catastrophe” written all over it, and America could very well pay the price.

“This deal, if it goes through, will accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. It allows them to keep all 19,000 centrifuges, keep many of them spinning, keep much of the enriched uranium, keep developing ICBMs, and the ICBMs, the sole purpose of them is to carry a nuclear warhead to the United States of America. You don’t need a warhead to get to Israel. The only purpose of an ICBM is to cross the Atlantic and get to America.”
