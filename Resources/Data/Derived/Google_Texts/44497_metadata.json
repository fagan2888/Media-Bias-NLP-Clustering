It looks as though the bond will cruise, though.\n\nAlso in Mesquite, incumbent Dennis Tarpley and 28-year-old Jeff Casper are leading Mesquite\u2019s council races. And in neighboring Sunnyvale, Mayor Jim Phaup won early voting by nearly a 2-to-1 margin over Ronnie Henderson.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L21lc3F1aXRlLW1heW9yLXRyYWlscy1pbi1lYXJseS12b3RpbmcuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Ray Leszcynski", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "UPDATE, 9:40 p.m.: With more than half the boxes fully counted, Stan Pickett retained his sizable lead over John Monaco and will become the next mayor of Mesquite. \u201cMy lifelong\u2026", "title": "Pickett defeats Monaco for Mesquite mayor", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/05/mesquite-mayor-trails-in-early-voting.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-05-09T21:41:06Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd3e\"", "article_summary": "And in neighboring Sunnyvale, Mayor Jim Phaup won early voting by nearly a 2-to-1 margin over Ronnie Henderson.\nUPDATE, 9:40 p.m.: With more than half the boxes fully counted, Stan Pickett retained his sizable lead over John Monaco and will become the next mayor of Mesquite.\nAlso in Mesquite, incumbent Dennis Tarpley and 28-year-old Jeff Casper are leading Mesquite\u2019s council races.\nMore than 3,200 early votes were cast in the city and Monaco finds himself trailing former council comrade Stan Pickett by nearly 15 percent.\nOriginal post: Over eight elections and more than a dozen years as a Mesquite elected official, Mayor John Monaco has become adept at predicting the number of voters that will turn out in his city\u2019s election."}
