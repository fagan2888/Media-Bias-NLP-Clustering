(AP) - An Indiana farm supply store\u2019s plan to raffle off a young goat to help local 4-H programs has been called off.\n\nThe Rural King store in Muncie was selling $1 tickets. But the city\u2019s animal control agency halted the contest on Wednesday and fined the business $100 for raffling a live animal in violation of a local ordinance.\n\nThe Star Press reports (http://tspne.ws/1CSXqzh ) that the 3-month-old brown goat, named Ernie, had been kept in a pen inside the store since at least last week.\n\nAnimal Rescue Fund co-director Dana Salkoski said she offered to buy the goat for $100, but was told the raffle had already raised about $600 and would go on as scheduled.\n\nA store manager referred calls to the chain\u2019s corporate office, which had no comment.\n\nFund founder Terri Panszi said the issue hit home since the group had rescued a goat and eight lambs earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe problem we have is they\u2019re raffling off a live animal to they-don\u2019t-know-who,\u201d Panszi said.\n\nThe local ordinance includes an exception for \u201c4-H auctions and/or charity fundraisers,\u201d but it didn\u2019t apply because the store isn\u2019t officially connected with 4-H and had not made arrangements with 4-H before the raffle, according to Muncie Animal Shelter/Animal Control Director Phil Peckinpaugh.\n\nDonors who didn\u2019t want to participate in the actual raffle could check a box saying they just wanted their money to go to 4-H.\n\n\u201cI think that their intent was noble,\u201d Peckinpaugh said. But, he said, \u201crules are rules.\u201d\n\nThe goat was leashed and taken out to a waiting pickup truck while Peckinpaugh was still in the store Wednesday, to be returned to the farm from which it had come.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Star Press, http://www.thestarpress.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Indiana farm supply store's plan to raffle off a young goat to help local 4-H programs has been called off.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/goat-raffle-has-b-a-a-d-outcome-for-farm-store/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "An Indiana farm supply store\u2019s plan to raffle off a young goat to help local 4-H programs has been called off.", "title": "Goat raffle has b-a-a-d outcome for farm store"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Indiana farm supply store's plan to raffle off a young goat to help local 4-H programs has been called off.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Goat raffle has b-a-a-d outcome for farm store"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9527\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - An Indiana farm supply store\u2019s plan to raffle off a young goat to help local 4-H programs has been called off.\nThe Star Press reports (http://tspne.ws/1CSXqzh ) that the 3-month-old brown goat, named Ernie, had been kept in a pen inside the store since at least last week.\n___Information from: The Star Press, http://www.thestarpress.com\nThe Rural King store in Muncie was selling $1 tickets.\nFund founder Terri Panszi said the issue hit home since the group had rescued a goat and eight lambs earlier this year."}
