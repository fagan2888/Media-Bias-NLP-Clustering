Still, hospitals may not yet be harnessing the full power of these online tools.\n\nWhichever marketing strategies hospitals choose to pursue, they must always look improve these efforts, as the increased \"retailization\" of healthcare means competition for patients' business is stronger than ever, according to a MediaPost article. Indeed, the accessibility and affordability offered by retail clinics has left many traditional providers scrambling to compete.\n\nHospital marketing strategies also need to be increasingly targeted due to the vast regional differences in regard to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the MediaPost article states, adding, \"marketers that are already adjusting and customizing their messaging to targeted groups are one step ahead of the rest of the pack.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Houston BizBlog post\n\n- read the MediaPost article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 tips for hospitals in a consumer-driven market\n\nOld-fashioned marketing technique brings in targeted patients\n\nPatients choose hospitals based on social media\n\n5 hospital marketing campaigns that push the envelope\n\nUrgent care clinics bring accessibility, affordability\n\n6 top 2014 healthcare marketing trends", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the momentum toward healthcare organizations pursuing marketing strategies to draw and engage patients continues to grow, organizations can keep up with the competition by employing specialized \"marketing officers.\"", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the momentum toward healthcare organizations pursuing marketing strategies to draw and engage patients continues to grow, organizations can keep up with the competition by employing specialized \"marketing officers.\"", "title": "Top talent, focused approach drive successful hospital marketing strategies", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/top-talent-focused-approach-drive-successful-hospital-marketing-strategies/2015-01-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "health marketing,Hospital Marketing,Marketing,Operations & Business Management,social media", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Marketing,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd283\"", "article_summary": "As the momentum toward healthcare organizations pursuing marketing strategies to draw and engage patients continues to grow, organizations can keep up with the competition by employing specialized \"marketing officers.\"\nTo do this, Sette recommends healthcare organizations seek out top marketing talent to \"find and fix the gaps in their current campaigns.\"\nWhichever marketing strategies hospitals choose to pursue, they must always look improve these efforts, as the increased \"retailization\" of healthcare means competition for patients' business is stronger than ever, according to a MediaPost article.\nHe suggests recruiting from consumer-driven industries that have already dealt with major customer shifts, such as retail and hospitality.\nTo learn more:- read the Houston BizBlog post- read the MediaPost articleRelated Articles:5 tips for hospitals in a consumer-driven marketOld-fashioned marketing technique brings in targeted patientsPatients choose hospitals based on social media5 hospital marketing campaigns that push the envelopeUrgent care clinics bring accessibility, affordability6 top 2014 healthcare marketing trends"}
