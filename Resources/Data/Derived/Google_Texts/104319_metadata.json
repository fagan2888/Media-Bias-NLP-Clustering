The customers who reported they used labels purchased 400 fewer calories (representing a relative difference of 20 percent), 370 milligrams less sodium and 10 grams less saturated fat than the overall average.\n\nNevertheless, even consumers who used the labels purchased oversized meals that, on average, far exceeded what could be considered \u201chealthy\u201d\u2013 highlighting the difficulty for consumers when dining out. The authors argue for a need to do more to help consumers to eat sensibly and to encourage portion control, among other findings published online today ahead of print in the December issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\nAmericans currently purchase at least a third of the calories they consume on food prepared away from home\u2013 so providing detailed nutritional information on menus and on packaged foods is a commonly touted tactic to educate consumers and encourage them to make healthier choices.\n\n\u201cWhile previous studies have shown mixed impacts of menu labeling in fast food settings, this study suggests that nutrition information may be particularly useful in full-service restaurants,\u201d said Donald F. Schwarz, MD, health commissioner for the City of Philadelphia and a co-author of the study.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s menu labeling law requires full-service chain restaurants with more than 15 locations nationwide to list values for calories, sodium, fat and carbohydrates for each item on all printed menus. Fast food restaurants must list calories on their menus boards and make the other nutrition information available upon request. Philadelphia\u2019s law is unique in requiring more than just calories on menus. The enactment of this law in 2010 created the opportunity to observe whether menu labeling affects what consumers purchase \u2013 by comparing what happens at multiple locations of a single full-service chain restaurant, within and outside of city limits.\n\nMenu labeling will expand nationwide when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is fully implemented; at that time, all fast-food and full-service restaurant chains with more than 20 locations will be required to provide nutrition information at the point of purchase.\n\nIn this study, Auchincloss and colleagues from Drexel, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and University of Pennsylvania, assessed whether food purchases at full-service restaurants varied depending on the presence of labeling. They collected 648 customer surveys and transaction receipts at seven restaurant outlets of one large full-service restaurant chain. Two outlets had menu labeling, while five outlets did not. The authors looked at differences in calories and nutrients purchased between those who dined at outlets with menu labeling and those who did not, and at customers\u2019 reported use of nutritional information when ordering.\n\nOn average, customers purchased food that had approximately 1,600 food calories (kcal) \u2013 a total that rose to 1,800 calories when also counting beverages. Most people need only 2,000 calories for an entire day, so a single meal approximated a full day\u2019s worth of calories. Purchased meals had an average sodium content of 3,200 milligrams, with an average of 35 grams of saturated fat. These numbers far exceed recommended limits for an entire day. For most people, recommended daily limits are 2,300 milligrams sodium and 20 grams of saturated fat.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare the average intake with the recommended daily intake, these consumers purchased almost all their calories, and more than the recommended sodium and saturated fat in just one meal,\u201d said Beth Leonberg, an assistant clinical professor and director of the didactic program in dietetics in Drexel\u2019s College of Nursing and Health Professions, who co-authored the study. \u201cIn order to not exceed recommended intakes for the day, most adults should consume fewer than 750 calories, 750 milligrams of sodium and 8 grams of saturated fat in a single meal.\u201d\n\nThe authors concluded that current efforts don\u2019t go far enough to help consumers to eat sensibly and to encourage portion control. Educating consumers about menu labeling may further increase the small observed impact on healthier consumer choices.\n\n\u201cWe also need to pursue approaches that make the healthy choice the default,\u201d said Giridhar Mallya, MD, director of policy and planning for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and a co-author of the study. \u201cThis might include product reformulation, promoting healthier options on menus, and offering smaller portion sizes.\u201d\n\nAdditional Information and Resources\n\nOther co-authors with Auchincloss, Schwarz, Leonberg and Mallya include Karen Glanz, PhD of the University of Pennsylvania and Andrew Ricchezza, who at the time of the study was a master\u2019s student at the Drexel School of Public Health.\n\nRelated studies by this evaluation team addressed the nutritional value of foods listed on menus at full-service restaurant chains with and without mandatory labeling laws (paper in press) and customer knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding menu labeling and their use (published in Public Health Nutrition in 2013: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980013000104).
