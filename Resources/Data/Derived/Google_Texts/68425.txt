ROBERT PLANT: Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email. Originally developed as an asynchronous tool to aid communication and productivity, email has become a universal drain on employees’ time, its pervasive overuse (a side-effect of its ease of use) has killed its purity.

I have often wondered why we have yet to create an efficient virtual personal assistant, a VPA for email. If my smartphone knows how long it will take me to get to work when I leave and understands the traffic implications for a particular day, then my VPA should be able to inform my calendar and send apologetic emails or texts ahead of me when I’m late. If my phone knows where and when I eat for routine business meeting, it should be able to send an email or negotiate with my counterpart’s VPA for me. If a student needs a grade checked, thinking there has been a mistake entering it on the reporting system, my VPA should be able to check my spreadsheet and respond, only flagging me when it is a true error.

Natural language processing systems and computational linguistics have been around for decades, which when combined with machine learning and predictive analytics, provides the basis for such a VPA. However, my research background in validation and verification of knowledge-based systems alerts me to the fact that while much of the emails sent only task people in routine ways, the skill lies in understanding when something requires truly expert knowledge, the human rather than virtual input. For that, I guess my VPA could always send me an email.
