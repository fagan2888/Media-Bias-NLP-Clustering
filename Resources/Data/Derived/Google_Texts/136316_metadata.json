They have gained work permits and are able to access some privileges such as obtaining driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform\n\nCritics say the 97 percent rate suggests little vetting that would lead to approval of criminals and other undeserving applicants if the same method is applied to a broader legalization program.\n\n\u201cThat says that the agency is going to be rubber-stamping applications and they\u2019re going to be focused primarily on approving as many people as possible as quickly as possible, with only a light review, and that their focus is going to be on quantity of approvals rather than quality of decisions,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was born out of President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. Struggling to bolster support among Hispanic voters in the months before the election, the president said he would use executive action to halt deportations for young illegal immigrants. He previously said he didn\u2019t have that authority.\n\nThe first applications arrived on Aug. 15, 2012, and more than 610,000 had been successfully submitted as of Dec. 31, 2013. Of those, 521,815 were approved and 15,968 were denied, which worked out to a 97.03 percent approval rating.\n\nImmigration advocates said the high approval rate isn\u2019t a sign of lax vetting, but rather evidence that those who applied were prepared and deserving. They said those who were ineligible generally didn\u2019t bother to apply and that the bigger problem wasn\u2019t too many undeserving immigrants trying to gain status, but too few deserving people.\n\n\u201cBy far, the biggest barrier to people applying has been just blatant misinformation,\u201d said Adam Luna, director of Own the Dream campaign, which helps \u201cdreamers.\u201d\n\nThe name is taken from legislation that never passed Congress but would have given young immigrants a path to citizenship. Mr. Obama\u2019s policy cannot confer citizenship, but it can confer benefits of legal status such as work permits.\n\nMr. Luna said the application process for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals presented some early problems but that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of approving immigration benefits, worked closely with advocates to resolve the issues.\n\nMr. Luna said that feedback loop would be important for any broader legalization.\n\nMore recently, the program came under fire after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration couldn\u2019t handle the level of applications and had to delay processing Americans\u2019 requests for family members\u2019 visas in order to process the deferred action requests.\n\nThe time frame for the family reunification requests went from an average of five months to as long as 15 months, according to the report.\n\nKenneth Palinkas, president of the union for USCIS officers and adjudicators, who has battled the agency over its policies, said they feared those sorts of problems could result from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like DACA took precedence,\u201d he said.\n\nUSCIS said the wait time has been reduced to eight months and the agency hopes to return it to five months soon.\n\n\u201cThe agency manages the volume of cases it receives through a network of processing centers and local offices and regularly rebalances its workload,\u201d said USCIS spokesman Christopher S. Bentley.\n\nHe said the agency is committed to \u201ctimely adjudication\u201d of the petitions from green card holders to bring their families to the U.S.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals application runs six pages. It asks whether the applicant entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa, where the applicant has lived in the U.S., and the applicant\u2019s level of educational attainment, and includes a list of yes-or-no questions about arrests, gang membership and terrorist interests.\n\nThe fee is $465, which covers the application process and costs for having biometric identifiers taken and stored by the government.\n\nA number of questions have been raised over how closely USCIS is reviewing the applications and over the documents it is accepting as proof of age and residency. Requirements include passports, pay stubs, utility bills and notarized affidavits from friends.\n\nFew applicants have in-person interviews, which likely adds to the high approval rate and creates a security problem, said Mr. Palinkas, chief of the labor union.\n\nHe said any broader legalization for illegal immigrants should include in-person interviews and strict checks on documents.\n\n\u201cI cannot see how you can grant anybody a benefit when you haven\u2019t even seen them, and they\u2019ve already broken the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes almost comical that this is the way they\u2019re proceeding.\u201d\n\nWhatever the lessons to be learned from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the man who oversaw the process will have a chance to see them through.\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas, who ran USCIS for the past two years, was promoted in December to be deputy homeland security secretary and was put in charge of preparing the department for full legalization.\n\nSo far, with more than a half-million people approved, reports of bad behavior have been few.\n\nThis month, however, a 19-year-old woman was referred for deportation after she was convicted of two counts of felony hit-and-run. The woman, who was in the U.S. under the deferred action program, had driven her car through a pile of leaves and killed two girls who apparently had been playing and hiding in the leaf pile.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many others have run afoul of the law and face deportation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it doesn\u2019t keep track of that data.\n\nThe agency also said there is no automatic deportation trigger.\n\n\u201cEvery case is evaluated on its individual merits,\u201d ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said. \u201cIf a DACA recipient is convicted of a criminal violation subsequent to their receiving the benefit, ICE would make an individual determination about whether or not the nature of the violation warranted their appearance in immigration court.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The test run for immigration legalization \u2014 the 2012 program to grant tentative legal status to young illegal immigrants \u2014 has exposed some serious problems that likely would need to be solved if Congress approves a broad immigration reform bill.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The test run for immigration legalization \u2014 the 2012 program to grant tentative legal status to young illegal immigrants \u2014 has exposed some serious problems that likely would need to be solved if Congress approves a broad immigration reform bill.", "title": "High rate of approval for \u2018dreamers\u2019 vexes critics of immigration reform", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/16/high-rate-of-approval-for-dreamers-vexes-critics-o/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/16/2_162014_dreamers-tuition8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/16/2_162014_dreamers-tuition8201.jpg", "description": "The test run for immigration legalization \u2014 the 2012 program to grant tentative legal status to young illegal immigrants \u2014 has exposed some serious problems that likely would need to be solved if Cong", "card": "summary", "title": "High rate of approval for \u2018dreamers\u2019 vexes critics of immi"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Jessica Vaughan"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Obama\u2019s policy cannot confer citizenship, but it can confer benefits of legal status such as work permits.\nMr. Luna said the application process for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals presented some early problems but that U.S.\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was born out of President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.\nImmigration advocates said the high approval rate isn\u2019t a sign of lax vetting, but rather evidence that those who applied were prepared and deserving.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of approving immigration benefits, worked closely with advocates to resolve the issues."}
