I have health care through the VA so I really don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u2014Jerry Breier\n\nA: Wait! Don\u2019t drop that coverage\u2026\n\n\u201cIf you are eligible for Medicare, you should not rely solely on VA benefits for your health care needs,\u201d says Medicare Rights Center spokesperson Mitchell Clark.\n\nThe VA also states on their website that they \u201cstrongly encourage you to keep your health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe two coverages are complementary.\n\nBecause VA health care is a benefit and not insurance, you can only receive care\u2014for free or for a small co-payment, depending on your priority group\u2014through a VA facility.\n\n\n\nYour Medicare Part B insurance, meanwhile, helps pay for doctors\u2019 services, outpatient care, and, most importantly, emergency room visits outside the VA.\n\nPart B will come especially in handy if you have an emergency and need to be taken to a non-VA hospital. The VA will cover some non-VA emergency room care, but certain requirements must be met. The VA will also only pay to the point of medical stability and all claims must be filed within 90 days from the last day of the emergent care.\n\nAlso keep in mind that certain VA hospitals and facilities may not be able to perform all procedures you may want due to equipment restrictions. In that case, they may cover the cost for treatment outside the VA\u2019s network, or if there is an alternate remedy to your problem that they can perform at the VA, they will cover that procedure instead. So if there are several treatments to an ailment, you may have to go with whatever the VA can provide rather than choosing from among all possible solutions as you could with Medicare.\n\nIf you\u2019re still really set on dropping Part B, check the VA\u2019s list of service facilities to make sure there are locations near your home and other places you frequent, like your child\u2019s home or a favorite vacation spot. You should also consider the types of services you use and will likely need to use in the next several years to determine whether you\u2019ll be okay only receiving care from a VA facility.\n\nTo drop this coverage, you only need to contact Medicare (1-800-633-4227) and let them know your decision.\n\nShould you decide you want to be reinstated, however, you will have to wait until the following January. Keep in mind that you will also likely incur a Part B premium penalty of 10% for each 12-month period you are without the coverage, warns Clark. Any savings you may have racked up from not paying Part B before could be eaten up by the higher premiums.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, your current Medicare part B premium is $104 a month, as it is for most people, and you drop coverage now but then decide to re-up in two years\u2019 time. Your new premium could be $125.84, says Brentwood, Tenn. financial planner Gary Ward.\n\nCan\u2019t afford the Part B premium? You may qualify for assistance through the state-run Medicare Savings Program. You can visit Medicare\u2019s website to find out which agency in your state runs the program.\n\nRead more from Money.com:", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Especially in an emergency, you'll be glad to have the greater coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Especially in an emergency, you'll be glad to have the greater coverage.", "title": "Why You Shouldn't Drop Other Insurance if You Have VA Health Benefits", "url": "http://time.com/money/3669196/va-health-benefits-medicare-part-b/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/140603_ff_qa_obamacare_illo_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/140603_ff_qa_obamacare_illo_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Why You Shouldn't Drop Other Insurance if You Have VA Health Benefits", "description": "Especially in an emergency, you'll be glad to have the greater coverage.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "MONEY"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "keywords": ", ask the expert, healthcare, medicare, medicare part b, v.a. benefits, v.a. healthcare, va benefits, va healthcare, veteran, veteran affairs, veteran affairs department, veterans affairs benefits", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "VA, veterans, Veteran's Administration, Veterans Administration, Ask the Expert, Healthcare, health care, Medicare, Medicare part B, V.A. benefits, V.A. healthcare, VA benefits, VA healthcare, Veteran, Veteran Affairs, veteran affairs department, veterans affairs benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6a4\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t drop that coverage\u2026\u201cIf you are eligible for Medicare, you should not rely solely on VA benefits for your health care needs,\u201d says Medicare Rights Center spokesperson Mitchell Clark.\nBecause VA health care is a benefit and not insurance, you can only receive care\u2014for free or for a small co-payment, depending on your priority group\u2014through a VA facility.\nI have health care through the VA so I really don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u2014Jerry BreierA: Wait!\nCan\u2019t afford the Part B premium?\nQ: \u201cHow do I go about dropping my Medicare Part B plan?"}
