Certainly there is a strain of conservatism that feels an undue nostalgia for a less tolerant, less diverse, 1950s-style America. But more and more often these days, \u201creactionary\u201d would better apply to those ostensible liberals who oppose virtually any change to any government program that has ever existed.\n\nWe have, for example, long been accustomed to liberal politicians opposing proposals to reform entitlement programs, but what are we to make of it when someone like Elizabeth Warren, self-appointed scourge of corporations and the 1 percent, starts to champion corporate-welfare programs like the Export-Import Bank? The mere existence of a government program seems to render it immune to criticism.\n\nEvidence seems to make little difference. Just last month, the trustees of Social Security and Medicare released their latest report, warning that both programs were heading rapidly toward insolvency. Social Security is running roughly $27.7 trillion in the red, an increase of $1.8 trillion over last year\u2019s number. Medicare\u2019s total unfunded liabilities exceed $48.1 trillion, an increase of $5.2 trillion since last year\u2019s report.\n\nHow did the Left react? Representative Sander Levin (Mich.), ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, spoke for most Democrats in claiming that \u201cthe Social Security Trustees report underscores that the program remains strong, with its long-term future presenting a manageable challenge.\u201d Representative Xavier Becerra (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Social Security subcommittee, actually said, \u201cThe most serious near-term risk Social Security faces is the impact of four years of Republican budget cuts, which have resulted in local office closings and staff shortages, long wait times on the phone and in person, and growing backlogs of Americans waiting for their earned benefits.\u201d Senator Bill Nelson (Fla.), who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Aging, claimed that \u201ctoday, Medicare is more solvent than it was in 1965.\u201d\n\nSocial Security was conceptualized in Bismarck\u2019s 19th-century Prussia and introduced here in 1935. Medicare is half a century old. The world has changed a great deal since either of those programs was born, but modernizing them to reflect today\u2019s technological and economic conditions is off the table.\n\nPick your issue, and liberals have become the defenders of the status quo. Education? Millions of low-income and minority students remain trapped in failing schools, but the liberal establishment, dependent on the teachers\u2019 unions, opposes charter schools, school vouchers, and education tax credits. Obamacare? Every word has become gospel \u2014 except those unilaterally changed by the president himself.\n\nPerhaps nothing reveals how reactionary the Left has become as much as its response to Paul Ryan\u2019s recent proposal for welfare reform.\n\nPaul Krugman may believe that our current plethora of overlapping and contradictory welfare programs is \u201cfairly efficient,\u201d but few others do. The sad fact is that federal and state governments have spent a combined $18 trillion fighting poverty during the 50 years since Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Last year alone, we spent close to $1 trillion on at least 126 separate anti-poverty programs. Yet, by conventional measures, that spending has accomplished virtually nothing in terms of reducing poverty. Even recent studies, based on alternative measures that do show some initial success during the early years of the War on Poverty, indicate that progress has essentially stalled out in recent decades. To most people, this would suggest the need to change our strategy.\n\nRyan\u2019s proposal was hardly radical. He didn\u2019t propose abolishing the welfare state. He didn\u2019t even propose significant cuts in federal welfare spending. Instead he simply suggested consolidating eleven current programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, and housing assistance, into a single block grant to the states. States would have the option of participating in the block grant or continuing to operate under the current programs. States that chose the block grant would receive the same amount of funding they do now, but would have more latitude to experiment in order to find options that worked better than what we have today. In order to ensure accountability and to prevent a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d participating states would have to provide a detailed plan showing how they intended to use the money, with specific benchmarks for success. That\u2019s not exactly a proposal out of Dickensian London.\n\nBut the Left didn\u2019t even want to discuss it except to denounce it. Representative Rosa DeLauro (Conn.) found it \u201calmost diabolical.\u201d Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the No. 3 Democrat in the House, warned that \u201cpeople in poverty will have a much more difficult time accessing support to help them climb out of poverty.\u201d Krugman warned that any proposal from Ryan could not be trusted, while Laura Clawson at Daily Kos called it \u201cjust what you\u2019d expect of Paul Ryan: the ultimate heartless Republican attempt to slash the safety net into ribbons, cloaked in the guise of concerned condescension.\u201d\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to disagree with Ryan\u2019s proposal.
