Tester's chief of staff, Tom Lopach, will move to the committee to become its executive director. Preston Elliott, who managed Tester's 2012 reelection campaign and most recently ran outgoing Sen. Kay Hagan's (D-N.C.) race, will be deputy executive director.

"This is an experienced team with a long history of winning incredibly tough races," Tester said in a statement. "I'm excited that we have been able to attract the top talent our party has to offer for the 2016 cycle — a cycle that will be about Democrats going on offense.

“I know they understand what it takes to build strong campaigns and are ready for the challenge of winning back the majority," he added.

A trio of other top DSCC staffers will remain onboard. Justin Barasky will continue as communications director, Christie Roberts will stay on as director of research and strategy, and Valerie Chraka Friedman will stay on as national finance director.
