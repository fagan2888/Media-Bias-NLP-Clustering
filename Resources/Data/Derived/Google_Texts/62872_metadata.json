More recently, while the overall unemployment rate has fallen, other yardsticks like the participation rate and wage growth have caused concern among economists as well as policy makers at the Federal Reserve.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is unveiling an interesting new graphical tool allowing users to study eight aspects of the labor market. Some are familiar, like unemployment, employment, hours and wages. Others are slightly less so, like the labor force participation rate, labor demand and job loss rates.\n\nOne new option is an index that tracks the much-debated issue of the mismatch between job openings and skills \u2014 that is, when employers cannot find workers with the necessary qualifications, despite getting plenty of applicants.\n\nSkeptics argue that the problem essentially comes down to whether employers are willing to pay enough to attract the workers they need; others say there is a genuine shortage of trained workers, especially in skilled blue-collar fields like welding.\n\nThe mismatch feature is based on an index developed by economists at the Fed and in academia and was presented in a research report prepared in 2012 and revised last June.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140310070046, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 10, 2014", "org": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York", "keywords": "Labor and Jobs,Research,United States Economy,Federal Reserve Bank of New York,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Visualizing the Dynamics of the Labor Market ( 20140310 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nelson D.
