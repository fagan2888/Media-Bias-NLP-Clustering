How could he resist? And yet, before he gives his opinion on what\u2019s happening with the team, he wants you to know that he hasn\u2019t seen every second of every game.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be an expert on the last couple of games,\u201d he said.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything the former Nuggets coach, now an NBA analyst for ESPN, wants clear right off the top, it\u2019s that.\n\nBut he has seen the Nuggets. And he has thoughts on what has happened during their rocky start. He shared some of those before Denver\u2019s game Friday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nKarl\u2019s thoughts start right at the top with the player he demanded the most from when he coached the team, point guard Ty Lawson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Ty playing at a high level,\u201d Karl said. \u201cI think he\u2019s their engine.\u201d\n\nKarl questioned how healthy Lawson is because of the point guard\u2019s sluggishness through four games.\n\nLawson then sat out the Cavaliers game with ankle soreness, an injury he has been dealing with since late last season.\n\n\u201cHe relies so much on speed and quickness and explosion,\u201d Karl said. \u201cHe needs all three to get his stuff done, because he\u2019s so small. I didn\u2019t see the explosion as much. It seemed like one of his legs had some tenderness to it.\u201d\n\nAmong the wrinkles the Nuggets are still ironing out include getting consistent offensive aggressiveness from their starters, execution on the offensive end from the entire team and having the proper intensity and energy level in every game.\n\nThey are issues, Karl said, that aren\u2019t exclusive to the Nuggets.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of guidance and direction on either end of the court, from my standpoint of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a plan yet. And I can say this about 10 other teams too, so don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\n\nWant a surprise?\n\nKarl, who championed the idea that a team can win big by throwing waves of good players out on the court just as well as one that has a couple of stars, thinks Nuggets coach Brian Shaw needs to pare down his rotation.\n\n\u201cOne thing I think Brian is kind of caught up in a little bit is he\u2019s playing too many players,\u201d Karl said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can play three centers. I don\u2019t think he can play that many big guys on the court when your team plays well when it\u2019s fast and small. I\u2019m not saying you play 48 minutes at fast and small, but you\u2019ve got to delegate some portion of fast and small. He has six big guys, and in the game of basketball right now, you don\u2019t need six big guys.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Karl recognizes being able to win in multiple ways is key for any NBA team.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to play both ways,\u201d Karl said. \u201cIn that last year (with Denver), I think our record against teams that held us in the 90s or under 90 points \u2026 we won 75 percent of our games. You want to play a game that motivates and energizes the strengths of your basketball team. At that time, for me, I thought the strengths of our team were mostly our perimeter guys. And (Kenneth) Faried, of course, surprised by playing very well.\n\n\u201cBut the strengths of our team were our perimeter players. So I ran a system that was magnifying those strengths. Brian\u2019s got to evaluate what he thinks \u2014 they have a lot of big guys. Is that the strength of their team? Or is the perimeter the strength of their team? I don\u2019t know what the team is, other than I\u2019ve always felt that Ty is their engine.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: What\u2019s wrong with the Nuggets?
