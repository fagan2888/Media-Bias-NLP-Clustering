(Photo: Katie McLean)\n\nGREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 Nearly 3,000 people answered Bernie Sanders\u2019 call for \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d in Greenville on Friday, greeting the Democratic presidential candidate with repeated loud cheers and sign waving as he railed against \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d at the TD Convention Center.\n\nThe senator from Vermont drew crowds ten times as big during appearances in major West Coast markets.\n\nStill, his first stop in Greenville was one of the best attended presidential campaign events in the Upstate this election cycle, Democrat or Republican.\n\nThe silver-haired populist pointed in the air and waved his hands as he belted out the message of class struggle that has made him the closest rival so far to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe American people are sick and tired of establishment economics. They are sick and tired of establishment politics. And they are sick and tired of establishment media,\u201d Sanders declared to cheers.\n\nHe called for raising the minimum wage and a single-payer health care system and decried \u201csuper PACS funded by billionaires and millionaires\u201d and South Carolina\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe people \u201cunderstand in their gut that corporate greed is destroying our country,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThe Greenville speech was the kickoff for a two-day swing through South Carolina by Sanders, his first visit to the Palmetto State since April.\n\nSymone Sanders, a campaign spokeswoman who is not related to the candidate, said the campaign counted 2,800 attendees at the Greenville rally.\n\nNot all of them were from South Carolina, however, judging from the Georgia and North Carolina license plates in the convention center parking lot.\n\nClinton filled a smaller venue as well as a spillover room and turned some people away during a campaign stop in Greenville in July.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much support Sanders will draw from black voters, a hugely important constituency for South Carolina\u2019s Democratic presidential preference primary Feb. 27.\n\nNon-whites accounted for more than half the voters in the 2008 primary \u2014 when Barack Obama beat Clinton \u2014 but most of the faces at the TD Convention Center on Friday were white.\n\nA national Gallup survey released earlier this month gave Clinton an 80% favorability rating with black voters, compared with 23% for Sanders.\n\nClinton has championed issues deemed important to black voters \u2014 such as criminal justice reform and voting rights \u2014 during three visits to South Carolina since she announced her candidacy in April.\n\nOne African American at the Greenville rally, however, said she will vote for Sanders and doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any trouble appealing to blacks in South Carolina.\n\nRosemary Wallace, a 53-year-old medical marijuana activist from Rock Hill, said Sanders is \u201ctalking common sense, and that\u2019s all we want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a whole bunch of talk and rhetoric. He\u2019s got a plan laid out,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Clinton, Wallace volunteered that a lot of voters will be turned off by the scandal over her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and whether she mishandled classified information.\n\nIf Clinton is president, Wallace asked, \u201cWhat else is she going to withhold? She withheld those emails the whole time. If she had nothing to hide, she should have let them go.\u201d\n\nAnother African-American at the rally, Joshua Hollington, a 22-year-old student at Winthrop University from Charleston, said he hasn\u2019t decided who will get his vote.\n\nHollington said he\u2019s considering Sanders, though he \u201cmight be a little too left.\u201d\n\nClinton \u201chas a lot of good views,\u201d too, he said, adding, \u201cIf she can get out of this scandal, she might have a good shot.\u201d\n\nBarbara Gill, a 71-year-old retiree from Greenville, said she\u2019d already decided to vote for Sanders.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s about the only one aside from Donald Trump who can\u2019t be bought, and Donald Trump is not an option for me,\u201d said Gill.\n\nGill said she is \u201cnormally a Hillary fan, but I\u2019m liking her less and less. I think she\u2019s part of the Wall Street crowd.\u201d\n\nIf Vice President Joe Biden enters the race, Gill said, \u201cThat would give me something to think about.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EaSqKk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Nearly 3,000 showed up for the rally in Greenville.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Nearly 3,000 showed up for the rally in Greenville.", "title": "Sanders decries \u2018billionaire class\u2019 at S.C. rally", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/21/sanders-decries-billionaire-class-sc-rally/32159489/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly 3,000 showed up for the rally in Greenville.", "title": "Sanders decries \u2018billionaire class\u2019 at S.C. rally", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/25af7fd203ecfd97bff93c71ff07b58a30ab21d0/c=699-0-3494-2795&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Super PAC", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Super PAC", "title": "Sanders decries \u2018billionaire class\u2019 at S.C. rally", "author": "Rudolph Bell", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/730374947cebfa51797acb2bcc1376000c3538fa/c=1048-0-3144-2795/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1b17c379cc87081362b8f57690d4f7a663a08e9/c=699-0-3494-2795/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b1fdfbbb8a2b2e0318268699a43398b7dee3d11/c=233-0-3960-2795/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/343341ff8c5e5135ef2d07c4d624cfe5105ff3fe/c=0-218-4193-2577&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-21T21:30:43.100000-04:00", "shorthed": "Sanders decries \u2018billionaire class\u2019 at S.C. rally", "articleid": 32159489, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4ff3e90a6db1b85ac12467ec4407867a9314a11/c=0-218-4193-2577/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6143845f8f4f8cd7988be9066e4bfa19eddf2846/c=1310-0-2882-2795/local/-/media/2015/08/21/Greenville/B9318502106Z.1_20150821182241_000_G7CBMM26M.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb208\"", "article_summary": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, speaks during a rally at the TD Conference Center on Friday, August 21, 2015 in Greenville.\nNot all of them were from South Carolina, however, judging from the Georgia and North Carolina license plates in the convention center parking lot.\nSymone Sanders, a campaign spokeswoman who is not related to the candidate, said the campaign counted 2,800 attendees at the Greenville rally.\nThe Greenville speech was the kickoff for a two-day swing through South Carolina by Sanders, his first visit to the Palmetto State since April.\nStill, his first stop in Greenville was one of the best attended presidential campaign events in the Upstate this election cycle, Democrat or Republican."}
