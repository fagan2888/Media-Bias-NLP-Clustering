The Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this month in King v. Burwell, a case challenging the provision of tax credits on federal insurance exchanges. While the legal issues are dry lawyers\u2019 fare \u2014 how to interpret several interconnected phrases of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the practical stakes are high. The government estimates that millions of Americans will be left without affordable health insurance if it loses.\n\nWhile the administration may well prevail, it has expressed remarkable pessimism about its options if it does lose. The secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, wrote to Congress last month about the administration\u2019s lack of a contingency plan: \u201cWe know of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health care system that would be caused by an adverse decision.\u201d\n\nBut luckily the Constitution supplies a contingency plan, even if the administration doesn\u2019t know it yet: If the administration loses in King, it can announce that it is complying with the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment \u2014 but only with respect to the four plaintiffs who brought the suit.\n\nThis announcement would not defy a Supreme Court order, since the court has the formal power to order a remedy only for the four people actually before it. The administration would simply be refusing to extend the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning to the millions of people who, like the plaintiffs, may be eligible for tax credits but, unlike the plaintiffs, did not sue.\n\nTo be sure, the government almost always agrees to extend Supreme Court decisions to all similarly situated people. In most cases, it would be pointless to try to limit a decision to the parties to the lawsuit. Each new person who was denied the benefit of the ruling could bring his own lawsuit, and the courts would simply rule the same way. Trying to limit the decision to the parties to the suit would just delay the inevitable.\n\nBut the King litigation is different, because almost everybody who is eligible for the tax credits is more than happy to get them. Most people who receive tax credits will never sue to challenge them. Lawsuits can be brought only by those with a personal stake, so in most cases the tax credits will never come before a court. The administration is therefore free to follow its own honest judgment about what the law requires.\n\nThis idea may seem radical, but it has a strong legal pedigree. Judicial authority, or jurisdiction, is case-specific and person-specific. That is true even of the Supreme Court, which the Constitution gives \u201cjudicial power\u201d to decide \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d It is reaffirmed by Marbury v. Madison (1803), which affirmed the power of judicial review by relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s duty to decide \u201cparticular cases.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Obama could also take a page from President Lincoln. In his first inaugural address, Lincoln discussed a recent Supreme Court decision about slavery. He forswore \u201cany assault upon the court,\u201d but stressed that \u201cthe policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people\u201d ought not be \u201cirrevocably fixed\u201d by a single suit brought by only a few. He said that Supreme Court opinions were thus \u201centitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases\u201d but were ultimately limited to \u201cthe parties to a suit as to the object of that suit.\u201d If the Obama administration thinks the stakes are high enough, it can take the same path.\n\nThere are legal wrinkles, of course. Lower courts have sometimes claimed legal authority to invalidate a regulation (which is at issue in this case) even for parties who aren\u2019t before the court. And some employers might be able to bring lawsuits that would call their employees\u2019 subsidies into question. But the administration has already raised legal defenses to those potential problems in other lawsuits and could press those defenses here, too.\n\nThe real obstacle to this contingency plan is not legal, but political. Invoking this constitutional prerogative forces the president to spend substantial political capital, and it is easier to shift the blame. That may be a broader pattern in modern politics. For instance, the administration has called on Congress to reduce unjust sentences even though the president could simply commute them on his own constitutional authority.\n\nBut we should not let the president avoid responsibility by abdicating his powers. If the administration believes that a Supreme Court loss would be egregious and disastrous, it ought to consider taking the political heat to limit it.\n\nShould the administration lose this lawsuit, it will be quick to blame the court for the consequences. But the administration should instead decide whether it is willing to put its constitutional powers behind its words. If not, then it will deserve a share of its own blame.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "King v.
