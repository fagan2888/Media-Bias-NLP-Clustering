He regularly wears a binder to compress chest tissue.\n\n\u201cSome are a little more halfway, so they\u2019re like a sports bra,\u201d Eilert says, identifying the different binders.\n\nDrake wears a binder all the time to help him pass so people identify him as a male. But passing comes with a price \u2013 binders can cause physical pain and discomfort.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of risks to it over time,\u201d Eilert says. \u201cThey recommend 8 hours a day, less is better. It can be physically uncomfortable for breathing. You don\u2019t want to sleep with it, it can cause physical pain when you wake up.\u201d\n\nDrake says many transgender youth, including a number of his friends, aren\u2019t out to their parents and can\u2019t afford binders.\n\nSo they use things such as duct tape or Ace bandages to suppress chest tissue.\n\n\u201cThose can actually lead to the breaking down of your ribs,\u201d Eilert says. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna reformat your ribs and break down your bone, and can really cause some damage later.\u201d\n\nDrake has been lucky. His family supports his transition both emotionally and financially.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my child,\u201d York says. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna bring me to tears. I\u2019d throw myself in front of train for my kids. I\u2019d give them my last breath. I want him to be complete \u2013 you know happy, whole, and this is who he\u2019s meant to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Drake told his mother the truth about who he was the two came up with a plan. If Drake wanted to transition, Shelia wanted to make sure he did it safely.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health publishes standards of care that provide best practices for transitioning.\n\nThe first step is counseling, so Drake and his mom went to Indianapolis therapist Becky Bickel.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that our clients are ready that they have the coping skills they need,\u201d Bickel says. \u201cThat they really understand what this is going to do to their body social, legally. The primary role is to help them think through this and make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page and understand that they\u2019re doing the something that is potentially irreversible.\u201d\n\nOnce counselors establish a patient is transgendered, they recommend them to begin hormone therapy.\n\nDrake began taking testosterone just before high school graduation, where his school let him wear a blue robe instead of the white ones girls had to wear.\n\nAfter about a year and a half of living as his preferred gender, the next step now is top surgery, which Drake has scheduled later this month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely freeing,\u201d Eilert says. \u201cI came out I think when I was 17, and after 17 years of keeping that inside, it was like, I can be who I am. It was freeing.\u201d\n\nWithout Financial Support, Some Turn To The Black Market\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult for males trying to make the transition to female. Testosterone adds masculine features to a body that can be hard to reverse.\n\nKayleigh Renner is an example. She\u2019s 26 and drives a cab in Bloomington.\n\nShe realized she wanted to transition three years ago, and she already felt like it was too late.\n\n\u201cYou know, I feel like I\u2019m too old. Maybe 26 doesn\u2019t seem old, but you\u2019re past puberty, testosterone has done things to your body,\u201d Renner says. \u201cIt always seems like it\u2019s too late, and you think you\u2019re never going to pass. But then again you have to think it\u2019s never too late, because longer you wait, the harder it will be.\u201d\n\nRenner says she realized transitioning was the only way for her to beat depression and have a chance at a normal, happy life.\n\n\u201cEverything is just so much better,\u201d Renner says. \u201cThere\u2019s still those thoughts and that\u2019s something everyone has to deal with, but it\u2019s nowhere near as difficult as it was. The future in depression is just black. There\u2019s nothing there. You can\u2019t even contemplate tomorrow. But this is just something I need to do. I can see the end goal, and its something I\u2019m really striving for.\u201d\n\nSo Renner began the process. She sought counseling, started taking hormones, and scheduled surgeries.\n\nDr. Gregory Chernoff is a cosmetic surgeon who has been operating on transgender patients for decades. A major part of transitioning from male to female is facial feminization surgeries.\n\n\u201cAll the surgical \u2013 male to female \u2013 forehead lift, hairline advancements, hair transplants to give a more feminine hairline, as part of the brow lift often we\u2019ll do a bony reduction of the bossing of the forehead that many men have,\u201d Chernoff says. \u201cEyelid surgery, feminize the nose with rhinoplasty, very commonly we\u2019ll do cheek implants chin implants and then do a face and neck lift.\u201d\n\nFacial feminization surgeries alone can cost between $30,000 and $70,000, depending on the doctor, and how many surgeries are needed.\n\nTogether, top and bottom surgeries for male to female cost about $30,000, so the total cost of transition for Renner could be upwards of $100,000.\n\nAs a young adult, Renner was covered under her parent\u2019s insurance plan.\n\nBut her family didn\u2019t welcome the transition for many reasons.\n\n\u201cTo them it was this huge blow from left field,\u201d Renner says. \u201cThe old argument of \u2018we didn\u2019t see evidence of this as a child, you\u2019re kind of making this up, this is a chosen lifestyle, this is not who you are.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo when Renner\u2019s parents found out she was using their insurance to pay for counseling, hormones and consultations, they dropped her from the plan just days before her scheduled surgeries.\n\n\u201cThat was the complete breakdown. It went back to the depression I was in before, just worse because it was so real, it was about to happen, and then it was just gone,\u201d Renner says.\n\nRenner was left to pay for services on her own. She also no longer had access to counseling and hormones, leaving her to purchase the drugs on the black market.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of what you\u2019re getting, if what you\u2019re getting is the real thing,\u201d she says. \u201cOr, if it\u2019s fresh and not past its expiration date. The sources \u2013 there are several different types of estrogen \u2013 there\u2019s the bioidentical, the horse mare, and then its like, is this really what it says it is? It\u2019s pretty risky.\u201d\n\nInsurance\u2019s Role In The Transitioning Process\n\nBut for those who have insurance, their transitioning process is more likely to be covered than it was years ago.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, zero people were covered by insurance,\u201d Cleveland-based plastic surgeon Dr. Daniel Medalie says. \u201cNow I would say maybe one in five of my patients is covered by insurance. \u201d\n\nHe says big companies including Microsoft and Google are starting to include transgender services in their insurance plans to attract more employees and the number of surgeries they actually have to pay for is extremely low.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of transgender patients in the world,\u201d Medalie says. \u201cThere are more and more companies that are specifically bargaining out with the insurance companies to have this included.\u201d\n\nFor now, the one glimmer of hope Renner sees is the Affordable Care Act, which covers counseling and hormones, if she can afford the right plan.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act still doesn\u2019t cover any transgender procedures because they are still considered elective, not medically necessary.\n\nRenner hopes to raise money for her surgeries by working and applying for aid through various foundations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Transgender youth often have trouble finding the money to pay for transitioning surgeries, but insurance is starting to cover more of the transition process.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Transgender youth often have trouble finding the money to pay for transitioning surgeries, but insurance is starting to cover more of the transition process.", "title": "How Young Transgender Adults Pay For Transition Surgery | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/transgender-youth-fund-transition-surgery-67563/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/05/kayleigh1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/05/kayleigh1.jpg", "description": "Transgender youth often have trouble finding the money to pay for transitioning surgeries, but insurance is starting to cover more of the transition process.", "card": "summary", "title": "How Young Transgender Adults Pay For Transition Surgery"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Drake Eilert is female to male transgender.\nIt was freeing.\u201dWithout Financial Support, Some Turn To The Black MarketIt\u2019s more difficult for males trying to make the transition to female.\nBut the Affordable Care Act still doesn\u2019t cover any transgender procedures because they are still considered elective, not medically necessary.\nTogether, top and bottom surgeries for male to female cost about $30,000, so the total cost of transition for Renner could be upwards of $100,000.\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health publishes standards of care that provide best practices for transitioning."}
