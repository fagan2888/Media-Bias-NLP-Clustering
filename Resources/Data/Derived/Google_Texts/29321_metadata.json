You are hearing from that physician on a weekly or monthly basis with information that\u2019s relevant to your care,\u201d chief executive Jeff Butler said.\n\nMany patients may not live in that world just yet, but that\u2019s certainly where a number of health-care professionals see the industry headed.\n\nThe passage of the Affordable Care Act and changes to the way doctors are reimbursed for their medical services \u2014 primarily the shift toward payments for keeping patients healthy as opposed to just treating them when sick \u2014 made some doctors consider leaving their private practice to become part of a larger hospital system, Butler said.\n\nThe rationale, Butler said, is that large hospital systems have the financial resources to absorb increased health-care costs and invest in the technology needed to more closely monitor patients.\n\n\u201cWe think that shouldn\u2019t be the only option for a physician going forward,\u201d Butler said.\n\nThat\u2019s how Privia Medical Group came to be. The network of physicians \u2014 220 and counting across Maryland, Virginia and the District \u2014 effectively acts as one large medical practice with each doctor owning a piece of the business.\n\nButler said the arrangement allows doctors to use Privia Health\u2019s technology and form relationships with health-care plans as a collective, while still maintaining control over how they run their practice day to day.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we strike the right balance between practice autonomy and the advantage of being part of a medical group,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, the company has $400 million to fund an expansion into Texas, Florida, Georgia and New York, as well as other parts of Maryland, Virginia and the District. Butler said the funds will also be used to acquire complementary businesses.\n\nThe money was put into a holding company called Brighton Health Group, which now wholly owns Privia Health as a subsidiary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arlington-based Privia Health is a growing network of physicians that plans to expand across the nation.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/stevenoverly", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Arlington-based Privia Health is a growing network of physicians that plans to expand across the nation.", "title": "The Download: Meet the local company that just raised $400 million from investors", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-meet-the-local-company-that-just-raised-400-million-from-investors/2014/09/19/9fa63bc8-3e7d-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@stevenoverly"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-meet-the-local-company-that-just-raised-400-million-from-investors/2014/09/19/9fa63bc8-3e7d-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews, privia health, privia medical group, goldman sachs, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/stevenoverly"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9fa63bc8-3e7d-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, privia health, privia medical group, goldman sachs, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6e3\"", "article_summary": "The money was put into a holding company called Brighton Health Group, which now wholly owns Privia Health as a subsidiary.\nThat\u2019s how Privia Medical Group came to be.\nArlington-based Privia Health raised a staggering $400 million from a group of investors anchored by Goldman Sachs, the company announced last week, a pot of money that it will use to expand its network of physicians beyond the Washington region.\n\u201cWe feel like we strike the right balance between practice autonomy and the advantage of being part of a medical group,\u201d he said.\nThe network of physicians \u2014 220 and counting across Maryland, Virginia and the District \u2014 effectively acts as one large medical practice with each doctor owning a piece of the business."}
