Boling is leading a program that attempts to help the elderly avoid expensive hospital stays by bringing medical care to them. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The two medical students in the back seat lurch left. Then right. Then left again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping you guys are not vertiginous or anything,\u201d calls out Peter Boling, 60, as his taupe Passat carves the winding, wooded road to his afternoon house call.\n\nBoling, an affable geriatrician who looks like George Bluth but drives like Jeff Gordon, has been visiting elderly patients in their homes since 1984. In those early years, as a newly-minted faculty member at Virginia Commonwealth University, he staffed a clinic in the morning and made house calls in the afternoon.\n\nHome visits, by then, already had become pass\u00e9. In the 1930s, doctors saw patients at home about 40 percent of the time. In the 1980s, nearly all visits took place at the physician\u2019s office or at a hospital. Less than 1 percent were house calls. Modern medicine was centralizing, trapping primary care physicians in their own webs of equipment and auxiliary staff.\n\nBoling\u2019s experiences, though, convinced him that there is still a role for medicine in the home, particularly for the frailest of the elderly. These patients need more attention than a 15-minute clinic appointment affords them. For many, just getting to a clinic is a struggle. So a slight complaint is allowed to fester into a crisis, an ambulance and an expensive emergency room visit.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to deliver health care where it\u2019s best for the patient,\u201d Boling says. \u201cIf the clinic is the right place for them, then come to the clinic. If it\u2019s hard for them to come to the clinic, short-term or long-term, we\u2019ll go to them.\u201d\n\nBoling revs through a turn, sending up a puff of rust-red leaves. He tells the students how he got to this moment today.\n\nDecades ago, he and his colleagues at the American Academy of Home Care Medicine embarked on a saga to spread this very personal way of caring for sick elderly patients. Studies were done. The system saved money. Patients were healthier. Families were happier.\n\nStill, few wanted to pay for this rather old-fashioned model of health care. Medicare reimbursed at a paltry rate for house calls. Most of the house-call outfits ran at a loss, subsidized by grants or a sponsoring hospital. The doctors realized that if they wanted to change how medicine was practiced, they had to change how Americans paid for it.\n\nTheir efforts came to a head with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which funded a three-year incentive program called Independence at Home. Like many of the other cost-saving experiments that the ACA set into motion, Independence at Home does not propose an entirely new way to deliver health care. It just demonstrates a new way to fund it.\n\nThe 17 participating house-call practices are to get an annual bonus \u2014 dating to 2012 \u2014 based on how much money they saved Medicare by keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital. The results of the first year are expected to come out shortly. Because these house-call teams serve some of Medicare\u2019s sickest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 patients, the savings could be huge.\n\nIn 2005, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the top 5 percent of Medicare cases in a given year account for 43 percent of total costs. Overall, Medicare accounts for 14 percent of the national budget, or about $500 billion annually.\n\nFor the teams of doctors and nurses participating in the study, those savings would translate into thousands of additional dollars in revenue per patient each year \u2014 the kind of money that would allow the teams to hire more staff members and pay a competitive salary.\n\nBoling has another mission. The nation faces a dire shortage of family doctors, especially those who focus on the elderly. And no wonder: Primary care is exhausting. The hours are long and the pay is paltry compared with specialties such as dermatology or plastic surgery.\n\n\u201cOne of my goals, my career-long goals when I quit, is to have established an economic model that makes this a desirable mode of practice,\u201d Boling says. He understands that medical school debt is crushing. \u201cBut I think if I could pay these guys like a hospitalist, like a junior cardiologist or something, many of them would be flocking to our door.\u201d\n\nAll of which explains why, today, Boling is driving two second-year med students to see 93-year-old Helen Shadoan.\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nPhysician Peter Boling talks with patient Helen Shadoan at her home at the Heritage Oaks retirement home in Richmond, Va., while nurse practioner Marie Gerardo checks Shadoan\u2019s blood pressure. In the background is Loretta Byrd, who assists Shadoan on a daily basis. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)\n\nBoling and his students pull into the parking lot at Heritage Oaks, a retirement complex 15 minutes from downtown. A tottering ragtime tune issues from the common room piano.\n\nThe crowd shuffles inside Shadoan\u2019s spare living room. On a wooden table in the corner, a white Teddy bear leans against an empty flowerpot. An oxygen machine and its tubes are neatly arranged near the entrance.\n\nShadoan, 93, sits in a pink gown facing the single window. A rotation of home-care aides looks after her round-the-clock. She is blind and hard of hearing, but her voice is still lustrous. She used to be an audiovisual technician, she says, developing photographs and making charts.\n\n\u201cDo you still remember where you used to work?\u201d someone asks.\n\n\u201cCertainly!\u201d she says. \u201cThe Veterans Administration \u2014 well, I guess it\u2019s Veterans Affairs now.\u201d\n\nMarie Gerardo, the nurse practitioner in charge of her case, begins to tell Boling about Shadoan\u2019s recent brush with pneumonia. Autumn is a perilous time for the elderly. A couple of weeks ago, Shadoan began to run a fever.\n\n\u201cHer temp in the evening was 101.5 and her pressure when I was here was in the 80s over 60s,\u201d Gerardo says. The room inhales all at once. \u201cSo I was begging her to go to the emergency room, literally.\u201d\n\nBut Shadoan flatly refused.\n\nBoling leans over to talk into Shadoan\u2019s ear. \u201cWhen you had that pneumonia, you were really sick,\u201d he says. He grew up near Boston but he has worked nearly his entire career in Virginia. These days his voice slips into a slight twang when he talks to patients.\n\n\u201cDid you feel really sick?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t feel that bad,\u201d Shadoan says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have that much energy.\u201d\n\nBoling tells the students that this common among older patients, who often can\u2019t tell how sick they actually are.\n\n\u201cI wanted her in the hospital,\u201d Gerardo continues. \u201cAnd Ms. Shadoan, at 93, was very emphatic about not going. She\u2019s blind and extremely hard of hearing, so a hospital visit is horrible for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just give me a nervous breakdown,\u201d Shadoan says.\n\nThat day, Gerardo had acquiesced. She ordered a mobile chest X-ray and started Shadoan on antibiotics. She did not force her patient to go to the emergency room.\n\nThis, in the end, was the right call. Shadoan was more comfortable at home. She was spared an unnecessary hospitalization, and Medicare saved money.\n\n\u201cIt probably took her a bit longer to get better, but in reality she was probably better served not being in the hospital,\u201d Gerardo says. \u201cShe has done really quite well.\u201d\n\nBoling turns to the two student doctors standing near the wall. Shadoan is still recovering a bit from the pneumonia, and Boling wants the students to break out their stethoscopes. How does her chest sound? Do they think Gerardo made the right choice?\n\n* * *\n\nWhen President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, most of the nation focused on how the law would extend health-care coverage to more Americans. Recall the bitterly debated insurance mandates; the push to expand Medicaid that some governors foreswore as federal meddling.\n\nAlthough concerns about ballooning medical spending had gotten the ball rolling on health-care reform, the actual legislation did not roll out grand plans for containing health-care costs. Instead, the law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to oversee a salvo of demonstration projects, each promising to zap various inefficiencies in the system.\n\nA curious fact about health care in the United States is that most doctors can diagnose its dysfunctions in an instant. They know they should spend more time with their patients, and spend more time following up on them. They want to. They also know they should talk more with nurses, should talk more with social workers, should talk more with psychiatrists, should talk more with pharmacists, and so on.\n\nBut by and large, the system can punish those instincts. Most doctors have little opportunity do the kind of coordination and follow-up that leads to better health outcomes. You cannot bill Medicare, for instance, for spending an extra hour on the phone trying to figure out why your patient didn\u2019t get her at-home oxygen tank. But that might be exactly the kind of miscellaneous assistance she needs to get better, and the kind of assistance she might never receive because no one has the time to notice the problem, let alone delegate it to a social worker, if there even is one on staff.\n\n\u201cThe system pays for the bricks, but it won\u2019t pay for the cement,\u201d says Bruce Kinosian, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOne of the goals of the ACA is to figure out, in different ways, how to pay for that cement.\n\nEarlier this year, Kinosian co-wrote a study on the house-call programs operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He and his colleagues \u2014 including Thomas Edes, the VA\u2019s director of geriatrics \u2014 compared the medical costs of patients before and after they entered a house-call program. They found that the VA\u2019s house-call teams not only paid for themselves, but they also went on to reduce overall health-care costs by 12 percent. In part this was because patients were 25 percent less likely to go to a hospital.\n\nIn the VA study, patients also reported sky-high satisfaction ratings: 83 percentsaid their care was \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nAnother study this year, also in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, compared patients in a D.C. house-call program to a carefully matched control group with similar diseases and medical histories. The house-call patients cost Medicare 17 percent less. About half of the savings came from reduced hospitalizations, and another chunk from keeping patients out of nursing facilities.\n\nA theme of modern health-care reform has been a process called \u201caligning incentives.\u201d That means, for instance, fining hospitals that discharge patients who quickly land in the hospital again. It also means paying for results, not for individual procedures. Boling and his colleagues have lobbied hard for the government to recognize the savings and increased satisfaction that their house-call programs generate.\n\nIndependence at Home, which is limited to 10,000 patients, is an attempt to show how house-call practices can get a cut of the savings they generate. The Medicare office uses a statistical model to predict how much each patient is expected to cost each year. If a house-call team can bring their patients\u2019 costs below the prediction, through better care or fewer emergency room visits, Medicare will share the savings with that team. Medicare takes the first 5 percent saved each year, and gives the doctors 80 percent of any savings thereafter.\n\nUnder this formula, a house-call team might get a couple of thousand of dollars extra per patient per year if it can reduce a costs by 10 to 15 percent \u2014 a reduction that\u2019s in line with what the studies predict. The money would be a great boon to these practices, most of which can handle only 200 to 500 of these complex, sick patients. (A typical primary care physician might serve 2,500 regular patients.) In his practice, Boling could use the money to hire a couple of extra social workers or physicians.\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nPhysician Peter Boling chats with Paige Carpenter, executive director of the Heritage Oaks retirement home in Richmond, Va. Boling had been upstairs visiting a patient with second-year medical students Sarah Hughes, second from right and Adrienne Uphoff. (Timothy C. Wright for the Washington Post)\n\nBoling, who chairs the geriatrics division at VCU\u2019s medical school, runs two house-call teams at the university. He staffs each with a handful of physicians and nurse practitioners, along with social workers, triage nurses and, recently, a pharmacist. Once a week, the teams assemble to discuss their patients and various aspects of their lives.\n\nThis is the kind of health care that Boling thinks millions of elderly Americans should have access to: comprehensive, in-depth and insistent.\n\n\u201cWe get into every little part of their medical history and their social history,\u201d says Susanna Payne, a nurse practitioner. \u201cI know how many grades she completed in school, I know what she used to do for work. I know how how many kids she has, how many are still alive. How many are actually involved in her care.\u201d\n\nThe program is not for everyone. Boling\u2019s doctors focus on the most complex cases: people with multiple chronic illnesses, who rarely leave the house. These are the ones who benefit most from the careful services they provide.\n\nOn a recent Thursday, with her colleagues gathered around a conference table, Payne runs down the information on one of her newer charges. Mary is an 82-year-old with high blood pressure, a pacemaker and impaired vision from macular degeneration, with a history of vertigo and stroke. She recently went to the emergency room because she felt dizzy and her urine was dark. The doctors there diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection and sent her home. (Mary\u2019s last name has been withheld for privacy reasons.)\n\nThese are the kinds of unnecessary ER visits that the team tries to prevent. Someone could have helped her over the phone, or with a quick visit. The team always has someone on call 24/7.\n\nFor five years, Payne says, Mary has been relying on the emergency room for her primary care. \u201cShe\u2019s used to calling 911 and going to these hospitals when she really needs something,\u201d Payne tells the group.\n\nIt takes \u201ca little while for people to get used to having access to care, to learn to rely on us,\u201d Boling says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t usually take too terribly long for people to find that they don\u2019t like the ER experience as much as having someone come to their house.\u201d\n\nOn a recent house call, Mary complained of painful calluses on her feet. Payne arranged a visit from a podiatrist. Mary also showed Payne a $200 bill for a medical bracelet that she could not afford. Payne immediately e-mailed the team\u2019s social worker to see if she could get the bracelet for free.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into someone\u2019s house, you stumble across these things that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily stumble across in clinic, that really do cause a great deal of anxiety,\u201d Payne says.\n\nTreating very frail elderly patients often requires treating families. Physician Amy Paul brings up another patient she\u2019s worried about, a bedbound 87-year-old woman who lives with her daughter and grandchildren. The daughter, who looks after her mother, is supposed to be seeing a psychiatrist, but she hasn\u2019t been going. The daughter\u2019s blood-sugar levels also recently were so high that she needed a shot of insulin from the ER. But during her home visit, Paul saw the daughter having sweet tea with crackers and Doritos \u2014 terrible foods for someone with high blood sugar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a couple of visits with a lot of education,\u201d Paul says.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Helen Shadoan\u2019s apartment, kneeling in the afternoon light, Sarah Hughes lifts her stethoscope to the elderly woman\u2019s chest.\n\nAll med students at VCU are required to sign up for a house call. Hughes wants to become a pediatrician. She\u2019s used to being in clinics, where she says the pace is much quicker \u2014 20 minutes per patient, tops. By now, they\u2019ve already been in Shadoan\u2019s room for 35.\n\nGerardo instructs her to lean closer and talk in a deeper voice so that Shadoan can hear her.\n\n\u201cHi, Ms. Shadoan,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI\u2019m a student. My name is Sarah. Can I listen to your heart?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Shadoan says. \u201cJust tell me what you want me to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just sit there. You\u2019re doing great,\u201d Hughes says.\n\n\u201cYou guys have been remembering to observe when you walked in, right?\u201d Boling says, as the students wrap up. \u201cYou noticed the oxygen tubing and the walker. Now, Ms. Shadoan can\u2019t see, so she\u2019s already adapted her environment to some extent. She knows where everything is in this apartment, exactly.\u201d\n\nThe conversation turns to her daily routine. She wakes up at 5 or 6 every morning and switches on MSNBC. She likes political talk shows, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in particular.\n\nShe voted for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the 2008 presidential race, and Obama in 2012. \u201cWell as far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s okay,\u201d Shadoan says of the president. \u201cHe\u2019s not the best one we ever had. He\u2019s certainly isn\u2019t the worst.\u201d\n\nThe best one?\n\n\u201cOh my, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe FDR. He\u2019s the first one I ever voted for.\u201d\n\nSomeone asks for her thoughts on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t quite understand it,\u201d she says, pausing. \u201cMy son\u2019s thoroughly against it. But I think there must be some good parts to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has done many things.
