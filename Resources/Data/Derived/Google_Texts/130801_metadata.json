Robert Gallucci will be the latest one to leave when his five-year term at the helm of the MacArthur Foundation expires at the end of this month. Since the start of the year, new CEOs have taken charge at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation while both the James Irvine Foundation, The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) and Pittsburgh Foundation seek new leaders.\n\nA bevy of nonprofit CEOs announced their retirements in recent months, including Peggy Conlon at The Ad Council, Jane Gilbert at The ALS Association, Valerie Lies at Donors Forum and Sharon Camp of the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\u201cBaby Boomers are getting to be 60, 65, and it\u2019s time for them to move on to other things,\u201d said Tom Flannery, a Boston, Mass.-based partner with Mercer consulting.\n\nThe inevitable conversation around when someone is going to retire and what they plan to do is very different from 20 years ago, when the plan was typically to head south and play golf. \u201cWhat we hear more and more today is, they want to serve on a board, be an advisor, use the knowledge they\u2019ve built up, but they don\u2019t want the 9-5 grind. That\u2019s a big change,\u201d Flannery said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s opening up a lot of talent. Not a lot of them are running to publicly traded companies,\u201d he said. The problem that exists is finding the right matchmaker between candidates and board members and organizations, he said. Some communities have organizations that focus on helping nonprofits find board members.\n\nTurnover among nonprofit chief executives is occurring at a faster pace now than in previous years, according to statistics Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The Chicago-based search firm tracks staff and CEO turnover in the nonprofit and government sector (although it doesn\u2019t break out nonprofit and government).\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, 50 CEOs have stepped down compared with 36 during the same period in 2013. That\u2019s a faster clip than last year when 178 posts turned over during all of 2013, which was nearly identical to the 179 the firm tracked in 2012. In previous years, the totals turnover was closer to 150 openings.\n\nThe demographics of CEOs and the aging of Baby Boomers is having an impact but David Edell, president and co-founder of DRG, a New York City-based executive search firm focused on nonprofits, said there\u2019s more to it. \u201cI would characterize it as a changing business model of nonprofits: the pressures that nonprofits are facing I think, many people are requiring different sets of skills, priorities, and background. So I think boards are pushing to make some change in those areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt varies field to field; in human services and healthcare, it\u2019s all about managed care, in other areas it\u2019s all about fundraising. There are a bunch of changes in the world that are dictating different kinds of skills.\u201d\n\nA new generation of board leaders has different expectations about how organizations should be run and the relationship between boards and CEOs, Edell said, which could be driving change as well.\n\n\u201cRetirement\u201d doesn\u2019t mean golfing for fishing anymore either. Dr. Larry Corey will step down this summer after three and a half years as president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Wash. He plans to focus his energies on research toward vaccines for HIV and herpes viruses.\n\nAfter 30 years leading the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), William C. McGinly next month will become the new president of Gobel Education, a health care philanthropic services firm. John Seffrin has led the Atlanta, Ga.-based American Cancer Society for two decades and announced plans to retire. Though there\u2019s no timetable, he said he would continue to work to fight non-communicable diseases. The longest-serving president in CASE\u2019s 40-year history, John Lippincott informed members earlier this year that he will retire in January 2015. Appointed in 2004, he is the organization\u2019s ninth president. There\u2019s no word yet on his next move.\n\nIt\u2019s much more common these days for people to enter a second career, not just a second employer, Flannery said, but doing something very different.\n\nYears ago, maybe a CEO would have stuck around longer, Edell said, but people who are staying in jobs for seven to 10 years don\u2019t view it as their life\u2019s work. People who are now in their late 50s say they have more things in life that they want to accomplish and they\u2019re not \u201cgoing to hang around for the next seven years,\u201d Edell said.\n\n\u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, executives would come to a job, building it, finding new challenges and stay forever and love it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of CEOs who are saying, \u2018I just don\u2019t want to deal with the changes,\u2019 and want to pack it in, retiring at 55 or 60 and not the magic 65 or 67,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cWhat\u2019s good about that is they recognize they may not be the right person going forward and are willing to exit gracefully. That provides an opportunity for advancement for new people coming into the organization,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a particular issue in healthcare where the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is putting significant stress on organizations and the regulatory environment is getting more stringent, Flannery said. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019re seeing people who\u2019ve just said it\u2019s not worth it to stick around while other\u2019s who\u2019ve said this is the most exciting time ever.\u201d\n\nHe told the story of one CEO in his 70s who was expected to retirement but thinks all the changes in healthcare are \u201cjust unbelievably terrific.\u201d Flannery said he\u2019s still seeing a lot of people in their 40s and 50s who are still on the achievement drive and if there are opportunities and the circumstances are right, they\u2019ll take them. \u201cPeople are changing jobs for new opportunities,\u201d he said. For example, a 45-year-old who recognizes that they might not become the CEO at their organization may find there\u2019s an opening, get recruited and move on elsewhere.\n\nLack of fit\n\nWhen a CEO retires, it\u2019s usually accompanied by laudatory announcements outlining accomplishments during their tenure. In some cases though, there\u2019s far less talk about what was accomplished and merely some obligatory public thanks for their service. A short tenure can mean it was a weak marriage from the start.\n\nThe lack of fit between a CEO and an organization is a relatively small percentage of the turnover, Flannery said. He\u2019s seen situations where within the first 30 days, it was evident the hire did not work out while in other cases it\u2019s takes more than 18 months. Boards must be willing to give feedback and guidance to their CEO, to make sure there\u2019s clarity around the expectations. \u201cWhere we see that clarity, we\u2019re seeing fewer cases of failed executives. That means that the board has got to step up and provide that type of counseling,\u201d Flannery said.\n\nOf course, some boards and search committees talk about seeking a change, bringing new energy and dynamics, Edell said, but got out to hire and realize they weren\u2019t quite as ready. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a bad fit, bad mutual expectations, just not matching up. They hired the person they said they wanted but weren\u2019t really ready for what they wanted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the context of this, there is a thrashing around of what kind of leadership do we want to help lead our nonprofit businesses these days, and will we find it in the nonprofit sector; do we find it someplace else, is it inspiring, can they manage the complexity of the new environment? No one in any sectors found the model that they have most confident in. Bad fits\u2026have to do with trying to do those kinds of things and not exactly working out the way they thought they might,\u201d Edell said.\n\nLarger, asset-rich organizations are much more sophisticated in their recruitment process as smaller ones don\u2019t have the assets to do it, Flannery said, while smaller, local organizations are looking at more local candidates so they don\u2019t have major relocation costs and related issues. Those large organizations are changing how the individual is going through the final process, bringing them into town and letting them see what the environment is like. \u201cOrganizations have recognized that they\u2019ve got to in many ways market themselves in a much more positive way,\u201d Flannery said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the nation\u2019s largest foundations have seen a new chief executive take over this year.
