To a large extent, this approach was driven by the lack of cost-competitive alternative options to flaring, as the price for equipment capable of capturing and distributing byproduct gas was considerably higher than flaring.\n\nGiven flaring\u2019s relative low cost and convenience, many producers neglected to look for alternatives, choosing to focus on exploiting vast underground pools of gas rather than capturing oil-byproduct gas.\n\nThis has been the case in some of the world\u2019s largest oil- and gas-producing countries, which have also been among the biggest gas flaring nations thus far.\n\nRecognizing the significance and impact of gas flaring on the global economy and environment, the World Bank began issuing periodic progress reports on flaring since it launched its anti-flaring initiative in 2001.\n\nAs such initiatives raised awareness of flaring, a growing number of countries began to realize that reducing flaring could offer important dividends. Firms and policymakers, however, had to progressively employ careful strategic planning and vision instead of focusing on the immediate cost burdens presented by methods of capturing byproduct gas.\n\nThe United States, Russia and Nigeria \u2014 traditionally among the world\u2019s largest gas flaring countries \u2014 led the charge in these efforts, as they have reduced their flaring activities by enforcing limits and environmentally friendly policies. Yet, despite their efforts, flaring still accounts for billions in lost revenues for the industry and continues to harm our environment.\n\nAs we move forward to a cleaner, more environmentally sustainable world, more investments and regulations will be needed from these countries and others to truly tackle this issue.\n\nFrom a policy and regulatory perspective, producers can create the frameworks required to reduce flaring by joining the efforts of the World Bank\u2019s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Public-Private Partnership, which Azerbaijan and SOCAR joined alongside other governments and companies to better identify solutions to eliminate flaring from the energy industry by 2030.\n\nThe global oil and gas industry has widely recognized the importance of mitigating the negative effects of ecological and climate change, and has integrated environmental protection into the international agenda as a matter of priority.\n\nAzerbaijan, as an oil-producing country, has undertaken bold actions in this regard, achieving significant results over the past several years.\n\nRegardless of how we look at it, anti-flaring investments should have a long-term structural style, similar to Azerbaijan\u2019s gas-flaring-reduction program.\n\nThe program is part of a 24-year-old, multi-billion-dollar government and SOCAR joint effort to reduce petroleum-company pollution and clean up already polluted soil and water.\n\nAs a practical example, SOCAR and its international partners cooperated to decrease the ratio of flared gas equivalent to 1.7 percent in 2013 and 1.6 percent in 2014, respectively. The captured flare gas was eventually channeled into the transportation network and delivered to end consumers.\n\nBefore Azerbaijan began its anti-flaring program in 2008, byproduct gas accounted for 20 percent of all the gas produced by its national petroleum enterprise \u2014 the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic, or SOCAR.\n\nBetween 2008, the year SOCAR began its anti-flaring efforts, and 2010, the company cut the amount of gas it was flaring by 45 percent. The 2008 figure was 494 million cubic meters, the 2010 figure 276 million.\n\nThe flaring reduction also eliminated 396,000 tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions a year.\n\nBut just as the World Bank estimated in 2012, Azerbaijan\u2019s investments and byproduct-gas recovery plan \u201cwill put 1.6 billion cubic meters of natural gas to productive use\u201d by 2017, creating considerable additional sources of gas revenues.\n\nGiven my direct responsibility and involvement in addressing environmental issues, I must note the crucial contributions of our strong and trusted global energy partners, without whom such results would have been impossible.\n\nSOCAR has also joined the World Bank\u2019s initiative \u201cZero Routine Flaring 2030\u201d in conjunction with other major oil companies and was the fifth company to sign up.\n\nTransitioning into cleaner and more efficient energy production is not an easy step. Large energy consumer markets like the United States and China continue to face complications in maintaining clean, yet profitable domestic production markets, for instance.\n\nThis often means that investments in broader environmental technology are sidelined to make way for short-term economic gains. It is certainly understandable, and in an industry no short of uncertainties like oil and gas, both these countries face the challenge of finding more advantageous and secure domestic alternatives to fossil-fuel imports from foreign partners.\n\nBut anti-flaring initiatives offer a rather unique value proposition for producers. Just as in Azerbaijan, they can lead to substantial business gains for the industry and the country \u2014 while at the same time protect the environment and the public\u2019s health.\n\nFlaring generates 300 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, plus tons of other pollutants.\n\nBringing flaring down to zero in the coming years would be good news for all.\n\nThe global economy will gain billions in additional unused energy assets, while our environment will keep breathing the way it is intended to.\n\nHuseynzade is the vice president of ecology at SOCAR, the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Petroleum companies across the world still burn off a colossal 140 billion cubic meters of byproduct gas a year.", "description": "Petroleum companies across the world still burn off a colossal 140 billion cubic meters of byproduct gas a year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Petroleum companies across the world still burn off a colossal 140 billion cubic meters of byproduct gas a year.", "title": "More must be done to cut wasteful, polluting gas flaring", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238936-more-must-be-done-to-cut-wasteful-polluting-gas", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238936-more-must-be-done-to-cut-wasteful-polluting-gas", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-16T18:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Rafiga Huseynzade", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-16T18:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238936-more-must-be-done-to-cut-wasteful-polluting-gas", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Petroleum companies across the world still burn off a colossal 140 billion cubic meters of byproduct gas a year.", "card": "summary", "title": "More must be done to cut wasteful, polluting gas flaring"}, "dcterms.title": "More must be done to cut wasteful, polluting gas flaring"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5c9\"", "article_summary": "Until the past decade or so, most oil and gas producers routinely practiced gas flaring, preferring to burn off the natural gas that rose to the surface during production rather than capture it.\nThe United States, Russia and Nigeria \u2014 traditionally among the world\u2019s largest gas flaring countries \u2014 led the charge in these efforts, as they have reduced their flaring activities by enforcing limits and environmentally friendly policies.\nThis has been the case in some of the world\u2019s largest oil- and gas-producing countries, which have also been among the biggest gas flaring nations thus far.\nRecognizing the significance and impact of gas flaring on the global economy and environment, the World Bank began issuing periodic progress reports on flaring since it launched its anti-flaring initiative in 2001.\nYet, despite their efforts, flaring still accounts for billions in lost revenues for the industry and continues to harm our environment."}
