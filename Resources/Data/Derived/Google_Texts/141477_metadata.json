They considered plans sold both on the state's exchange, Covered California, as well as in the commercial market.\n\nThey confirmed that exchange plans generally have fewer hospitals in-network than employer-sponsored plans. But in contrast to the concerns of many lawmakers and the public, they also determined that narrow networks still offer quality care. What's more, the study supports what insurers have been saying for years: Narrow networks can substantially lower costs.\n\n\"Our analyses paint a somewhat surprising picture of the difference in the average quality of hospitals in these networks,\" the study authors wrote. \"The average quality in the [Covered California] networks is actually higher than that in the commercial networks.\"\n\nAlthough consumers enrolled in exchange plans can choose from a smaller pool of hospitals to receive care, the narrow networks \"only marginally restrict geographic access as measured by the percentage of people residing in at least one hospital market area,\" the authors said.\n\nCalifornia officials have been among the nation's leaders in investigating narrow networks, FierceHealthPayer has reported. And in two separate lawsuits, Consumer Watchdog sued Cigna and Blue Shield of California, claiming they offered inadequate provider networks and incorrectly advertised which providers were in their networks.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Health Affairs study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStates played key role in enforcing network standards in 2014\n\nMore consumers enrolling in narrow network health insurance plans\n\nSome ACA plan enrollees struggle to find docs\n\nCalifornia officials scrutinizing narrow networks\n\nCigna, Blue Shield of Calif. sued for 'bait and switch' scheme", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although narrow network plans, which are commonly sold on the health insurance exchanges, offer far fewer hospitals and doctors for consumers to choose from, they still deliver similar or better quality care as other plans, according to a study published in Health Affairs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Although narrow network plans, which are commonly sold on the health insurance exchanges, offer far fewer hospitals and doctors for consumers to choose from, they still deliver similar or better quality care as other plans, according to a study published in Health Affairs.", "title": "Narrow network plans offer same quality as other plans", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/narrow-network-plans-offer-same-quality-other-plans/2015-05-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Blue Shield of California,employer-based coverage,Exchange Plans,Health insurance exchanges,narrow networks,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "But in contrast to the concerns of many lawmakers and the public, they also determined that narrow networks still offer quality care.\n\"The average quality in the [Covered California] networks is actually higher than that in the commercial networks.\"\nWhat's more, the study supports what insurers have been saying for years: Narrow networks can substantially lower costs.\nAlthough narrow network plans, which are commonly sold on the health insurance exchanges, offer far fewer hospitals and doctors for consumers to choose from, they still deliver similar or better quality care as other plans, according to a study published in Health Affairs.\nCalifornia officials have been among the nation's leaders in investigating narrow networks, FierceHealthPayer has reported."}
