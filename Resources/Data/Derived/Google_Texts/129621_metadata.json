In his New York Times column this morning, he appears to discover what at least half the country has long known: The Republican Party has been hijacked by unruly nihilists. \u201cThe House Republican caucus,\u201d Brooks writes, \u201cis close to ungovernable these days. How did that situation come about?\u201d I\u2019m not sure what prompted his eureka moment, but it\u2019s nice to see Brooks, a card-carrying member of the conservative intelligentsia, finally reckon with the present state of the GOP.\n\nThree months ago I wrote a similar column about the degeneration of conservatism and the Republican Party. I argued that conservatism, as a practical political philosophy, was essentially dead in this country. And that the GOP has abandoned its rich intellectual history, thinkers like Edmund Burke and Alexis de Tocqueville and even William F. Buckley, Jr. In today\u2019s Republican Party, there is no place for ideas or compromise or prudent governance; it\u2019s a party of reactionaries and insurgents, people drunk on destruction.\n\nTo his credit, Brooks grapples honestly with this in his piece. He writes:\n\nThis was not just the work of the Freedom Caucus or Ted Cruz or one month\u2019s activity. The Republican Party\u2019s capacity for effective self-governance degraded slowly, over the course of a long chain of rhetorical excesses, mental corruptions and philosophical betrayals. Basically, the party abandoned traditional conservatism for right-wing radicalism. Republicans came to see themselves as insurgents and revolutionaries, and every revolution tends toward anarchy and ends up devouring its own.\n\nThis is all undeniably true, but it didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Today\u2019s GOP is the inevitable result of decades of collusion between the Republican Party and the conservative media-industrial complex. The sane and reasonable conservative voices have been subsumed by the hysterical shrieks of Sean Hannity and Bill O\u2019Reilly and the entrepreneurs on right-wing talk radio. These are the voices that represent conservative politics, and they are what\u2019s poisoned the conservative brand. And Brooks makes no effort to deny this:", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's unclear what took him so long, but the NYT conservative admits that the GOP is ungovernable", "title": "Sweet Jesus, David Brooks is finally making sense: How Fox News & the GOP insanity caucus pushed him over the edge", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's unclear what took him so long, but the NYT conservative admits that the GOP is ungovernable", "title": "Sweet Jesus, David Brooks is finally making sense: How Fox News & the GOP insanity caucus pushed him over the edge", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/13/sweet_jesus_david_brooks_is_finally_making_sense_how_fox_news_the_gop_insanity_caucus_pushed_him_over_the_edge/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/david_brooks3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's unclear what took him so long, but the NYT conservative admits that the GOP is ungovernable", "title": "Sweet Jesus, David Brooks is finally making sense: How Fox News & the GOP insanity caucus pushed him over the edge", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/david_brooks3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Conservatives, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, New York Times, Republican Party, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Conservatives, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, New York Times, Republican Party, The Right, Elections News, Media News, News, Politics NewsI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but David Brooks is making sense.\nIn today\u2019s Republican Party, there is no place for ideas or compromise or prudent governance; it\u2019s a party of reactionaries and insurgents, people drunk on destruction.\nThree months ago I wrote a similar column about the degeneration of conservatism and the Republican Party.\nToday\u2019s GOP is the inevitable result of decades of collusion between the Republican Party and the conservative media-industrial complex.\nIn his New York Times column this morning, he appears to discover what at least half the country has long known: The Republican Party has been hijacked by unruly nihilists."}
