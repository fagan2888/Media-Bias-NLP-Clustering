Today\u2014more than 500 days later\u2014the bank has yet to respond to the conservative government watchdog\u2019s request, and Ex-Im\u2019s delayed response has prompted congressional inquiries.\n\nHowever, an examination of public FOIA logs from the bank found the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century has been more successful in obtaining records from Ex-Im.\n\n\u201cI hope the public by now is very aware that Ex-Im is a very non-transparent organization and that its president is a big factor in this lack of transparency,\u201d Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe public ought to be bothered by the lack of transparency, and this is yet more evidence that it is the case.\u201d\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s logs, American Bridge, a \u201cprogressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable for their words and actions,\u201d filed nine FOIA requests from October 2012 to August 2014. Of those, the organization withdrew one request.\n\nOver the last three years, American Bridge 21st Century has requested correspondence between a number of Republican politicians and Ex-Im officials including the bank\u2019s chairman, Fred Hochberg; vice chair, Wanda Felton; and members of its Board of Directors.\n\nThe 80-year-old agency responded to five of the nine information requests filed by American Bridge. Three of those\u2014two of which are less than one year old\u2014remain open because of pending consultation with divisions of the bank.\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the group filed a FOIA request for correspondence between the bank and seven Republican members of Congress running for the U.S. Senate: Reps. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana, Jack Kingston of Georgia, Paul Broun of Georgia, Phil Gingrey of Georgia and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\nThe request was ultimately fulfilled by the bank, though Ex-Im does not publicly disclose how long it took the agency to respond.\n\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century also requested copies of correspondence between the bank\u2019s Board of Directors and former Rep. Michele Bachmann in March 2013, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Hochberg in October 2012.\n\nEx-Im responded to both requests.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to both American Bridge 21st Century and Ex-Im for more information on the information requests, but neither organization answered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite stunning,\u201d de Rugy said. \u201cThe discrepancy in treatment is really problematic. It shouldn\u2019t exist. It should be a process, and there should be no difference in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite stunning. The discrepancy in treatment is really problematic. It shouldn\u2019t exist. It should be a process, and there should be no difference in time,\u201d said @VerodeRugy.\n\n>>> Ex-Im Misrepresents Subsidies to Prominent Billionaire\n\n\u2018Less Than Transparent\u2019\n\nAmericans for Limited Government\u2019s president, Nathan Mehrens, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for correspondence between Ex-Im officials and employees of the consulting firm McLarty Associates close to two years ago.\n\nMcLarty Associates is run by Thomas McLarty, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. According to public records, the firm hasn\u2019t lobbied Congress since 2005, but its clients have benefited from millions in loans and loan guarantees awarded by Ex-Im.\n\nAdditionally, a number of McLarty Associates employees served on the bank\u2019s advisory committee between 2010 and 2013.\n\nMehrens submitted his FOIA request to Ex-Im on Nov. 5, 2013. According to the bank\u2019s records, the relevant documents are currently in the midst of a legal review\u2014more than 500 days later.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s delay of a response to Americans for Limited Government\u2019s request garnered the attention of Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis, who serves as the chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n\nLast week, Duffy sent a letter to Hochberg requesting more information on the \u201cunacceptable\u201d delay of the request, including unredacted copies of the relevant records.\n\nThe bank has until May 11 to respond.\n\n\u201cSadly, I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with an agency that has been less than transparent about its activities and its data,\u201d de Rugy said. \u201cIt seems that the Ex-Im Bank is committed to just blocking access to data.\u201d\n\nHochberg Ties\n\nIn addition to McLarty Associates, Hochberg, Ex-Im\u2019s chairman, also has ties to the Clinton administration.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2001, Hochberg worked with then-President Clinton as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration and later served as acting administrator of the agency.\n\nThe Ex-Im chairman has also been a longtime donor to the couple. From 1992 to 2007, Hochberg personally donated a total of $11,100 to the couple\u2014$8,600 to Hillary Clinton during her runs for the U.S. Senate and president, and $2,500 to Bill Clinton during his presidential elections.\n\nAccording to a 2008 Politico report, Hochberg bundled more than $100,000 in donations for both Hillary Clinton, then a New York senator, and President Obama during the 2008 presidential election.\n\n>>> Conservative House Freedom Caucus Comes Out Against Export-Import Bank", "article_metadata": {"description": "For two groups on opposing sides of the political spectrum, requests to Ex-Im for records under the Freedom of Information Act yield different results.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For two groups on opposing sides of the political spectrum, requests to Ex-Im for records under the Freedom of Information Act yield different results.", "title": "For Two Groups, Requests to Ex-Im Return Different Results", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150505_ExImFOIA_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-06T14:34:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zKWhf6"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For two groups on opposing sides of the political spectrum, requests to Ex-Im for records under the Freedom of Information Act yield different results.", "title": "For Two Groups, Requests to Ex-Im Return Different Results", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150505_ExImFOIA_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-05-06T10:13:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T14:34:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "American Bridge 21st Century, Americans for Limited Government, Export-Import Bank, Freedom of Information Act, Fred Hochberg, Hillary Clinton, Bill Cassidy, Shelley Moore Capito, Tom Cotton, Michele Bachmann"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb49\"", "article_summary": "For two groups on opposing sides of the political spectrum, requests to the Export-Import Bank for records under the Freedom of Information Act yield different results.\nThe Daily Signal reached out to both American Bridge 21st Century and Ex-Im for more information on the information requests, but neither organization answered.\nThe 80-year-old agency responded to five of the nine information requests filed by American Bridge.\nThe request was ultimately fulfilled by the bank, though Ex-Im does not publicly disclose how long it took the agency to respond.\n\u201cIt seems that the Ex-Im Bank is committed to just blocking access to data.\u201dHochberg TiesIn addition to McLarty Associates, Hochberg, Ex-Im\u2019s chairman, also has ties to the Clinton administration."}
