Sellus Wilder, who placed second in the primary, had tried to align himself with the state\u2019s more liberal community and those backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgent bid for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nGreg Blair, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, previewed the message the party will use against Gray to defend Paul\u2019s seat in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cRand Paul is a tireless advocate for jobs and limited government and a fierce opponent of the Obama-Clinton war on coal,\u201d he said. \u201cJim Gray is just the latest in a growing line of Democrats who thought they could run from their party\u2019s toxic policies of the last eight years. Gray should celebrate his primary win because with his support of Obamacare and the rest of Barack Obama\u2019s liberal agenda, his campaign has reached its high water mark.\u201d\n\nPaul re-emerged in Bluegrass State politics when he ended his presidential bid in February after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. Though some Republicans in Kentucky were unhappy with his presidential campaign at the time, he appears to have solidified his support among his base \u2013 easily beating two minor rivals on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile the Kentucky Senate seat is viewed as relatively safe for Republicans, Democrats are not ignoring it. Like their support for Democrat Connor Eldridge in Arkansas, the national Democratic support for Gray gives them a chance \u2013 just in case \u2013 in an election year that has so far proven unpredictable.\n\nWith a large personal fortune from his family\u2019s construction business, Gray has said he will be able compete with Paul in the advertising fight.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "After a projected victory in the Kentucky Senate Democratic primary on Tuesday, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray will lead the party's uphill effort to unseat incumbent Republican Rand Paul in November.", "title": "Lexington Mayor Jim Gray Earns Nod to Challenge Rand Paul", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/alert/lexington-mayor-jim-gray-wins-democratic-primary-rand-paul/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a projected victory in the Kentucky Senate Democratic primary on Tuesday, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray will lead the party's uphill effort to unseat incumbent Republican Rand Paul in November.", "creator": "@eyokley", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "title": "Lexington Mayor Jim Gray Earns Nod to Challenge Rand Paul", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Campaigns", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MissouriEli"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "After a projected victory in the Kentucky Senate Democratic primary on Tuesday, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray will lead the party\u2019s uphill effort to unseat incumbent Republican Rand Paul in November.\nLike their support for Democrat Connor Eldridge in Arkansas, the national Democratic support for Gray gives them a chance \u2013 just in case \u2013 in an election year that has so far proven unpredictable.\nGray had been supported by much of the party\u2019s established infrastructure, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and those in the state who supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\nWith a large personal fortune from his family\u2019s construction business, Gray has said he will be able compete with Paul in the advertising fight.\n\u201cRand Paul is a tireless advocate for jobs and limited government and a fierce opponent of the Obama-Clinton war on coal,\u201d he said."}
