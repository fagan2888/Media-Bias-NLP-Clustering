K. had a turn at becoming an education wonk with his commentary on the Common Core standards. Numerous \u201cChiefs for Change\u201d toppled from the ranks of chiefdom. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett went down in defeat due in part to his gutting of public schools, as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker remained resilient while spreading the cancerous voucher program from Milwaukee to the rest of the state.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio rose to turn back the failed education reforms of ex-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, only to have his populist agenda blocked by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who insisted on imposing policies favored by Wall Street. Progressives formed Democrats for Public Education to counter the neoliberal, big money clout of Democrats for Education Reform. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush emerged as rival voices in the ongoing debate about the Common Core among potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\nBut hogging the camera throughout the year was another notable character: charter school scandals.\n\nIn 2014, charter schools, which had always been marketed for a legendary ability to deliver promising new innovations for education, became known primarily for their ability to concoct innovative new scams.\n\nFrom Local Stories to National Scandal\n\nTroubling news stories about the financial workings of charter schools had been leaking slowly into the media stream for some years.\n\nA story that appeared at Forbes in late 2013 foretold a lot of what would emerge in 2014. That post \u201cCharter School Gravy Train Runs Express to Fat City\u201d brought to light for the first time in a mainstream source the financial rewards that were being mined from charter schools. As author Addison Wiggin explained, a mixture of tax incentives, government programs and Wall Street investors eager to make money were coming together to deliver a charter school bonanza \u2013 especially if the charter operation could \u201cescape scrutiny\u201d behind the veil of being privately held or if the charter operation could mix its business in \u201cwith other ventures that have nothing to do with education.\u201d\n\nAs 2014 began, more stories about charter schools scandals continued to drip out from local press outlets \u2013 a chain of charter schools teaching creationism, a charter school closing abruptly for mysterious reasons, a charter high school operating as a for-profit \u201cbasketball factory,\u201d recruiting players from around the world while delivering a sub-par education.\n\nHere and there, stories emerged: a charter school trying to open up inside the walls of a gated community while a closed one continued to get more than $2 million in taxpayer funds. Stories about charter operators being found guilty of embezzling thousands of taxpayer dollars turned into other stories about operators stealing even more thousands of dollars, which turned into even more stories about operators stealing over a million dollars.\n\nWhile some charter schools schemed to steer huge percentages of their money away from instruction toward management salaries and property leases (to firms connected to the charter owners, of course), others worked the system to make sure fewer students with special needs were in their classrooms.\n\nThen the steady drip-drip from local news sources turned into a fire hose in May when a blockbuster report released by Integrity in Education and the Center for Popular Democracy revealed, \u201cFraudulent charter operators in 15 states are responsible for losing, misusing, or wasting over $100 million in taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nThe report, \u201cCharter School Vulnerabilities to Waste, Fraud And Abuse,\u201d combed through news stories, criminal records and other documents to find hundreds of cases of charter school operators embezzling funds, using tax dollars to illegally support other, non-educational businesses, taking public dollars for services they didn\u2019t provide, inflating their enrollment numbers to boost revenues, and putting children in potential danger by forgoing safety regulations or withholding services.\n\nThe report made charter school scandals a nationwide story and received in-depth coverage at Salon, \u201cBill Moyers and Company,\u201d the Washington Post and the Nation.\n\nA Summer of Scams\n\nCharter schools scandals continued to break throughout the summer.\n\nIn Ohio, report after report continued to reveal how popular charter school chains like White Hat Management had sky-high dropout rates while they poured public money into advertising campaigns and executive pay.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a report found exorbitant costs associated with charter school operations and lavish CEO salaries and bonuses for charter school operators despite vastly underperforming the state\u2019s traditional public schools. Another report revealed how Pennsylvania charters had gamed the system for special education funding, resulting in annual profits of $200 million to the schools.\n\nIn Michigan, a series by the Detroit Free Press found charter schools with \u201cwasteful spending and double-dipping. Board members, school founders and employees steering lucrative deals to themselves or insiders. Schools allowed to operate for years despite poor academic records.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, an investigation by the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel found, \u201cUnchecked charter-school operators are exploiting South Florida\u2019s public school system, collecting taxpayer dollars for schools that quickly shut down.\u201d\n\nAnother Florida local news outlet investigating charter school operations found millions of taxpayer dollars misdirected from classrooms and students to management companies. The report pointed to charter school chain Charter Schools USA that uses tax-exempt bonds to build schools that it then rents to UCSA-affiliated schools. Then the CUSA schools are saddled with rent payments back to CUSA and its management company at rates considerably higher than those charged to other non-CUSA schools in the area.\n\nStill more news stories came out about charter schools related to the largest bricks-and-mortar charter-school chain in the United States run by the secretive Turkish cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen, who lives in exile from Turkey in rural Pennsylvania. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Chicago-area Concept Schools, part of the Gulen charter chain, were subjects of an ongoing federal investigation. The enquiry is about nearly $1 million that has been paid to contractors all with ties to the G\u00fclen network.\n\nArticles from the Washington Post found District of Columbia charter school operators evading rules to pocket millions in taxpayer dollars and charter schools pumping public money into for-profit management companies.\n\nA report in the Arizona Republic found board members and administrators from more than a dozen charter schools \u201cprofiting from their affiliations by doing business with schools they oversee.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charter schools promised new education innovations.
