How the Affordable Care Act showed up in returns

Of the 94 million tax returns claiming coverage, approximately 6.6 million reported an Individual Shared Responsibility Payment (the fee for not having health coverage), over two thirds of which (4.3 million) were prepared by paid or volunteer preparers. The Taxpayer Advocate reported that over 300,000 of those reporting an ISRP didnt actually owe one at all.

Separately, 10.7 million returns filed a Form 8965 to claim coverage exemption; over half of those returns were prepared by a professional or a volunteer.
