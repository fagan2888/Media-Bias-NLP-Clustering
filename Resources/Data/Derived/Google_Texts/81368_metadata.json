It turns out that hospital staff mistook Nate for another baby. Not only that, they even failed to obtain consent from either parent prior to the surgery, with Melton simply assuming nurses had taken away Nate for a physical, only for them to return hours later with a now operated-on son.\n\n\"Essentially they took our child who was 100 percent healthy, no issues at all, out of the nursery and cut his mouth,\" Melton told WTVF. \"At that point I began to cry hysterically.\"\n\nThe procedure in question was a frenectomy, or the removal of a little skin flap (frenulum) underneath the tongue. A similar skin flap exists at the base of our inner lip and in genitalia. While the frenulum normally helps secure a free-hanging organ to the body, it can too harshly restrict its motion if it\u2019s too short. In those cases, surgeons, as they did with Nate, will simply cut away at least a portion of the frenulum. Though unmentioned, it\u2019s likely the medical condition UMC doctors were attempting to fix was ankyloglossia, or tongue-tie.\n\nFor their part, the hospital was quick to admit to their mistake, with the surgeon who operated on Nate explaining what happened in a progress report. \"... I had asked for the wrong infant. I had likely performed the procedure on an infant different than the one I intended to ... and I admitted my mistake and apologized,\" he wrote, according to WTVF.\n\nMelton and her attorney Clint Kelly weren\u2019t particularly enthused by that explanation, however. \"There is no excuse on operating on the wrong baby, none,\" said Kelly. \"We don't know if the child will have speech problems or eating problems. The concern here is this was a healthy baby that was supposed to leave the hospital, but instead was harmed by the hospital.\"\n\nThough the frenectomy is a relatively minor procedure that can be performed at a dentist\u2019s office, Kelly is right to note that there\u2019s really no telling how it might impact someone with an already perfectly functional tongue.\n\nNate's case is hardly the first hospital mishap to receive attention. In 2014, an Alabama couple sued doctors after the man\u2019s planned circumcision became an amputation, and in 2013, a New York City hospital fired the surgeon who removed the wrong kidney from a 76-year-old man on dialysis.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "healthy, newborn, baby, mistakenly, gets, minor, surgery, instead, routine, physical", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Tennessee hospital ended up performing surgery on the wrong newborn, leaving him with a disfigured tongue.", "title": "Tennessee Hospital Performed Surgery On The Wrong Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/healthy-newborn-baby-mistakenly-gets-minor-surgery-instead-routine-physical-372586", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/07/healthy-newborn-baby-mistakenly-gets-minor-surgery-instead-routine-physical.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Tennessee hospital ended up performing surgery on the wrong newborn, leaving him with a disfigured tongue.", "title": "Tennessee Hospital Performed Surgery On The Wrong Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/healthy-newborn-baby-mistakenly-gets-minor-surgery-instead-routine-physical-372586", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/07/healthy-newborn-baby-mistakenly-gets-minor-surgery-instead-routine-physical.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/07/healthy-newborn-baby-mistakenly-gets-minor-surgery-instead-routine-physical.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-07T17:35:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T20:53:52-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Tennessee hospital ended up performing surgery on the wrong newborn, leaving him with a disfigured tongue."}, "article_summary": "The concern here is this was a healthy baby that was supposed to leave the hospital, but instead was harmed by the hospital.\"\n\"There is no excuse on operating on the wrong baby, none,\" said Kelly.\nIt\u2019s a hospital snafu that\u2019s rightfully left the Tennessean parents of an otherwise healthy newborn fuming.\nIt turns out that hospital staff mistook Nate for another baby.\nThe procedure in question was a frenectomy, or the removal of a little skin flap (frenulum) underneath the tongue."}
