The term has all it takes. It is ubiquitous, mysterious and, like its acolyte \u201cleadership,\u201d it works alone and pairs well with many adjectives.\n\nIs there a problem that transformational leadership and disruptive innovation aren\u2019t invoked to solve? Is there a company whose failure is not explained by a lack of both?\n\n\n\nPeople have long been both attracted to and afraid of novelty. These days, however, corporate leaders and management gurus urge us to throw caution to the wind and join in the romance with innovation.\n\nRomance may fill us with hope. But it is not a state of mind that goes with much perspective or discernment.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I am not praising stagnation. I am suggesting that when it comes to innovation, time and type count much less than intent and attention.\n\nThe preoccupation with how much time our company spends innovating and whether changes are radical or incremental can blind us from contemplating why it\u2019s innovating\u2014and for whom.\n\nThe impulse to innovate is often driven, more or less consciously, by a perception of impending threat. Especially if we hold power of some kind we may try to change everything, as the old saying goes, so that everything remains the same. Innovation then becomes a glossy cover for a conservative project\u2014preserving our position rather than solving someone else\u2019s problems.\n\nLook around. How many \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d innovations, be them products, services or ways of operating, are thinly veiled attempts to firm the ground on which established powers stand or to jump onto it? How many make a positive difference that stands the test of time?\n\nGenuine innovation is about renewal, not about preservation. It is often the product of imagination outside, and often against, the norm fueled by a cocktail of discontent, concern, curiosity and hope. It is not always, necessarily, universally beautiful and good.\n\nFor all their current romance, groundbreaking innovation and established leaders are strange bedfellows. And so they should remain. Progress occurs most easily if new and old remain in a dialectic tension, than if the powers that be sedate those who want to become by co-opting their work\u2014and their words.\n\nGianpiero Petriglieri (@gpetriglieri) is associate professor of organizational behavior at INSEAD, where he directs the Management Acceleration Programme for emerging leaders.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Innovation is a strong contender for the crown of business buzzword of the decade.", "title": "Innovation Is a Nice, but Too Often Misunderstood, Buzzword", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/16/innovation-is-a-nice-but-too-often-misunderstood-buzzword/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Innovation Is a Nice, but Too Often Misunderstood, Buzzword", "description": "Innovation is a strong contender for the crown of business buzzword of the decade.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "Innovation is a strong contender for the crown of business buzzword of the decade.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-16T15:05:37-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/16/innovation-is-a-nice-but-too-often-misunderstood-buzzword/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-793", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Innovation is a strong contender for the crown of business buzzword of the decade.", "title": "Innovation Is a Nice, but Too Often Misunderstood, Buzzword", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/16/innovation-is-a-nice-but-too-often-misunderstood-buzzword/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-793", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-16T15:05:47-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ab4\"", "article_summary": "GIANPIERO PETRIGLIERI: Innovation is a strong contender for the crown of business buzzword of the decade.\nFor all their current romance, groundbreaking innovation and established leaders are strange bedfellows.\nThese days, however, corporate leaders and management gurus urge us to throw caution to the wind and join in the romance with innovation.\nIs there a problem that transformational leadership and disruptive innovation aren\u2019t invoked to solve?\nI am suggesting that when it comes to innovation, time and type count much less than intent and attention."}
