It took 12 billion years, but light from a massive explosion that occurred shortly after the Big Bang has just reached Earth.

The rare gamma-ray burst could help scientists understand more about the early universe.

Recorded as GRB 140423A, the explosion was first observed in April by the telescope Rotse-IIIB at an observatory in western Texas owned by Southern Methodist University.

The area of the explosion’s peak afterglow, circled in blue and yellow, can be seen in the image above. A bright star sits to its left.

Gamma-ray bursts are believed to be the catastrophic collapse of a star at the end of its life.

“As NASA points out, gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang,” Farley Ferrante, a graduate student at Southern Methodist University who monitored the explosions with astronomers in Hawaii and Turkey, said in a release from the university.
