The offending sentence has been removed from this amended online version. The Globe and Mail apologizes to Dr. Livingstone for this error.\n\nThe Globe and Mail EDITORIAL CARTOON Editorial cartoons for October, 2014\n\nFor years, the City of Toronto has been trying to get me to ride my bike to work. Armies of urban planners and health officials and environmentalists are convinced that bike commuting will make me healthier and happier and confer a wide range of social benefits, such as lessening traffic congestion and pollution. Secretly, they\u2019re happy that the traffic is getting worse and worse, because they figure more and more people will abandon their cars and take up walking, cycling and public transit instead. If only we could be more like Amsterdam!\n\nPlanners have tried all kinds of incentives to get us to cycle more. Toronto has built dedicated bike lanes, as well as semi-dedicated lanes (a safety menace, in my view). It even invested in a money-losing bike-share program. Sadly, though, I\u2019m no more inclined to ride a bike than ever. My reasons are pedestrian: Sweatiness, helmet hair, inability to pick up dinner and 10 kilograms of cat litter on the way home. And the weather, which is crummy half the year.\n\nBut mostly, I enjoy not having my teeth knocked out. Cycling in Toronto is so dangerous that only lunatics would do it. You can be wiped out at any moment by cars and streetcar tracks.\n\nOnly about 25 per cent of big-city cyclists are women. We have a different idea of our own best interests than the city planners do \u2013 which, I can assure you, will not deter these people in the least.\n\nThe idea that public officials have a duty to help you do what\u2019s in your own interest has taken off with a vengeance, thanks in no small part to something known as \u201cnudge\u201d theory. Nudge theory, which was invented by two guys named Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, is on the face of it quite benign. It recognizes that we are flawed, irrational and occasionally foolish creatures, who, left to our own devices, cannot be relied on to save for retirement, eat our vegetables or floss. The idea behind nudge theory \u2013 also known as \u201csoft paternalism\u201d \u2013 is to design public policies that make the right choices much easier.\n\nOntario\u2019s new pension plan is a good example of nudge theory. The provincial Liberal government \u2013 the finest bunch of soft paternalists you will ever meet \u2013 decided that we aren\u2019t saving enough for retirement. So it will help us. No one will be forced to join the new plan \u2013 that would be too coercive. Instead, people will be automatically enrolled, with an option to drop out. Because the default is to belong, most people will wind up doing the government\u2019s idea of the right thing through sheer inertia. (Whether we need this plan at all is another matter. A lot of people think that if some folks are not very good at saving for retirement, it\u2019s their tough luck.)\n\nNudge theory is the offspring of behavioural economics, which explains why people don\u2019t always act like rational animals, and it\u2019s hot, hot, hot. Governments all over are figuring out how to nudge us into being better people. Prof. Sunstein has advised Barack Obama\u2019s government. Prof. Thaler has advised British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has has set up a behavioural insights team, also known as the Nudge Unit. This team has been busy figuring out how to get people to sign up for organ donation, to pay their taxes on time and to insulate their attics, among other worthy efforts. In a TED talk shortly before he took office, Mr. Cameron explained how knowledge of human behaviour was part of his vision for a \u201cnew age of government.\u201d\n\nMaybe you think all this is a great breakthrough in social policy-making. Or maybe you think there\u2019s something faintly creepy about a behavioural insights team. If it\u2019s the latter, I\u2019m with you.\n\nNew York University professor Jeremy Waldron has just articulated some of this unease in an essay for The New York Review of Books. The most obvious problem with nudge theory, he argues, is that it divides the world into \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u201d are the informed, the dispassionate, the rational ones who happen to be in charge. \u201cWe\u201d are the people who \u201cknow better,\u201d as Prof. Waldron puts it, and who also have the power and the knowledge to manipulate the choices that other people make \u2013 for their own good, of course. \u201cThey,\u201d the poor schlubs, are myopic, lazy, poorly informed and poorly controlled. They need saving from themselves.\n\nThe other problem is that regulators and governments are people too. They have their own fallibilities. \u201cWe all know they are perfectly capable of screwing things up on their own, whether it\u2019s the invasion of Iraq or the rollout of Obamacare,\u201d Prof. Waldron says.\n\nA third problem, one I have observed often, is that \u201csoft paternalism\u201d can morph pretty quickly into \u201csoft authoritarianism,\u201d exemplified by people who are dogmatic, self-righteous and wrong. I ran across a prime example in an e-book by Vancouver\u2019s Bree Galbraith called The Designer Nudge. In it is an interview with Dr. Verity Livingstone, a breastfeeding specialist at the University of British Columbia. The issue is how to nudge new mothers into breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to move them along, to nudge them, you have to decide if the information has to be \u2018scary\u2019 to possibly shift them sooner than the positive bit would,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem in a nutshell. It\u2019s a short step from nudging people to terrorizing them and pushing them around. Many fields \u2013 especially public health \u2013 are full of people who think they have a corner on the truth. These people often bemoan the fact that the public doesn\u2019t trust them. But the reason we don\u2019t trust them is quite often that they are simply imposing their own preferences on the rest of us.\n\nSo stop nudging me already. I may be flawed, but I am an adult. I will not cycle in Toronto traffic. And I don\u2019t like bullies.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Do we need help to do what\u2019s in our own interest?
