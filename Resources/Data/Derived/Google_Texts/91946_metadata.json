Today, only four of those lawmakers are still in office and running for reelection this fall.\n\nThe dramatic downsize underscores not only how consequential the health care law vote was but how quickly moderate Democrats have been eliminated on Capitol Hill. Even those who opposed the law had trouble surviving the highly partisan atmosphere it helped to create.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith the divide only more pronounced in 2014, the final four are trying to avoid a similar fate. Obamacare remains a volatile issue, and all still tout their \u201cno\u201d vote. Yet their vulnerability also reflects a more daunting and long-lasting problem for lawmakers who would occupy the middle ground.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Protecting the sick? Not so easy)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can just look at the Affordable Care Act \u2014 you have to look at the broader picture,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have many people like myself left. The moderates on the Republican side are gone, too.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are small signs that the health care law\u2019s presence on the campaign trail is waning, Peterson and Reps. Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, John Barrow of Georgia and Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts continue to be challenged over whether they did enough to try to stop Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve done more than maybe any member in the House to either sponsor, co-sponsor or vote for bills to make changes to it,\u201d Lipinski said. \u201cI know I have an opponent saying \u2018repeal , repeal, repeal.\u2019 But I think most people understand where we are at right now. They know changes need to be made. But they don\u2019t want to throw the whole thing out.\u201d\n\nLynch, one of the rare Democrats who opposed the health care law from the left, is the only one of the remaining four who doesn\u2019t have an opponent in November. Lipinski, Barrow and Peterson, by contrast, have real campaigns ahead. They represent swing districts that the GOP has been working to reclaim for some time, and all face opponents trying to tie them to Obamacare and to capitalize on the continued unpopularity of both the law and President Barack Obama.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Solving a 2014 Obamacare problem pushes premium hikes in 2015)\n\nRick Allen, the well-funded Republican hoping to unseat Barrow, has repeatedly blasted him for supporting the law, including a Facebook post that faulted him for voting \u201c27 times against repealing, defunding or delaying Obamacare.\u201d Peterson\u2019s and Lipinski\u2019s opponents have lobbed similar criticisms.\n\nNone of the four incumbents has voted to fully repeal the law, but each has backed bills to eliminate particularly disliked parts of Obamacare, such as the employer mandate or individual mandate.\n\nBarrow, for one, turned down the government\u2019s contribution to his health insurance. Lipinski is the lead Democrat on a measure to change the ACA\u2019s \u201cfull time\u201d definition from 30 hours to 40 hours. Both have co-sponsored several bills against parts of the law and voted for more.\n\nPeterson hasn\u2019t been quite as quick to lead the efforts against Obamacare, but he has joined Republicans on several pieces of anti-ACA legislation that have come to the House floor. While he knows the law played a big role in his 2012 race, he senses that its political liability is starting to diminish.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Immigration status may cost people Obamacare coverage\n\n\u201cThe only time it comes up [with constituents] is when I bring it up,\u201d said Peterson, who thinks the GOP overplayed its hand with dozens of repeal votes. \u201cPeople are smarter than that. They know the Senate is Democratic and the president will be there another two years. Even if they wanted repeal, I think they\u2019ve realized it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nLike the other three Democrats, he said he sees value in some parts of the ACA but would vote against it again today. He and the others have touted their opposition and taken steps to remind constituents of their 2010 vote. Both Lynch and Lipinski say they still have constituents thanking them.\n\n\u201cI get mostly really, really, really positive response,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI think it\u2019s because, as is usually the case with a 2,400-page bill, nobody read it. None of my constituents really realized the full details.\u201d\n\nAs they seek reelection this fall, all four men find themselves somewhere in between the Democrats who support the law but are loathe to acknowledge its problems and the Republicans who can\u2019t admit that it has benefits beyond eliminating denials based on preexisting conditions.\n\nThey are pushing a \u201cfix it\u201d line \u2014 as in, they didn\u2019t support the law, but now that it\u2019s here, they don\u2019t want to repeal it. Instead, they want to repair the flaws they see in the legislation. Polling backs up the strategy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sweet spot in the polls \u2014 to be for improving the law, so you\u2019re not for it but you\u2019re not for denying people those benefits,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBarrow, who has frequently supported GOP bills to repeal or undermine small portions of the law, is expecting his Republican challenger to use Obamacare against him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be an issue for our opponent this fall,\u201d a Barrow aide said. But the lawmaker is \u201cnever afraid to talk about it. He was adamantly opposed to the bill when it came out. \u2026 But now, he says this all the time: He\u2019s the guy who has had prostate cancer, and he knows the value of preventive measures. He knows the value of not being able to deny something for preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nThe four Democrats are hoping to hang on where other moderates couldn\u2019t.\n\nHalf of the 34 who voted against Obamacare in March 2010 lost their seats that November, overcome by the Republican wave that was powered in part by the law. Another four chose not to run for reelection.\n\nPublic sentiment hadn\u2019t shifted much by 2012. And today, after defeats and retirements, only six Democrats of the original \u201cno\u201d votes remain. They include Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, who announced their departures earlier this year.\n\nRep. Ben Chandler of Kentucky was among those defeated in 2012. He believes his vote against the law helped him win reelection in 2010, but he couldn\u2019t pull out another tough race just two years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite confident that had I voted for the Affordable Care Act, I would have lost in 2010,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nObamacare has played \u201ca huge role\u201d in Democrats\u2019 losses, he said. \u201cWhen it was being debated, a whole bunch of us moderate Democrats were sitting in the back [of the House chamber], saying, this is going to be the end of us, we\u2019ve got no chance to survive this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The dramatic downsize underscores how quickly moderate Democrats have been eliminated.", "title": "Just 4 anti-ACA House Dems left", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/2014-elections-anti-obamacare-democrats-110237.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/21/stillstandinganimated1.gif", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Congress,Stephen Lynch,Democrats,2014 Elections,John Barrow,Daniel Lipinski,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The dramatic downsize underscores how quickly moderate Democrats have been eliminated.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0aa3\"", "article_summary": "| AP Photo/Getty Just 4 anti-ACA House Dems leftThirty-four House Democrats bucked their party to vote against Obamacare when it passed in 2010.\n\u201cI know I have an opponent saying \u2018repeal , repeal, repeal.\u2019 But I think most people understand where we are at right now.\nHe and the others have touted their opposition and taken steps to remind constituents of their 2010 vote.\nThe dramatic downsize underscores not only how consequential the health care law vote was but how quickly moderate Democrats have been eliminated on Capitol Hill.\nPeterson hasn\u2019t been quite as quick to lead the efforts against Obamacare, but he has joined Republicans on several pieces of anti-ACA legislation that have come to the House floor."}
