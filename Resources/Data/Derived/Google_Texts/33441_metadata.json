It evaluates each request against the public interest of keeping it up.\n\nThe poll also found 64 percent of people believe the U.S. government has gone too far in sweeping up information from technology companies for surveillance purposes. Another 36 percent believe the government has struck the right balance.\n\nThe online poll surveyed 1,032 registered voters from Feb. 26-27 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.05 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The U.S. proposal is similar to the European policy.", "description": "The U.S. proposal is similar to the European policy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The U.S. proposal is similar to the European policy.", "title": "Public wants 'right to be forgotten' online", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/236246-poll-public-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-online", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/biz_cybersecuritystory.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/236246-poll-public-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-online", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-19T09:12-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "search engine, Google, Yahoo, Bing, right to be forgotten, Europe,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-19T09:12:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/236246-poll-public-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-online", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The U.S. proposal is similar to the European policy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Public wants 'right to be forgotten' online"}, "dcterms.title": "Public wants 'right to be forgotten' online"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd663e\"", "article_summary": "Nearly nine in 10 U.S. voters want \"the right to be forgotten\" on the Internet, according to a new poll.\nThe online poll surveyed 1,032 registered voters from Feb. 26-27 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.05 percent.\nThe wipe of the link from search engines does not remove the actual web page from the Internet, and the European policy only extends to search engines specific to Europe, but not the standard Google.com.\nThat proposal is similar to the European policy known as the \"right to be forgotten,\" which has divided those advocating for increased privacy and others who argue it could curtail free expression.\nAnother 36 percent believe the government has struck the right balance."}
