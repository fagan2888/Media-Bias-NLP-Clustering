As medical providers deal with complexities resulting from a weakened economy, rising health care and insurance costs, and the upcoming implementation of the Affordable Health Care Act, services must be trustworthy and cost-effective.

The Act’s rollout will continue through early 2014 and its success relies heavily upon people signing up between Oct. 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014.

“We don’t think the law has gone nearly far enough to recognize the complexity of care or the continuum of the quality of outcomes, but we’ll see where it goes,” Dr. John Noseworthy, president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic, said Tuesday.

There have been about 40 votes in Congress to repeal the law, but alternative options have not been presented.

“Our purpose is to understand what patients need, and every decision we make at the Mayo Clinic is: What is the need of the patient?” Noseworthy said during the Afternoon MoJoe web-exclusive interview. “When you have a mission and a purpose like that, you tend to make the right decisions.”

Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit practice in Rochester, Minn., that will celebrate its 150-anniversary next year, has been working to improve efficiency to provide better care at lower costs for patients.

“Somehow we have to get our hands around the fact that health care in this country is too expensive and too fragmented,” Noseworthy said on Morning Joe.

“It’s all about how we’re going to solve this for the American people,” he added. “We’ll figure it out; I’m sure we will.”
