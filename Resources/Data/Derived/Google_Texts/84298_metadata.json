Every year since their wedding in Denver\u2019s Cheeseman Park, they\u2019ve been on a bicycle tour in Colorado \u2014 six times with Ride the Rockies. Johnson served in the town\u2019s clinic briefly while in medical school at the University of Colorado Boulder, and his wife sent her children to summer camp here. It was their first time in town together.\n\n\u201cHe is the much stronger biker,\u201d Tribbett said. \u201cHe usually stays with me, or almost always, really. And sometimes I feel guilty, because he could do it way faster. And once in a while, I sag, but not for long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of training, and I have plenty of time to ride by myself,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more fun to ride with someone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a beer for our anniversary.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: The best photos from Ride the Rockies\n\nWestcliffe, and its neighboring town, Silver Cliff, resting at the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range, came alive as first-time hosts on Ride the Rockies, welcoming nearly 2,000 cyclists finishing the 30th edition of the tour.\n\nThe oldest rider was 90 years old, the youngest just seven. Riders came from all 50 states and 11 countries. In all, they traversed 464 miles and ascended more than 31,000 feet over seven days, starting in Grand Junction and ending here.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no corners were cut here,\u201d Chandler Smith, the tour director, said at the closing ceremonies. \u201cFrom the hay bale bicycle on the outskirts of town, to the decorated bicycles that lined the course as we came in, to the horse-drawn buggies delivering cowbells, to the chalk art greeting cyclists as they approached the finish line, to all the cheering fans, to all the incredible offerings of entertainment and food.\n\n\u201cWestcliffe and Custer County, you all promised one of the greatest finishes, and you all delivered. \u2026 You have most definitely set the bar a lot higher.\u201d\n\nThey came to the edge of town \u2014 downhill, to their relief \u2014 in waves and trickles. A cyclist here, a group of two or three, a dozen. Some of their faces betrayed comfort and joy, some exhaustion. Others shot their fists skyward, yelling in celebration or slapped hands with people cheering along the sidewalk. Residents and business owners lined the streets under a sweltering sun, exuberantly ringing cowbells, waving their hands, cheering and clapping. The atmosphere was like the finish to a stage of a professional cycling race.\n\n\u201cOur community came together,\u201d said Donna Hunt, the president of the Custer County Chamber of Commerce. Businesses and sponsors raised $30,000 to put on the final party, one that they did not apply for. Tour organizers approached them eight months ago about being the route\u2019s finish.\n\nThe prudent riders started early as the sun rose over Ca\u00f1on City, the day\u2019s starting city. Any expectation that tour organizers would take it easy on riders in their seventh and final day were mistaken. After a downhill out of Ca\u00f1on City, through Brookside and into Florence, cyclists began a 29-mile climb that started gradually before snaking steeply up Hardscrabble Pass, the incline in the middle unrelenting, before riders were shot straight down into Westcliffe.\n\nThe reward at the top of Hardscrabble was a dramatic unveiling of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, its 13,000 and 14,000-foot peaks stretching across the horizon, still showing patches of snow, with lush green at the base set to an azure-colored sky.\n\nThe tour began on Sunday in Grand Junction, the same city where this ride 30 years earlier in 1986 had started before it ended in Denver. In all since that first ride, the tour has climbed 12,685 miles, visited 46 towns in Colorado and climbed more than 27 mountain passes. After Grand Junction, riders cycled through Colorado National Monument, Hotchkiss, Gunnison, Crested Butte, Salida and Ca\u00f1on City before ending here.\n\n\u201cI leave my office for a week,\u201d Johnson said of doing the tour, \u201cand I tell everybody I\u2019m going away to summer camp. That\u2019s what this is for us.\u201d\n\nStaff photographer AAron Ontiveroz contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Canon City,Hardscrabble Pass,Ride the Rockies,Sangre de Christo,Westcliffe", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "Westcliffe, an old railroad town that served as the host city for 2015's Ride the Rockies finale, welcomed thousands of cyclists finishing the tour.", "title": "In Westcliffe, a small town welcomes Ride the Rockies finale", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2015/06/20/westcliffe-colorado-ride-the-rockies-2015-day-7/3232/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2015/06/ride-the-rockies-day-7-2015-web-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Westcliffe, an old railroad town that served as the host city for 2015's Ride the Rockies finale, welcomed thousands of cyclists finishing the tour.", "title": "Westcliffe welcomes the Ride the Rockies finale with pomp and fanfare", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2015/06/20/westcliffe-colorado-ride-the-rockies-2015-day-7/3232/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2015/06/ride-the-rockies-day-7-2015-web-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@danielpetty", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Westcliffe, an old railroad town that served as the host city for 2015's Ride the Rockies finale, welcomed thousands of cyclists finishing the tour."}, "article_summary": "Every year since their wedding in Denver\u2019s Cheeseman Park, they\u2019ve been on a bicycle tour in Colorado \u2014 six times with Ride the Rockies.\nAfter Grand Junction, riders cycled through Colorado National Monument, Hotchkiss, Gunnison, Crested Butte, Salida and Ca\u00f1on City before ending here.\nThe prudent riders started early as the sun rose over Ca\u00f1on City, the day\u2019s starting city.\nRiders came from all 50 states and 11 countries.\nIn all since that first ride, the tour has climbed 12,685 miles, visited 46 towns in Colorado and climbed more than 27 mountain passes."}
