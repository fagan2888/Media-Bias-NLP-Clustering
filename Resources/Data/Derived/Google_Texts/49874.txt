An inmate walked away from his work assignment just before noon Friday near Boulder Highway and Flamingo Road but was captured by late afternoon, according to the Nevada Department of Corrections.

Inmate Casey Davis, 22, was incarcerated Sept. 5 and assigned to Three Lakes Valley Conservation Camp in Indian Springs for 12 to 30 months. He was on a work assignment for the Nevada Division of Forestry when he walked off.

Members of the Nevada Department of Corrections Inspector Generalâ€™s office captured Davis about 4:30 p.m. Davis was transported to High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs.

According to Clark County court records, he pleaded guilty to one count of attempted grand larceny in June 2012. Davis remained on probation after a violation in May, but his probation was revoked after another violation on July 30.

Davis has no prior felonies and was expected to be released in August 2014.

Three Lakes Valley Conservation Camp holds 192 inmates who work with the Division of Forestry on projects such as litter removal, landscaping and fighting wildfires. It houses minimum-security and work release offenders.
