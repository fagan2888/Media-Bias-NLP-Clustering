As it appeared that Ohio Gov. John Kasich would earn a second place finish in the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday night, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's campaign dismissed Kasich's chances going forward.

"Kasich ran a one-state campaign," Bush spokesman Tim Miller told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, according to The Hill. â€œHe does not have a viable path to the nomination at all, and he certainly does not have a viable path to success in South Carolina, a state where support of the military is critical."
