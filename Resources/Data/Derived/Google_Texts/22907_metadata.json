Their new tactic is to take the direst predictions of the law\u2019s critics, show how those didn\u2019t come true, and, voila, declare that everything is just peachy.\n\nBut on the real world test of what the law is actually doing to the wallets of exchange customers, a very different picture emerges, I point out in The Week. I note:\n\nEvery year, companies selling coverage through ObamaCare's exchanges have to ask state regulators to approve their premiums for the following year \u2014 a practice more appropriate for the Soviet Union than an allegedly free-market economy. And this year, according to several news reports, some are requesting increases of over 50 percent\u2026 What's more, these hikes are likely just a prelude to far bigger ones in future years. Why? Because two programs \u2014 risk corridor and reinsurance \u2014 that were meant to \"stabilize\" rates in ObamaCare's first few years so that insurers could obtain the right mix of enrollees are set to expire next year... So, to recap: ObamaCare has fallen short of its enrollment target, hiked insurance premiums, failed to cut down on ER visits, and flopped in its attempt to improve hospitals' bottom line.\n\nOther than that it\u2019s working great.\n\nGo here to read the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Liberals would like you to believe it is, rising coverage costs tell a different story", "title": "Is Obamacare's Medical Socialism Working?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/08/is-obamacares-medical-socialism-working", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14337773434377.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14337773434377.jpg", "description": "Liberals would like you to believe it is, rising coverage costs tell a different story", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is Obamacare's Medical Socialism Working?"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Economics", "published_time": "2015-06-08T15:37:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/shikha-dalmia"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9652\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019ve been touting the tremendous success of the law ever since healthcare.gov stopped crashing anytime four people logged on simultaneously.\nBut on the real world test of what the law is actually doing to the wallets of exchange customers, a very different picture emerges, I point out in The Week.\nOther than that it\u2019s working great.\nTheir new tactic is to take the direst predictions of the law\u2019s critics, show how those didn\u2019t come true, and, voila, declare that everything is just peachy.\nBecause two programs \u2014 risk corridor and reinsurance \u2014 that were meant to \"stabilize\" rates in ObamaCare's first few years so that insurers could obtain the right mix of enrollees are set to expire next year..."}
