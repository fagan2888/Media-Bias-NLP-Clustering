Weston J. Tanner, a freshman at Seaman High School, received his Eagle Scout award in a Court of Honor ceremony Oct. 27 at the Sunrise Optimist Club in Topeka.

A member of Boy Scout Troop 193 chartered at Topeka’s Pleasant Hill United Methodist Church, Tanner earned 33 merit badges during his Scouting career.

Among them were carpentry and pathfinding, two historic merit badges made available only during 2010 Boy Scout Centennial year celebration.

In addition to numerous leadership duties within his troop, Tanner completed BSA National Youth Leadership training this past spring.

He also attended the 2013 National Scout Jamboree at Bechtel Scout Reserve in West Virginia last summer.

For his Eagle service project, Tanner built two shade structures over the team benches at the Sunrise Optimist Club’s T-Ball field — an idea he got while helping coach a youth team.

A member of the National Junior Honor Society, Tanner also is active in sports (football, bowling and track), as well as student government at Seaman.

He is the son of Rick Tanner and Kathy Gross-Tanner, of Topeka.
