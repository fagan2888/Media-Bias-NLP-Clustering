The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, also ranked No.1 in U.S. News and World Report\u2019s rankings, has an even higher percentage of female students coming in (42%).\n\nThe Wharton School has admitted 40% or more female students for the last five years.\n\nFor Stanford University, the business school that tied with Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania to rank No. 1 in U.S. News and World Report\u2019s rankings, 36% of the class of 2015 is female, an increase from last year.\n\nThe average percentage of female business school students in the country is 37%, according to The Women\u2019s Leadership Gap by the Center for American Progress. The report states that though women make up 52% if the professional workforce, they are underrepresented in leadership positions.\n\nOnly 14.6% of executives, 8.1% of a company\u2019s highest earners and 4.6% of CEOs from Fortune 500 companies are women, according to the report. Less than 17% of board members for Fortune 500 companies are women.\n\nThere has been some progress with increasing the number of women in leadership roles since 1980. Back then there weren\u2019t any female executives in Fortune 100 companies. In 2001, 11% of Fortune 100 executives were women.\n\nAccording to the report, the number of female CEOs was six times higher in 2009 than it was in 1997. Though the numbers improved, the last decade has stayed pretty stagnant with female management and executive board growth.\n\nGet Free Updates!
