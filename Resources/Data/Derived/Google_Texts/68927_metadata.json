Here are five things to watch in the government\u2019s employment report due Friday morning.\n\nThe top line\n\nThe U.S. has added an average of 212,000 jobs through the first eight months of 2015, a healthy number even though the pace of hiring has slowed from 2014. Last year, the economy generated an average of 260,000 jobs a month, the strongest gain since 1999, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEconomists expect another increase of 200,000 or more in September, based on the record number of job openings. The unemployment rate is likely to remain unchanged at a seven-year low of 5.1%.\n\nAugust redux\n\nThe final employment report of the summer appeared to show a surprising slowdown in hiring in August. However, the initially reported 173,000 gain \u2014 down from 245,000 in both July and June \u2014 is expected to be revised higher.\n\nHow come? The preliminary report has undercounted the number of new jobs created in August by an average of 60,000 in recent years. Many businesspeople who take part in the government survey go on vacation, and they are slow to return their answers. That\u2019s especially true of smaller businesses.\n\nWilliam Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Business, said small businesses are hiring more people that the government\u2019s official report suggests.\n\n\u201cWe should expect a major upward revision in August\u2019s BLS number because there was no evidence in NFIB\u2019s data that job creation slacked off sharply from June and July,\u201d he said.\n\nFull employment\n\nThe shrinking unemployment rate, on the cusp of falling below 5%, has spawned plenty of hand-wringing among economists and Federal Reserve bigwigs. They worry the labor market is reaching what\u2019s known as \u201cfull employment,\u201d when the labor market gets so tight that wages surge and higher inflation breaks out.\n\nYet the labor market may not be as tight as the 5.1% unemployment rate implies. An alternative rate known as the U6 puts unemployment at 10.3%. The rate including all the people who say they want a full-time job but can\u2019t find one, a number that still tops 16 million. That\u2019s an unusually high level after more than six years of economic expansion.\n\nWith so many people still out of work, companies might be able to keep a lid on wages for a while longer. The U6 rate tends to hover around 8% when times really good.\n\nWorker pay\n\nSeveral measures of how much workers earn are rising more rapidly. But that hasn\u2019t been the case for average hourly wages. They\u2019ve been climbing at a 2.2% annual pace through most the recovery, well below the 3% to 4% gains typical at the height of economic boom.\n\nRobin Anderson, senior economist at Principal Global Investors, said her firm\u2019s research indicates wages are rising more rapidly than hourly pay indicates. Soon she expects hourly wages to show similarly strong gains.\n\n\u201cAs the U.S. economy continues to improve, we expect wages to begin to accelerate more sharply,\u201d she said.\n\nSkeptics counter that the large pool of underemployed and the difficulty employees face in finding qualified workers are likely to dampen wage growth for some time to come. Companies are being incredibly selective, they say, and doing whatever they can to hold the line on wages.\n\nWho\u2019s up, who\u2019s down\n\nTalk about two industries headed in different directions: manufacturers and home builders.\n\nManufacturers have barely increased employment in 2015 owing to fierce headwinds: A strong dollar, weak global growth and spending cutback by energy producers. And many are cutting jobs.\n\nBuilders, on the other hand, have ramped up construction amid a strong uptick in home sales. The employment report hasn\u2019t shown sizable job gains over the summer, partly because many firms say they can\u2019t find enough carpenters, bricklayers and so forth. But hiring will have to rise if builders are to keep up with demand.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "With job openings at an all-time high and layoffs at the lowest level since Richard Nixon was president, the U.S.economy is expected to create another 200,000 new jobs in September.", "creator": "@jbartash", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DV577_PAYEMS_ZG_20151001144517.png", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jeffry Bartash", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "With job openings at an all-time high and layoffs at the lowest level since Richard Nixon was president, the U.S.economy is expected to create another 200,000 new jobs in September.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-watch-in-the-september-jobs-report-2015-10-01", "author": "Jeffry Bartash", "parsely-title": "Here\u2019s what to watch in the September jobs report", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-01T14:57:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "With job openings at an all-time high and layoffs at the lowest level since Richard Nixon was president, the U.S.economy is expected to create another 200,000 new jobs in September.", "title": "Here\u2019s what to watch in the September jobs report", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-watch-in-the-september-jobs-report-2015-10-01", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DV577_PAYEMS_ZG_20151001144517.png", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DV577_PAYEMS_ZG_20151001144517.png"}, "article.id": "453F230E-6850-11E5-8442-44666E2B49DD", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Here are five things to watch in the government\u2019s employment report due Friday morning.\nAugust reduxThe final employment report of the summer appeared to show a surprising slowdown in hiring in August.\nThe preliminary report has undercounted the number of new jobs created in August by an average of 60,000 in recent years.\nThe employment report hasn\u2019t shown sizable job gains over the summer, partly because many firms say they can\u2019t find enough carpenters, bricklayers and so forth.\nThe unemployment rate is likely to remain unchanged at a seven-year low of 5.1%."}
