The teenage GG Johnston, from all outward appearances, seemed to have “everything going for me.” Inside, though, she carried “a ton of pain.”

Her emotional distress was so severe that it led to a suicide attempt at age 16; fortunately, the mental health counseling she received during a subsequent four-month hospital stay enabled her to conquer her demons.

Today, she’s an in-demand executive coach and respected community leader whose volunteer work includes chairing Denver Health Foundation’s Level One Society. Its current focus is building and expanding mental health resources for children and teens at Denver Health Medical Center.

Johnston was honored Aug. 25 when the Carson J Spencer Foundation had its ninth Shining Lights of Hope Gala at the Grand Hyatt Denver. She was nominated by her friend, Carson J Spencer Foundation board member Christy Belz, who also chaired the gala with her husband, Ferd.

“The award is given to a person who has experienced a suicide or mental health crisis and has turned that loss or struggle into positive energy to help promote mental health and prevent suicide,” Christy Belz noted. “GG Johnston is a true inspiration.”

Other awards went to engineer Chas Klisis, Volunteer of the Year; Gourmet Fine Catering (Corporate Shooting Star); and The Denver Post, Media All-Star Award. In addition, Columbine and Monarch high schools were recognized for their contributions to the foundation’s FIRE Within program.
