Flow batteries – more akin to fuel cells, really – are getting increasing attention as researchers press to meet a need for energy storage brought on by the rise of intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind. Now Harvard scientists, backed by the Obama administration’s ARPA-E program, have written up an advance that they say addresses the key matter of flow battery expense, thanks in part to rhubarb.

Yes, rhubarb.

It all comes down to something called “quinones,” described as “naturally abundant, inexpensive, small organic (carbon-based) molecules.” The Harvard team says it designed, built and tested a laboratory flow battery using quinones as an alternative to flow-battery favorite vanadium, the active metal component dissolved in the rechargeable soup of electrolytes that are stored in external tanks, then pumped into a cell to react electrochemically across a membrane to produce current.

So where might these quinones come from? According to the Harvard release:

Quinones are abundant in crude oil as well as in green plants. The molecule the Harvard team used in its first quinone-based flow battery is almost identical to one found in rhubarb. The quinones are dissolved in water, which prevents them from catching fire.

A metal-free battery, the Harvard team says, could make flow batteries a whole lot less expensive than they are today, allowing the world to take advantage of their great attribute: the ease with which they energy storage can be scaled simply by varying the size of the tanks holding the fluids. Not possible with solid-electrode batteries, explains Harvard:
