The U.S. remains the only industrialized nation that does not supply universal health care to its citizens. Obamacare is clearly the foot-in-the-door to a Canadian system and the Republicans have been fighting tooth and nail to discredit it.\n\nTheir champion is Pipes, an unabashed ultraconservative who believes if you can\u2019t fend for yourself, well tough luck.\n\nShe opposes any form of public health care, even for the poor and the elderly.\n\n\u201cI believe in small government, freedom and individual responsibility,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nA native of Vancouver and former member of the Fraser Institute, she is now the president and CEO of a small San Francisco think-tank called the Pacific Research Institute (PRI).\n\nA newly-minted American citizen, Pipes demonizes Obamacare in speeches, books, in congressional testimony, and in her weekly \u201cPipes Up\u201d column on Forbes.com.\n\nAside from Obamacare itself, her favourite target is Canada. She promotes herself \u2014 and is often referred to in the U.S. media \u2014 as \u201ca fugitive from Canadian health care.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s single-payer health-care system, Pipes said in an interview, \u201cwas a big part of the decision in my leaving the country in 1991.\u201d\n\nIn public appearances, she rarely fails to recount the story of how her aging mother died prematurely in 2005 of colon cancer while on a British Columbia waiting list for an MRI.\n\nShe blames public health care and proffers her anecdote as proof that Canadians are dying because waiting lists deny them access to timely care.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding health care is similar to unravelling an onion,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are just so many layers and many tearful moments. I think if you can tell stories that relate to people\u2019s own situations I think it helps them understand it.\u201d\n\nPipes is well paid for her advocacy. In the last five years alone, PRI paid her a total $2.3 million US, according to PRI tax returns.\n\nPRI\u2019s $7-million annual budget is financed by donors that include major health-care companies and the ultraconservative billionaire Koch brothers who have become as dominant a brand name for conservative political financing as McDonald\u2019s is for fast food franchising.\n\nPipes\u2019 academic and health-care credentials are thin. Her only degree is a BA in economics.\n\nWhat counts, she said, is \u201cwhat you do and how you do your work; is it peer reviewed and is it reliable?\u201d\n\nPipes, however, appears to fail on both counts.\n\nWhen asked who reviews her work, she said \u201cwe have academic reviewers at PRI. We have an editorial board.\u201d\n\nReliability has also been questioned.\n\nEven fellow Forbes.com blogger Rick Ungar accused her of publishing \u201cmisleading Obamacare attacks.\u201d Ungar criticized her claim in 2011 that a Deloitte survey showed that an overwhelming majority of front-line doctors opposed Obamacare. With the exception of surgeons, the report indicated just the opposite.\n\nDuring our interview she also proved fast and loose with the truth. She claimed \u201c50 per cent of health care is already in government hands.\u201d The U.S. Census Bureau put the most recent figure at 32.6 per cent.\n\nShe also claimed 5.7 million Americans have lost their health insurance because of Obamacare. What she doesn\u2019t say is that overwhelming majority of the cancelled policies were replaced by cheaper, better plans that meet Obamacare\u2019s higher standards.\n\nPipes\u2019 misstatements often mirror those made by Republican lawmakers and conservative-sponsored advertising campaigns.\n\nOne recent TV ad featured a Michigan woman claiming she suffered from leukemia and had lost her health insurance, her doctor and could no longer afford her medicines because of Obamacare. \u201cIf I do not receive my medicine I will die,\u201d she says. What she doesn\u2019t mention is that she switched to a more comprehensive plan under Obamacare that saves her $1,200 a year \u2014 and she still has her doctor. Other ads have featured actors pretending to be real Americans whose insurance had been cancelled under Obamacare.\n\n[see video: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/17/truth-teller-julie-boonstras-obamacare-ad/]\n\nMother Jones and other publications have questioned whether Pipes writes her own material.\n\nPRI\u2019s biggest subcontractor is Keybridge Communications, a Washington, D.C. firm that, in its own words, creates \u201ctop-notch journalism producers \u2026 writing, researching, and creating effective news hooks.\u201d\n\nThe company has said it researches, drafts and edits Pipes\u2019 work, which is unusual for an academic think-tank. According to tax filings, PRI paid Keybridge from 2008 to 2012 almost $1.5 million.\n\nPipes said PRI has a small staff of seven and \u201cmost of the work that we do is contracted out.\u201d\n\nShe added, however, that she uses Keybridge only for the occasional editing job. \u201cSometimes I will pay them just to review something I have written, to edit it, but not all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are all my ideas. I never falter from my views.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the ideological divide is Dr. Danielle Martin, a family doctor and vice-president of medical affairs and health system solutions at Women\u2019s College Hospital in Toronto. Her father, D\u2019Arcy Martin, is a union organizer and educator.\n\nShe too has her tearful anecdote, although she rarely unleashes it to support her arguments. Before Canada enacted its universal health-care system, her grandfather had a heart attack and the hospital bills bankrupted the family.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t build a health-care system based on stories,\u201d she said.\n\nPipes and Martin last month went head-to-head while testifying before a U.S. Senate subcommittee studying what the U.S. health-care system can learn from other countries.\n\n[See video: http://www.c-span.org/video/?318225-1/hearing-health-care-access-costs%5D\n\nFive other medical experts were on the panel. Two came from Asia and Europe. But the senators\u2019 focus was squarely on Canada.\n\nWhile Pipes talked about her mother \u2014 recounting the story twice \u2014 along with other stories of doctors she knows had quit the Canadian system in apparent disgust, Martin smoothly deflected a barrage of questions from Republicans eager to breach her calm, Canadian confidence and discredit the Canadian system.\n\n\u201cWhy are doctors exiting the public system in Canada?\u201d Republican Senator Richard Burr inquired.\n\n\u201cWe see a net influx of physicians from the United States into the Canadian system over the last number of years,\u201d she replied.\n\nBurr quickly jumped to his next question. \u201cWhat do you say to an elected official who goes to Florida and not the Canadian system to have a heart valve replacement?\u201d he continued, referring to former Newfoundland premier Danny Williams\u2019 heart surgery in 2010.\n\nMartin: \u201cThe pioneers of that particular surgery, which Premier Williams had, \u2026 are in Toronto \u2026 Sometimes people have a perception \u2026 that going to where you pay more for something, that that necessarily makes it better, but it\u2019s not actually borne out by the evidence.\u201d\n\nUnlike Pipes, Martin has a string of peer-reviewed papers to her name and is an expert in both primary care and hospital administration.\n\nAt the end of the hearings, the two adversaries shook hands. Pipes said of Martin, \u201cI thought she was very professional even if we don\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\nMartin blames Pipes for leading a dishonest attack on the Canadian system. \u201cIf the best they can come up with is somebody who brings forward a couple of anecdotal stories and self-publishes her opinions as facts then those of us who are actually interested in preserving and enhancing and improving the public system don\u2019t have anything to worry about,\u201d she said.\n\nwmarsden@postmedia.com", "article_metadata": {"DC.rights": "2014.
