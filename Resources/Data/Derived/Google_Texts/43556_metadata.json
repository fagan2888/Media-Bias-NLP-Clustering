Smith\n\nLast month, hospital readmissions penalties under the Affordable Care Act were extended to include patients readmitted within 30 days of treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or total hip or knee replacement.\n\nThis is in addition to penalties put into place in 2013 for patients readmitted within 30 days for heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia.\n\nThe penalties, which are aimed at financially punishing poor-quality care, are hitting hospitals hard. Nationally, hospital penalties for preventable readmissions are predicted to hit $756 million in 2014, up from the estimated $227 million in 2013.\n\nThese penalties are expected to have a trickle down effect in many other health care industries, including ambulance services and EMS.\n\nAn opportunity for EMS\n\nAlthough paramedics and EMS professionals are not the primary drivers of high-cost, low-quality health care, EMS experts, including Glenn Leland, chief strategy officer at Pro-Transport-1, predict that health care reform could be a tremendous opportunity to reconfigure the role of EMS within an integrated health care system.\n\n\u201cIf you step back and look at what\u2019s going on with health care reform \u2026 much of the focus is on hospitals,\u201d Leland said. \u201cHospitals are going through the majority of the change to improve the efficiency of our health care delivery system.\n\n\u201cIn fact, EMS is attempting to solve some of the economic efficiency of the Medicare program and readmissions. I see the economic pressure on hospitals as a key, driving pain point for EMS in the future.\u201d\n\nSteve Wirth, one of the nation\u2019s leading EMS attorneys, points to mobile integrated health care as a model for keeping patients out of the hospital and lowering hospital readmissions. These models can also offer greater continuity of care and provide patients with easily accessible primary care services and follow-up care.\n\nData shows home health care can lead to better patient outcomes. One study from North Shore University Hospital in New York found that among more than post-heart surgery 400 patients, those that did not receive home health care post-surgery were three times more likely to die or be readmitted to the hospital.\n\nHeart surgery patients who received home health care after surgery from a nurse practitioner were significantly less likely to end up back in the hospital within the first month post-discharge.\n\nThis kind of positive outcomes data is feeding a growing interest and investment in these new models of care. Mobile integrated health care with EMS and/or nursing professionals can offer greater continuity of care, more hands-on help, and cut down on the need for the most expensive form of care: in-patient hospital care.\n\nAnother growing trend is the rise of consumerism in health care. Industry experts argue that EMS and the ambulance service industry must meet and exceed consumer demands to thrive in the new health care environment.\n\nConsumers in the ambulance service industry include:\n\nPatients\n\nHealth care providers\n\nHospitals\n\nHealth care organizations, such as skilled-nursing and assisted-living facilities\n\nConsumers today expect:\n\nConvenience and an easy user experience\n\nProven value for a service, especially a paid service\n\nPersonal connection\n\nAccessibility of services, anywhere, anytime\n\nTo fully understand and meet consumer demand, the ambulance service industry has to recognize how consumer needs are shifting due to:\n\nAn aging population\n\nAn epidemic of chronic illness including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes\n\nA shortage of primary care providers and clinics\n\n\u201cWe need to recognize that we\u2019re health care providers, not emergency providers anymore,\u201d said Jerry Overton, chair of the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch. \u201cWe have to redesign our systems around who is really calling for help and what kind of help they need. I think that\u2019s the real challenge.\u201d\n\nWhy EMS should shift to non-acute care\n\nIncreasingly, the ambulance service industry is being asked by patients and industry organizations to provide basic health care. This a fundamental shift for a profession that was created to offer life-saving, acute, on-scene care and transport.\n\nFor EMS providers that are willing to embrace and meet changing consumer demands, it is an enormous opportunity. EMS can offer extraordinary added value within an integrated health care system by using innovative non-acute care models to offer these four services.\n\nProvide greater continuity of care between health care facilities and the patient\u2019s home.\n\nOffer post-discharge follow-up visits to help patients transition to their homes, maintain their care plan, and avoid hospital readmission.\n\nRefer patients, when appropriate, to urgent care or primary care facilities.\n\nHelp patients better navigate the health care system, especially those with chronic co-morbidities or complicated medical conditions.\n\nSome forward-thinking ambulance agencies \u2014 including REMSA in Reno, Nevada, MedStar in Ft. Worth, Texas, American Medical Response nationally, MetroAtlanta in Atlanta, Acadian Ambulance in the southern region, WakeMed in North Carolina \u2014 are embracing the challenge of meeting these demands.\n\nThese organizations have created innovative ways to offer non-acute care with EMS teams and health care professionals, including nursing hotlines, community paramedics, homecare follow-up visit programs, and other cutting-edge care models.[1] [2] [3]\n\nTo read more about the health care reform, health care consumerism, and the future of EMS and the ambulance service industry, download the complete whitepaper, \u201cThe Future of the Ambulance Service Industry: Value-Focused, Consumer-Driven & Mobile-Savvy,\u201d which includes \u201c8 Ways Better Technology Platforms Can Improve Ambulance Services.\u201d\n\nReferences\n\n1.
