BEST stands for Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology.\n\nTwenty-six teams from middle schools and high schools took part in the competition, in which they attempt to make their robots perform tasks such as moving plastic clothes hangers.\n\nThe event, hosted by Metropolitan State University of Denver, gives students hands-on experience in engineering and scientific methodology.\n\n\u201cThis helps students bring classroom learning to real-world applications,\u201d said Kathy Geise, president of Rocky Mountain BEST, one of several chapters of the nationwide nonprofit. \u201cStudents are motivated by the competition to apply the classroom skills they learn in engineering, programming and math, and bring it to life with robots.\u201d\n\nFor six weeks, students designed, built and tested their robots.\n\nMetro State professors in aviation and aerospace science, engineering technology, industrial design and marketing donated their time as mentors and judges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of learning involved, from teamwork to team building, and even marketing and presentation skills,\u201d Geise said.\n\nSix teams from Saturday\u2019s competition will advance to a regional competition in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cWe worked together on this twice a week for just a short amount of time,\u201d said Nicholas Redhorse, an eighth-grader at The Manning School in Jefferson County.\n\nThe robots \u2014 each with a student acting as driver \u2014 picked up dowels and put them in buckets, as well as picked up clothes hangers and placed them on hooks.\n\n\u201cThis (competition) has been something to look forward to after working hard on it,\u201d Redhorse said.\n\nThe Manning team, made up of 17 students, led all schools in scoring on Saturday, so Redhorse was optimistic they would make it to regionals.\n\nLamb said her team reached regionals in 2012.\n\n\u201cI really hope we can make it back,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to keep working on our robot and improving it.\u201d\n\nKurtis Lee: 303-954-1655, klee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kurtisalee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "War of robots: Student teams vie for Colorado supremacy", "title": "War of robots: Student teams vie for Colorado supremacy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/26/war-of-robots-student-teams-vie-for-colorado-supremacy/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131026__robots-1p1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131026__robots-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-26T17:34:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T17:05:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Twenty-six teams from middle schools and high schools took part in the competition, in which they attempt to make their robots perform tasks such as moving plastic clothes hangers.\nThe event, hosted by Metropolitan State University of Denver, gives students hands-on experience in engineering and scientific methodology.\nLamb was among more than 300 students from across Colorado who took part in the Rocky Mountain BEST Robotics Competition at the Auraria Campus Event Center on Saturday.\nSix teams from Saturday\u2019s competition will advance to a regional competition in Arkansas.\n\u201cThis (competition) has been something to look forward to after working hard on it,\u201d Redhorse said."}
