Associated Press/Molly Riley\n\nCarlyle Group David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.\n\nSpeaking at the UBS Best of Americas 2014 Conference in London on Thursday, Mr. Rubenstein, Carlyle\u2019s co-chief executive, said a large amount of assets are concentrated among the top players in other asset management businesses, but not in private equity.\n\nCiting data from consulting firm McKinsey & Co., he said the top five managers in the exchange-traded funds business together accounted for 76% of the ETF assets managed globally. The same goes for large-cap domestic equities and U.S. taxable fixed income, where the five largest players commanded a collective 60% and 50% share of their respective markets.\n\n\u201cIf the trends in ETFs and large-cap domestic equity are to happen in this industry as well, firms like Carlyle are likely to get a higher share of the assets under management,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, the five biggest buyout firms manage 9% of funds allocated to private equity, according to the McKinsey data.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small percentage,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cI do think consolidation will occur and the top seven or three or four firms will dramatically increase their assets under management as people are familiar with their brands and will give them money.\u201d\n\nFor Carlyle, the consolidation will probably play out by the firm acquiring peers that will fill in gaps, or \u201cniches,\u201d in its product offerings, rather than through mergers with its competitors, according to Mr. Rubenstein.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t likely to buy people who compete with us as we already have a pretty good business in those areas,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Rubenstein said the Washington, D.C., firm will likely buy firms whose founders are approaching retirement age and aren\u2019t going to scale up their firms or bring them to the public market.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.", "title": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: Expect Consolidation in PE Industry", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/09/12/carlyles-rubenstein-expect-consolidation-in-pe-industry/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN268_RUBENS_P_20140912165051.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: Expect Consolidation in PE Industry", "description": "Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-12T21:20:42-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/09/12/carlyles-rubenstein-expect-consolidation-in-pe-industry/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17332", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.", "title": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: Expect Consolidation in PE Industry", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/09/12/carlyles-rubenstein-expect-consolidation-in-pe-industry/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN268_RUBENS_P_20140912165051.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17332", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-12T21:38:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc878\"", "article_summary": "Associated Press/Molly RileyCarlyle Group David Rubenstein predicts the private equity industry may soon go through a consolidation phase that could strengthen the largest players in the field.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small percentage,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said.\nCurrently, the five biggest buyout firms manage 9% of funds allocated to private equity, according to the McKinsey data.\nMr. Rubenstein said the Washington, D.C., firm will likely buy firms whose founders are approaching retirement age and aren\u2019t going to scale up their firms or bring them to the public market.\nCarlyle Group\u2019s David Rubenstein at the National Archives in Washington, in December 2013."}
