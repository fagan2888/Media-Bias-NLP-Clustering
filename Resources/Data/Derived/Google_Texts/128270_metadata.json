The pathway she found was rap\u2014and not just any rap, but as Brittany Cooper explains, Southern, ATL-style hip-hop. While black female rappers are marginalized or ignored, Azalea\u2019s image has proved to be lucrative, and that has nothing to do with her talent. As numerous critics have observed, including Chris Molanphy at Slate and Molly Lambert at Grantland, Azalea is a mediocre artist using the toehold of her novelty for success. (This is what her voice actually sounds like, by the way; even her off-air persona is a carefully pruned minstrel show.)\n\nIggy Azalea\u2019s persona would be less frustrating if she seemed even slightly aware of it. The relationship white musicians have with black musicians is in and of itself a significant subgenre of American race relations; musical cultural appropriation is rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, after all. Within the genres of rap and hip-hop\u2014musical forms where black musicians finally got some credit for their creation\u2014it\u2019s even more important for white musicians to justify their existence. Eminem is a dick to everyone, but especially following \u201c8 Mile,\u201d it\u2019s hard to think of him as anything but a champion for the lives of the disenfranchised working-class Detroiters he grew up with. Macklemore\u2019s stance on inclusiveness has more to do with him, most of the time, than it does for the marginalized groups he\u2019s advocating for\u2014his eagerness to be seen as progressive speaks of ego more than altruism. On the other hand, though, at least he has a stance\u2014and when he marched for Mike Brown in Seattle, he did his best to blend in. Even up-and-comers like the charmingly named Machine Gun Kelly have a finger on the pulse of the conversation; that rapper played the part of a white, racist asshole in \u201cBeyond the Lights,\u201d demonstrating a willingness to confront his own complicity in the problems with hip-hop.\n\nWednesday night, one of the female black rappers Azalea feuds with, Azealia Banks, called out \u201cIgloo Australia\u201d for not speaking out on the Eric Garner case, as she herself was doing. Banks\u2019 twitter is all kinds of profanity and calling-out, and there are dozens upon dozens of artists, black and white, who didn\u2019t bother making a statement about New York\u2019s decision to not indict the cop that killed Garner. Azalea\u2019s silence wasn\u2019t necessarily remarkable, just in-character. But her responses to Banks\u2019 shade were uncomfortably clueless: The first noted that \u201call hell broke loose\u201d while she was offline; the second urged an unnamed person to \u201cfind a new game plan.\u201d Tellingly, the second could literally be directed at anyone, about anything\u2014Banks, for calling her out on Twitter, continuing the feud; the police, for getting in hot water again over another unexplained black death; the protestors, even, for taking to the streets with the same cry for justice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The root of Iggy Azalea's cultural appropriation isn't simple racism; it's total self-absorption", "title": "Iggy Azalea\u2019s strange year: What her latest Twitter feud reveals about the character she\u2019s created", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The root of Iggy Azalea's cultural appropriation isn't simple racism; it's total self-absorption", "title": "Iggy Azalea\u2019s strange year: What her latest Twitter feud reveals about the character she\u2019s created", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/iggy_azaleas_strange_year_what_her_latest_twitter_feud_reveals_about_the_character_shes_created/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/iggy_azalea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The root of Iggy Azalea's cultural appropriation isn't simple racism; it's total self-absorption", "title": "Iggy Azalea\u2019s strange year: What her latest Twitter feud reveals about the character she\u2019s created", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/iggy_azalea.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, azealia banks, Editor's Picks, eric garner, Ferguson, iggy azalea, Mike Brown", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9395\"", "article_summary": "The relationship white musicians have with black musicians is in and of itself a significant subgenre of American race relations; musical cultural appropriation is rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, after all.\nWithin the genres of rap and hip-hop\u2014musical forms where black musicians finally got some credit for their creation\u2014it\u2019s even more important for white musicians to justify their existence.\nWhile black female rappers are marginalized or ignored, Azalea\u2019s image has proved to be lucrative, and that has nothing to do with her talent.\nIggy Azalea\u2019s persona would be less frustrating if she seemed even slightly aware of it.\nWednesday night, one of the female black rappers Azalea feuds with, Azealia Banks, called out \u201cIgloo Australia\u201d for not speaking out on the Eric Garner case, as she herself was doing."}
