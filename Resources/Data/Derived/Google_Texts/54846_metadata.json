The ad agency previously developed a \u201cguerrilla marketing campaign\u201d at bars for free HIV treatment in Michigan and created a Facebook page for honey-baked ham.\n\nThe purpose of the contract is \u201cfor the publication of the Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP) journal,\u201d which will \u201ccommunicate recent scientific findings and trends in the environmental health sciences\u201d and \u201cinform the public about important topics in environmental health.\u201d\n\nA \u201cmajor objective\u201d listed is to make the journal \u201caccessible to people with disabilities\u201d and to \u201cincrease readership.\u201d\n\nThe online publication includes an archive of the print version of EHP, a monthly journal issued by the NIH since 1972. The print version was eliminated in January 2012, shifting all of the journal\u2019s content online. Archives are also available in Chinese, Spanish, and French.\n\nNIH issued a request for information in April 2012 on how to \u201cenhance EHP\u2019s current online presence.\u201d\n\nNIH wanted prospective contractors to \u201cprovide information as to how your agency/organization can reduce wasteful spending and use more efficient methods of production.\u201d\n\nEHP now runs as a WordPress site, a free web-hosting platform, according to the contract\u2019s Performance Work Statement (PWS).\n\nUnder the new contract, Brogan & Partners will be responsible for publishing the journal 12 times a year, on the first business day of each month. Its responsibilities include monitoring reader responses, developing a mobile phone app, copyediting, proofreading, and increasing readership through marketing.\n\nThe government selects the content for each edition, which includes scientific papers, manuscripts, and editorials. The editor-in-chief and all editorial staff are employees of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).\n\nEHP has recently featured a cover story on \u201curban gardening,\u201d an article on wind turbines, and a paper on \u201cUrinary Metabolites of Organophosphate and Pyrethroid Pesticides and Behavioral Problems in Canadian Children.\u201d\n\nEvery monthly issue consists of about 25 commentaries, reviews, and research articles, one editorial, and four to five letters to the editor.\n\nBrogan & Partners will also be in charge of graphics for the website to \u201cenhance reader understanding and publication attractiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe graphics shall work strategically with the text to present important concepts, illustrate and clarify points made in the text, convey information that would be cumbersome or impossible to describe in words, and/or add visual appeal,\u201d the PWS said.\n\nA spokesperson for Brogan & Partners said they could not comment to the Washington Free Beacon on any information pertaining to their work on EHP and referred all questions to Joe Balintfy, an NIH spokesman.\n\nWhen asked to justify the cost of the contract, Balintfy told the Free Beacon that publishing the journal amounts to over $2 million a year.\n\n\u201cThe EHP contract is for a period of up to five years, so the cost is roughly $2.2 million per year,\u201d said Balintfy, who works in the office of communications and public liaison for the NIEHS. \u201cThe contract is renewed one year at a time, subject to budgetary and other constraints.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupporting the publication of EHP is consistent with the congressionally mandated purpose of NIEHS including the \u2018dissemination of research findings, knowledge, and information on environmental health science,\u2019\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Journal published on WordPress platform costs $2.2 million per year", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has set aside $11 million to continue to publish its \u201cenvironmental health\u201d journal online, according to a government contract released on New Yea", "title": "NIH Spends $11 Million to Publish \u2018Environmental Health Journal\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/nih-spends-11-million-to-publish-environmental-health-journal/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WindTurbine-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has set aside $11 million to continue to publish i", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WindTurbine-150x150.jpg", "title": "NIH Spends $11 Million to Publish \u2018Environmental Health Journal\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) publishes a monthly peer-reviewed journal, Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP), which operates on the WordPress platform, at a cost of $2.2 million a year.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has set aside $11 million to continue to publish its \u201cenvironmental health\u201d journal online, according to a government contract released on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nThe editor-in-chief and all editorial staff are employees of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).\nWhen asked to justify the cost of the contract, Balintfy told the Free Beacon that publishing the journal amounts to over $2 million a year.\nUnder the new contract, Brogan & Partners will be responsible for publishing the journal 12 times a year, on the first business day of each month."}
