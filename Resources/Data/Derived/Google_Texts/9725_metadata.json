She never expected her husband to die that same year. Then she exhausted her savings. And, finally, she got sick. Very sick.\n\n\u201cThe day I went to Parkland, I was so embarrassed I started crying,\u201d said Morrison, now 63. \u201cI was laying on their counter and I could not breathe.\u201d\n\nFrom that low point five years ago, the Garland woman is back on her feet. Her condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was stabilized by Parkland Memorial Hospital staff, which also encouraged her to buy a health insurance policy through the Affordable Care Act. This year\u2019s sign-up ends Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the insurance card in my wallet,\u201d Morrison said with pride.\n\nShe joined the newest group of insured residents of Dallas County: those who qualify to buy private health insurance but who want to stay in the public health system. The attraction is Parkland\u2019s promise to forgive most of the co-payments and deductibles for patients earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nIt works like this: Instead of trying to collect high-deductible payments from its lowest-income patients, the hospital would collect only what the patients\u2019 insurance plans would cover. Without their deductible forgiven, these patients probably wouldn\u2019t buy the insurance.\n\nDr. Fred Cerise, Parkland\u2019s president and CEO, said it made sense to apply the hospital\u2019s charity-care program to insured patients, who could afford the subsidized monthly premium but not the hefty co-payments and deductibles that go with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an insurance program,\u201d he stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s financial assistance for people in certain income categories who buy private insurance.\u201d\n\nHospitals scramble\n\nThe state\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid coverage has left millions of Texans uninsured, causing the public hospitals that serve them to scramble for funding. The new federal law is lowering the supplemental Medicaid payments they previously received each year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find creative ways that will bring in more revenues, and the state and federal government have got to help,\u201d said Ted Shaw, president and CEO of the Texas Hospital Association. He cited a managed-care program set up for uninsured patients in San Antonio as another example of how to control hospital costs.\n\nLast year, Parkland helped almost 1,500 patients move from its charity-care program into private insurance coverage. The hospital subsequently was reimbursed about $20 million from private insurance plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBut those two numbers are not connected,\u201d said Catherine Bradley, a Parkland spokeswoman. \u201cWe have no way of knowing how many of the people we saw with ACA plans were previously uninsured.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s board of managers approved the financial assistance program in December. It goes into effect in March.\n\nSnagging more revenues is important for Dallas County\u2019s lone public hospital, which approved a $1.4 billion budget for this year with a $34 million deficit. County taxpayers are contributing nearly $450 million, an amount hospital administrators would like to reduce.\n\nBut nobody knows whether thousands of Parkland\u2019s low-income patients will sign up this year or be scared away by the high deductibles.\n\n\u201cYou can get people to sign up for an insurance plan, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have a lot of discretionary income,\u201d said Bob Reed, Parkland\u2019s vice president for patient access.\n\nFor example, it costs Morrison $27.44 for her subsidized insurance premium, instead of the typical $544 monthly charge for Molina Healthcare\u2019s silver plan, which she chose. But the plan also came with a $4,000 deductible \u2014 the amount Morrison must pay out of pocket before her insurer pays any medical expenses.\n\n\u201cIt might as well have been a million,\u201d Morrison said with a laugh. She gets only $1,229 a month in disability payments.\n\nCharges slashed\n\nUnder the Parkland Financial Assistance Program, Morrison\u2019s $14,748 annual income falls far below 200 percent of the poverty level, which is $23,540. Instead of being responsible for the $4,000 deductible, she can expect to pay $10 per doctor visit, $3 to $8 for each prescription and up to $100 for an emergency room visit.\n\nIf she chooses to leave Parkland, however, she\u2019s likely to pay the full deductible at another hospital or health care provider before her insurance kicks in.\n\n\u201cI could elect to go to other doctors, but Parkland has been so good to me,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a pain in the neck with all those people there, but my care has been excellent. My pulmonary doctor is just wonderful.\u201d\n\nHow much the Financial Assistance Program will benefit Parkland\u2019s bottom line is not yet clear. Hospital officials estimate that nearly 30,000 of its patients should have bought insurance coverage when the new federal law went into effect last year. Most didn\u2019t.\n\nSo far this year, about 900 Parkland patients have been guided through the insurance enrollment process, using the hospital\u2019s computers and staff assistance. It isn\u2019t known how many completed their enrollment and are paying their monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cThey say they have signed up, but until they bring us the insurance card, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Reed said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The attraction is Parkland\u2019s promise to forgive most of the co-payments and deductibles for patients earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.", "og": {"description": "The attraction is Parkland\u2019s promise to forgive most of the co-payments and deductibles for patients earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.", "title": "Parkland Memorial Hospital to give insured low-income patients a break", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150213-parkland-memorial-hospital-to-give-insured-low-income-patients-a-break.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150213-nm_10obamacare_kl03.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_10ObamaCare_KL03.JPG", "height": 884}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-14T05:37:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-02-14T05:08:11Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Parkland Memorial Hospital to give insured low-income patients a break\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150213-parkland-memorial-hospital-to-give-insured-low-income-patients-a-break.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150213-nm_10obamacare_kl03.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_10ObamaCare_KL03.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2180525\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-14T05:08:11Z\", \"section\": \"General News\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150213-nm_10obamacare_kl03.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_10ObamaCare_KL03.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-02-14T05:08:11Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "It works like this: Instead of trying to collect high-deductible payments from its lowest-income patients, the hospital would collect only what the patients\u2019 insurance plans would cover.\nSo far this year, about 900 Parkland patients have been guided through the insurance enrollment process, using the hospital\u2019s computers and staff assistance.\nLast year, Parkland helped almost 1,500 patients move from its charity-care program into private insurance coverage.\nCharges slashedUnder the Parkland Financial Assistance Program, Morrison\u2019s $14,748 annual income falls far below 200 percent of the poverty level, which is $23,540.\nThe hospital subsequently was reimbursed about $20 million from private insurance plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act."}
