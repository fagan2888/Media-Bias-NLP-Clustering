So what accounts for the difference?\n\nThe key lies in the wording of the question, the pollster said. While previous surveys have asked for a straight yes-or-no response on defunding, the RMU poll used a more detailed question that reflects the recent GOP proposals.\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions,\u201d the RMU question says. \u201cWould you say you support or oppose this plan?\u201d\n\nThe results of the RMU poll, released Dec. 2, came as a near-mirror image of those released Monday by USA Today/Suffolk University, whose survey asked \u201cShould federal funding for Planned Parenthood be eliminated?\u201d The result was 58 percent disagreed and 33 percent agreed.\n\n\u201cNow 14 polls confirm that Americans oppose \u2018defunding\u2019 Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Twitter after the USA Today/Suffolk survey was release. \u201cBut it\u2019s politics as usual in Congress.\u201d\n\nThe conservative Media Research Center accused media outlets of \u201ccensoring\u201d the RMU poll because it deviates from the Planned Parenthood narrative. The RMU survey was conducted before the Nov. 27 shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.\n\nPollster Philip Harold, a professor at the Pittsburgh university, told the MRC that in the past, \u201cresults from the RMU Polling Institute have gotten traction on political topics but not this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the cardinal rules in polling is to clearly indicate the alternative in the question and a poll question that doesn\u2019t do this is flawed,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cBecause the wording of this poll reflects the actual proposal, it is more accurate.\u201d\n\nThe RMU poll also showed a surprisingly high percentage of support for the GOP defunding plan among Democrats. While 47.3 percent of Democrats opposed the Republican proposal, 42.7 percent supported it.\n\n30-30-30", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little-noticed poll is challenging the widely touted narrative that most Americans oppose GOP efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/12/most-americans-favor-gop-plan-defund-planned-paren/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A little-noticed poll is challenging the widely touted narrative that most Americans oppose GOP efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.", "title": "Most Americans favor GOP plan to defund Planned Parenthood, says poll defying narrative"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A little-noticed poll is challenging the widely touted narrative that most Americans oppose GOP efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.", "card": "summary", "title": "Most Americans favor GOP plan to defund Planned Parenthood, says poll"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNow 14 polls confirm that Americans oppose \u2018defunding\u2019 Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Twitter after the USA Today/Suffolk survey was release.\nA little-noticed poll is challenging the widely touted narrative that most Americans oppose GOP efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe RMU survey was conducted before the Nov. 27 shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s politics as usual in Congress.\u201dThe conservative Media Research Center accused media outlets of \u201ccensoring\u201d the RMU poll because it deviates from the Planned Parenthood narrative.\n\u201cCongressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions,\u201d the RMU question says."}
