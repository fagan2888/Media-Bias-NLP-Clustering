All are abandoned. There\u2019s no more prayer service, no more masses on Sundays in Mosul because there\u2019s no clergy, no people there that are Christians.\u201d\n\nSako said ISIS took advantage of \u201cdefenseless\u201d Christians, unjustly driving them out of the region in an effort of \u201creligious cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen [ISIS] writes the letter \u201cn\u201d [meaning Christian in Arabic] to single out [the homes of] Christian families, that means they are evaporating the city of its Christian population. It is mass evaporation. It\u2019s a genocide of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nMany refugees fled to the nearby city Qaraqosh to seek asylum under the Kurdish government, which has promised to protect them by lining the city\u2019s border with soldiers to repel ISIS.\n\nBut even this barrier is proving faulty as ISIS gains control of the city\u2019s water and electricity sources. Sako said this conflict has cut the city off from other villages, making it difficult for families to find income.\n\n\u201cLately we heard that the Kurdish government has stepped up to help them with some financial assistance to each family, but this is a very tough situation for them,\u201d Sako said.\n\nSako noted that Christians must make clear to ISIS that they don\u2019t have intentions to fight or govern, but that they have the right to peacefully live in the land of their \u201cforefathers\u201d as they have for the past 2,000 years.\n\nTo Sako, a permanent solution to sectarian conflicts is to follow the West and adopt a law that separates the government from religion. He said governments that forcibly impose a single religion on an entire population cannot be accepted in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s live together as full right citizens, as brothers and sisters and everyone will follow his or her own religion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Chaldean Patriarch is appealing to the international community for action against ISIS\u2019 expulsion of Christians in Mosul.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Chaldean Patriarch is appealing to the international community for action against ISIS\u2019 expulsion of Christians in Mosul.", "title": "Chaldean Patriarch Looks to West For Help in Iraq", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140725_Patriarch_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/X3BoJC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Chaldean Patriarch is appealing to the international community for action against ISIS\u2019 expulsion of Christians in Mosul.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140725_Patriarch_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "Chaldean Patriarch Looks to West For Help in Iraq", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-07-28T09:35:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Mosul, Iraq, Chaldean Patriarch, Louis Raphael Sako, Christian, Qaraqosh"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfb7\"", "article_summary": "The Chaldean Catholic Patriarch is appealing to the international community for action against ISIS\u2019 expulsion of Christians in Mosul, deeming the situation as \u201c21st century genocide.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mass cleansing based on religion.\u201d Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako said.\nThe patriarch cited his contacts in Mosul who say the area is now devoid of Christian presence following ISIS\u2019 ultimatum earlier this month.\nHe said governments that forcibly impose a single religion on an entire population cannot be accepted in the 21st century.\n\u201cThis is the responsibility of a nation like the United States that cherishes democracy, freedom of religion and freedom of conscious,\u201d Sako said.\nTo Sako, a permanent solution to sectarian conflicts is to follow the West and adopt a law that separates the government from religion."}
