Every Friday, we take a look at three pieces by right-leaning writers that constructively articulate core elements of their worldview. The goal isn\u2019t to find conservatives telling us how right liberals are, but rather to pick out writing that helps liberals understand where their ideological foes are coming from.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started.\n\n1. \u201cLena Dunham & Jill Duggar: Baring It All for Us\u201d \u2014 S.D. Kelly, Christ & Pop Culture\n\nLena Dunham has been in the news this week. Probably the best response to Dunham\u2019s new book and the political kerfluffle surrounding it was penned by S.D. Kelly in Christ and Pop Culture. Conservatives have criticized Dunham for not knowing when to stop telling us about her personal life, and Kelly certainly picks up on that theme: \u201cIn the contemporary account of growing up, self-revelation becomes not only entertainment, but a stand-in for Thoreau\u2019s idea of the examined life.\u201d\n\nBut Kelly also adds a cross-ideological twist by arguing that the cultural mirror image of Dunham can be found in Jill Duggar \u2014 one of the daughters in the extremely conservative and extremely numerous Duggar family \u2014 featured in The Learning Channel\u2019s \u201c19 Kids and Counting.\u201d And as it happens, Duggar has also written a tell-all book stumping for her family\u2019s conservative approach to sex, dating, and all the same topic Dunham covers:\n\nWe take Lena Dunham and Jill Duggar seriously as arbiters of how to live because so many of us, religious, secular, conservative and progressive alike, have sacrificed the medium for the message. As long as one of the many, many people cluttering pop culture in the digital age says something we agree with, we don\u2019t care how she says it. And while we watch from our respective corners, cheering or jeering as the case may be, each woman sacrifices her sense of self and the freedom to grow up in private on the altars of ideology and politics and commerce. Having been repeatedly accused of offering too much information about herself, Lena Dunham objects to the phrase in an interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross. \u201cToo much information has always been my least favorite phrase because what exactly constitutes too much information?\u201d I\u2019d like to take a crack at answering Lena\u2019s question. What, exactly, constitutes too much information? Too much information becomes too much information when it is the sum total of information, when a person is nothing more than a collection of situations, sensations, dictates, status updates and aphorisms \u2014 all of it regurgitated before even being digested. We watch as Jill Duggar and Lena Dunham, their book deals and Twitter followers predicated on continual self-revelation, are reduced to the sum total of their parts. As they give parts away, episode by episode, one candid appearance on the Today show and illuminating interview on NPR at a time, what exactly will it all add up to in the end? Accept yourself, they each say, but they don\u2019t finish the thought: and hope there is a self left when nobody is watching.\n\nPolitical scientist Andre Gelman has pointed out that social and cultural issues motivate the voting habits of richer Americans most strongly, while economic and pocketbook issues motivate poorer voters. (The phenomenon of the working class \u201cvoting against its interests\u201d because politicians have swayed them with social issues is actually quite limited.) Perhaps the most dispiriting part of Kelly\u2019s essay is the observation that Dunham and Duggar may well represent the future of how this slugfest between rival cultural tribes will play out among the upper class, as they turn to their media consumption to reveal \u201cthe key to the good life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the new frontier of the culture wars,\u201d Kelly observes. \u201cThe progressive-conservative clash resounding in personal experiences of twenty-somethings, each blow landing with a dull thud.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cIn Defense of Daring: The Virgin Galactic Accident and Next Steps for Private Space\u201d \u2014 Rand Simberg, The New Atlantis\n\nLast week, a spacecraft run by Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic \u2014 a private firm working its way into space-tourism \u2014 tragically broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another. This prompted Jeffrey Kluger of Time Magazine to take Branson to task \u2014 along with other billionaire owners of private space forms \u2014 for \u201ctoo much hubris, too much hucksterism and too little knowledge of the head-crackingly complex business of engineering.\u201d\n\nThis week, Rand Simberg, a libertarian author and entrepreneur himself, came to Branson\u2019s defense in The New Atlantis. Simberg\u2019s description of Branson as \u201ca visionary and a philanthropist\u201d who could \u201cchange the world\u201d is a bit overcooked, but he makes an enthusiastic case that Branson\u2019s personality traits, both good and bad, are a necessary part of the mix that will drive human space exploration. Furthermore, he does it by digging into the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the very institution Kluger would prefer handled our quest for space in lieu of Branson and his fellow billionaires:\n\nIt might be instructive here for Kluger to consider the life story of another individual \u2014 someone who in the early 1930s was a pilot for the Marine Corps, and then re-enlisted during World War II. This man was primarily a lawyer and a businessman, becoming a vice president at a firm that built instruments for airplanes. In the early 1960s, this man somehow \u201cinsinuated\u201d himself \u201cinto the space business\u201d even though he was a \u201cnon-professional\u201d on space matters (to use the same language that Kluger assigned to Branson). Yet somehow this individual, James E. Webb, the second NASA administrator, pulled together the new government agency that Kluger so admires and that, less than eight years after he took the reins, sent men from earth around the moon, winning the space race. Kluger thinks that a Virgin Galactic crash \u201calways seemed troublingly likely.\u201d Well, it was certainly possible. In my recent book Safe Is Not an Option, I describe the various ways that SpaceShipTwo (among other privately operated space vehicles) could have a very bad day. But of course it is much more possible, and even \u201clikely,\u201d for such an event to occur in a test program \u2014 that is why test programs exist, and that is what they were for even in the early days of space, and before that in the early days of aviation. Test programs risk test pilots\u2019 lives and risk vehicles in order to reduce and minimize the eventual loss of fully operational vehicles carrying passengers. Kluger, like some other commentators in the wake of last week\u2019s news, seems not to understand the difference.\n\nOne argument here might be that, as a nonprofit and government-run project, NASA\u2019s institutional culture is more inclined towards care and throughtfulness, while private firms might be more reckless under the comparatively \u201cdynamic\u201d pressures of profits and the market. On the other hand, Simberg credibly argues that a Branson-esque spirit of risk-taking and entrepreneurism was probably at work within NASA\u2019s culture during the heyday of its greatest accomplishments.\n\nRegardless, private space exploration seems to be the main game in town these days, barring a massive decision by the federal government to start actually spending money again. \u201cOne suspects that [Richard Branson] will be humbler in his hucksterism going forward,\u201d Simberg wrote. \u201cBut go forward he probably will.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cSex and the Single Girl: A Review of \u2018How to Build a Girl\u2019\u201d \u2014 Gracy Olmstead, Acculturated\n\nCaitlin Moran\u2019s novel How To Build A Girl hit shelves two months ago. It concerns a young woman named Johanna Morgan who deals with the insecurities of the teenage years by inventing an alter ego named Dolly Wilde, who writes scathing music reviews for a culture magazine while working her way through a plethora of booze, cigarettes and wild sex.\n\nThis week, Gracy Olmstead, who writes regularly for The American Conservative, reviewed the book in the pages of Acculturated. Olmstead found the characterization of Johanna \u2014 her needs and interior life \u2014 compelling and moving. But she also explores how human beings create themselves, a question that sometimes breaks down philosophically along conservative and liberal lines.\n\nRoughly speaking, liberals view it as a post-modern process of of inventing ourselves in accordance with our own subjective sense of meaning, while conservatives view it as a matter of acknowledging that human nature is largely \u201cgiven,\u201d to flourish we have to identify and embrace the pieces of ourselves that already exist as they are. \u201cWhat do you do when you build yourself,\u201d Moran asks, \u201conly to realize you built yourself with the wrong things?\u201d Her answer comes down on the liberal view: \u201cYou rip it up and start again. That is the work of your teenage years.\u201d\n\nThis concept of personhood is rather interesting. Moran seems to believe that, in order to become a full \u201cperson,\u201d we must be invented: that the raw materials that made up \u201cJohanna\u201d were not quite enough. She had to become Dolly Wilde \u2014 or, at least, Dolly Wilde was a rough draft of a better Johanna/Dolly who will emerge further down the road. We wonder throughout the book whether Moran is advocating for the natural innocence of Johanna, or for the powerful, self-created energy of Dolly \u2014 and I rather think that, in the end, Moran is advocating for neither: she is advocating for Johanna\u2019s choice, to be whoever she wants to be. But when we turn \u201cchoice\u201d into a virtue, we remove a person\u2019s ability to determine whether certain choices are right or wrong, wise or foolish. Johanna\u2019s choice to become a writer is a good, inspiring choice. Her decision to find her own artistic style and flair is good. But Moran herself points out that these decisions have consequences. By the end of the book, we see that Johanna\u2019s independence has not been without its costs (don\u2019t want to spoil everything, but it does have repercussions on her family\u2019s wellbeing). And this says nothing of the other choices Johanna makes, regarding sexual relationships and other wild lifestyle choices. Mightn\u2019t they have consequences down the road? They seem to do some damage to Johanna\u2019s usual chipper and delightful tone of writing, by the end of the book.\n\nOlmstead, by contrast, argues that the answer to the question of who we are \u201clies less in self-recreation, and more in self-cultivation: in taking the raw material, and using it to grow and build a future, rather than in creating an artificial shell, and pouring ourselves into it.\u201d Which is interesting, because it implies that raw materials can be trusted. Usually, it\u2019s liberals who are assumed to view the world in a fundamentally optimistic way, and to see human beings as intrinsically decent (just corrupted by evil systems of power). Meanwhile, it\u2019s conservatives who supposedly see the world as fallen and human beings as inherently sinful. In a way, Olmstead\u2019s argument relies upon an implicit inversion of that script.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Helping liberals understand where their ideological foes are coming from.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Helping liberals understand where their ideological foes are coming from.", "title": "Three Things Conservatives Wrote This Week That Everyone Should Read", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/11/07/3589689/conservatives-post-31/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_138693020-e1411149242158.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_138693020-e1411149242158-320x213.jpg", "description": "Helping liberals understand where their ideological foes are coming from.", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Three Things Conservatives Wrote This Week That Everyone Should Read"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_138693020-e1411149242158.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_138693020-e1411149242158.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-07T15:27:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4261\"", "article_summary": "Politics Three Things Conservatives Wrote This Week That Everyone Should Read CREDIT: ShutterstockWelcome to TP Ideas\u2018 weekly roundup of the best conservative writing!\nRegardless, private space exploration seems to be the main game in town these days, barring a massive decision by the federal government to start actually spending money again.\nThis week, Gracy Olmstead, who writes regularly for The American Conservative, reviewed the book in the pages of Acculturated.\nKelly, Christ & Pop CultureLena Dunham has been in the news this week.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s conservatives who supposedly see the world as fallen and human beings as inherently sinful."}
