No, he\u2019s got his sights set on the world stage\u2014this time as secretary general of the United Nations, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.\n\nBut not all world leaders are keen to see this come to fruition, including first and foremost, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe Washington Times reports:\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama\u2019s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama\u2019s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year. Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida. Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama\u2019s plans which he calls the Obama Project. \u201cWasn\u2019t eight years of having Obama in office enough?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. \u201cEight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.\u201d\n\nFurther gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. \u201cmoving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,\u201d the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's term expires in early 2017, making Obama\u2019s bid for the position a possibility. Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ugh. .05/27/2016 7:58:58AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ugh.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Report: Obama Wants to Become UN Secretary General, Netanyahu Doing Everything He Can to Stop Him", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/01/10/report-obama-wants-to-become-un-secretary-general-netanyahu-doing-everything-he-can-to-stop-him-n2102416", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/271/2015-09-28T150150Z_1_LYNXNPEB8R0SQ_RTROPTP_3_UN-ASSEMBLY-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ugh.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Report: Obama Wants to Become UN Secretary General, Netanyahu Doing Everything He Can to Stop Him", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/01/10/report-obama-wants-to-become-un-secretary-general-netanyahu-doing-everything-he-can-to-stop-him-n2102416", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/271/2015-09-28T150150Z_1_LYNXNPEB8R0SQ_RTROPTP_3_UN-ASSEMBLY-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Report: Obama Wants to Become UN Secretary General, Netanyahu Doing Everything He Can to Stop Him , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWasn\u2019t eight years of having Obama in office enough?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates.\nIt seems President Obama has no intention of stepping out of the White House and fading from the limelight.\nMr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama\u2019s plans which he calls the Obama Project.\nMr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.\nNo, he\u2019s got his sights set on the world stage\u2014this time as secretary general of the United Nations, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida."}
