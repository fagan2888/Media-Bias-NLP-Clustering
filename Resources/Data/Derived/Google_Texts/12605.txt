We had a question posted on our Facebook page asking if there was a way to put a visible time stamp on photos taken by an iPhone.

At first, we thought it was silly, but there are actually some reasons for going old school with the visible time stamp, like organization or verification for a third party.

All smartphone photos contain the date and time embedded in what’s called the metadata, so if you get an app that can read the hidden info, you can easily add the timestamp to your pictures.

For iPhone users, checkout a free app called TimeStamp-It Lite and for Android users there’s ADP timestamp which is also free.

Both of these apps allow you add tasteful time stamps and place them in any of the four corners so you don’t look like you’re stuck in another century.
