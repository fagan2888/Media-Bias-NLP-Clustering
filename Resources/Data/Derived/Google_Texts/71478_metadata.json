The tax credits were based on projected 2014 income and consumers must reconcile the amount of tax credits they received with their actual incomes. Consumers could owe money if their actual income turned out to be higher than projected or get a credit if their income was lower than projected.\n\nPeople with questions about the new forms can call ACR at 800-475-2430.\n\nThe state health insurance exchange has answered frequently asked questions about Form 1095-A on its website.\n\n\n\nContact James T.
