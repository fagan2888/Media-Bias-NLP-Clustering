This past Sunday, Fox News Channel’s MediaBuzz with Howie Kurtz delivered its biggest audience since its launch — 1.3 million viewers — and was the No. 1 cable news program for the day in the news demo with 300,000 viewers in that age bracket. Sunday’s program included an interview with Fox Business Network’s Melissa Francis, who claimed she was chastised by CNBC management when she worked there, as part of a “cover-up” of the math of Obamacare. (CNBC has called her claims “laughable.”)

Meanwhile, CNN’s all-things-media Sunday show, Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter, logged 415,000 viewers — 86,000 in the news demo. This fell short of Stelter’s 2014 average of 456,000 viewers and 126,000 in the news demo. This despite landing an interview with one of the women who’d accused Bill Cosby of rape years ago and who has come forward again with those claims as Netflix gets ready to drop its Cosby holiday special and NBC continues to develop its Cosby-centric multi-generational family comedy series.
