Although he has now become an advocate of easier sharing information between EHR systems, I believe that both the vendors and health systems have become complicit in making patient communication more complex and confusing. Government rules also have some share of the blame.\n\nOne of the linchpins of Meaningful Use, Stage 2 is to facilitate communication with the patient through the use of portals. Unfortunately, that fails miserably more often than it could possibly succeed.\n\nWhile there are a number of reasons for this, the most notable is the plethora of \u201cuser-friendly\u201d portals, none of which communicate with each other. Some comprehensive medical centers at least coordinate messages within their system, but that doesn\u2019t help someone who chooses professionals based on no criteria other that they all have the same employer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s even worse with one system that I use where every practice has their own unique site, none of which communicate with each other, even though they are all on the same EMR.\n\nTo make matters worse some portals allow you to choose your own username, others do not. Passwords are inconsistent.\n\nIn my case, I use three different systems and have five different portals. I recently tried to send a result to my internist but forgot the username that I was assigned. \u201cThere was a \u201cforgot username\u201d button but that led me to the direction to call her which I couldn\u2019t do in the middle of the night.\n\nEven during normal office hours that can be a daunting task. Many of my physician friends who have practices thing of Meaningful Use as a nuisance. They\u2019ve installed heir EMR, put up a patient portal essentially just to check a required box. They also complain that they can\u2019t force their patients to use it.\n\nThe legitimate concern for patient privacy and accurate patient identification between diverse systems is solvable but there are multiple ways to overcome that. The easiest way to accomplish this is by putting control into the hands of the patient, either directly or through a trusted broker. Another alternative is an aggregator collect and/or display the information.\n\nWeakening the rules for meaningful use does nothing to make the situation better. It reinforces the status quo by rewarding behaviors that continue the silos of multiple portals. EMH vendors alone are not the answer either. Each will continue to try and build a better, more user friendly solution than their competitors. We don\u2019t need better, we need consistency.\n\nWithout trusted and standards-based there will never be a perfect solution. I\u2019m not looking for perfection, I\u2019m only looking for something that\u2019s workable. Perfect can come later.\n\n[Photo Credit: Confused from Big Stock Photos]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bottom line:  patient portals fail more often than they succeed.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Bottom line:  patient portals fail more often than they succeed.", "title": "Meaningful (or Meaningless) Use?
