And needless to say, it\u2019s a lot easier for policy wonks and academics like Elmendorf to make these pronouncements than lawmakers and politicians who must answer to voters. With so much at stake financially for a politically potent bloc of seniors and others approaching their retirement years, open talk of reforming Social Security and Medicare health benefits for seniors entails considerable political risk.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich is the latest Republican presidential candidate to touch the dangerous \u201cThird Rail of Politics\u201d by strongly advocating major reforms of Social Security and other entitlements to slow the growth of the federal debt.\n\nLike New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before him, Kasich last Friday caused an uproar in New Hampshire by warning that seniors would have to \u201cget over\u201d cuts in their Social Security benefits if he is elected president and carries out his entitlement reform initiatives.\n\n\"We can't balance a budget without entitlement reform,\u201d Kasich said during NH1's \"Fiscal Fridays\" series in Concord. \u201cWhat are we, kidding?\" the one time House Budget Committee Chair said when asked about his opponents who say they won't touch entitlements, according to CNN. Later that day, Kasich declared at a town hall meeting in Stratham that: \u201cYou\u2019re on Medicare and you want me to ignore the fact that it\u2019s going broke, you\u2019re not going to like me.\u201d\n\nFor his efforts, the New Hampshire Democratic Party circulated a video of Kasich\u2019s comments, saying that Kasich \u201cthreatened our Granite State seniors.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bush Stung by Backlash to His Call for Overhauling Medicare\n\nThough he wasn\u2019t responding directly to Kasich, Elmendorf offered a criticism of the kind of cuts Kasich appeared to endorse. \u201cIf we narrowed the gap between federal revenue and spending through significant across-the-board cuts in Social Security and Medicare, we would significantly reduce total retirement income for many lower- and middle-income people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat approach would be wrong, in my view, because it would impose a large burden on the people who have been experiencing the slowest income growth. It would also be wrong because those benefits have distinctive characteristics that are even more important for people who do not have defined-benefit pensions.\u201d\n\nRather than going after benefits across the board, Elmendorf said he would focus on reducing Social Security and Medicare benefits for high-income beneficiaries and raising the ceiling on payroll taxes on workers with high earnings. \u201cTaken together, such targeted measures could eliminate much of the estimated 75 year shortfall in the system,\u201d he wrote, citing previous CBO studies. \u201cIn Medicare, additional tax revenue could be raised by boosting the payroll tax rate for workers with higher earnings.\u201d\n\nKasich revealed last week that he wants to \u201cprivatize\u201d Social Security for future seniors and reduce benefits for baby boomers who are nearing retirement. Kasich said that he\u2019s not sure yet of the precise nature of his reforms \u201cbecause I gotta go back and do all the numbers again.\u201d As for younger Americans many years away from retirement, \u201cI still like the idea of giving them an opportunity to earn money through the strength of our American economy, with Social Security included in that.\u201d\n\nRelated: How the Presidential Candidates Would Confront $18.6 Trillion of U.S. Debt\n\nElmendorf differs with Kasich and Christie on the best approach to curtailing growth in entitlement costs and argues that \u201csome of the standard arrows in reformers\u2019 quivers should be a last rather than a first resort.\u201d\n\nFor instance, he argues that an increase in the eligibility age for all retirement benefits in Social Security \u201cwould reduce monthly benefits for everyone who chose to retire at the same age as they would under current law, and it would reduce the number of years of benefits for everyone who chose to retire later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat change would be especially harmful for lower-income people,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf has just offered his pre", "title": "Is There a Less Painful Way to Fix Social Security?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/There-Less-Painful-Way-Fix-Social-Security", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07132011_Social_Security_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/There-Less-Painful-Way-Fix-Social-Security", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07132011_Social_Security_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf has just offered his pre", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda62b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTherefore, cuts in Social Security or Medicare benefits, or increases in taxes used to finance those programs, will almost certainly be needed to put federal debt on a sustainable path,\u201d Elmendorf wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post.\nJohn Kasich is the latest Republican presidential candidate to touch the dangerous \u201cThird Rail of Politics\u201d by strongly advocating major reforms of Social Security and other entitlements to slow the growth of the federal debt.\nWith so much at stake financially for a politically potent bloc of seniors and others approaching their retirement years, open talk of reforming Social Security and Medicare health benefits for seniors entails considerable political risk.\n\u201cIf we narrowed the gap between federal revenue and spending through significant across-the-board cuts in Social Security and Medicare, we would significantly reduce total retirement income for many lower- and middle-income people,\u201d he wrote.\n\"We can't balance a budget without entitlement reform,\u201d Kasich said during NH1's \"Fiscal Fridays\" series in Concord."}
