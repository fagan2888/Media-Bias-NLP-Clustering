But I definitely want to be pretty cautious,\u201d said MacKinnon, who has played in the tournament twice, winning last year.\n\nHe spoke to the media for the first time since suffering the injury March 18 at Calgary, expressing frustration for ending the year on the bench for the second consecutive season.

He said the whole team must avoid sugarcoating the disappointing season.\n\nCameron Wolfe, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s knee injury revealed as left MCL sprain, worse than expected", "title": "Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s knee injury revealed as left MCL sprain, worse than expected", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/nathan-mackinnons-knee-injury-revealed-as-left-mcl-sprain-worse-than-expected/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__Nathan-Mackinnonp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__Nathan-Mackinnonp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T20:28:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T13:38:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "MacKinnon revealed Saturday that he suffered a left MCL sprain and couldn\u2019t have played even if the Avs made the playoffs.\nIt turns out the knee injury that cost the Avalanche star forward Nathan MacKinnon the last 10 games of the season was worse than he initially thought.\nMacKinnon felt his faceoff opponent jumped into his knee when they got tangled up and caused it to cave in.\nBut I definitely want to be pretty cautious,\u201d said MacKinnon, who has played in the tournament twice, winning last year.\nNo immunity for Avs playersCaptain Gabe Landeskog was candid about his performance and what to expect next season."}
