Getting hit with a Taser is not fun, but watching someone get hit with a Taser at 28,500 frames per second (fps) definitely is. A video uploaded by The Slow Mo Guys shows what getting hit with a Taser looks like in Super Slow Motion.

Using a one-shot cartridge made by Taser HQ, Gavin Free recruited a brave soul by the name of Dan Hafen to stand his ground against the shocking power of a Taser for five minutes. The result is something that belongs in the MOMA on permanent loop.

Besides watching someone take two Taser prongs to the back, one of the most interesting parts of the video is the confetti that flies out of the cartridge upon deployment. Each piece of confetti features the cartridge's serial number to ensure every Taser deployment is accounted for.

This isn’t the first interesting video involving a Taser and a Super Slow Mo camera. A YouTube video dubbed “The Taser Photoshoot” shows 100 participants who were willing to strip down and get hit with 300,000 volts of electricity.
