RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Mike Aliff is a four-wheel-drive good Samaritan.

The 31-year-old Richmond, Virginia, native spent Saturday morning driving around in his Jeep Wrangler looking for people to help as the massive snowstorm made its way through his state and others.

After seeing motorist Paul Kay stuck alongside Midlothian Turnpike in suburban Richmond, Aliff pulled his Jeep over, hopped out and got on the ground to attach a tow rope to Kay’s car.

Then he jumped back in his Jeep and successfully pulled Kay’s car from the snow.

State authorities have warned drivers to stay off the road amid a massive snowstorm that’s paralyzed large much of the state, but Aliff says his faith in his Jeep is absolute.

He says: “This Jeep ain’t getting stuck. I can pull out anything in this Jeep.”
