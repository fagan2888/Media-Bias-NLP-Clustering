Sickness takes aim at schools, daycare centers, workplaces, and, yes, sports locker rooms. One week after Peyton Manning came down with the stomach flu, star receiver Emmanuel Sanders missed Saturday’s practice with flu symptoms.

Coach John Fox said he expects Sanders to travel with the team on Sunday.

“Illnesses are common this type of year,” Fox said.



Sanders appeared under the weather on Friday. He didn’t improve and was excused from activity. He has a decent window for recovery since the Broncos don’t play until Monday night in Cincinnati. Andre Caldwell sits behind Sanders on the depth chart. Rookie Cody Latimer has been cleared from the concussion protocol, but has yet to find a niche in the offense as he learns behind veteran receivers.

Sanders boasts 89 catches for 1,261 yards and seven touchdowns, all career-highs in his first season with the Broncos.

Peyton Manning practiced on a limited basis and remains listed as questionable on the injury report. “He looked good,” Fox said, explaining that Manning’s reps have been similar to a normal week. Linebacker Brandon Marshall (sprained foot) and offensive tackle Paul Cornick (right turf toe) were ruled out for the game. Marshall said Saturday his foot continues to improve. He still might sit out the final game next week to assure he heals for the playoffs, though no decision has been made.

In all, six Broncos are listed as questionable on the injury report: Manning (thigh), running back Juwan Thompson (hip/knee), Ryan Clady (thigh), Will Mongtomery (knee), Kayvon Webster (shoulder) and Sanders (illness).
