As I noted last year, Robbins is one of the best-performing managers in the game.\n\nRobbins was playing the Affordable Care Act by investing in publicly traded hospitals. A large portion of Glenview\u2019s portfolio is still invested in hospital stocks and he\u2019s been a top hedge fund manager the last couple years. This comes as the Obamacare benefit helped push hospital and other health care stocks to all-time highs.\n\nHave you ever wondered how billionaires continue to get RICHER, while the rest of the world is struggling?\n\n\"I study billionaires for a living. To be more specific, I study how these investors generate such huge and consistent profits in the stock markets -- year-in and year-out.\"\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to get your Free E-Book, \u201cThe Little Black Book Of Billionaires Secrets\u201d\n\nHowever, the major hospital stocks have been sold off hard \u2013 as much as 40% year-to-date.\n\nStill, there are other things at work here. One of the big tailwinds for hospitals is the aging population. And while the initial influx of new people with insurance was a big boost, there\u2019s still plenty of runway for hospitals. Some 9 million people got insurance last year, but there are still over 33 million people without insurance in the U.S.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are the top three hospital stocks to buy on the recent weakness:\n\nNo. 1 Hospital Stock to Buy: HCA Holdings (NYSE: HCA)\n\nShares of HCA are down 23% over the last three months. HCA operates more than 160 hospitals in the U.S. and over 100 surgery centers. Its key market is the Sun Belt region, where there are faster-growing urban markets and an aging demographic.\n\nOne of the big reasons hospital stocks took it on the chin was dismal earnings from the nation\u2019s leading hospital operator, HCA Holdings. The company noted that its uninsured volume is growing, up to 8% of total admissions in the third quarter versus 7.3% a year ago.\n\nThe key with HCA is that it\u2019s generating industry-tops return on invested capital, coming in at close to 20%. It\u2019s also supposed to grow earnings at one of the highest rates in the industry over the next five years.\n\nOf note, billionaire David Tepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management have been buying up shares. Tepper noted that he thought the stock was hit too hard and was buying more.\n\nNo. 2 Hospital Stock to Buy: Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH)\n\nCommunity Health was one of Glenview\u2019s top 10 holdings as of this summer. But its shares have fallen over 40% this year. The stock now trades at just 8 times next year\u2019s earnings and just 6 times free cash flow.\n\nThis hospital operator recently offered guidance that showed costs increasing faster than expected. However, there were bright spots, which included a 0.2% rise in total admissions year-over-year and 0.1% increase in same-store admissions.\n\nCommunity Health runs hospitals in various rural and non-urban communities. In truth, it\u2019s the largest operator of non-urban hospitals in the U.S. The enticing thing about non-urban areas is that they offer higher reimbursement rates.\n\nJust a few months ago it spun off close to 40 smaller, slower-growth hospitals in rural areas as Quorum Health.\n\nPages: Next 2\n\nETF BASIC NEWS", "article_metadata": {"description": "Larry Robbins and his Glenview Capital hedge fund made a big bet on President Obama\u2019s health care reform.
