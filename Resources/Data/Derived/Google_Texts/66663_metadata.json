Stelter asked Earnest if perhaps the Obama administration is \u201cwithholding more than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the president\u2019s record of transparency stands up to any of the records of his predecessors,\u201d replied Earnest.\n\nThe CNN host then wondered whether Earnest himself could improve the flow of information to temper such accusations of the administration.\n\n\u201cWell, I definitely am committed and I have a responsibility in this job to try to help the president live up to his commitment to be the most transparent president in history,\u201d the press secretary explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that you still say that line: Most transparent president in history,\u201d Stelter said, flabbergasted. \u201cHe has been criticized so many times for saying that given the prosecutions of whistle blowers and other steps. You all still stick by that line?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Earnest said assuredly.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of steps that we\u2019ve taken to give people greater insight into the White House,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of these \u201csteps\u201d involves allowing press to gain access to fundraisers that Obama attends at private homes. So, the president might not be completely honest about the NSA or Obamacare, but he\u2019ll let you come to one of his swanky parties.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "White House press secretary Josh Earnest appeared on CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" in his first Sunday show interview and defended the Obama administration as the \"most transparent\" in history.", "title": "White House press secretary still defends Obama as 'most...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/07/earnest-home-600x203.jpg", "height": 203}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/13/white-house-press-secretary-defends-obama-transparent-president/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "josh-earnest-sunday-show-interview", "published_time": "2014-07-13T16:17:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T12:00:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec90\"", "article_summary": "White House press secretary Josh Earnest appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d in his first Sunday show interview and defended the Obama administration as the \u201cmost transparent\u201d in history.\n\u201cThere are a number of steps that we\u2019ve taken to give people greater insight into the White House,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWell, I definitely am committed and I have a responsibility in this job to try to help the president live up to his commitment to be the most transparent president in history,\u201d the press secretary explained.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that you still say that line: Most transparent president in history,\u201d Stelter said, flabbergasted.\nOne of these \u201csteps\u201d involves allowing press to gain access to fundraisers that Obama attends at private homes."}
