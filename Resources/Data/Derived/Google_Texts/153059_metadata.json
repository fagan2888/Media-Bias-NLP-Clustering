No reason to change now.\n\nBut while Hughes is prepared to take the political heat for this, he also glances over his shoulder at Senate Republicans and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nBy state constitutional law the governor calls the Legislature into special session, and the governor sets the agenda.\n\nIt is Herbert\u2019s call, says Hughes, to assemble lawmakers and put Utah Access+ before them.\n\nWhat happens then is up to the House and Senate GOP caucuses.\n\nAnd Hughes doesn\u2019t see the House GOP caucus changing its long-held internal rule of 38 votes (or more) on major bills, taxes, and political issues.\n\nLittle discussed today is that in the 2015 Legislature Herbert\u2019s own Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion bill (SB164) passed the Senate 17-11-1 with only 13 GOP votes. Fifteen votes is a majority in the 29-member Senate.\n\nThus, while SB164 had a majority of Senate GOP caucus votes for it (13 out of 24 Republicans), it still took at least two Democratic votes to pass the whole Senate.\n\nHealthy Utah failed in the House vote, with only two dozen House Republicans voting for it.\n\nUtah Access+, says Hughes, is not his favorite alternative.\n\nIt is compromise reached by Herbert\u2019s Gang of Six committee put together after Healthy Utah failed in the 2015 Legislature \u2013 made up of Herbert, Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox; Hughes, R-Draper; Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy; House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville; and Sen. Brian Shiozawa, R-Cottonwood Heights, (SB164\u2019s sponsor).\n\nUtah Access+ \u201cis not 100 percent of what I wanted,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cWe worked together to get at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not raised the bar to 38 votes\u201d \u2013 the House majority coming from the GOP caucus, said Hughes.\n\n\u201cThat has always been the bar \u2013 even before I came to the House.\u201d\n\nIf Utah Access+ \u201chas now become the Greg Hughes show,\u201d says the speaker. \u201cThen some basic questions need to be answered\u201d by those opposing the Gang\u2019s proposal and how to get it passed.\n\n\u201cThe state is stepping up with $25 million\u201d to fully fund the state share of the so-called \u201cwoodwork\u201d children \u2013 those who have always qualified for Medicaid, but were never signed up by their low-income parents.\n\nThose extra kids, because of all the Medicaid expansion publicity, will likely come into the new program once passed.\n\nThat $25 million \u201cis at least twice\u201d the cost of any of the 14 health care professional groups\u2019 new assessments under Utah Access+.\n\n\u201cWe are doing our share,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nMore importantly, all these medical groups demanding Medicaid expansion \u2013 and the $450 million in federal dollars coming to Utah (and into their pockets) \u2013 are only going to have to contribute 7 cents for each new dollar coming through expansion \u2013 and the more patients and clients they serve.\n\n\u201cI swear if these (health care groups) demanding we leverage the $450 million\u201d in federal money \u201cacross these 14 medical groups say we should not do this\u201d \u2013 have the 7 cents-per-$1 assessments -- \u201cthen we need a strong public dialogue on why they don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nFor if the state is stuck with the whole 10 percent match, then \u201cas I stand here I promise it will impact growth in funding new students, it will impact higher education funding\u201d down the road.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Medicaid expansion up to 138 percent of poverty will grow year after year, and it will be funded first \u2013 \u201coff the top\u201d \u2013 of other state spending.\n\n\u201cIt is a risk I will not take; I will never take,\u201d says Hughes.\n\nThere is today a concerted effort in the media \u2013 even by some members of the media \u2013 to make the issue today that \u201cHughes hates the poor and sick,\u201d and will only talk process and never the lives affected, says the speaker.\n\nNot so, he adds.\n\n\u201cWe are asking doctors, on average, to pay an extra $67 a month\u201d in the new Utah Access+ licensing fees. Other health care providers will be asked to contribute more, too, to make up the state\u2019s 10 percent share to get the feds 90 percent share -- to get that new $450 million flowing into Medicaid expansion in Utah, says Hughes.\n\nThat is not unreasonable, he adds.\n\nJust as it is not unreasonable for the House GOP caucus to make the major budget and public policy decisions based on finding 38 votes within the majority.\n\nIf Herbert wants to move ahead without 38 firm votes in the House GOP caucus, okay says Hughes.\n\nLet the GOP governor \u2013 who agrees with the Gang of Six\u2019s Utah Access+ Medicaid expansion \u2013 take his constitutional authority to do so: Call a special session.\n\nThe Utah GOP caucus will hold a closed meeting Oct. 13 to hash out the plan and take a head count.\n\nMaybe there will be more than 38 \u201cyea\u201d votes there.\n\nBut whatever the number is, Hughes and other House GOP leaders, and caucus members themselves, will expect those \u201cyea\u201d votes to hold up on any floor vote for Utah Access+ taken publically later.\n\nNo saying in the caucus you vote yes, then going to a House Democrat and trading your switched \u201cno\u201d vote for his or her \u201cyea\u201d vote so the bill will pass on the floor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean when I say we all have to own our Medicaid expansion votes, one way or the other,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nHe adds that Utah Plus+ is a fair, reasonable approach to Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut no GOP House member will be pressured by leadership to accept it; the votes will come based on the plan itself. Or they won\u2019t.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes is getting bashed around these days over Utah\u2019s Medicaid expansion.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/7215-hughes-republicans-have-to-own-medicaid-expansion", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "type": "article", "title": "Hughes: Republicans Have to 'Own' Medicaid Expansion"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Those extra kids, because of all the Medicaid expansion publicity, will likely come into the new program once passed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean when I say we all have to own our Medicaid expansion votes, one way or the other,\u201d said Hughes.\nUtah House Speaker Greg Hughes is getting bashed around these days over Utah\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nLittle discussed today is that in the 2015 Legislature Herbert\u2019s own Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion bill (SB164) passed the Senate 17-11-1 with only 13 GOP votes.\nLet the GOP governor \u2013 who agrees with the Gang of Six\u2019s Utah Access+ Medicaid expansion \u2013 take his constitutional authority to do so: Call a special session."}
