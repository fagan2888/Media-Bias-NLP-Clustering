Obamacare, Facebook

Today on Lubbock’s First News, Jordan Wilson offered details of tonight’s event, Obamacare: What’s In It For Me? The event will be a bipartisan discussion of the policy. It will take place at the Knipling Center from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm tonight, Thursday evening.

Wilson said, “What this event is really about is knowing exactly how Obamacare is going to affect you; not only just your wallets, but also how the hospital procedure is going to change for you and what kind of care you can expect.” He noted that the event will also be geared toward health care providers to let them know what kind of changes will take place.

The event will offer a panel of speakers, including Representative Charles Perry, Lubbock County Democratic Chairman Kenny Ketner, and Patty Freier as former Legislative director for Covenant.

Free parking can be found for the event on 21st and Louisville Ave. It is sponsored by Covenant Student Nurses Association.
