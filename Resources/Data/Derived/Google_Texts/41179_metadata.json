He was 94.\n\nSakato, who had congestive heart failure, according to his daughter, was the last surviving member of the seven.\n\nDuring the war, Sakato served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated Japanese-American unit whose members have come to be known as national heroes after they rescued more than 200 men of the 141st Infantry Regiment of the Texas National Guard \u2014 the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d \u2014 trapped behind enemy lines.\n\nThe 442nd, the most highly decorated combat unit, for its size and length of service, in U.S. military history, lost 800 men in the fight.\n\nSakato, for his part, didn\u2019t speak highly of his prospects as an Army recruit, saying he performed poorly in marksmanship and the obstacle course in basic training.\n\nHe first tried to enlist shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7, 1941, but was turned down, classified as an \u201cenemy alien,\u201d despite the fact he was born and raised in California.\n\nIn October 1944, though, he and the 442nd were in the Vosges Mountains of northeastern France, tasked with finding and rescuing the Lost Battalion.\n\nAccording to the official Army report, Sakato stopped \u201can organized enemy attack \u201d single-handedly.\n\n\u201cDuring this entire action,\u201d the citation continued, \u201che killed 12 and wounded two, personally captured four and assisted his platoon in taking 34 prisoners. By continuously ignoring enemy fire, and by his gallant courage and fighting spirit, he turned impending defeat into victory and helped his platoon complete its mission.\u201d\n\nSakato later received shrapnel wounds to his upper body and was evacuated from the battlefield. He received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army\u2019s second-highest combat honor, but was denied the Medal of Honor.\n\nAfter the war, Sakato moved to Denver, where he spent 32 years working as a postal clerk.\n\nHalf a century later, Sen. Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii, put forth legislation to initiate a review of the military records of Asian-American World War II veterans. On June 21, 2000, President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to 22 Asian- American veterans, including Sakato, only seven of whom were still alive.\n\n\u201cIt is long past time to break the silence about their courage,\u201d Clinton said at the White House ceremony in 2000. \u201cRarely has a nation been so well served by a people it has so ill treated.\u201d\n\nSakato\u2019s wife of 60 years, Bess Saito Sakato, died in 2007. Survivors include a daughter, Leslie Sakato of Denver, and two brothers.\n\nThe Washington Post contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "George \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato, American hero, dies at 94", "title": "George \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato, American hero, dies at 94", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/george-joe-sakato-american-hero-dies-at-94/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__CD09VETSTAMP_KO19069p1-1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__CD09VETSTAMP_KO19069p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T21:36:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:16:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After the war, Sakato moved to Denver, where he spent 32 years working as a postal clerk.\n\u201cI wear this for the men who didn\u2019t come home,\u201d he told The Denver Post in 2011.\nSurvivors include a daughter, Leslie Sakato of Denver, and two brothers.\nSakato, who received the military\u2019s highest honor in 2000, one of seven living Asian-American veterans belatedly recognized for their valor, died Dec. 2 at his home in Denver.\nOn June 21, 2000, President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to 22 Asian- American veterans, including Sakato, only seven of whom were still alive."}
