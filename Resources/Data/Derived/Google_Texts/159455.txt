A man who reportedly assaulted a Pawnee County Deputy in Hallett has crashed his vehicle after an ensuing pursuit.

According to sheriff Mike Waters, deputy Tom Moore was responding to a domestic call, and while he was talking with the alleged victim, Aaron Westbay, 29, showed up to the residence in Hallett.

As Moore attempted to place Westbay under arrest, he began to fight with Moore and possibly broke his arm, Waters said.



Westbay jumped in his car and sped away, and Moore pursued him through Hallett, Jennings and Terlton before Westbay crashed his car on Shamrock Road in Drumright, Waters said.



Osage SkyNews 6 flew overhead as Westbay was ordered out of the vehicle and placed under arrest.

According to online court records, Westbay has a history of domestic abuse charges.



Court records show his address is in Mannford.
