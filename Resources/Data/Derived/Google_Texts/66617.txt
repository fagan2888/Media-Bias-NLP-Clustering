A minor bill designed to protect consumers is apparently driving the Texas electric industry crazy.

Rep. Rafael Anchia (D-Dallas) is getting an earful from electric company lobbyists who don’t like a bill he introduced in the 2015 Legislature.

Two sources in the Texas Legislature say Anchia’s staffers are receiving what one calls “an unexpected backlash regarding the bill.”

Anchia’s bill faces a hearing Wednesday in the House Committee on State Affairs – which means now is the time for supporters and opponents to act.

His House Bill 489 would place fees paid by consumers to electric companies for using smart thermostats under state regulatory rules. Because the gadgets are new, the way electric companies market them to customers is not regulated by the state. It also calls for the use of “plain language” in product contracts.

What’s interesting here is that Anchia’s bill is minor affecting few Texans who actually rent smart thermostats from an electric company. But apparently lobbyists don’t want to open the door to any more regulation on the state’s confusing retail electricity industry.

Anchia’s bill is in reaction to a Dallas Morning News Watchdog column I wrote in 2013 showing how Plano resident Tamara Galbraith was charged $495 by Tara Energy when she cancelled her smart thermostat rental.

She said the promised rewards didn’t justify the expense.

I showed readers the ultra-tiny print on the contract, rendering it essentially unreadable.

There ought to be a law, and that’s what Anchia has said. He sees the need to place new technologies under state marketing rules. Smart thermostats weren’t on the market a decade ago when Texas deregulated electricity.

Now electric companies see them as a way to make money. They rent them to customers, some of whom don’t realize they can buy smart thermostats on their own. The devices are supposed to adjust temperatures based on the habits of the people in the house.

You can let Anchia know your thoughts on his bill before Wednesday’s hearing by sending him an email: to rafael.anchia@house.state.tx.us.

As the Dallas Morning News Watchdog, I’m pushing bills that fix major problems in the Texas retail electricity market. So far, I’m disappointed because only one of my suggestions has been introduced (eliminating minimum usage penalties).

Read my latest report on The Watchdog’s legislative package for 2015: “Watchdog: This week is legislature’s last chance for electricity reform.”

Here’s the text of the minor bill driving the Texas electric industry crazy.

HB 489

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT relating to customer protections related to smart thermostat services marketing and contracts.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTIONA1.AASubchapter A, Chapter 17, Utilities Code, is amended by adding Section 17.010 to read as follows:
