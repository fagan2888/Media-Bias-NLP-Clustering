A plan is considered affordable if the employee's share of the annual premium for the lowest priced individual plan is no more than 9.5% of the worker's annual household income.\n\nAn August survey of 140 large employers by the NBGH found that 76% of employers are adding or expanding consumerism tools, which help employees evaluate medical treatments and compare prices, in 2016 to delay the excise tax. The study also found that 76% are adding or expanding consumer-driven health plans, and 70% are adding or expanding wellness incentives.\n\nIf employers made no changes, the majority of large employers would trigger the excise tax by 2019 for at least one plan, the study found.\n\nEmployers who haven't set a strategy don't have much time to waste.\n\n\u201cIt takes a number of years to make the changes that they need to make in order to stay below the tax,\u201d Mr. Wojcik said. \u201cYou can't just do that from one year to the next, or it's going to be a drastic change, and employees will let you know that they don't like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the year where employers are saying, 'I know by 2018 I need to make changes, so I need to do it over (the next) three years,' \u201d agreed Rob Moroni, Detroit-based Midwest corporate market leader for The Segal Group Inc. \u201cEveryone has now decided what their strategy is for the excise tax, and they are implementing in '16.\u201d\n\nChanges are best made in phases, he said.\n\n\u201cYou kind of look at which lever you want to pull\u201d to bring down plan costs, Mr. Moroni said. \u201cDo I want to pull plan design lever (or) do I want to pull contribution lever? But with the excise tax, the contribution lever doesn't work, because you have to bring down the value of the plan.\u201d\n\nThoroughly communicating those major plan design changes is essential, experts said.\n\n\u201cEmployers are really starting to feel for their employees a little bit more in terms of the cost (and)\u2026 the impact on employees,\u201d said Wally Dawson, Raleigh, North Carolina-based managing principal with Digital Benefit Advisors.\n\nThey are \u201cvery consciously trying to engage their employees a little bit more so that they understand why they are having to pass on these cost increases,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he said, employers are engaging workers \u201cto make wise decisions about their benefit choices so they can be part of the solution of helping to combat future cost increases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Moving on from the IRS reporting requirements that were front of mind during the 2015 fall open enrollment for group health plans, benefits managers are grappling with implementing strategies to avoid the Cadillac tax for the 2016 enrollment season.Confronted with the possibility of triggering the...", "title": "Benefit managers focus on Cadillac tax issues for 2016 enrollment season - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20151021/NEWS03/151029944", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20151021/NEWS03/151029944/AR/0/cadillac-tax.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Moving on from the IRS reporting requirements that were front of mind during the 2015 fall open enrollment for group health plans, benefits managers are grappling with implementing strategies to avoid the Cadillac tax for the 2016 enrollment season.Confronted with the possibility of triggering the...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Benefit managers focus on Cadillac tax issues for 2016 enrollment season - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "If employers made no changes, the majority of large employers would trigger the excise tax by 2019 for at least one plan, the study found.\nMoving on from the IRS reporting requirements that were front of mind during the 2015 fall open enrollment for group health plans, benefits managers are grappling with implementing strategies to avoid the Cadillac tax for the 2016 enrollment season.\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a health plan meets the minimum value standard if it covers at least 60% of the total cost of medical services.\n\u201cDo I want to pull plan design lever (or) do I want to pull contribution lever?\n\u201cIt takes a number of years to make the changes that they need to make in order to stay below the tax,\u201d Mr. Wojcik said."}
