The Affordable Care Act – a.k.a. “Obamacare” – became law on Tuesday. And ‘NSYNC just wanted to educate their fans about it.

The boy band’s Twitter account posted “Love, hate, or just confused by it – learn all you can about the Affordable Care Act which starts enrolling tomorrow! http://www.healthcare.gov .”

While the fairly innocuous tweet got props from major progressive groups, it upset some fans. A sampling of the backlash tweets included:

“If you’re following @ NSYNC, I’d unfollow since they want you to have government-controlled healthcare. Just look at their last tweet.”

“I used to like you. How sad that you’re now liberal #puppets. @NSYNC”

Even Fox News’ Michelle Malkin chimed in with “@NSYNC Learn about all the self-employed small biz owners losing their health plans because of Obamacare!”

Haters might be saying “Bye Bye Bye” to the band, but the ACA is now the law of the land.
