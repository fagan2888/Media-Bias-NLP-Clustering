But that\u2019s not the case. The family\u2019s \u201cnew plan\u201d is a temporary plan that does not meet the ACA requirements. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan offered the plan to customers who had their old policies canceled but did not want to purchase insurance on the exchange. It turns out that Wendt found a cheaper, subsidized plan on the exchange, but declined to accept it because she did not want her children on the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nThat\u2019s her right, of course, but the ad is misleading because it fails to disclose that the Wendt family opted to pay more for insurance rather than accept the conditions that came with obtaining a cheaper, subsidized health plan on the exchange.\n\nMeet the Wendt Family\n\nShannon Wendt, and her husband, Zach, are Republicans. They were elected precinct delegates for Tallmadge Township, a section of Grand Rapids, Mich., in Ottawa County, in the August 2012 primary. She sells Etsy products and operates a website called Organic Mama\u2019s Shop. He is a real estate agent. Neither has insurance through an employer. As she explained in prior interviews, she had a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan plan that she obtained on the individual market, but it was canceled because it did not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the ad, which began airing March 25, Wendt says her \u201cnew plan is not affordable at all.\u201d She is shown with her five children, ages 3 to 10, and husband, Zach, who she said is \u201cworking a lot more hours\u201d to pay for the insurance increases. But left out of the ad is why the new plan costs more and the family\u2019s personal decision to opt for a more expensive plan.\n\nShannon Wendt told Fox Business in an article published Jan. 7 that she and her husband were eligible to buy a subsidized health insurance plan, but she said she was surprised and frustrated to learn that her family would be eligible for subsides on the exchange only if they enrolled their children in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. CHIP, as it is known, is a joint federal-state health care program that provides insurance at little or no cost for children of moderate-income families who are not eligible for Medicaid.\n\nFox News, Jan. 7: She found that because she and her husband are small-business owners \u2014 Zach is a real estate agent \u2014 and they take certain business deductions, they fall right under 200% of the federal poverty line. This makes them subsidy eligible, and their children Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) eligible. \u201cIf we want our children on our family plan \u2014 whether its two or 10 people \u2014 we lose the subsidy,\u201d Wendt says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that they are forcing families onto government health-care. It almost feels like an attack on small business owners. This revelation is more frustrating than the initial glitch.\u201d\n\nWendt is right. As HealthCare.gov explains, a family cannot receive subsidies to help buy insurance on the exchange if the children in the family are CHIP-eligible and they do not sign up. But if the children do go on CHIP, then other members of the family, i.e., the parents, may be eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchange \u2014 which would have been the case with the Wendt family.\n\nSince the Wendt family\u2019s adjusted household income falls \u201cright under 200% of the federal poverty line,\u201d as Fox wrote, then that means the couple has a modified adjusted gross income of no more than $72,060, based on the 2014 federal poverty guidelines for a family of seven. That also means their children are eligible for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in Michigan, as Wendt said, since families earning up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for Michigan CHIP.\n\nShannon Wendt has her reasons for not wanting her children to be on CHIP \u2014 reasons she explained in a March 31 op-ed she wrote for the Washington Times. In it, she acknowledges she and her husband \u201cwould be eligible\u201d for subsidies and \u201cwould be paying less\u201d for insurance but do not feel CHIP would provide adequate health care coverage for their children.\n\nWendt, Washington Times op-ed, March 31: What about the subsidies? My husband and I would be eligible, but only if we put our children on MIChild, a taxpayer-funded state health insurance program run through Medicaid. My husband and I would be paying less, but we\u2019d also have to leave the family doctor I\u2019ve been with since I was 6 years old. That\u2019s a path we would never take. We\u2019d be sacrificing our children\u2019s health for the sake of our wallets.\n\nShe goes on to say that her children were briefly on the Michigan CHIP plan several years ago and had a bad experience with one of the doctors who \u201cfailed to give my daughter the right immunizations.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old mom has every right, as we said, to make that decision. We don\u2019t take issue with Wendt\u2019s decision, but rather her assertion that the Affordable Care Act is \u201cdestroying the middle class,\u201d when other families faced with the same choices may have made a different decision that could save them thousands of dollars a year.\n\nLet\u2019s consider what would happen if a family with a similar profile to the Wendts decided to enroll their kids in CHIP and accept the federal subsidies for an exchange plan.\n\nSubsidized Insurance Plans\n\nWe took the information publicly known about the Wendt family and plugged the values into the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator and the HealthCare.gov website to obtain subsidy and premium estimates for a family that fits the Wendt profile.\n\nOn the KFF site, we provided this information: state (Michigan), zip code (49534), county (Ottawa), adjusted annual household income ($69,000, which is 194 percent of the FPL), employer coverage (none), number of people in family (7), number of adults enrolling in the exchange (2), ages (30 and 34), tobacco use (no), number of children enrolling in the exchange (none).\n\nWe don\u2019t know the Wendts\u2019 exact adjusted household income, but $69,000 is \u201cright under\u201d 200 percent of FPL. We also don\u2019t know if either smokes, but for this exercise we assumed the couple does not.\n\nKFF says children in the household might be eligible for CHIP depending on the state (actually the Wendt children would be eligible for CHIP in Michigan, as we know) and the adults would be eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchange.\n\nThere are two kinds of subsidies available to those who purchase insurance on the exchange: an advanced premium tax credit, which is used to lower premiums; and the cost-sharing reduction, which lowers out-of-pocket expenses for people who purchase a silver plan. (There are four levels of plans available for people 30 and over, from cheapest to most expensive: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Silver covers 70 percent of health care costs.)\n\nThe KFF subsidy calculator said a Michigan family of seven with an adjusted income of $69,000 could expect to receive $121.75 per month in premium tax credits. KFF said the couple could purchase, with subsidies, a bronze plan for $220 per month and a silver plan for $345.75 per month \u2014 plus the couple\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum would be limited to no more than $4,500 if they go with the silver plan. KFF did not provide information on the family\u2019s annual deductible, which would depend on what kind of silver plan the family chooses.\n\nWe went to HealthCare.gov to get more specific information about the plans that are available to such a family. Again, we plugged in all the same values: a family of seven in Ottawa County, Mich., with an adjusted household income of $69,000, seeking coverage for two adults ages 30 and 34. HealthCare.gov says that the two adults are eligible for a $121 per month tax credit \u2014 the same amount KFF gave \u2014 and a reduced out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM) for the silver plans.\n\nHealthCare.gov also says there are 33 plans offered by three insurance companies in Ottawa County: eight bronze, 14 silver and 11 gold. Bronze plans cover 60 percent of health care costs, silver 70 percent and gold 80 percent.\n\nA sample of the exchange plans, including subsidies, that were listed on HealthCare.gov for a family that fits the Wendt profile:\n\nBlue Cross Select Bronze HMO, $221 per month/$11,900 deductible/$12,700 OOPM per family\n\nBlue Cross Premier Bronze PPO, $292 per month/$12,700 deductible/$12,700 OOPM per family\n\nBlue Cross Silver Select HMO, $322 per month/$900 deductible/$2,900 OOPM per family\n\nBlue Cross Premier Silver PPO, $421 per month/$600 deductible/$2,800 OOPM per family\n\nBlue Cross Select Gold HMO, $454 per month/$500 deductible/$10,200 OOPM per family\n\nBlue Cross Premier Gold PPO, $534 per month/$300 deductible/$10,200 OOPM per family\n\nIn her op-ed in the Washington Times, Wendt said that last year she paid $221 per month for coverage that included a family deductible of $5,000, 20 percent coinsurance, and a $10,000 out-of-pocket maximum. This year, she has a policy that costs $381 per month, with a $10,000 deductible, 30 percent coinsurance, and a $17,000 out-of pocket maximum. That\u2019s a premium increase of $160 per month ($1,920 per year) for a policy that has a higher deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nBased on the Kaiser Family Foundation and HealthCare.gov results, a Michigan family of seven with the same profile could get a silver plan with the same coinsurance as the Wendt\u2019s current plan, a monthly premium that would be roughly the same (somewhat less for the HMO and somewhat more for the PPO) and far less than the $10,000 annual deductible. Plus, such a family would be eligible for subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket expenses to around $3,000 \u2014 which could represent a significant savings since Shannon Wendt told MLive.com, a Michigan news website, that her family paid $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year.\n\nOf course, the silver plan also provides more benefits because it provides \u201cessential benefits\u201d and meets other requirements that Wendt\u2019s old and current plan do not meet.\n\nIn explaining her frustration with the new law, Shannon Wendt told Fox News that she was happy with her old plan because the family prefers paying low monthly premiums and high deductibles. \u201cWe feel it makes financial sense for us to have a higher deductible plan and just pay these little things out of pocket and then the money we\u2019ve been able to save every month on our premium we\u2019ve been putting away for years and years in the event that something comes up where we would need our deductible, where we would have significant medical needs,\u201d she said.\n\nIn that case, the HealthCare.gov website shows that a family fitting the Wendt profile could get a bronze plan, which covers only 60 percent of health care costs. A bronze plan would have a low monthly premium ($221 for the HMO and $292 for the PPO) but a high deductible ($11,900 for the HMO and $12,700 for the PPO).\n\nEither way, the bronze or silver plans would provide better benefits at less cost than the plan Shannon Wendt currently has.\n\nBlue Cross and Rate Shock There\u2019s one other thing that we know about Wendt\u2019s insurance coverage that is important. She was covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan \u2014 the state\u2019s largest writer of individual health plans \u2014 and the insurer caused a stir in the market when it canceled all of its non-compliant plans except one called \u201cKeep Fit.\u201d That plan was grandfathered in because, the company said in a November 2013 press release, it was \u201cthe only plan in Blue Cross\u2019 individual portfolio to have a 2013 \u2018plan year.\u2019 \u201d When Obama, the Michigan governor and state insurance commissioner all said that insurance companies could re-issue non-compliant plans, Blue Cross declined to do so \u2014 in part because it said it hadn\u2019t raised premiums in the individual market since 2011 in anticipation of phasing them out. The company said in the November press release that to extend all of its non-compliant individual plans would result in a \u201crate shock.\u201d The company said, \u201cKeeping the plans open in 2014 would require a \u2018catch-up\u2019 premium rate increase of 30 percent or more.\u201d They did allow people like the Wendts to transition into the \u201cKeep Fit\u201d plan \u2013 but only through 2014. This is what Wendt means when she writes in her op-ed that she now has \u201ca \u2018grandfathered\u2019 plan that will be canceled at the end of 2014.\u201d Despite the company\u2019s stated desire to prevent \u201crate shock,\u201d Blue Cross members complained that that is exactly what happened. Wendt wasn\u2019t the only one complaining about high rates. A Detroit Free Press story told a similar story about the Mulder family in Wixom, Mich.\n\nDetroit Free Press, Nov. 15, 2013: The Mulder family in Wixom, for instance, received notice last month that their bare-bones Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan policy \u2014 costing $291 a month and carrying a $5,000 deductible \u2014 would end Dec. 31. Given the choice of it and his other options \u2014 one with a $930 monthly premium and another with a cheaper premium but a $17,000 annual deductible. Josh Mulder said he\u2019d rather continue his current policy.\n\nTiffany Jones, a spokeswoman for BCBSM, told us in an email that 140,000 of its members moved from the canceled plans to either the non-compliant Keep Fit plans or ACA-compliant exchange plans. She could not provide us with the average rate change \u2014 increase or decrease \u2014 for those who selected Keep Fit or for those who went on the exchange. In November, BCBSM spokesman Andy Hertzel told Crain\u2019s Detroit Business that about 50 percent of its customers who had non-compliant individual policies were eligible for subsidies.\n\n\u201cMany people could receive better benefits at lower prices\u201d on HealthCare.gov, Hertzel told Crain\u2019s.\n\nShannon and Zach Wendt could have been among those people if they went on the exchange \u2014 but they decided against it.\n\n\u2013 Eugene Kiely\n\nUpdate, April 1: This article has been changed to clarify that federal subsidies are based on adjusted household incomes using the modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, definition of income. Also, one reference to the Wendt\u2019s current plan initially said it had a $17,000 deductible. It has a $10,000 deductible and $17,000 out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-04-02 17:18:27 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "title": "Misleading Anti-Obamacare Message Explored", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/anti-obamacare-ad_n_5072275.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1712924/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1712924/images/o-BARACK-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Misleading Anti-Obamacare Message Explored"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-01 17:18:27 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5072275", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "michigan americans for prosperity,obamacare,anti-obamacare ad michigan,Americans for Prosperity,anti-obamacare ad,Obama Health Care,obamacare michigan", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "michigan americans for prosperity,obamacare,anti-obamacare ad michigan,Americans for Prosperity,anti-obamacare ad,Obama Health Care,obamacare michigan", "published_time": "2014-04-01 17:18:27 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-04-01 17:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fbc\"", "article_summary": "Also on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it?\nEzra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care.\nWhat do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get?\nBut like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody.\nKFF said the couple could purchase, with subsidies, a bronze plan for $220 per month and a silver plan for $345.75 per month \u2014 plus the couple\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum would be limited to no more than $4,500 if they go with the silver plan."}
