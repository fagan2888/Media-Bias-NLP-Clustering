Hanson testifying at an October hearing on assisted suicide at the Massachusetts State House. (NewBostonPost photo by Evan Lips)\n\nBOSTON \u2013 Kristen Hanson remembers the phone call she received on May 13, 2014. It was an emergency medical technician who told her that her husband, J.J., who had appeared completely healthy when he left for work, had suffered a seizure and couldn\u2019t speak. But nurses couldn\u2019t find anything wrong.\n\nAfter hours of tests during which she pushed for an MRI scan, doctors found the life-altering cause of the grand mal seizure: two lesions in J.J.\u2019s brain that were diagnosed as an inoperable, aggressive form of cancer. Doctors told the upstate New York couple that he had just four months to live.\n\n\u201cIt was paralyzing, it was so traumatic. One day everything is perfect, you\u2019re living your dreams \u2026 then all of a sudden they tell you your husband\u2019s going to die,\u201d said Kristen, a former elementary school teacher and current stay-at-home mom with James, her two-year-old son. \u201cAll of a sudden you have to make these huge decisions without really knowing much about the disease.\u201d\n\nToday, 34-year-old J.J.\u2019s cancer is in remission following aggressive treatment. Now the optimistic Marine Corps veteran is fighting for the lives of others.\n\nAfter serving two deployments in the Marines and fighting off brain cancer, J.J. is now battling to save lives as president of the two-year-old, Princeton, N.J.-based advocacy group Patients Action Fund. As part of his work, he travels to speak out against physician-assisted suicide.\n\nLast month, he came to Boston to testify at an Oct. 27 hearing on an assisted-suicide bill pending before the Massachusetts Legislature. In January, state Rep. Louis Kafka (D-Stoughton) reintroduced the measure as House Bill 1991, an \u201cact affirming a terminally ill patient\u2019s right to compassionate aid in dying,\u201d in a fourth attempt in six years to pass it into law. A similar measure that appeared on the 2012 election ballot lost, 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\n\u201cIf this legislation was legal at the time, I could have had doctor-prescribed suicide pills on my nightstand\u201d after being told he\u2019d be dead within about 120 days, J.J. testified at the Public Health Committee hearing on Beacon Hill. \u201cI would have had them with me as I laid in bed during month five and questioned whether life was worth living.\u201d\n\nThe story of Brittany Maynard, a Portland, Oregon, advocate for right-to-die laws, has become the face of the movement. Advocates for \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d contend that individuals should have the right to take control of their own lives and be able to end them as they choose, whether to avoid physical pain or otherwise. Such laws exist in Oregon, Washington, California and Vermont.\n\nMaynard and J.J., who were about the same age and had the same type of cancer, grade-4 astrocytoma, used their experiences in opposite ways. He cites his success in fighting off the disease in making the case that assisted-suicide laws can undermine the will to survive among people with life-threatening illnesses. She ultimately took advantage of the Oregon law and ended her life last year.\n\n\u201cEveryone deals with difficulty in their life in some way or another,\u201d J.J. said. \u201cNot only are you going to die, but you\u2019re going to die fast and it\u2019s going to be painful. What are you going to do with that? That was the question we had to face.\u201d\n\nWhile not everyone would make a similar decision, J.J. and Kristen chose to fight his cancer, which meant searching until they found a doctor willing to operate.\n\nDuring the surgery, doctors found a third tumor and successfully removed all the diseased tissue. J.J. also received painful chemotherapy treatments. Even with the disease in remission, he remains a high-risk patient.\n\nLike many who oppose assisted suicide, J.J. argues that physicians can make diagnostic mistakes and many patients can live for years after a prognosis of imminent death. He is also concerned for patients whose insurers will cover inexpensive lethal drugs but not $4,000-a-month chemotherapy treatments, as Springfield, Oregon, resident Barbara Wagner said she was told in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf 10 percent survive, why can\u2019t I be the 10 percent?\u201d J.J. said. \u201cYou have to try. You have to go for the best-case scenario.\u201d\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nNBPValueoflife\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/30/a-fighter-takes-aim-at-assisted-suicide/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JJ-Hanson-e1453996180408.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "assisted suicide, end of life, legislation, Massachusetts, regulation"}, "description": "Kristen Hanson remembers the phone call she received in 2014.
