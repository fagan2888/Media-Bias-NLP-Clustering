Back in the U.S. several months later, Shoval and his wife started receiving a series of invoices and summaries of benefits, which seemed to add insult to injury. The bills were expensive, the invoices were complex, and what their insurance covered and what it didn\u2019t was confusing.\n\nFrustrated and beginning to get the sense that he wasn\u2019t alone, Shoval stepped down from his job at eBay and co-founded Simplee with Roberto Rabinovich and Tom Tsarfati to help both patients and healthcare systems understand and manage healthcare expenses \u2014 from the comfort of their smartphones.\n\nFast forward to 2013, Simplee is tracking and managing more than $3 billion in patient medical expenses and now processes \u201ctens of millions\u201d in patient payments each year, Shoval tells us. Since launching in 2011, the startup has raised $7.8 million from investors like Greylock IL, The Social+Capital Partnership and Embarcadero Ventures, and today, with adoption continuing, Simplee is announcing that it is adding $10 million in Series B financing, in an investment led by Heritage Group. The company\u2019s existing investors, Social+Capital and Greylock IL, also contributed to the round, bringing its total investment to just under $18 million.\n\nShoval attributes the raise, and the startup\u2019s growth over the last two years, in part, to the rise in consumer-driven healthcare in the U.S. In the big picture this is a positive trend, but it also means that people are increasingly opting into insurance plans that come with the pain of high deductibles \u2014 meaning a larger share is coming out of their own pocket. In fact, Shoval says that the average family in the U.S. pays an additional $4,000 every year \u2014 on top of what they\u2019re already paying for insurance.\n\nThis leads to a scenario in which patients inevitable end up confused and distressed, unsure of exactly what they\u2019re paying for and why. On the other hand, due to the rise in consumer-driven models, hospitals, practices and care providers are having to collect a larger share of bill payments directly from these confused patients. There\u2019s friction on both sides of the transaction, but considering Simple\u2019s origin story, it\u2019s no wonder Shoval and team decided to start with reducing the friction on the consumer side.\n\nTo help patients deal with the hassle of confusing healthcare payments, Simplee created a platform that essentially combined the financial management tools of a platform like Mint.com with a mobile wallet in an effort to simplify bill and expense management, while making it easier to track visits, monitor benefits and pay bills online.\n\nAnd that has been the crux of Simplee\u2019s platform: The fact that, in addition to being able to filter and track expenditures by each family member, Simplee\u2019s mobile apps really act as a payment platform so that users can pay their bills direct, link their spending accounts and set up alerts so that they\u2019re notified when problems with billing arise. This, in particular, is a huge value-add considering the changes that the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d) will bring to this space.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not all the way there in terms of offering support to every patient, today, the app offers coverage for 80 percent of insurance plans in the U.S., and Simplee continues to work to expand the list of insurance providers it supports, the co-founder says.\n\nOn the other side, over the last year, Simplee has stepped up product development on the enterprise, or healthcare systems side of the coin. SimpleePAY, its new B2B-style payment and loyalty platform for hospitals and care providers, which launched earlier this year, has been key to extending its functionality on the provider side.\n\nThe platform allows hospitals to more easily distribute and collect bills and text and email patients simple URLs instead of sending out printed versions, for example. The goal, really, is to enable hospitals to access the same kind of consumer-friendly medical wallet it had made available to its own customers, giving hospitals the ability to offer it to their patients. In turn, the providers can access a more robust set of features aimed at helping them cut down on the costs of paper invoicing, billing and so on, while increasing revenues and delivering new features.\n\nThe startup is already working with partners like El Camino Hospital in Mountain View to enable patient payments online, and today, it announced that Emergency Medicine Associates \u2014 the largest provider of emergency room services in Washington D.C. \u2014 will be deploying SimpleePAY as well.\n\nIn the coming months, Simplee hopes to continue expanding its roster of SimpleePAY customers, leveraging its new strategic investment from the Heritage Group \u2014 an organization that represents hundreds of hospitals across the U.S., investing in solutions that seek to \u201creduce cost, improve outcomes and increase the efficiency of healthcare delivery.\u201d\n\nWith the new funding under its belt, Shoval says that Simplee will look to significantly expand its team of 30, and continue to invest in innovation and growing sales and marketing around SimpleePAY, which has become its chief source of revenue. But, in the end, he says, Simplee will look to stick to its core mission, which is helping both patients and healthcare providers to reduce the complexity of healthcare payments \u2014 even as Obamacare makes that job all the more difficult.\n\nFor more, find Simplee at home here.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/rip-empson/\" title=\"Posts by Rip Empson\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Rip Empson</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ripemp\" rel=\"external\">@ripemp</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "In 2009, Tomer Shoval went on vacation with his family to Mexico, which unfortunately ended on a sour note \u2014 and one with which many travelers can empathize \u2014 they all got sick.
