The North is also holding a Korean-Canadian Christian pastor, who is serving a life sentence for subversion.\n\nKim apologized for trying to steal military and state secrets in collusion with South Koreans, and said he was paid for doing it. He described the acts as aimed at overthrowing the North Korean regime, KCNA said.\n\nPhotographs issued by the North's state news agency showed Kim bowing and wiping away tears.\n\nJapan's Kyodo news agency and China's Xinhua news agency also reported Kim's meeting with media outlets in Pyongyang where he confessed to anti-state activities.\n\nMEMORY STICKS\n\nKim spoke of making contacts with South Koreans to pass secret information contained in USB memory sticks and also images state media said were damaging to the North on data storage cards.\n\nOutside information is strictly controlled in North Korea and ordinary people there often use USB sticks or other portable memory drives to share foreign media.\n\nAn official introducing Kim to the media began the meeting by praising North Korea's nuclear achievements and its leader, Kim Jong Un, said the source in Pyongyang, who had direct knowledge of the meeting.\n\nA defector from the North previously told Reuters that Kim was a Christian pastor who had worked in China and the United States and sent medical aid into the North.\n\nCNN reported in January that Kim was 60 and from Fairfax, Virginia, and that he said he had spied on behalf of South Korea.\n\nKim told media he was born in Seoul in 1953 and moved to the United States when he was 19. He said he set up a business in the North Korean special economic zone of Rason in 2008, KCNA said. He said his two daughters lived in New York and he had siblings in South Korea, it said.\n\nNorth Korea faces the prospect of further international isolation after the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions after its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February.\n\n(Editing by Robert Birsel and James Dalgleish)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A Korean-American man detained in North Korea has confessed to steal", "title": "Korean-American in North Korea confesses to stealing secrets: media", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/25/Korean-American-held-NKorea-confesses-trying-steal-military-secrets-media", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-usa-confession_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/25/Korean-American-held-NKorea-confesses-trying-steal-military-secrets-media", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-usa-confession_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A Korean-American man detained in North Korea has confessed to steal", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A Korean-American man detained in North Korea has confessed to stealing military secrets and plotting subversion with South Koreans, the North's official news agency and foreign media reported on Friday.\nHe said his two daughters lived in New York and he had siblings in South Korea, it said.\nOutside information is strictly controlled in North Korea and ordinary people there often use USB sticks or other portable memory drives to share foreign media.\nNorth Korea faces the prospect of further international isolation after the U.N.
