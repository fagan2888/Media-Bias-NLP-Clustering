One person is dead after their vehicle collided with a traffic sign and a tree Sunday morning near Commons Drive in Destin.

Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) officials say around 2:45 a.m., Brian O'Sullivan of Gulf Breeze was traveling east on U.S. Highway 98 attempting to turn left onto the road adjacent to the Regions Bank when he overcorrected his turn, entered into a median and struck a traffic sign.

His vehicle continued north, and he turned left onto Commons Drive. While on Commons Drive he overcorrected his turn again, and entered into the grass median and then hit a tree.

O'Sullivan was pronounced dead at the scene. FHP says he was not wearing a seatbelt and alcohol could have been a factor.
