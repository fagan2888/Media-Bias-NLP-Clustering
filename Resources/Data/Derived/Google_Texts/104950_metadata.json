Oprah Winfrey, it is said, lives somewhere along the road, on an estate last valued at $50 million; \u201cone of the most beautiful places on earth,\u201d she calls it. \u201cI have a little ritual,\u201d she told a newspaper. \u201cEvery time I pass the front of my house I sing \u2018Jesus Loves Me\u2019.\u201d A quietly marked turn-off leads to Westmont\u2019s campus, 111 acres of an estate built and landscaped in a Mediterranean style, ocean below, mountains above. A streambed meandering down the hill, wooded paths crisscrossing it, stone benches squatting beneath California oaks, eucalyptus, and exotic evergreens collected by the property\u2019s previous owner. The smell of sweet pine and flowers, rose gardens and a dozen different tropical blossoms pouring off balconies and bubbling fountains. It\u2019s the prettiest campus in America; or, in the words of one alumnus, a Presbyterian pastor in San Jose named Ben Daniel, \u201ca very beautiful corner of a dying world.\u201d\n\nBen called after I published an essay about a short time I\u2019d spent living with a Christian conservative movement called the Fellowship, or the Family. The Fellowship is secretive, \u201cinvisible\u201d in its own words, and exclusive, intended not for the masses but for those whom the movement calls \u201ckey men,\u201d particularly in business and politics. Some members speak of \u201cbiblical capitalism,\u201d others of \u201cbiblical law,\u201d but in essence their beliefs are simple: \u201cJesus plus nothing,\u201d they like to say.\n\n\u201cLook at Westmont,\u201d Ben told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeder school.\u201d\n\nWestmont\u2019s motto is \u201cChristus Primatum Tenens,\u201d or, \u201cHolding Christ Preeminent.\u201d Some call it the Wheaton of the West, after Wheaton College in Illinois, which likes to consider itself \u201cthe Harvard of evangelicalism.\u201d Its liberal arts faculty is distinguished and its students generally affluent, many of them drawn from the wealthier suburbs of Southern California. Not Ben. He\u2019d been raised, he said, \u201cbehind the redwood curtain\u201d of rural Northern California. His parents were Jesus freaks, hippies for Christ. In 1986 he went to Westmont to become a preacher, but he understood the job as something more like that of a druid, deciphering God\u2019s works in nature, than that of a megachurch CEO.\n\nBen chose Westmont because his older brother had done a year there, and his divorced father lived in Santa Barbara. But his brother dropped out, his father found the college\u2019s mix of aggressive conservatism and Christianity unsettling, and Ben found himself adrift in a campus culture that revolved around beach parties. Not long after he got there, a group of older students \u201csock and dimed\u201d him: they scooped him up, drove him to the beach, stripped him naked, and left him with a sock to cover his crotch and a dime to make a phone call. Ben had no one to call. He found a couple making out on the beach\u2014Westmont students, it turned out, in violation of campus policies forbidding sexual activity before marriage\u2014and they drove him back to campus.\n\nBen\u2019s father called the dean of students, but as Ben recalls the conversation, the dean had no sympathy for the 18-year-old. He told Ben\u2019s father there were no rules against hazing. (There are now.) Ben\u2019s father was shocked. \u201cYou don\u2019t allow dancing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hazing\u2019s ok?\u201d The dean\u2019s answer, Ben\u2019s father said, was a chuckle and a \u201cYep.\u201d\n\nBen didn\u2019t go to the beach much after that. Instead, he went hiking. He could walk off the campus and right into the Santa Ynez Mountains. When he got to Westmont, they were brown and crackling, ready to ignite, a condition Californians refer to as \u201cgolden.\u201d As the semester progressed, green crept up the hill from the well-irrigated campus. It reminded Ben of fertile Humboldt County. He\u2019d finish classes and set off by himself and walk for hours, thinking about the usual things, girls, and grades, and being lonely, and also Christian things, theology and God and the pressing problem of creation. He\u2019d wanted at one point to be a physicist, but geology was more his speed. He loved the stories of mountains rising and falling and shifting and colliding, the quiet grandiosity of the earth in motion. But the stories made him uneasy, too. They nudged him toward questions he\u2019d never had to ask and to which he had no answers. If the fossil record chronicled life emerging from a primordial soup, what did that mean for the truth of Adam and Eve?\n\nBen\u2019s questions didn\u2019t drive him away from his faith, they propelled him deeper into it. He began writing columns for the student newspaper about faith in the world. Standard social gospel fare, working with the poor, the hypocrisy of affluent Christians, American involvement in the late 1980s dirty wars of Central America. Radical by Westmont standards. And yet nobody could deny Ben\u2019s sincerity, his intensity. He became a student-chaplain, and then, with the encouragement of the head chaplain, a man named Bart Tarman, Ben joined what Tarman called a \u201ccell group,\u201d a group of young men devoted to their faith through their devotion to one another.\n\nBen remembers Tarman telling them they should seal the deal: commit to being a cell group forever. Brothers for life. Such a brotherhood would be stronger than \u201cChristianity,\u201d a term, Ben recalls, that Tarman considered nothing more than a label. They could leave names like that behind. They could leave everything behind. Ben, in fact, should ease off writing for the paper. The brothers should live together. They would be special. The dean of students, Jonathan H. Hess, became one of their mentors. \u201cEvery guy confessed to one another,\u201d Ben remembers. \u201cMostly, we talked about masturbation.\u201d It was a sin, but not as great a sin as women. \u201cIt was supposed to be just men and Jesus.\u201d\n\nBen didn\u2019t last. \u201cI was a failed recruit,\u201d he says. \u201cI fell in love.\u201d Fellowship men were allowed to fall in love, of course, but their romance was to follow a certain order. When Ben tried to explain he told me about a Fellowship man he\u2019d spoken to recently, about to marry. The groom-to-be told Ben he had his priorities straight: 1. His Fellowship mentors. 2. His Fellowship brothers. 3. The Fellowship. 4. His fianc\u00e9. He compared himself to Hosea, the prophet who married a \u201charlot\u201d on God\u2019s command: \u201cGo, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms.\u201d A lesson in humility for the groom, and a chance for the bride to be redeemed. \u201cYou must dwell as mine for many days,\u201d the biblical Hosea told his wife when he bought her in a slave market for 15 pieces of silver and a bushel of barley. \u201cYou shall not play the harlot, or belong to another man.\u201d[1]\n\nBen didn\u2019t want to own his girlfriend. He didn\u2019t want to submit to his mentors. But the Fellowship wanted Ben. The older men invited him to Washington. By now Ben knew his cell was just one of many, that the main work of the organization was not with students in need of grooming but with \u201cfollowers of Christ\u201d in politics, business, overseas. In Washington he attended the Fellowship\u2019s only public event (the Fellowship \u201cworks best when it\u2019s clandestine,\u201d another member told him), the annual National Prayer Breakfast. Public and not-public; the President of the United States is the star speaker and much of Congress attends, but the Breakfast belongs to the Fellowship. They decide who\u2019s invited and where they sit and who attends the week of hotel suite meetings, the dinners, the receptions for generals and contractors and defense ministers around the globe.\n\nThis was not the social gospel. This was not what Ben believed. There was a man there Ben had only read about: a man said to run death squads in El Salvador. That made Ben\u2019s decision easier. He chose the girl. He left the Fellowship behind.\n\nAs the years went on, as he began to pastor his own church, he started wondering more about what he\u2019d been a part of. That led him back to Westmont College; in particular to a man with whom he wanted me to speak to better understand his time with the Fellowship: Dr. Ronald Enroth, a sociologist who studies what he calls \u201cspiritually abusive\u201d religious movements.\n\nEnroth was my first appointment at Ben\u2019s alma mater.\n\n* * *\n\nEnroth was a bearish man, bearded and gruffer in voice than in fact. We met outside the school\u2019s switchboard office, in the mansion at the heart of the campus, and he guided me to a handsome room bordered west and south with walls of windows, where we sat at one end of a long oak table. Enroth had been teaching at Westmont College for 39 years, and it was where he intended to end his working days. \u201cWhy would I leave paradise?\u201d he said. He was fascinated by his college\u2019s history, his evangelical Presbyterian faith, and, recently, the threats to both he perceived in the Fellowship. He\u2019d launched his career with studies of cults, a word, he admitted, that had fallen out of fashion. \u201cNow, we\u2019re supposed to call them \u2018new religious movements,\u2019\u201d he said. But \u201ccults\u201d are what made him. Jesus People USA and the Children of God, the Unification Church, AKA \u201cthe Moonies,\u201d and even the Family\u2014a hippie fundamentalist group famous for \u201cflirty fishing,\u201d recruitment through the implied promise of sex, and not be confused with the Family also known as the Fellowship\u2014provided him with grist for eight books and a reputation that brought speaking fees and courtroom appearances as an expert witness, work that both thrilled and inspired him to further investigations.\n\nThen Enroth turned his methodology inward, toward mainstream evangelicalism itself. Churches That Abuse, as he titled one book, became his obsession, and the phrase \u201cspiritual abuse\u201d his contribution to modern American theology not just as studied in academia but also in popular magazines and on talk shows. Like the discovery of a disease long suspected but ill-defined, the words \u201cspiritual abuse\u201d gave a form and a name to what had until then been just a feeling.\n\nSpiritually abusive movements, Enroth explained, lack the most explicit warning signs by which we know fanaticism and charlatanism. They don\u2019t usually believe in flying saucers, like the 39 suicides of Heaven\u2019s Gate, or homegrown Christs with a taste for classic rock, like the Branch Davidians of Waco. They rarely retreat into compounds, they don\u2019t stockpile weapons. But common to cults, \u201cnew religious movements\u201d gone sour, and old church communities turned abusive, is an emphasis on submission and obedience, what one informant called \u201clearned helplessness,\u201d stumbling upon a common psychological term for a condition of perceived powerlessness that can lead to depression and mental illness.\n\nEnroth ran down a list of characteristics of spiritual abuse: \u201cdisrupted families,\u201d \u201csurveillance,\u201d \u201cspiritual elitism,\u201d ostracism of those who leave. I found myself nodding in recognition. It sounded like what I\u2019d witnessed in the Fellowship. Later, I\u2019d read in Enroth\u2019s work about other aspects that were just as instantly recognizable:\n\n\u2014an emphasis on amorphous \u201cattitudinal sins,\u201d especially \u201crebelliousness\u201d;\n\n\u2014suppression of dissent;\n\n\u2014no institutional checks and balances;\n\n\u2014an aversion to publicity;\n\n\u2014a perception of persecution, the notion that outsiders can never understand;\n\n\u2014a recruitment strategy that, in the beginning at least, denies that there\u2019s anything to which to belong.\n\nEnroth glanced toward the door frequently as he spoke. His voice rose and dipped between indignation and tact. When he settled on one tone he\u2019d tilt his head back and close his eyes and tick off point and counterpoint like a rhythm, petting and tapping the table. His two books on spiritual abuse, Churches That Abuse (1992) and Recovering from Churches that Abuse (1994), won him more notice than the combined work of his three-decade career, and also more attacks. Fellow evangelicals who thrilled to Enroth\u2019s anti-cult crusades grew angry when his diagnoses returned to the house of the faith they shared. Enroth, long at war with a secular academic establishment that prefers the term \u201cnew religious movement\u201d to the pejorative \u201ccult,\u201d found himself embattled among other evangelicals. His tenure at Westmont spanned half the life of the college, he was unmovable; but the quick glances at the door and the resolute recitations of symptoms, signals, and warnings were the results of certain unpleasantnesses to which he had become accustomed. There were things, he said, he couldn\u2019t talk about because his lawyer had told him not to. And there were things, he said, he couldn\u2019t talk about because of his heart. At the height of his career, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery. Afterward, his doctor gave him a choice\u2014his life as an investigator of hostile organizations, or his life, period. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cI have avoided any formal research on the Fellowship, or \u2018the Family.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut still. Students talk. Parents, grandparents, complain. Other faculty members grumble. One man, he said, Jonathan Hess\u2014no longer Westmont\u2019s dean of students but still a fixture in the community\u2014launched a prayer group for Westmont grads who\u2019d remained in the area. During his Westmont tenure, Hess had decried the college\u2019s conventional place in the world. In a 1987 speech to the college, he described Westmont not so much as an educational institution as a kind of training ground dedicated to producing \u201cchange agents\u201d bound by \u201cdeep unity of mind.\u201d The goal? Transformation of the \u201cout there\u201d culture to conform to the \u201cin here\u201d culture. That is, to make the world more like Hess\u2019s vision of Westmont. It was a radical amplification\u2014or perhaps a radical reduction\u2014of Romans 12:2, which reads, \u201cBe ye not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\u201d Hess took a Bible verse that speaks to a believer\u2019s liberty of conscience and turned it toward a hive-minded tautology: \u201cWe will transform culture to the extent that we are a transforming community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be a transforming community to the extent that we are being transformed individually and corporately\u2026. Students will become transformers to the extent that they see and feel us being transformed.\u201d\n\nHess left Westmont and began working on transformation full time. The Fellowship became one of his partners. A first step, as far as Enroth could tell, was to send out a mass mailing to students and alumni asking them for funds to support his new mission. Enroth recalled Hess\u2019s unusual travels over the years. Once he\u2019d told Enroth that he was flying to Peru just so he could spend some time on the plane sitting next to a \u201cSouth American leader\u201d\u2014the Fellowship way of \u201ccoming along side\u201d the powerful people it considers \u201ckey men.\u201d Enroth said Hess became vague when Enroth asked him who the man was, dodged when Enroth asked him who was paying, and directly refused to answer when Enroth asked him what they\u2019d discuss. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make an impact on leaders,\u201d Enroth recalled Hess telling him.\n\nWho\u2019s the \u201cwe,\u201d Jon?\n\nThere is no \u201cwe\u201d; just a group of friends.\n\nSo when the buzz about Hess\u2019s new group started crackling with what Enroth thought might be symptoms of spiritual abuse, he asked his old acquaintance directly if he could learn more. He was evasive, Enroth recalled.\n\nNot much to learn, Ron.\n\nWell, Enroth asked, is it true that it\u2019s a closed group?\n\nEveryone who knew Hess said he had an easy manner. Some women thought he could be creepy, but men understood; Hess was a guy.\n\nThat\u2019s what Enroth remembered Hess telling him.\n\nNo, no. We\u2019re just a group of guys.\n\nWould I be invited? Enroth asked.\n\nWell, no.\n\nOne of Enroth\u2019s neighbors, a mutual friend of both men, a wealthy contractor who told Enroth that he was a big financial contributor to the Fellowship, tried to explain. It wasn\u2019t that Hess was excluding anyone. It was just that\u2014well, Ron would be uncomfortable. These men had grown close together in the Lord. There were things they shared, about their lives, and Ron hadn\u2019t shared such things, and so.\n\nAnother time, Enroth recalled, three young men from his neighborhood approached him while he was gardening. Clean cut, good Westmont grads. \u201cDr. Enroth. We understand you\u2019re going to include the Fellowship in your next book. Hope you\u2019re not going to write about us.\u201d\n\nEvery now and then, \u201cmaybe two or three times a year,\u201d Enroth said, a parent would call him about the Fellowship. They wanted to know if the Fellowship is a cult; Enroth would promise to investigate; and, he said, invariably reassures them that it is not. But as the questions and the complaints piled up over the years, he became less certain. One student told him that the Fellowship\u2019s longtime leader, a man named Doug Coe, had explained to her that certain young people don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d college. A couple called him in distress upon learning that their son, having spent much of the family\u2019s savings on four years at Westmont\u2014comparable in cost to elite secular colleges\u2014had announced that he was called by God to be Coe\u2019s personal driver. \u201cCoe,\u201d said Enroth, \u201cappears to me to be a sort of an evangelical guru.\u201d Another student had gone to Washington to work for the Fellowship. \u201c \u2018These people have good connections,\u2019 \u201d Enroth recalls him explaining. \u201c \u2018They\u2019re going to get me a job. And if I don\u2019t play along, they might make sure I don\u2019t get a job.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from some students that [Coe] discourages the name \u2018Jesus Christ,\u2019\u201d Enroth continued, \u201cthat he tells students, \u2018Don\u2019t use the two terms, Jesus and Christ, together. Just refer to Jesus.\u2019 Jesus minus the Bible, in a sense. They don\u2019t like the word Christian. There\u2019s a reluctance to identify with mainstream Christianity. There\u2019s a sense of spiritual elitism. The Fellowship tells young people this is a way to be closer to God, closer than they can get within Christianity.\u201d\n\nBart Tarman, Ben Daniel\u2019s old cell group mentor and the chaplain of Westmont\u2014a position of real influence at an evangelical college\u2014was proud and open on campus about his Fellowship connections, many of them with rich and powerful people around the world. These relationships constituted what he considered to be true community of Jesus followers, marked not by the \u201cnatural liberty\u201d of an individual to make his or her own choices, but rather, he explained in a recorded talk, \u201ctrue freedom,\u201d as John Winthrop put it, the \u201cliberty to [do] only that which is good.\u201d Tarman was invoking Winthrop\u2019s Puritan ideal of control, applied to the modern world in all its difference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Take a tour of Westmont, a feeder school for the next generation of religious right leaders", "title": "Ditto boys: An elite Christian education", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Take a tour of Westmont, a feeder school for the next generation of religious right leaders", "title": "Ditto boys: An elite Christian education", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/15/jesus_plus_nothing_equals_spiritual_abuse_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/08/anne_rice_can_leave_christianity_but_im_staying.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Take a tour of Westmont, a feeder school for the next generation of religious right leaders", "title": "Ditto boys: An elite Christian education", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/08/anne_rice_can_leave_christianity_but_im_staying.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Sharlet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christianity, Conservatism, Editor's Pick, Editor's Picks, Jesus, Killing the Buddha, Tea Party, The Fellowship, Westmont College", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0933\"", "article_summary": "Just refer to Jesus.\u2019 Jesus minus the Bible, in a sense.\n\u201cLook at Westmont,\u201d Ben told me.\n\u201cI fell in love.\u201d Fellowship men were allowed to fall in love, of course, but their romance was to follow a certain order.\nThe groom-to-be told Ben he had his priorities straight: 1.\nWhen Ben tried to explain he told me about a Fellowship man he\u2019d spoken to recently, about to marry."}
