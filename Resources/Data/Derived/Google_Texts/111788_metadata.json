That's been corrected below.\n\nAt least 2,300 more Boulder County Democrats and 30 more Boulder County Republicans are eligible to participate in their party's March neighborhood precinct caucuses, according to voter registration figures from the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office on Thursday.\n\nMonday, Jan. 4, was the deadline for voters to register and join the Democrats or Republicans in order to be able to cast March 1 caucus votes and be eligible to become delegates to their parties' county, state legislative district, congressional district and state assemblies later in March and April.\n\nDemocrats on Boulder County's registration rolls grew to 102,244 voters from 99,884 as of Dec. 1 on those rolls after Monday's midnight deadline.\n\nBoulder County's registered Republican voters showed a much smaller increase, to 44,271 this week from 44,240 on Dec. 1.\n\nDropping in the county's official registration rolls between Dec. 1 and this week were the numbers of voters identifying themselves as unaffiliated with any political party, decreasing to 98,268 from 99,694.\n\nAlso showing decreases since Dec. 1 were the numbers of Boulder County voters affiliated with smaller parties, which won't be holding March 1 caucuses. Libertarians dropped to 2,588 from 2,663, for example, while the Green Party's registered voters fell to 1,342 from 1,453. The American Constitution Party's voters fell to 287 voters from 293.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMircalla Wozniak, a spokeswoman for the Clerk and Recorder's Office, said there may yet be a few additions to the number of people who revised their registration by midnight Monday, since the county may not yet have received a few mailed-in voter registration change forms that were postmarked by midnight Monday.\n\nWhile precinct caucuses typically are lightly attended, even in some presidential election years, they \u2014 and the assemblies that follow \u2014 are the traditional path for picking most of the Republican and Democratic candidates who will appear on those parties' June primary ballots. Some candidates choose to bypass the caucus-and-assembly process and petition onto the major parties' primary ballots.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29361453/march-caucuses-loom-boulder-county-voters-swell-parties", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "At least 2,300 more Boulder County Democrats and 30 more Boulder County Republicans are eligible to participate in their party's March neighborhood precinct caucuses, according to voter registration figures from the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office on Thursday.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29361453:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-09T13:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29361453/march-caucuses-loom-boulder-county-voters-swell-parties", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "At least 2,300 more Boulder County Democrats and 30 more Boulder County Republicans are eligible to participate in their party's March neighborhood precinct caucuses, according to voter registration figures from the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office on Thursday.", "title": "As March caucuses loom, Boulder County voters swell parties' ranks"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "At least 2,300 more Boulder County Democrats and 30 more Boulder County Republicans are eligible to participate in their party's March neighborhood precinct caucuses, according to voter registration figures from the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office on Thursday.", "title": "As March caucuses loom, Boulder County voters swell parties' ranks", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29361453/march-caucuses-loom-boulder-county-voters-swell-parties", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-09T13:00:00-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "As March caucuses loom, Boulder County voters swell parties' ranks", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarStaff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2016-01-11T14:34:36-0700", "endDate": "2026-01-08T18:03:50-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2016-01-08T18:08:18-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "At least 2,300 more Boulder County Democrats and 30 more Boulder County Republicans are eligible to participate in their party's March neighborhood precinct caucuses, according to voter registration figures from the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office on Thursday.\nAlso showing decreases since Dec. 1 were the numbers of Boulder County voters affiliated with smaller parties, which won't be holding March 1 caucuses.\nBoulder County's registered Republican voters showed a much smaller increase, to 44,271 this week from 44,240 on Dec. 1.\nLibertarians dropped to 2,588 from 2,663, for example, while the Green Party's registered voters fell to 1,342 from 1,453.\nDemocrats on Boulder County's registration rolls grew to 102,244 voters from 99,884 as of Dec. 1 on those rolls after Monday's midnight deadline."}
