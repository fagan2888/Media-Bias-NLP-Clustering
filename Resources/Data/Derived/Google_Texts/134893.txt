Las Vegas, NV (AP/KTNV) - Ted Cruz addressed 500 members of the Republican Jewish Coalition Saturday in Las Vegas.



Fresh off a win in Colorado where Cruz got 34 delegates, the Texas senator is confident he can defeat Donald Trump.



"What Wisconsin means is Donald's paths to 1,237 is almost impossible," said Cruz, who also won in Wisconsin last week. "It means the odds of going to a contested convention are much, much higher. If we go into a contested convention, we're gonna have a ton of delegates, Donald is gonna have a ton of delegates, and it's going to be a battle in Cleveland."



Both of Cruz's rivals for the GOP presidential nomination, Trump and John Kasich, declined invitations to attend the Republican Jewish Coalition event.



If he becomes president, Cruz promised to repeal "every word" of the Affordable Care Act, abolish the IRS and cut other federal agencies.
