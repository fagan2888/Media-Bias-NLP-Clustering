However, the House passed a continuing resolution to fund the government yesterday that included a reauthorization of the bank until June 30.\n\nThe Senate could vote on the measure as early as this afternoon, but it is unknown whether the Democrat-controlled chamber will pass the continuing resolution with Ex-Im\u2019s short-term reauthorization or attempt to extend the bank\u2019s life beyond next summer.\n\n>>> Politically Connected: Ties Link Embattled Government Bank, Well-Heeled Consultants\n\nGreenspan joins a list of Ex-Im opponents who range from self-described progressives such as pioneering consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., to House conservatives such as Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nPresident Obama opposed the bank as a senator in 2008, calling it \u201ca fund for corporate welfare,\u201d but supported the agency\u2019s reauthorization two years ago and came out in support of it again this year.\n\nAdvocates argue that the New Deal-era agency helps small businesses compete in the global market and creates jobs at home. Obama and other proponents such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., contend that because other nations operate government-run export credit agencies, the United States would be at a competitive disadvantage if Ex-Im were to be shuttered.\n\nHowever, the agency\u2019s foes, led by Hensarling, argue that it is an engine for corporate welfare and cronyism, helping politically connected corporations such as Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric.\n\n>>> Main House Foe of Export-Import Bank \u2018Swallows Hard\u2019 at 9-Month Reprieve\n\nGreenspan, first appointed to head the Federal Reserve by President Ronald Reagan, said that eliminating export subsidies would boost the global economy, but noted that politics often trump good policy.
