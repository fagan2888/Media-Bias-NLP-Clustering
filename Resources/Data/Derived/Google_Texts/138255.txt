An email lists income tax increases that take effect this year and that were all passed under the Affordable Care Act without Republican votes.

The facts: This is the same email received by many last year, which we wrote had some bogus numbers (check it out at http://tinyurl.com/mo4sgl3). In addition, none of these “increases” took effect on Jan. 1, 2015, (or on Jan. 1, 2014, as last year’s viral emails purports), and not one — except for a new addition in this year’s viral email — had anything to do with the Affordable Care Act.

It’s also inaccurate that no Republicans voted in favor of the taxes. In fact, the tax increases listed in the original email were part of the “fiscal cliff” package that passed Congress with bipartisan support, according to FactCheck.org and numerous media outlets.

Again, the recent email with the effective date of Jan. 1, 2015, has the exact same “tax increases” as last year’s Jan. 1, 2014, email — except for one addition.

Here’s what the email states (with the facts according to FactCheck.org):

■ Top income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% (it happened more than 2 years ago for singles making more than $400,000 a year or couples making more than $450,000).

■ Top income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% (FactCheck.org figured this as the combination of federal income tax and the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, which has never been 52.2%).

■ Capital gains tax went from 15% to 28% (actually, it went to 20%).

■ Dividend tax went from 15% to 39.6% (it went to 20% in 2013 with the same incomes as the tax bracket).

■ Estate tax went from 0% to 55% (the rate is indexed for inflation each year and is still 0% for incomes under $5.43 million per individuall in 2015)

The one new claim says, “Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%.”

The Medicare tax increase was part of the Affordable Care Act — the only tax listed in the email that was — but it took effect in January 2013, not this year, as FactCheck.org notes. And it applies only to those who earn more than $250,000 for married couples who file jointly, $125,000 for married couples who file separately and $200,000 for all others.
