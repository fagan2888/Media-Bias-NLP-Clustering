Richard Hanna (R-NY) greatlyboosted her name ID around the Upstate New York district. ThroughTVads and liberal Super PACs, Hanna, who currently has a 52 lifetimeACU rating, is attacking Tenney as a \u201ctax and spend liberal\u201d andas someone who is aligned with the liberal Democratic New YorkAssembly Speaker Sheldon (Shelly) Silver.\n\n\u201cThe only place I\u2019m not well knownis Courtland, Broome, and Tioga. That\u2019s where I\u2019m trying to buildname ID is down there, but Richard actually built my name ID. NowIhave to make it positive and get the vote out,\u201d she told BreitbartNews on Saturday.\n\nTenney, who graduated ColgateUniversity with Monica Crowley, received the big endorsementsrecently from other Fox News Channel luminaires Sean Hannity andMichelle Malkin, Erick Erickson, and Laura Ingraham.\n\nTenney explained, \u201cI have to counter[the attack ads]. So now that I\u2019ve got Hannity and Laura Ingrahamand Michelle Malkin and some of the others have came out likeRedState.com\u2018s Erick Erickson\u2013a whole bunch of them\u2013so now [thevoters are thinking], \u2018What\u2019s going on? Who\u2019s telling the truthhere?'\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a TV ad that says I neverraised taxes. I\u2019m the number one conservative in New York. I\u2019vegot the endorsement of the Conservative Party and he\u2019s got liberalPACs. So I just had to counter it, because people kept calling mesaying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something.'\u201d\n\nTenney says Hanna\u2019s attacks on her asa liberal lawmaker are absurd. Hanna claims that Tenney voted toraise New York sales and property taxes, for example, butaccordingto Tenney she is unable to raise sales and property taxes in theAssembly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been running an ad thatsays I\u2019m a tax and spend liberal and that I\u2019m in the tank forShelly Silver\u2013that I raised sales tax and property taxes. We don\u2019tdo sales and property taxes by the state. Those are localgovernments. [The ads] are just completely fraudulent. [The attack adssay] I\u2019m with Shelly Silver and that I\u2019m a liar. It just goes onand on like they did with David Brat.\u201d\n\nTenney says Hanna\u2019s ads take advantageof the sparse knowledge many have about how bills are moved fromlocal governments around the Empire state to the state capitol inAlbany.\n\n\u201cState government in New York is alot different than DC. We ratify local bills. If a village wantstouse lever voting machines in a local election, for example, wehaveto approve that. It\u2019s a local bill,\u201d she said. Noting theDemocratic majority (108 to 42) in the state\u2019s lower chamber, sheremarked, \u201cSo every bill that comes out of the [assembly],obviously, Shelly votes yes on. It wouldn\u2019t come out if it weren\u2019ta yes vote, and out of a thousand bills, we do about 850 or 900 [that] are local bills and are non-substantive bills.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Tenney pointed out that she was the first Republican to call for Silver\u2019s resignation as Speaker, when Democratic Assemblyman Vito Lopez was forced out of office after he was accused of groping and intimidating young female staffers in a 2012 sexual harassment scandal. The New York State GOP, local media, as well as a New York Democratic lawmaker called upon Silver to resign when evidence surfaced the NY Democratic Assembly Speaker appeared to cover up the scandal long before it surfaced. Silver, however, resisted and stayed in his position.\n\nSimilar to Virginia Republicancandidate for Congress David Brat\u2019s campaign, Tenney\u2019s camp ishelped by enthusiastic local Tea Party groups, Tenney says. Sheattended a number of Tea Party events in 2010 when Hanna ran forCongress a second time and won.\n\n\u201cAt that time when I was at Tea Partyrallies, 90 percent of them were all Marines or veterans who careabout our Constitution\u2013less government, less taxes. There weren\u2019tall these peripheral issues. That\u2019s what they were reallyinterested in, so I don\u2019t know why the national Republicans\u2026 just completely maligned and denigrated their base.\u201d\n\nShe went further, \u201cMost of the coreTea Party people are not these wacky people. They\u2019re just regularveterans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo [the local Tea Party groups] havebeen really gangbusters helping me. They\u2019re doing some fun stuff\u2013like tomorrow we\u2019re doing a RINO hunt. They\u2019re having a blast.They love getting people out. They\u2019re really excited. They\u2019vebeen great. They\u2019ve been really nice. They helped me get [petitionballot] signatures and making phone calls. They\u2019re going door todoor. They\u2019re very motivated, and they haven\u2019t been motivated in awhile, because Richard just didn\u2019t do anything for them.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tenney entered the GOPprimarymuch later than most candidates, an issue that some in the NY GOPthink may have hurt elevating her name ID, Tenney neverthelesscontinues forward with meet and greets as well as telephone townhalls.\n\n\u201cI did a town hall the day before.I\u2019m just meeting people everywhere, and a lot of the time thepeopleat the meet and greets are Republican Committee people who aredisgusted with Richard, because they didn\u2019t know what his recordwas.\u201d\n\nTenney says GOP county chairmen aresupporting Hanna, however, and are \u201cdoubling down.\u201d She said,supporting him. One guy told me, \u2018If Obama was a registeredRepublican, [the NY County Chairmen] would be telling everyone tovote for Obama.'\u201d\n\nTenney appears unconcerned about aMcLaughlin and Associates poll released in March showing Hannatrouncing her with over 70 percent of likely GOP voters supportinghim.\n\n\u201cIf you look at that poll, they didn\u2019trelease the rest of it. I got Mark Weiner to look it up. In thatpoll, 45 percent of the people were unaware of me, and thatwas a large reason for the low numbers,\u201d said Tenney. \u201cLast time,\u201d she said, referring to the 2012 GOP primary,somuch advertising that\u2019s going into it that wasn\u2019t going into itbefore.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tenney continues to challengeHanna to a debate, the GOP Congressman refuses to not only faceherbut be near her at public events, Tenney said, noting he hascontinued an aggressive practice of maintaining several armslengthsfrom the Tea Party challenger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Claudia Tenney Hopes to Ride David Brat Wave to Victory over Richard Hanna", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Claudia Tenney Hopes to Ride David Brat Wave to Victory over Richard Hanna", "title": "Claudia Tenney Hopes to Ride David Brat Wave to Victory over Richard Hanna - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Top-Races/claudia-tenney-townhall-twitter.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/22/claudia-tenney-hopes-to-ride-david-brat-wave-to-victory-over-richard-hanna/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Claudia Tenney Hopes to Ride David Brat Wave to Victory over Richard Hanna", "creator": "@kerrypicket", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Top-Races/claudia-tenney-townhall-twitter.jpg", "title": "Claudia Tenney Hopes to Ride David Brat Wave to Victory over Richard Hanna - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Laura Ingraham, Richard Hanna,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Richard Hanna", "published_time": "2014-06-22T14:14:33-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Similar to Virginia Republicancandidate for Congress David Brat\u2019s campaign, Tenney\u2019s camp ishelped by enthusiastic local Tea Party groups, Tenney says.\nSheattended a number of Tea Party events in 2010 when Hanna ran forCongress a second time and won.\nThey\u2019re just regularveterans.\u201d\u201cSo [the local Tea Party groups] havebeen really gangbusters helping me.\nHanna claims that Tenney voted toraise New York sales and property taxes, for example, butaccordingto Tenney she is unable to raise sales and property taxes in theAssembly.\nNew York Republican AssemblywomanClaudia Tenney says she is grateful that political attack ads byherCongressional primary opponent Rep.
