Though progress has been made in improving access to hospice and palliative care over the past decade, the committee identified major gaps: Not enough physicians are proficient in palliative care, providers are reluctant to have direct and honest conversations about end-of-life issues, and there is inadequate financial and organizational support for the needs of ailing and dying patients.\n\nThe Conversation Project, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people talk about their end-of-life issues, cites the facts: Eighty percent of people say if seriously ill, they would talk to their doctor about end-of-life care. Seven percent actually do. Ninety percent say that talking about end-of-life care with their family members is important. Twenty-seven percent have actually done so. Sixty percent say that they don\u2019t want their families to be burdened with tough decisions. Fifty-six percent have not conveyed their wishes to their loved ones.\n\nEnd-of-life-care planning is not currently a routine part of medical care in the US. There are multiple reasons for the lack of conversation about the end of life. Patients and families, because of fear, denial or family conflict, postpone facing the inevitability of death. Many physicians are reluctant, believing it is their duty to do whatever possible to save a life. Then, there are the economic realities. The fee-for-service model of reimbursement has discouraged doctors from talking to their patients about alternatives to dying in the hospital, like hospice and palliative care. Insurance companies won\u2019t reimburse hospitals and physicians for talking about options with their patients.\n\nJenny Gold, reporter for Kaiser Health News, noted that \u201cfive years ago, the health law\u2019s proposal for Medicare to reimburse doctors for counseling patients about living wills and advance directives became a rallying cry for Republican opponents of the law who warned about so-called \u2018death panels.\u2019 The reimbursement provision was removed from the Affordable Care Act before it passed.\u201d\n\nPerhaps change has its best chance at the grassroots level. Minnesota and Wisconsin have been standard-bearers when it comes to making end-of-life planning part of regular care, the byproduct of which has been a reduction in healthcare costs. Over the past three decades, La Crosse, Wisconsin, a small town on the Minnesota border, has been working to educate the entire community to adopt new practices with remarkable results.\n\n\u201cOne of our doctors recently told me that making a plan is just like taking blood pressure or doing allergy tests,\u201d says Bud Hammes, a medical ethicist at Gundersen Health System, one of La Crosse\u2019s two hospital networks. \u201cIt\u2019s just become part of good care here.\u201d\n\nEncouraging end of life planning has been challenging. Lacrosse\u2019s residents were \u201csometimes upset or anxious. \u2018Why are you bringing this up? Is there something wrong with me?\u2019\u201d Hammes says. \u201cThere were lots of strong emotions and this sense that this was only for people at the end of life and dying. We had to work really hard to convince people we wanted every patient to have this discussion.\u201d\n\nThe conversion of the hospital\u2019s practice started small with a pilot study of a small group of 60 patients with kidney failure. Families had the opportunity to discuss options for medical care under a variety of conditions. The program was so successful that Gunderson and the other hospital in town now give any patient in the system the opportunity to plan, not just those facing the ends of their lives.\n\nTo support the initiatives, Gunderson developed a program called Respecting Choices that gives the tools, including a script, to help caregivers have conversations by providing scenarios for discussion where there might be a choice of options. Today, 96 percent of La Crosse residents have an advance directive.\n\nThe effort has proven that patients prefer less aggressive courses of treatment. The Wisconsin Medical Society started to work on bringing the La Crosse model in 2013. (Minnesota had good results when they started doing the same thing a few years earlier.) Over two years, the program has reached 23 health systems. John Maycroft, MMP, the medical society\u2019s director of policy development and initiatives says, \u201cI want to show that this can be done, that it\u2019s something Wisconsin can do and that other medical societies can do. We\u2019re here for Wisconsinites, but we also want to be a national model.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. healthcare landscape is transforming and innovation has become a mandate for sustainability, a mind shift is occurring in how providers are approaching this issue. The IOM report concluded, \u201cHealth system managers, payers, and policy makers, likewise, have a responsibility to ensure that end-of-life care is compassionate, affordable, sustainable, and of the best quality possible.\u201d\u2014G.
