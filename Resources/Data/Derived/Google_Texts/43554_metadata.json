It has been happening all around the country, Brennan reported.\n\n\u201cThere are many thousands of doctors involved,\u201d Dr. Sam Untericht of the New York State Medical Society said.\n\nInsurers are trying to cut doctors who may run up costs, Untericht said.\n\n\u201cThey claim that they that this is a way of cutting costs which they have to do because they are getting a reduction in their reimbursement for the Medicare Advantage plans due to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he told Brennan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I have greater expenses because the patients that I take care of are very ill,\u201d Dr. Hess said.\n\nWar veteran Leonard Goldberg said he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s going to do but said he\u2019ll figure it out somehow.\n\n\u201cEspecially if people are our age, we don\u2019t want to get too excited, we don\u2019t want to get uptight. It\u2019s not as bad as going to Korea during the Korean War, but it\u2019s tough,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nDr. Hess is appealing the decision.\n\nCBS 2 reached out to UnitedHealthcare, but they did not offer a comment.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some are being forced to get a new doctor to remain covered.
