He now has 18 rushing touchdowns on the season, one behind Colorado State running back Kapri Bibbs for most in the nation.\n\nWith the victory, Navy (5-4) is just a win away from qualifying for a bowl game for the 11th time in 12 years.\n\n\u201c(Reynolds) played well,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cHawaii had some good stuff. They had a good game plan defensively, so it took us awhile to try to get our rhythm a little bit. They did a nice job. But Keenan stayed with it. I thought the kid played phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHawaii running back Joey Iosefa returned to the lineup for the first time this season since fracturing his foot and finished with 191 yards on a school-record 35 carries and a touchdown. Sean Schroeder completed 29 of 33 passes for 246 yards with three touchdowns for the Rainbow Warriors (0-9).\n\n\u201cBeing able to get the opportunity that I had to carry the workload was an honor,\u201d Iosefa said. \u201cMy main goal is to hold onto the ball and not give it up to the opposing team, gain as many yards as I can to help out the defense. I could not worry about my foot today because the more I think about it, the more it stops me from being a good runner.\u201d\n\nHawaii has now lost 12 consecutive games on the road dating to 2011 \u2014 the second longest streak in school history.\n\nWith the game tied at 14, an interception by Hawaii\u2019s John Hardy-Tuliau was nullified by a roughing-a-passer penalty on the first drive of the third quarter. Three plays later, Navy fullback Quinton Singleton made them pay with a 12-yard touchdown run.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely the leader,\u201d Singleton said about Reynolds. \u201cHe just inspires everybody. He takes command of the huddle. He puts you in the right place and he\u2019s a great play caller.\u201d\n\nReynolds then scored from 6 yards to increase the lead to 28-14 with 4:39 left in the third quarter. Hawaii went to a no-huddle offense and put together an 18-play, 99-yard drive, capped by a 6-yard run by Iosefa to pull with a touchdown.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Reynolds ran 67 yards to increase the margin back to 35-21. It was the longest play of the season for Navy. Hawaii, however, would not go quietly and cut the margin again on a 6-yard pass from Schroeder to Clark Evans. But once again, Reynolds answered with another 21-yard scoring run to put the game away with 1:36 left.\n\n\u201cThe whole game I thought I was one block away or one missed tackle away from breaking loose,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI just tried to remind myself to stay patient because it was going to come eventually.\u201d\n\nThe Rainbow Warriors entered the game as one of five winless teams in the FBS and didn\u2019t do much to help themselves early against the Midshipmen.\n\nAfter Hawaii\u2019s Donnie King Jr. fumbled a punt on his own 26, Reynolds found Geoffrey Whiteside in the corner of the end zone on the next play for a 7-0 lead with 10:08 left in the first quarter. Hawaii tied the game with 6:21 left in the half on a 40-yard pass from Schroeder to Keith Kirkwood.\n\nNavy retook the lead 14-7 on a 1-yard run by Reynolds, but the Rainbow Warriors knotted the score again on an 8-yard pass from Schroeder to Evans with 45 second left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Rainbow Warriors concluded a 10-day road trip that covered 9,863 miles, six time zones and another 47-10 loss to Utah State.\n\n\u201dIt was a great effort by everyone,\u201d Hawaii coach Norm Chow said. \u201cI thought the team played very well but you cannot make mistakes against a well-disciplined team like Navy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reynolds finished with a career-high 226 yards on 28 carries.
