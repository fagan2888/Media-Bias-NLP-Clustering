While outside, students and staff gathered in frustration.\n\nTeacher Antonio Romo told NBC4 he hasn\u2019t been paid in months and stands to lose his home.\n\nCCA\u2019s president Ron Schaechter took no questions Thursday night, but read from a prepared statement.\n\n\"Our goal is to make an arrangement that allows all students to complete their programs on time, to have their credits accepted and to ensure students are not charged more than what they contracted to pay with CCA,\" Schaechter said.\n\n\"We are discussions with other institutions as we speak. We understand the urgency,\" he added.\n\nThe statement \u2013 reproduced in full below \u2013 continued, saying CCA tried for months to arrange a seamless transition, work that Schaechter said will continue.\n\nOver the past several months, Career Colleges of America has been diligently working to either sell the institution or arrange a teach out with another institution. Although it was not successful with one institution, CCA continues to work with several other institutions and our regulatory agencies to make alternative arrangements that would be in the best interests of the students. Our goal is to make an arrangement that allows all students to complete their programs on time, to have their credits accepted and to ensure that students are not charged more than what they contracted to pay with CCA. We understand the difficulty and distress this has caused for the students, faculty and staff and we remain hopeful that we can still resolve this situation for their benefit. In that regard, we are in discussions with other institutions as we speak. We understand the urgency.\n\nFor the past 23 years, CCA has been committed to providing quality educational services for its students and a positive and productive environment for our staff. Over that time, we have successfully graduated thousands of students. We remain committed to our students, faculty and staff at this difficult time,\n\nRon Schaechter\n\nPresident\n\nCareer Colleges of America", "article_metadata": {"description": "With two campuses in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino, Career Colleges of America is well-known for offering a variety of medical vocational courses.", "title": "Popular Trade School's Abrupt Closure Leaves Students in Limbo", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "With two campuses in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino, Career Colleges of America is well-known for offering a variety of medical vocational courses.", "title": "Trade School's Abrupt Closure Leaves Students in Limbo", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/CCA-Career-Colleges-of-America-Trade-School-Financial-Aid-Students-239539651.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/classroom5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With two campuses in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino, Career Colleges of America is well-known for offering a variety of medical vocational courses.", "title": "Trade School's Abrupt Closure Leaves Students in Limbo", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/CCA-Career-Colleges-of-America-Trade-School-Financial-Aid-Students-239539651.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/classroom5.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "CCA, Career Colleges of America, Trade School, Financial Aid, Students", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "CCA, Career Colleges of America, Trade School, Financial Aid, Students"}, "article_summary": "We remain committed to our students, faculty and staff at this difficult time,Ron SchaechterPresidentCareer Colleges of America\nSome 800 trade school students are without federal financial aid after their campuses abruptly closed.\nWith two campuses in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino, Career Colleges of America is well-known for offering a variety of medical vocational courses.\nWhile outside, students and staff gathered in frustration.\nInside the South Gate campus Thursday night, employees refused to explain why classes were cancelled or if payroll was being made."}
