But it\u2019s very bad news for Hillary Clinton in particular.\n\nClinton is the 2016 Democratic front-runner by a mile. Just about the entire party, most of the media, and virtually all of the big liberal donors assume she\u2019s going to run and clean up in the primaries. Most of them are also bullish on her prospects in the general election, no matter who receives the nod on the Republican side \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nWhereas gerrymandered congressional districts look likely to favor Republicans in the House of Representatives for the foreseeable future, nationwide demographic trends give Democrats the edge in presidential races. Clinton will benefit from that advantage, as well as from a considerable store of good will built up during her time as secretary of state, from fond memories of her husband\u2019s presidency, and from the enthusiasm of those who long to see her become the nation\u2019s first female president.\n\nAll of which makes Hillary a uniquely formidable candidate. At least in the abstract.\n\nWhen it comes to the specific circumstances of the 2016 presidential race, she may be in a much weaker position than her supporters assume.\n\nThe problem has nothing to do with Hillary\u2019s image or record. (\"Benghazi\" will be decisive only to people who would never consider voting for her in the first place.) A presidential campaign can adjust an image and respond proactively to glitches in a candidate\u2019s record. But it can\u2019t do anything about running in the shadow of an unpopular, ineffective president. And that, increasingly, is what it looks like Hillary is going to have to do.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s approval ratings are mired in the low 40s. The signature legislative achievement of his presidency, the Affordable Care Act, remains extremely unpopular \u2014 so much so that the administration keeps putting off implementation of key parts of the law (a move that may well be unconstitutional). When it comes to foreign policy, the U.S. looks bewildered and ineffective in some areas (Russia, Syria) and setting itself up for humiliation in others (Iran, Israel-Palestine).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Congress. Obama has already given up on trying to move legislation through the Republican-controlled House. And in the past few months, he hasn\u2019t even been able to get his executive branch nominees through the Senate, where Democrats in the majority have gone so far as to implement a controversial rule change to block filibusters of most nominations.\n\nWhat\u2019s likely to happen if the Republicans take the Senate in November?\n\nAnswer: nothing.\n\nMeaning that for the last two years of Obama\u2019s presidency, nothing whatsoever will make it through Congress. Republicans will do everything in their power to turn Obama into the lamest lame-duck president in history. And though it may not be fair, that ineffectiveness is likely to drive down Obama\u2019s poll numbers even further.\n\nThat will be the background to Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for the White House. And it could present her campaign with an insoluble conundrum.\n\nThe best possible scenario for a candidate running to succeed a two-term president from the same party is for him to be very popular. That way, the organizing theme of the campaign can be some version of a cheerful \"More of the same!\" (This could have been the key to a strong victory for Al Gore in 2000, had his personal demons and latent hostility to Bill Clinton not driven Gore to distance himself from a popular sitting president and his substantial record of accomplishments.)\n\nBut when the sitting president is unpopular, the candidate is trapped. (Don\u2019t take it from me. Just ask John McCain.) She can\u2019t offer more of the same, because no one wants that. But neither can she directly denounce the president for his missteps and promise to take the country in a dramatically different direction, since doing so would seem disloyal to both him and their party. In the specific case of Obama, there\u2019s the added complication that he remains extremely popular in the African-American community, which Hillary can\u2019t risk alienating.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican candidate will have maximum leeway to attack the unpopular president relentlessly, tying the candidate to him through their shared party affiliation, as well as a resume showing four years of loyal service to his administration.\n\nTo which Hillary can respond by saying...what, exactly?\n\nPresumably some version of \"Yes, but.\"\n\nWhich doesn\u2019t make for a particularly rousing campaign slogan.\n\nMaybe it won\u2019t come to that. Maybe the Democrats will hold the Senate. Maybe Obama\u2019s approval ratings will bounce back. Maybe some global event will alter the downward trajectory of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut at the moment, none of those scenarios seem as likely as one in which Hillary is forced to fight an uphill battle with the dead weight of an unpopular president strapped to her back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/448886/why-barack-obama-biggest-obstacle-hillary-clinton-presidency", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/58345_article_full.jpg?itok=aYyZg5JM", "type": "article", "description": "If she chooses to run, she'll have to campaign in the shadow of an unpopular president", "title": "Why Barack Obama is the biggest obstacle to a Hillary Clinton presidency"}, "twitter": {"description": "If she chooses to run, she'll have to campaign in the shadow of an unpopular president", "creator": "@DamonLinker", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/58345_article_full.jpg?itok=aYyZg5JM"}, "title": "Why Barack Obama is the biggest obstacle to a Hillary Clinton presidency", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, Politics, opinion", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-25T06:22:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab59\"", "article_summary": "In the specific case of Obama, there\u2019s the added complication that he remains extremely popular in the African-American community, which Hillary can\u2019t risk alienating.\nRepublicans will do everything in their power to turn Obama into the lamest lame-duck president in history.\nBut it\u2019s very bad news for Hillary Clinton in particular.\nBut it can\u2019t do anything about running in the shadow of an unpopular, ineffective president.\nAll of which makes Hillary a uniquely formidable candidate."}
