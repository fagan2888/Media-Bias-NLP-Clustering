A former Center for Disease Control and Prevention director said Saturday that containing the Ebola virus is “clearly going to take months.”

Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, vice president for global health at Emory University and a former CDC director, told NBC news that this outbreak would take much longer to contain than previous ones because the virus has spread to urban areas in four different countries.

Dr. Koplan told reporters that containing this outbreak will take “more effort, more personnel and more equipment.”

This particular outbreak is more challenging to contain than previous cases because it has taken root in densely populated urban areas, Dr. Koplan explained, saying the spread is, “not going to turn around overnight.”

On Friday the World Health Organization declared the Ebola crisis in West Africa, the largest and longest outbreak ever recorded, to be an international public health emergency.
