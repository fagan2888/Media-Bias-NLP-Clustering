But, James does not expect the Fed to raise rates this month, even if the monthly jobs report on Friday is encouraging.\n\nAt 12:44 p.m. ET (1744 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 286.87 points, or 1.74 percent, at 16,803.37.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX was up 35.85 points, or 1.86 percent, at 1,968.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC was up 99.44 points, or 2.18 percent, at 4,657.39.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow were on track for their best one-day percentage gain since Feb. 12.
