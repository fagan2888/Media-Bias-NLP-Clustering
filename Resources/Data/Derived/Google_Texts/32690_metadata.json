On the other hand, both Clintons appear to be captives of the same economic class Liberals seek to contain, and the sourcing of funds for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation while she was Secretary of State becomes more scandalous by the minute.\n\nIn addition, Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq and is on record as being more \"hawkish\" in pursuing foreign policy than President Obama. She has favored the financial elites over common folk in previous incarnations; and, she is a latecomer in objecting to the militarization of police in the U.S., as well as the not so latent racism practiced throughout the country. Clinton appears to be paranoid and secretive, voting for the Patriot Act in 2001 and again in 2005.\n\nIn the meantime, despite all of the well-deserved cynicism in regard to their candidate, Liberals are advised to take advantage of Clinton's campaign initiative by trying to pin down her progressive \"creds\" as much as possible at a moment in time when it is clearly in her interest to allow them to do so, because it is at this point in the campaign maneuvering that Republicans will do everything possible to tear her down before the campaign begins in earnest.\n\nAnswering policy questions might actually be a welcome respite for her. So, while we listen to the issues of political dynasty and every misdeed the Clintons have committed -- slavishly pursuing money, the issues surrounding the Benghazi tragedy and the erased emails from her personal server, Liberals may well be able to burnish their own policy concerns.\n\nSo what are the questions, and how should they be posed? Starting with her professed desire to help the middle class in this country means changing the tax code to resort the deck on income distribution. The following questions apply, and they can be asked at any forum at which she appears and by anyone who chooses to reprint this list.\n\nCandidate Clinton, would you?\n\nIncome Inequality\n\n\n\n1.

Develop a Satisfaction Index to track the Consumer Price Index, and use it as a measure to determine government policy?\n\nThe list may be long, and there may be little time or opportunity to confront Clinton with policy questions, however, the more she is given the opportunity and shown the need to define a vision for America that approximates the Liberal agenda, the better off she, and we, will be in the ultimate campaign against a candidate mouthing sound bites to cover commitments to wealthy donors. Since Clinton is the commanding frontrunner -- and should she win -- Liberals need to do the best they can to define her in ways that become policy.\n\nFollow David Russell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Davidrus", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals are confronted with a dilemma: They are deeply troubled by the candidacy of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but she is the overwhelmi...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-04-27 16:10:01 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Liberals are confronted with a dilemma: They are deeply troubled by the candidacy of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but she is the overwhelmi...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-russell/madam-secretary-we-have-some-questions_b_7147478.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "Davidrus", "description": "Liberals are confronted with a dilemma: They are deeply troubled by the candidacy of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but she is the overwhelmi...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-26 16:10:01 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7147478", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Presidential election,liberal agenda,pulbic policy,Hillary Clinton,Democrats policy platform,Issues for 2016,2016 nominees", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Presidential election,liberal agenda,pulbic policy,Hillary Clinton,Democrats policy platform,Issues for 2016,2016 nominees", "published_time": "2015-04-26 16:10:01 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-26 05:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The following questions apply, and they can be asked at any forum at which she appears and by anyone who chooses to reprint this list.\nAnswering policy questions might actually be a welcome respite for her.\nSo what are the questions, and how should they be posed?\nSupport campaign finance reform by establishing public support and eliminating private contributions?\nReframe the national policy in the Middle East to containment, not involvement?"}
