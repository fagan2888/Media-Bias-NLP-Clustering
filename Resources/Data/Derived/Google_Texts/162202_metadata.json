Wearables and the quantified self continued to grab headlines, from the de-emphasis of the Nike Fuel Band to the launch of Runkeeper\u2019s Breeze activity sensor app to the backlash against attempts to feminize trackers by making them pretty. The Affordable Care Act continued to change healthcare, most notably when state insurance exchanges became live. And \u201cbig data\u201d was a phrase on many people\u2019s lips, with major healthcare players such as the Mayo Clinic and the MD Anderson Cancer Center partnering with IBM\u2019s Watson to bring big data to the bedside.\n\nWhat will 2015 bring? To find out, I spoke with Devin Gross, CEO, and Greg Blew, Chief Creative Officer and VP of Product Management, of Emmi Solutions, a health care technology company focused on helping providers empower people to be active in their own care. Gross and Blew identified three major themes that they believe will dominate the 2015 landscape:\n\nBig data gets personal. Healthcare has lagged behind other industries such as banking and retail in its use of big data to predict people\u2019s behavior and provide personalized outreach. Gross thinks this is about to change. \u201cWe look at the world as consumers,\u201d he says, noting that data can be pulled together in service of \u201cindividuals taking greater control of their care and their self.\u201d Wearables are certainly one piece of the growing data pool, alongside the same type of consumer data that other industries have used for years. Passive data and data from \u201cthe internet of things\u201d are other new sources of information about individual behavior and characteristics that may also play a role in helping health care organizations understand their end users.\n\nEngaging patients across a lifespan. To date, many interventions focus on acute medical episodes in a patient\u2019s life, such as a diagnosis of an illness or a hospitalization for a surgical procedure. However, Gross and Blew predict that widespread changes in the health care system will require organizations to build a relationship with patients. Coinciding with this change will be the availability of a deepened pool of data and sophisticated analytics to segment populations, two factors essential to making the conversations more meaningful and valuable. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to throw something generic over the fence and expect people to take action or trust that you know and understand them as a person,\u201d says Blew. The health care organizations that come out on top will be the ones who understand this and figure out how to do it at scale. Technology will play a role but keeping the conversations personalized is key, an approach that Emmi is taking with their own product roadmap.\n\nAs to concerns about how patients will react when health care companies have information about their consumer activities or other non-health behaviors, Blew says \u201cbuilding trust takes time but if you do it right, the sharing of information becomes natural. The exchange of data between patients and providers is private and personal but it\u2019s also really important to both parties to make sure they\u2019re each getting the best out of that relationship.\u201d And that relationship also \u201chinges on being able to talk to people as a person and not just a member of a population that they can talk to the exact same way.\u201d When that happens, Gross adds, the \u201cconversation transforms to being about the person and not about the problem.\u201d\n\nIncreased transparency for consumers. Several factors make increased transparency a likely fact for 2015. First, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, many people are paying real attention to their health insurance purchases for the first time. Blew notes that now, \u201cpeople can see what they\u2019re paying and that means something to them.\u201d Second, the proliferation of data sources about any one individual makes some transparency necessary to come down on the right side of the privacy line.\n\nThe three trends identified by Gross and Blew dovetail together nicely. One can imagine a rich tapestry of consumer data used to craft a personalized, technology-driven intervention that recognizes unique characteristics of an individual in a way that helps a person feel understood but within their level of comfort. The details of how that would work are to be determined, but the vision is there: The technologically engaged patient.\n\n\u201cIf we can begin tailoring the data under the quantified self umbrella with transparency, you\u2019re really changing the dynamics of the system,\u201d promises Gross.\n\nBoth Gross and Blew are optimistic about the future of health technology, citing the strong foundation laid in the areas of wearable technology, big data, and health care infrastructure. Gross believes that \u201ctrying to leverage what exists rather than replacing it is key,\u201d reminding us that the while the current system is imperfect, it\u2019s also complex and entrenched. The key is not to jettison the current system as much as use its components in more innovative ways to improve outcomes. \u201cPeople are figuring out that the data alone doesn\u2019t change behavior,\u201d Gross says.\n\nWhat are your predictions for health technology in 2015?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The year 2014 brought several trends in health technology.
