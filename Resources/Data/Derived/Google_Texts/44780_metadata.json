At least 345 transactions were announced in Q4:14, up 1% compared with the previous quarter. Spending hit $138.3 billion, an increase of 119% compared with the $63.1 billion in Q3:14, according to Health Care M&A News.\n\nThe Health Care M&A Market \u2013 Deal Volume by Sector Q4:14 Q3:14 Q4:13 Sector Deals Deals Change Deals Change Services Behavioral Health Care 5 4 25% 3 67% Home Health and Hospice 19 15 27% 18 6% Hospitals 31 20 55% 17 82% Laboratories, MRI and Dialysis 6 8 -25% 9 -33% Long-Term Care 84 81 4% 65 29% Managed Care 4 5 -20% 4 0% Physician Medical Groups 16 14 14% 20 -20% Rehabilitation 6 5 20% 7 -14% Other 36 36 0% 15 140% Services Subtotal 207 188 10% 158 31% Technology Biotechnology 45 27 67% 32 41% eHealth 31 34 -9% 24 29% Medical Devices 27 26 4% 30 -10% Pharmaceuticals 35 67 -48% 47 -26% Technology Subtotal 138 154 -10% 133 4% Grand Total 345 342 1% 291 19% Source: Health Care M&A News, January 2015\n\nThe previous record for fourth-quarter deal volume was set in December 2012, at 318 transactions. The previous high-water mark for spending was for $82.2 billion, set in the fourth quarter of 2006.\n\nFull-year totals for 2014 also broke previous records for the number of deals and the dollars spent. At least 1,299 transactions were announced last year, an increase of 26% over 2013\u2019s total of 1,035 transactions. The previous record for most transactions in a year was set in 1997, at 1,287.\n\nSpending reached new heights, up to $387.4 billion in 2014, and an increase of 137% over 2013\u2019s total of $163.7 billion. The new record far outstrips the prior one, set in 2006, of $268.5 billion.\n\n2014 was the year of the drug deal, as the Pharmaceutical sector accounted for 55% of the year\u2019s total spending ($213 billion) and 14% of the deal volume (188 transactions). The figures would be even higher if two transactions\u2014Pfizer Inc.\u2019s $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca and AbbVie\u2019s $54.7 billion offer for Shire plc\u2014had not terminated.\n\nLong-Term Care also broke earlier records, with approximately 290 transactions and $25.7 billion in spending. This sector has been on a hot streak since late in 2013, when 225 deals were publicly announced. Last year\u2019s combined total for spending easily surpassed the $22.6 billion record set in 2006.\n\n\u201cUncertainty over the effects of the Affordable Care Act has been replaced by exuberance,\u201d said Lisa E. Phillips, editor of Health Care M&A News. \u201cThe cost of debt remained cheap and equity was easy to raise. As growth slowed in other countries, health care became an attractive target for U.S. investors.\u201d\n\nM&A activity is likely to keep booming in the first half of 2015. \u201cAmericans continue to enroll in healthcare plans through the exchanges, which is good news for providers and payers,\u201d Ms. Phillips said. \u201cWe see some uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, not if. And the U.S. Supreme Court will release its decision in King v. Burwell by the end of June, which could disrupt enrollments through Healthcare.gov. Again.\u201d\n\nFor more information on The Health Care M&A Information Source or Health Care M&A News, or for a membership to any of Irving Levin Associates\u2019 services, please call 800-248-1668.
