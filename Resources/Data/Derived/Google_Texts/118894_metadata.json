But what about the candidates?\n\nA recent Gallup Poll found that nearly 70 percent of our nation\u2019s small-business employers believe the presidential candidates are not dealing with the issues most important to them.\n\nIn yet another Gallup Poll, a staggering 75 percent of Americans \u201cbelieve corruption is \u2018widespread\u2019 in the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot incompetence, but corruption,\u201d writes Jim Clifton, Gallup\u2019s chairman and CEO.\n\n\u201cThis alarming figure has held steady since 2010, up from 66 percent in 2009,\u201d the year Barack Obama became president.\n\n\u201cThis sense of corruption probably contributes to much of the extreme anxiety and unrest we see today,\u201d Clifton adds. \u201cStudents and citizens generally have lost faith in their national institutions \u2014 the biggest and most powerful of which is, of course, the federal government.\u201d\n\nThis has manifested itself in our electorate. In the 2012 presidential election, some 5 million fewer voters turned out than voted in 2008. Still more alarming, the 2014 midterm congressional elections had the lowest turnout in 72 years (36.3 percent).\n\nThat\u2019s a deeply depressing figure to remember the next time you hear anyone complain about the people who run Congress.\n\n\u201cAt alarming levels, citizens \u2014 when invited to participate directly in their own democracy \u2014 are taking a pass and staying home. Or taking their frustrations to the streets,\u201d Clifton says.\n\nCertainly that is what is fueling Donald Trump\u2019s rise to the brink of being nominated for the presidency at this summer\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland. And that has drawn millions of working-class Americans and younger people to Bernie Sanders\u2019 delusional crusade to transform our market economy into a cradle-to-grave socialist experiment.\n\nYou won\u2019t hear this on the nightly network news, but the Obama economy\u2019s dismal growth rate has been running at an average rate of about 2 percent a year since it plunged into the Great Recession.\n\nIn the last three months, the economy barely grew at a minuscule 0.5 percent, and it is considered by many to still be in recovery.\n\nCompare that to the Reagan recovery when his tax cut policies ended the 1981-82 recession in two years. The economy grew over the next six years at an average annual rate of nearly 4 percent.\n\nBut under Obama, \u201cJobs haven\u2019t come back,\u201d Clifton bluntly points out in his blog on this week\u2019s Gallup website. \u201cAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of the total adult population that has a full-time job has been hovering around 48 percent since 2010 \u2014 the lowest full-time employment level since 1983. This is why the middle class has been dangerously shrinking.\u201d\n\nAnd this is why it is premature to believe Hillary Clinton is going to beat Donald Trump in November, certainly not in a landslide. Not while Obama\u2019s economic record is being roundly criticized by small-business owners; millions of workers are trapped in low-wage, part-time jobs; and the economy has all but stopped growing.\n\n\u201cObama has (on average) managed 1.7 percent GDP growth, falling family incomes, and nearly 7 million men between 25 and 54 that don\u2019t even try to find a job,\u201d writes University of Maryland economist Peter Morici.\n\nClinton, who has never uttered a critical word of this president\u2019s failed record, is running on more of the same: higher taxes on wealthier Americans, income redistribution, and a raft of more business regulations that are killing our economy and crushing job creation.\n\n\u201cClinton promises a growth-slowing national version of the costly California Fair Pay Act (to) \u2018break down barriers\u2019 that are long gone,\u201d Morici says.\n\nEven a cursory examination shows there is nothing in Clinton\u2019s agenda that will grow the economy.\n\nBut she\u2019s offering plenty of leftist policies that will turn it into a graveyard of failed businesses, lost jobs, and little or no new business investment.\n\nThat why the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index is a key indicator of what will be driving this year\u2019s election. Especially the responses the index got when it asked, \u201cAs a small-business owner, what is the most important issue that you would like the presidential candidates to focus on during this campaign?\u201d\n\nTaxes were at the top of the list at 22 percent, followed by the economy (12 percent), health care (9 percent), jobs/employment (7 percent) and government regulations (7 percent).\n\nBut when Gallup asked owners to critically rank these issues in importance, a clearer, far more hostile mood emerges:\n\nOn raising taxes: Extremely important (34 percent) and Very important (49 percent). On Obamacare: Extremely important (33 percent), Very important (40 percent). On improving consumer confidence in the economy: Extremely important (26 percent), Very important (43 percent).\n\nStill, over two-thirds of business owners polled also said the candidates were not \u201cdiscussing their issues.\u201d Earth to Trump: Start talking about the economy in far more detail before it\u2019s too late.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe216d\"", "article_summary": "Still, over two-thirds of business owners polled also said the candidates were not \u201cdiscussing their issues.\u201d Earth to Trump: Start talking about the economy in far more detail before it\u2019s too late.\nOn improving consumer confidence in the economy: Extremely important (26 percent), Very important (43 percent).\nLambro - Note to the Candidates: Start Talking About the Economy5/9/2016WASHINGTON \u2014 Boil down all the bluff and bluster of the presidential campaign, and two issues stand out from all the rest: a weak economy, and a government driven by corruption, waste, fraud and abuse.\nA recent Gallup Poll found that nearly 70 percent of our nation\u2019s small-business employers believe the presidential candidates are not dealing with the issues most important to them.\nThe national news media regularly distort, cover up, play down or ignore these issues entirely, though the voters know better."}
