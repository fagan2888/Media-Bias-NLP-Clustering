Out of commission for more than a month, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail elevator that transports commuters between the Congress Street Station in the Jersey City Heights and the Ninth Street Station in Hoboken is working again.

The repair was completed last week, according to a NJ Transit representative.

But not all the news was uplifting.

Service on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system between Liberty State Park and West Side Avenue in Jersey City, which was suspended after a sewer line ruptured on Nov. 21, remains suspended.

The repair is expected to be completed "in the next few weeks," according to the NJ Transit representative.
