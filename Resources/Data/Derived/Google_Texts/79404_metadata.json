Mr. Hanson even went so far as to suggest Mr. Obama will surpass Warren Harding \u2013 he of Teapot Dome and Ohio Gang infamy \u2013 as the American president most tainted by scandal.\n\nRead this fascinating piece here.\n\nI tend to agree that Mr. Obama\u2019s doings make Mr. Harding\u2019s malfeasance look like small potatoes. However, I think that only is part of what he will be remembered for. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Mr. Obama\u2019s lasting legacy will be as a leader who did not live up to expectations.\n\nMr. Obama won his office in 2008 by a convincing margin. At the time of his election, it seemed some Americans truly believed him to be a God-like figure capable of miracles. In fact, before he had even been sworn in, scholars and non-scholars alike were comparing him with some of America\u2019s most well-regarded presidents, namely Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.\n\nInstead, Mr. Obama presided over a stream of debacles. Throughout his presidency, it seems policy failures \u2013 like the decline in America\u2019s standing on the world stage and problems with Obamacare \u2013 bureaucratic incompetence and scandals have been mainstays in news reports. For this reason, the president barely has the support of 40 percent of Americans, and his Democratic Party is bracing for mass losses in next month\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nWhile no president is perfect, it doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that things got so messy under Mr. Obama\u2019s watch. As such, he can fairly be described as a weak leader who never had the right stuff for the presidency to begin with.\n\nNeedless to say, things certainly did not play out in the manner anticipated by the people who blindly bought Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201chope and change\u201d rhetoric six years ago.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6d27\"", "article_summary": "I tend to agree that Mr. Obama\u2019s doings make Mr. Harding\u2019s malfeasance look like small potatoes.\nMr. Hanson even went so far as to suggest Mr. Obama will surpass Warren Harding \u2013 he of Teapot Dome and Ohio Gang infamy \u2013 as the American president most tainted by scandal.\nMr. Obama won his office in 2008 by a convincing margin.\nWhile no president is perfect, it doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that things got so messy under Mr. Obama\u2019s watch.\nInstead, Mr. Obama presided over a stream of debacles."}
