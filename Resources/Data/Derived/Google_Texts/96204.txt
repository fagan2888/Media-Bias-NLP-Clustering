Q: When trying to get breakfast on the table, cereal is the quickest way to go. But are cereals such as Cheerios and Chex really all that healthy?

A: Processed cereals are not as healthful as whole-grain options such as whole oatmeal. The grains in a processed cereal have been broken down, so they don’t provide all of the nutrition a whole grain would, and they often lack fiber, so they enter the bloodstream more quickly than a whole grain, which leaves a child hungry sooner. A better bet for a quick breakfast is a homemade whole-grain muffin, or pre-soaked oatmeal that can be heated quickly.

Q: I switched the term “breakfast” to mean “eat something.” It could be scrambled eggs on toast or a meatloaf sandwich. Some days it was a serving spoon of peanut butter and a glass of milk. Is this OK?

A: Leftovers often make a great breakfast! I agree that we should think out of the box when it comes to breakfast. We don’t need to eat the very American cereals and baked goods. Meats and broth and greens are traditional morning meals in many countries and are a fantastic way to begin any day.

Q: Is there any risk to eating the same thing every day, as long as it’s something healthy?

A: As long as you are getting a variety of foods and nutrients throughout your day, you are probably fine eating the same healthful breakfast most days. It never hurts to shake it up on weekends or when you have more time to experiment. Perhaps add fresh fruit or some raw nuts to up the nutrition.
