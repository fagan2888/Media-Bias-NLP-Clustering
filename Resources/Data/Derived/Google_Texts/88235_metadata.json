It never materialized. Two decades later, Hawke has fulfilled his destiny and picked up the trumpet in \u201cBorn to Be Blue.\u201d This time around, he\u2019s working with director Robert Budreau to paint an impressionistic picture of the legendary jazz trumpeter\u2019s 40s, imagining Baker as he tries to clean up his act.\n\nWe sat down with Hawke at South by Southwest in Austin to discuss the role of drugs in creativity, the idea of disappearing into a character, and honoring the essence of Baker\u2019s music.\n\nTalking about Chet Baker, you said something along the lines of, \u201cThe drugs don\u2019t help. They just help you deal with the anxiety.\u201d\n\nYeah, there\u2019s no talent inside the drugs. The talent is inside you. You know, sometimes people love to apply a lot of judgment to it, and I\u2019ve lost several friends to drugs and alcohol. So I certainly don\u2019t look at it with a tremendous amount of sympathy, but you also have to understand that a lot of people are in a lot of pain. How they manage their pain and their confusion and their depression and their loneliness and their insecurities \u2014 those things are painkillers. When you\u2019re hurting, it\u2019s very human to want to stop hurting.\n\nPart and parcel of that is, when you\u2019re an artist, you\u2019re sort of front and center with all of those things people use television or movies to ignore. When you\u2019re an artist, you maybe can\u2019t hide from it, because it\u2019s your work. It\u2019s your entire life.\n\nYour whole being goes into what you do. I think for a guy like\u2026 I don\u2019t even know Chet Baker. I don\u2019t want to talk about him specifically as a man. The two great actor-artists of my generation that influenced me are River Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who both died of heroin overdoses. It\u2019s just kind of brutal. You see there was a ferocity of honesty in both of those guys. They just despised lying. The world is full of a lot of little lies you have to tell to get through the day. For a certain amount of people who are extremely sensitive, it\u2019s really hard. If you don\u2019t have the proper tools inside yourself to navigate those waters, they can be pretty treacherous waters.\n\nAnd you add into the mix the immense success and failure, because the higher you go, the higher you fall. We all know that everybody\u2019s equal in our hearts, so there\u2019s a certain sense of fraudulence you have when you\u2019re being celebrated too much. I think there\u2019s some kind of base note that\u2026 we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re born, we don\u2019t know where we come from, we don\u2019t know what kind of magic is running the world. So to take responsibility for it like you\u2019re somebody fabulous or God\u2019s working through you \u2014 you know there\u2019s a lie manifest in there. That creates an immense amount of insecurity, the more success you get. Then failure is even more dangerous.\n\nI know that\u2019s something present for everyone in the arts. How does that play out for you personally?\n\nWith much difficulty. Sometimes I feel that my whole life has been a war with my nervous system. The person you want to be with the person you actually are is sometimes so disappointing that it creates\u2026 you find yourself tripping on yourself. I find that when I was younger, I had a lot more hubris. To put it nicely, I just loved acting and I loved the arts! I just wanted to be a part of it, and I couldn\u2019t imagine any downside. So I just did it. I remember making my Broadway debut. I remember walking out onstage and thinking, \u201cWow, I\u2019m making my Broadway debut! Not nervous at all. This is awesome!\u201d Just had that kind of attitude.\n\nAs you get older and you start to care more, you realize how rare the opportunities to contribute are, how much you value the arts, and how much responsibility comes with any success. There\u2019s this voice inside you. Publishing something, you go to the bookstore and see all the great novels nobody\u2019s read. The records \u2026 you go on iTunes and go, \u201cWhat?!? Why would I bother making a movie; there are so many great movies nobody\u2019s ever seen!\u201d That voice can become kind of crippling to me. \u201cWho are you? What are you pretending to do?\u201d But you have to fight through it. Each generation has to keep talking to each other. That\u2019s how I solve it with myself. If anybody acting is worthwhile, then it\u2019s worthwhile for any of us to try. If none of us try, none of it will ever happen.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the culture to decide what\u2019s really of value, and God knows that changes. We\u2019re rewriting the past all the time. Chet Baker is an interesting example. He loved to sing and wanted to do it, but he was wildly made fun of for doing it at the time. Now those records are still selling. The people making fun of him, that\u2019s gone. I\u2019m really glad that he believed in himself to do it.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the interesting things about especially music. Because of what happened to him, his music was at times incredibly personal. Sometimes when you\u2019re really personal, people don\u2019t always understand it. Especially initially.\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re really sincere. People are thrown by it. If you\u2019re ironic or glib or cool, people can kind of understand it. If you come out and go, \u201cHey, this is my heart here. Hold it in your hands\u201d\u2026 people are like, \u201cUhhhh, I don\u2019t want to hold your heart.\u201d But it\u2019s powerful and it\u2019s moving. Over time, they can start to handle it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to Ethan Hawke about managing pain, Chet Baker, and why he tries to \"spiritually marry\" his directors", "title": "Ethan Hawke on coping with failure, success and insecurity: \u201cSometimes I feel that my whole life has been a war with my nervous system\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to Ethan Hawke about managing pain, Chet Baker, and why he tries to \"spiritually marry\" his directors", "title": "Ethan Hawke on coping with failure, success and insecurity: \u201cSometimes I feel that my whole life has been a war with my nervous system\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/ethan_hawke_on_coping_with_failure_success_and_insecurity_sometimes_i_feel_that_my_whole_life_has_been_a_war_with_my_nervous_system/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/born_to_be_blue.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to Ethan Hawke about managing pain, Chet Baker, and why he tries to \"spiritually marry\" his directors", "title": "Ethan Hawke on coping with failure, success and insecurity: \u201cSometimes I feel that my whole life has been a war with my nervous system\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/born_to_be_blue.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Cannon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, born to be blue, chet baker, Editor's Picks, ethan hawke, Film, Jazz, Movies, Music", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: addiction, born to be blue, chet baker, Editor's Picks, ethan hawke, Film, Jazz, Movies, Music, Entertainment NewsBack in the \u201990s, Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater developed a movie about Chet Baker in his 20s.\nI think there\u2019s some kind of base note that\u2026 we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re born, we don\u2019t know where we come from, we don\u2019t know what kind of magic is running the world.\nI think for a guy like\u2026 I don\u2019t even know Chet Baker.\nEspecially if you\u2019re really sincere.\nTalking about Chet Baker, you said something along the lines of, \u201cThe drugs don\u2019t help."}
