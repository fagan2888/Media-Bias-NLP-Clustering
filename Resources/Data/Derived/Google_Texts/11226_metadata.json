With the year now coming to a close, the agency has released a listing of the top scams reported to it from the United States and Canada.\n\nWhile fraud can take on many different forms, \u201cimpostor scams\u201d are by far the most commonly run in North America, the BBB notes. They involve criminals who pose as trusted officials, such as IRS agents, police officers and debt collectors. Whether they make contact via phone, online or in person, the aim of imposters is to get victims to believe who they are so they can dupe them into parting with their cash or sharing their personal information to enable identity theft.\n\nAll of the top 10 scams involved some form of impostor scam.\n\nThe good news, the BBB says, is that many would-be victims recognized the impostors. \u201cAbout 85% of those reporting scams to BBB recognized them as frauds before any money was stolen,\u201d the organization reported on its website. Some people, however, encountered especially good impostors. \u201cThe top ten scams still account for more than $1 million lost from those who filed with BBB.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Enjoy: Federal Government Asks Google for Help Fighting Student Debt Scams\n\nThe three most highly reported scams were:\n\nTax scams \u2013 The BBB received 2,413 reports about this scam that involves a phony call from an \u201cIRS agent\u201d that claims back taxes are owned. The caller ID is commonly spoofed in this scam to add credibility. Callers will often threaten legal action, wage garnishment or jail time to add a sense of urgency to this ploy, as well.\n\nDebt collections \u2013 A total of 835 reports were filed about this type of fraud, which involves a call from someone who claims the victim has an unpaid debt. The caller will threaten lawsuits, jail time or wage garnishment if a payment isn\u2019t made immediately. Caller ID spoofing may occur with the caller pretending to be from a law enforcement agency or other government entity.\n\nSweepstakes/prizes/gifts \u2013 Another 811 reports were filed related to this kind of scam that involves telling a victim he or she has won a prize, but must cover incidental expenses to receive it, such as processing, delivery or insurance.\n\nOther scams were also commonly reported to the agency, including tech support, government grant and advanced fee loan ploys. Credit card scams, work-from-home schemes, fake check and money order and lottery scams were also reportedly briskly in 2015, the BBB noted.\n\nAvoiding Scams\n\nScams are run in abundance, but there are steps consumers can take to avoid them. When phone calls, emails or in-person visits are unsolicited and money is demanded, consumers can benefit by taking a step back to fully vet the bearer of the news and evaluate the situation. Refraining from giving out personal information until the recipient is fully vetted is also essential.\n\nWhen in doubt, call the agency or business directly using a number found on a bill or on the back of a credit card. It is imperative to not trust a number provided by a caller ID, an unsolicited email or an unknown, in-person visitor. The best defense in many cases is a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\nThe BBB collected more than 10,000 scam reports since it launched its Scam Tracker. Those reports only represent a sliver of those reported to local law enforcement and the federal government through websites such as StopFraud.gov. Consumers who are contacted by suspected scammers are urged to report the encounters.\n\nGet Free Updates! Stay in the loop with a weekly newsletter, with all our news from the previous week.
