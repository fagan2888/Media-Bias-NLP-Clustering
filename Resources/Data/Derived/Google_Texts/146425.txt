× Salvation Army gives Christmas presents to 300 Ferguson families

FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – Monday, the Salvation Army held a toy giveaway for more than 300 Ferguson families to try and help the community heal from the recent unrest.

Since the unrest, many undeserved families has had to choose between paying rent and buying Christmas presents for their kids.

The ‘Toy Town’ was held at the Church of the Nazarene.

Each family worked with a volunteer to pick out 3 to 4 toys per child.

Families also received a food voucher so they could buy a Christmas dinner.

Last week, the Salvation Army held a similar event for families in need, across the St. Louis area.
