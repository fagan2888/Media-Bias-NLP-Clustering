Once reporters with even rudimentary understanding of the law began poking around, they discovered that Bette was more a victim of anti-Obamacare histrionics than of the genuine article.\n\nThe ad makers at the conservative pressure group Americans for Prosperity are the Jerry Bruckheimers of atmospherically devastating campaign spots attacking Democrats who voted for Obamacare, but like nearly all Bruckheimer films the plots of these ads fall apart upon the mildest scrutiny.\n\nThe \u201cvictims\u201d in one of their ads attacking Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., turned out to be paid actors. Now in Michigan, they\u2019ve found a genuinely sympathetic character \u2014 Leukemia patient Julie Boonstra \u2014 who seems to earnestly dislike the Affordable Care Act. But neither Boonstra nor AFP can quite put their fingers on why she\u2019s worse off under the law than she was before. That\u2019s not to say she should be an Obamacare fan \u2014 who am I to tell her that? But there\u2019s almost no denying that she\u2019s more protected now than she was before, and probably better off financially as well.\n\nBoonstra\u2019s central complaint is that she lost her old healthcare plan because of Obamacare, just like an untold number of other individual market patrons. But the ad also suggests very strongly that she lost her doctor as well, and has been saddled with significantly higher costs.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler beat me to the fact check. It turns out that she kept her doctor, and in a separate interview with the Detroit News, acknowledged that her premiums under Obamacare ($571 a month) are half as much as they were last year ($1,100). Her annual savings \u2014 $6,348 \u2014 are actually just $2 shy of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s $6,350 \u201cOut of Pocket Maximum\u201d for an individual plan, above which the insurance company must pay every penny.\n\nEither she\u2019s unaware of that, or doesn\u2019t want to admit it, because she told Kessler, \u201cthe premiums are half, but the out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs are so high that, for me, it\u2019s unaffordable. My coverage is 80/20. Blood work, I\u2019m paying 20 percent. If I needed a bone marrow transplant, I would only be covered 80 percent. Everything, everything I do now, I have to pay a percentage of.\u201d\n\nBy \u201c80/20,\u201d Boonstra\u2019s implying she has a silver-plated healthcare plan, but the 20 percent cost sharing only applies to costs incurred under the OOP maximum. Any individual on that plan who needed, say, a $100,000 bone marrow transplant tomorrow wouldn\u2019t owe $20,000 out of pocket. They\u2019d owe $6,350.\n\nAFP spokesman Levi Russell\u2019s response amounts to an observation that a higher deductible exposes patients to lumpier, more unpredictable costs. \u201cNow her expenses are unpredictable, and that means unaffordable. It could be $600 one month, and three times that the next month. The reality of what she\u2019s dealing with is much more involved and can\u2019t be swept aside by saying, \u2018you have an OOP maximum so quit complaining about your cancer.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Given how horrible Obamacare supposedly is, it's bizarre the GOP has such a hard time finding real victims VIDEO", "title": "Are Republicans even trying?
