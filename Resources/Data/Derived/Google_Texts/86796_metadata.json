President Obama\u2019s administration plans to extend the Endangered Species Act protections for two breeds of lions whose numbers have been declining in Africa, the AP reports.\n\nThe outrage about the lion\u2019s death came soon after the Center for Medical Progress released its first three videos exposing a top Planned Parenthood official negotiating the sale of aborted babies\u2019 body parts. At the time, Obama ignored the public outrage about Planned Parenthood\u2019s treatment of human life; but he spoke up quickly after the lion\u2019s death and called for an investigation.\n\nSIGN THE NEW PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s efforts to protect wildlife are commendable, his record on protecting human life is shameful. Obama has been labeled the most pro-abortion president in U.S. history. Through his policies and close connections to abortion advocates, Obama has tried to expand the millions abortions that happen every year across the world.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama also threatened to veto legislation to de-fund the abortion giant Planned Parenthood, which is under investigation for selling aborted babies\u2019 body parts. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on Dec. 3. The House of Representatives is expected to approve the de-funding bill in January and send it to Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nBefore he became president, Obama voted against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, which would have ensured that babies who who survive abortions are protected. He vowed to veto a similar bill this fall that would have held abortion facilities criminally liable for harvesting body parts from aborted babies who technically are still alive.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s first week in office, he wasted no time in overturning the Mexico City Policy. The Mexico City Policy requires the more than 600 groups that receive State Department taxpayer funding to pledge not to promote or perform abortions with it. Abortion advocates objected to the measure for years during the Bush administration because they want to use the funds to do abortions overseas or lobby pro-life nations to reverse their laws against unlimited abortions.\n\nAs LifeNews previously reported, in 2009, Obama also gave China, one of the worst countries in the world for sex-trafficking, millions of dollar to fund their brutal one-child policy.\n\nThen he promised the American people that his health care policy, Obamacare, would not fund abortion. However, four years later, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that showed that Obamacare plans cover abortion and receive taxpayer subsides.\n\nIn 2012, Obama even opposed a federal ban on sex-selection abortions, which had wide public support. Obama said he opposed the bill because it would \u201cintrude in medical decisions.\u201d\n\nObama has shown his loyalty to abortion advocates throughout his presidency. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, which aborts about 330,000 babies every year, visited the White House dozens of times during Obama\u2019s presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Administration Enacts Protection For Lions But None for Unborn Children", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama won't let protections for babies in the womb get past his desk, but he is on board with new protections for endangered lions in Africa.", "title": "Obama Administration Enacts Protection For Lions But None for Unborn Children", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/12/21/obama-administration-enacts-protection-for-lions-but-none-for-unborn-children/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/barackobama26.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "obama administration enacts protection for lions but none for unborn children", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s administration plans to extend the Endangered Species Act protections for two breeds of lions whose numbers have been declining in Africa, the AP reports.\nBefore he became president, Obama voted against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, which would have ensured that babies who who survive abortions are protected.\nPresident Barack Obama won\u2019t let protections for babies in the womb get past his desk, but he is on board with new protections for endangered lions in Africa.\nObama said he opposed the bill because it would \u201cintrude in medical decisions.\u201dObama has shown his loyalty to abortion advocates throughout his presidency.\nThrough his policies and close connections to abortion advocates, Obama has tried to expand the millions abortions that happen every year across the world."}
