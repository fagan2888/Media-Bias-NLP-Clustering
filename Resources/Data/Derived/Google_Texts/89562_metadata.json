The tax has been dubbed the \u201cCadillac tax.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmployers will need to begin planning now, if they haven't already, to deal with the reality of the excise tax, said Morrison.\n\n\n\nThe first step employers need to take is to collect data on their plans, before making any decisions about what methods or products to adopt to curb costs, Morrison said.\n\nCoverage\n\nDropping dependent coverage for spouses, for example, would seem intuitively to make sense as a tactic to lower plan costs, Morrison said.\n\nEmployers that exclude working spouses from coverage may save money in the short term by cutting the number of covered lives, but the long-term effect of this strategy is less clear, according to a study from the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nWellness plans have gained in popularity, but the jury is still out on the degree to which they can lower plan costs, said Joanne L. Hustead, vice president and deputy leader of Segal Group Inc.'s National Health Compliance Practice in Washington. Employers may find that disease management will offer \u201cthe biggest bang for the buck,\u201d Hustead said.\n\nOther wellness strategies include culture change, such as demonstrating management support for a healthy employee culture; behavioral modification, such as providing incentive to promote health behaviors; increasing communications about health; and health status metrics, such as biometric screening.\n\n\n\nAlthough completely eliminating coverage is a possibility, to date, the vast majority of large employers haven't terminated health-care coverage for full-time employees, Morrison said. Some large employers may be holding off on this decision while waiting to see if other companies drop coverage, she said.\n\n\n\nHowever, some large companies have eliminated coverage for their part timers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc.\n\n\n\nThere is no single \u201csilver bullet\u201d that will control costs, but there are many opportunities, Morrison said.\n\nExcerpted from a story that ran in Pension & Benefits Daily (10/10/2014).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/acas-cadillac-excise-b17179896944/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The Affordable Care Act's excise tax that starts in 2018 should be called the \u201cCamry\u201d tax\u2014not the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax\u2014because it is going to affect more than just high-cost plans, a practitioner said at a...", "title": "ACA's \u2018Cadillac' Excise Tax Will Hit Lower Cost Health Plans, Practitioners Say"}, "csrf-token": "spKdgYvmjfNJnRTkD3wvuScbUMsE6o2bgO-kY1m9IA22ZQqlYNdSSM0lyv4kDBIKhd7nTbiRN2yHuEGFAJlIEUTCXcK6DIEBsbpHdc2ys1A1:h3bIcSZsdhXWlpcFo7JIc-Jv5AvcbGanAocdAWj1vjBCe3A27T-XAXi3ZFJoSwGkWVL4SMnjHk57tpw517afCVQH-FWifeqNRaUO517i-tg1", "description": "The Affordable Care Act's excise tax that starts in 2018 should be called the \u201cCamry\u201d tax\u2014not the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax\u2014because it is going to affect more than just high-cost plans, a practitioner said at a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Starting in 2018, the ACA imposes a 40 percent excise tax on the cost of high-cost health plans above a certain threshold.\nThe tax has been dubbed the \u201cCadillac tax.\u201dEmployers will need to begin planning now, if they haven't already, to deal with the reality of the excise tax, said Morrison.\nCoverageDropping dependent coverage for spouses, for example, would seem intuitively to make sense as a tactic to lower plan costs, Morrison said.\nThe Affordable Care Act's excise tax that starts in 2018 should be called the \u201cCamry\u201d tax\u2014not the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax\u2014because it is going to affect more than just high-cost plans, a practitioner said at a conference on employee benefits.\nThe first step employers need to take is to collect data on their plans, before making any decisions about what methods or products to adopt to curb costs, Morrison said."}
