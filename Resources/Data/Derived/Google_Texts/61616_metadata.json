Hepatotoxicity is essentially chemically-driven liver damage.\n\nAnd the results showed liver injuries from supplements increased by 20 percent over the almost 10-year study. Bodybuilding supplements cause prolonged jaundice, but non-bodybuilding supplements increase risk for transplants and death by 13 percent. Otherwise medications only increase these chances by three percent.\n\n\"Our study group is specific to [certain] centers and therefore we cannot conclude that liver injury due to herbals and dietary supplements in on the rise in the U.S.,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cFurther population-based study of liver injury due to herbal products and dietary supplements is needed.\"\n\nMore than 900 drugs, toxins, and herbs have been linked to liver injury, according to Medscape. And \u201cdrug-induced hepatic injury is the most common reason cited for withdrawl of an approved drug.\u201d\n\nWith regard to vitamin and herbal supplements, Medical Daily previously reported vitamin E and selenium supplements increase risk of prostate cancer, and vitamin D (poor thing) is consistently debunked by science.\n\nA better bet is to consult your doctor before raiding the supplement aisle. Before that, reassess your diet and see if it\u2019s lacking natural food sources of essential vitamins. Light tofu, cooked spinach, avocados, and almonds are rich in E, while salmon, eggs, mushrooms, and ricotta cheese are rich in D.\n\nSame goes for those interested in dietary supplements. Either consult your doctor or reassess your current diet and lifestyle. Improving overall diet quality doesn\u2019t lead to weight loss, but it reduces risk for a slew of additional disease, like cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nTaking a supplement to bulk up? Switch to sprint intervals versus hours on the treadmill, as well six small, protein- and carb-rich meals per day.\n\nSource: Navarro V, Barnhart H, Bonkovsky H, Davern T, Fontana R, et al.
