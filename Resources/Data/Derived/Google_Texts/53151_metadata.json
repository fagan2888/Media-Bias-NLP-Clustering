Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and the committee\u2019s chairman, told CNN.\n\nMr. Gowdy said those people include Cheryl Mills, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at State; aide Huma Abedin; and then-deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan.\n\nAttempting to quell the controversy over her use of private e-mail as the country\u2019s top diplomat, Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday that she deleted all of her personal emails and turned over anything related to her government business, but she said she wasn\u2019t going to turn over a private server she used.\n\nMr. Gowdy told CNN it\u2019s premature to say whether the committee is planning to subpoena the aides and that his select committee tasked with investigating the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi only has jurisdiction over emails involving Libya.\n\nHe also said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOn the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u201d Tuesday evening that the committee plans to talk to Mrs. Clinton \u201cat least twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a public record, you should have access to it \u2014 I should have access to it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to make that call. We don\u2019t grade our own papers in life. We don\u2019t call fouls on ourself in the NBA. We don\u2019t call holding on ourself in football.
