Last week, a report surfaced suggesting that AT&T was on the verge of acquiring DIRECTV for close to $50 billion. Today, that deal became official for $48.5 billion.

Together, AT&T thinks the companies can become a content distribution leader across mobile, video and broadband platforms. To be more specific, the deal will help AT&T and DIRECTV “better meet consumers’ future viewing and programming preferences, whether traditional pay TV, on-demand video services like Netflix or Hulu streamed over a broadband connection (mobile or fixed) or a combination of viewing preferences on any screen.”

Consumer bundles that include everything from video and high-speed broadband to mobile services could be a part of the future, plus the combination of the companies creates all sorts of operating efficiencies.

For the most part, at least for now, this move shouldn’t impact your AT&T wireless service at all.

From the press release – “This purchase price implies a total equity value of $48.5 billion and a total transaction value of $67.1 billion, including DIRECTV’s net debt.”
