The chemicals, scientific studies suggested, could be contributing to colony collapse disorder, or CCD, the acronym that\u2019s come to define the frightening and mysterious disappearance, seemingly overnight, of entire hives. Over the past six years, the U.S. has lost about $2 billion in such hives and, as a result, $30 billion in crops, to CCD.\n\nThe controversial move, of course, isn\u2019t enough to save the bees, but it\u2019s a start. The U.S., despite acknowledging a \u201ccomplex set of stressors and pathogens,\u201d including agrochemicals, as potential culprits in the die-offs, has yet do anything. In March 2013, a group of beekeepers and environmental groups sued the EPA for its failure to protect the insects, and, by extension, our food supply. The agency, however, said it won\u2019t complete its review of the pesticides until 2018.\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t limited to pesticides, says Dave Goulson, and it\u2019s not just honeybees that are feeling the stress. There are more than 20,000 species of bees in the world, and habitat loss and disease, in addition to pesticides, are threatening them all \u2014 not to mention the other insects that are likely being affected, or the larger species that rely on those species for food.\n\nA professor of biology at the University of Sussex and founder of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Goulson is the author of more than 200 scientific studies on bees and other insects and, most recently, of \u201cA Sting in the Tale,\u201d which chronicles his lifelong fascination with bumblebees and the quest to forestall their decline. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that the world my children grow up in is going to be a poorer place than what we have today,\u201d he told Salon. However, he\u2019s careful to add, we still have a chance to makes things, if not all better, then at least a lot less worse than they could have been. And he has a lot of suggestions for how that might be done. A condensed and lightly edited version of our conversation follows:\n\nYou\u2019ve been studying the decline of bees for about 20 years now. Are the die-offs that we\u2019re hearing about right now a recent phenomenon, or are they part of a larger pattern of decline?\n\nSo the die-offs we\u2019ve been hearing about recently mostly relate to honeybees, which are the managed bees that we keep in boxes and get honey from. A lot of people think that\u2019s the only species of bee, and of course it isn\u2019t. There really 20-odd thousand species of bee in the world. Almost all the others are wild bees that nobody looks after; they just look after themselves. They\u2019re all important, but we actually don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to most of them.\n\nBasically, though, the causes of these die-offs and generally of bee declines are broadly the same for all types of bees, as far as we know. And there are three main ones for which there are good evidence. You\u2019ll read all sorts of nonsense about other things. People will tell you that mobile phones are the cause of bee decline; or genetically modified crops is a popular one \u2014 it\u2019s slightly more plausible, but not much more than mobiles phones.\n\nFirstly, is habitat loss. Farming has really radically changed in the last hundred years. In Britain we used to have about 50 million acres of flowery hay meadows, and nearly 98 percent of it was destroyed in the 20th century, when we intensified farming to try and increase food production. It was really kicked up with the second World War: Subsidies were introduced to pay farmers to rip out the hedges and to essentially destroy all this natural habitat and turn it into a crop monoculture. That happens or has gone on everywhere: These days much of North America has these massive fields because of the availability of pesticides, and herbicides in particular, which means you can grow a crop without any weeds at all. I would question whether it\u2019s sustainable, but at least in the short term it produced heaps of food. But it also means there are a lot less flowers. That\u2019s bad if you\u2019re bee because all you eat is pollen, nectar and flowers. That\u2019s probably still the biggest thing that\u2019s affecting all bees.\n\nReason number two is disease. We accidentally redistributed bee diseases around the world. Honeybees aren\u2019t native to the Americas at all; they come from Africa. Sadly, when people move bees around they accidentally move their diseases and parasites with them if they\u2019re infected. And these are shared across bee species, so the diseases that affect honeybees will also spread to bumblebees and vice versa.\n\nNumber three is pesticides, which is a whole story in itself, but some of the insecticides we use are really toxic to bees, and to wildlife generally, and that certainly contributed to the problem. So with those three things together it\u2019s going to be bad.\n\nJust to clarify, what\u2019s the main difference between honeybees, which we usually hear more about, and other species? Comparatively, how important are they for food, agriculture, pollination, that sort of thing?\n\nIf you ask a child to draw a bee, they\u2019ll draw something big and fat with yellow and black stripes. That\u2019s a bumblebee. Honeybees are much smaller: they\u2019re not very furry, they\u2019re very slender, pale brown creatures and they\u2019re what lives in honeybee hives. And then there are all these other species of bee, which are mostly small and quite inconspicuous.\n\nIn terms of crop pollination, they\u2019re all important to some extent: Different crops tend to be better pollinated by one or the other. It has to do with the shape and size of the bee and the length of its tongue. Tomatoes are almost always pollinated by bumblebees, along with things like blueberries and raspberries, strawberries, beans and lots of other vegetables. Honeybees do a whole bunch of other things; almonds are almost always pollinated by honeybees. And many are pollinated by several different species of bee. But the long and short of it is that they\u2019re all important. It would probably be wiser to make sure that we look at a range of bees, because one of the dangers of the modern world is that some crops very heavily rely just on honeybees. When you use lots of pesticides then you get rid of the native and wild bees, and then your only option is to buy honeybees.\n\nAlmonds are a great example of this. They grow them very intensely and something like 1.5 million honeybee hives are transported to Northern California. Most of the honeybees in North America go to pollinate the almonds in one small area of California every spring. And if anything happens to that supply of honeybee hives then the almond growers are screwed, because they\u2019ve got nothing else to fall back on. And that\u2019s pretty worrying. It would be a much healthier situation if they encouraged and supported wild bees as well as honeybees so they\u2019ve got a backup. As it is, it\u2019s very risky.\n\nThe European Union has been a lot more progressive than the U.S. on banning pesticides that may be harming bees. Can you talk a little bit about how the E.U. managed to pass its rule and whether it\u2019s being seen as having any effect?\n\nYeah, so in the European Union we recently banned, for two years, three particular types of neonicotinoids, a type of insecticide that\u2019s chemically related to nicotine. It\u2019s a nerve toxin that affects the brain of the bee and any other insect. It\u2019s really toxic to insects, much more than almost anything else we\u2019ve invented before. To illustrate that, a fifth of a teaspoon is enough to kill 250 million bees. In the U.K., which is a pretty small area, we have to buy 80 tons of these chemicals every year \u2014 the U.S. figure is much, much higher. So we\u2019re putting tons and tons of stuff into the land which is persistent, it\u2019s systemic, it gets into plants, it gets into pollen and nectar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. is failling to protect one of our most valuable resources, says biologist Dave Goulson", "title": "How to save the world\u2019s bees before it\u2019s too late", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The U.S. is failling to protect one of our most valuable resources, says biologist Dave Goulson", "title": "How to save the world\u2019s bees before it\u2019s too late", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/17/how_to_save_the_worlds_bees_before_its_too_late/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/dead_bee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. is failling to protect one of our most valuable resources, says biologist Dave Goulson", "title": "How to save the world\u2019s bees before it\u2019s too late", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/dead_bee.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bees, Bumblebees, Editor's Picks, endangered species, Honeybees, pesticides, UK", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The controversial move, of course, isn\u2019t enough to save the bees, but it\u2019s a start.\nAnd these are shared across bee species, so the diseases that affect honeybees will also spread to bumblebees and vice versa.\nA condensed and lightly edited version of our conversation follows:You\u2019ve been studying the decline of bees for about 20 years now.\nThe European Union has been a lot more progressive than the U.S. on banning pesticides that may be harming bees.\nTopics: bees, Bumblebees, Editor's Picks, endangered species, Honeybees, pesticides, UK, Sustainability NewsThe European Commission knows how important bees are: In 2011, it passed a two-year moratorium on a class of pesticides thought to be facilitating the decline of global bee populations."}
