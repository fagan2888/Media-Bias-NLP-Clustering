Profiles on the bank\u2019s website - many featuring photographs - provide donors\u2019 details including age, height, weight, ethnicity, education level, talents and interests.\n\nWhile the bank has partnered with IVF clinics in Victoria and Queensland, this is the first time patients undergoing treatment in NSW will have access to its donors. It charges about $19,000 to ship six mature, frozen eggs to Australia.\n\nGenea\u2019s medical director, Associate Professor Mark Bowman, said the arrangement provided another option for women and couples unable to conceive with their own eggs. Finding a local donor was the preferred option, he said, but the sale and purchase of donor eggs is banned in Australia and people often struggled to find an altruistic donor among family, friends or through advertising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018For many of those women, their only other alternative up to now was to go overseas and have egg donation in a clinic in another country,\u2019\u2019 Professor Bowman said.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is another pathway giving women in a very difficult situation wider options. Nowadays egg freezing is much more successful than it used to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nSome local patients have already begun treatment with eggs from the bank. The US donors must comply with Australian and state laws on egg donation and assisted reproductive technology, receiving counselling and having their details registered so any children conceived can contact them in the future. Each donor\u2019s eggs may be used for a maximum of five families.\n\nThe World Egg Bank does not pay donors but compensates them up to $US5000 ($5,400) for expenses such as childcare, lost wages and travel.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Patients undergoing IVF in NSW will be able to import donor eggs from the US under a partnership between fertility clinic Genea and the World Egg Bank.", "title": "Genea partners with World Egg Bank to provide donor eggs", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/genea-partners-with-world-egg-bank-to-provide-donor-eggs-20140815-104kh6.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "Genea partners with World Egg Bank to provide donor eggs", "description": "Patients undergoing IVF in NSW will be able to import donor eggs from the US under a partnership between fertility clinic Genea and the World Egg Bank.", "card": "summary", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Patients undergoing IVF in NSW will be able to import donor eggs from the US under a partnership between fertility clinic Genea and the World Egg Bank."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6433\"", "article_summary": "The US-based bank is the largest commercial frozen egg donor bank in the world, recruiting and screening donors aged between 18 and 29.\nPatients undergoing IVF in NSW will be able to import donor eggs from the US under a partnership between fertility clinic Genea and the World Egg Bank.\nThe World Egg Bank does not pay donors but compensates them up to $US5000 ($5,400) for expenses such as childcare, lost wages and travel.\nFinding a local donor was the preferred option, he said, but the sale and purchase of donor eggs is banned in Australia and people often struggled to find an altruistic donor among family, friends or through advertising.\nEach donor\u2019s eggs may be used for a maximum of five families."}
