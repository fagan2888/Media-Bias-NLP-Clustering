Fordham Institute and a former Education Department staffer.\u201d\n\nWhat Severns refers to as the \u201cconservative\u201d Fordham Institute, however, is an organization that has been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to promote the Common Core standards, the education initiative that ultimately reminded millions of Americans that the federal government has no constitutional role in education.\n\nEarlier in December, Petrilli, apparently longing for bipartisanship, wrote about his \u201cpredictions and predilections for a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA),\u201d the current iteration of which is No Child Left Behind (NCLB):\n\nA reauthorization of the ESEA (on its fiftieth anniversary no less) could play the same role again: showing America that bipartisan governance is possible, even in Washington. Thankfully, both incoming chairmen of the relevant Senate and House committees\u2014Lamar Alexander and John Kline\u2014have indicated that passing an ESEA reauthorization is job number one. And friends in the Obama administration tell me that Secretary Duncan is ready to roll up his sleeves and get to work on something the president could sign. So far, so good.\n\nSearching for that elusive happy medium, Petrilli says that while his organization believes it is not currently politically practical for Washington to have too much power over education (because of the \u201ctrue\u201d conservatives who have grown powerful in Congress), still \u201cfederal education policy\u201d is a must\u2013even though the Constitution provides no role for the federal government in education:\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Washington must foreswear reform. To devolve everything to the states would be much like saying, \u201cHere\u2019s fifteen billion dollars in Title I money a year\u2014do whatever you want with it.\u201d The federal government may be a minority investor, but it still has a duty to demand something constructive in return. (Call it accountability for the taxpayer\u2019s dollar.) The challenge, then, is to find the right spot on the continuum between today\u2019s coercive, micromanaging federal role and \u201cleaving the money on the stump\u201d\u2014a spot that is realistic about Washington\u2019s proper role (and capacity) in the education cosmos, but that still nudges the system in a reform direction.\n\nWhat does Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), former U.S. education secretary under President George H.W. Bush, have to say about his plans as the new head of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee?\n\nSoon after his re-election in November, Alexander told NPR that his first priority would be to \u201cfix No Child Left Behind\u201d:\n\nThe Republican proposal to fix NCLB would give states the option \u2014 not mandate \u2014 to take federal dollars and let those dollars follow children to the schools they attend. We want to expand choice, but my view is that the federal government shouldn\u2019t mandate it. \u2026 Republicans would [also] transfer back to states the responsibility for deciding whether schools are succeeding or failing. Tennessee, Texas or New York would decide what the academic standards would be, what the curriculum would be, what to do about failing schools and how to evaluate teachers.\n\nAsked if he supports the Common Core standards, Alexander replied, \u201cI support giving states the right to decide whether to [adopt] the Common Core or not.\u201d\n\nThough Alexander may believe he is moving things in the \u201cright\u201d direction, there is no plan afoot to eliminate federal involvement in education, a factor that frustrates conservatives who have recently been fighting the federal government\u2019s overreach\u2013intermixed with corporate cronyism\u2013into an area that is constitutionally reserved for the states and local governments.\n\n\u201cI am hoping that Chairman Klein and Sen. Alexander will draw the major lessons from NCLB and the more recent Race to the Top programs,\u201d Jim Stergios, executive director of the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, told Breitbart News. \u201cFederal involvement, even with the best of intentions, tends to bring unintended consequences and often even negative impacts on student achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith NCLB, we saw many states react by lowering their standards and/or lowering the bar set by their state tests,\u201d Stergios continued. \u201cRace to the Top has handcuffed states seeking to set high standards by locking them into standards that are more or less in line with the average quality of standards in the states prior to the development of Common Core in 2009 and 2010.\u201d\n\nStergios observed the billions of tax dollars spent on so-called \u201cgame-changing initiatives\u201d over the past 15 years, with nothing to show for it, \u201cexcept that now the decisions are being made further from classrooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned this effort to revise NCLB serves as the quintessential D.C. head-fake wherein some of the old cobwebs of federal intrusion are brushed away but knitting of more recent vintage from the bureaucrats in Washington\u2013initiatives like Common Core and the national tests\u2013are locked into place,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to monitor what comes out to know that.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, writing at the Heritage Foundation, Lindsey Burke notes that Alexander will likely use, as his starting point for reauthorizing NCLB, the Every Child Ready for College or a Career Act, which he himself introduced in 2013.\n\nWhile Burke says Alexander\u2019s measure would eliminate the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and Highly Qualified Teacher mandates, as well as requirements that the states maintain certain levels of spending to qualify for federal funding, his proposal still mandates that states use federal funds to develop programs to enhance the mental, physical, health, and nutrition needs of students.\n\n\u201cIt also proposes reforms that are inappropriate for the federal government to pursue,\u201d Burke continues, \u201csuch as authorizing competitive grants to be awarded to states and school districts to develop performance-based teacher compensation models and school improvement strategies for local education agencies to use with under-performing schools.\u201d\n\nBurke also observes that Alexander\u2019s original proposal only permits Title I funds for low-income students to be portable to other public schools\u2013not private ones.\n\n\u201cIf the forthcoming NCLB reauthorization is modeled after the Every Child Ready for College or a Career Act,\u201d Burke concludes, \u201cit will represent a missed opportunity to advance federalism in education, limit Washington\u2019s overreach into local school policy, and provide states the opportunity to make federal funding student-centered and portable.\u201d\n\nBut the advancement of federalism seems miles off for those who are simply hoping for bipartisanship and retention of the ever-incentivizing \u201cstrings\u201d that are attached to the states\u2019 acceptance of federal funding. In the recent debate over Common Core, more Americans have come to understand what these \u201cstrings\u201d mean in terms of their children\u2019s education.\n\n\u201cAs parents, teachers, and other citizens increasingly realize, the US Department of Education is a millstone around the necks of our children,\u201d education director of the American Principles Project, Emmett McGroarty, told Breitbart News. \u201cUnmoored from the constitutional system of checks-and-balances, it gravitates toward education fads like Common Core and heavy-handed accountability schemes like No Child Left Behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people no longer view the US Department of Education as a supplemental agency that lends aid to state and local government,\u201d McGroarty added. \u201cInstead, they view it for what it is: an intermeddler that prevents parents and teachers and state and local government from having a real say in what children learn and how they are taught. Congressional leaders fail to appreciate the breadth and intensity of this change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Politico offered an image of left-wingers fearful that Republicans will take advantage of the backlash over Common Core and \u201cstrip the federal role out of education.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Politico offered an image of left-wingers fearful that Republicans will take advantage of the backlash over Common Core and \u201cstrip the federal role out of education.\u201d", "title": "The Left Fears Republicans Will 'Strip the Federal Role Out of Education' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-21-at-11.18.34-AM.png", "height": 354}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/03/the-left-fears-republicans-will-strip-the-federal-role-out-of-education/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Politico offered an image of left-wingers fearful that Republicans will take advantage of the backlash over Common Core and \u201cstrip the federal role out of education.\u201d", "title": "The Left Fears Republicans Will 'Strip the Federal Role Out of Education' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-21-at-11.18.34-AM.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, No Child Left Behind,Big Government, Education,Education", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "No Child Left Behind", "published_time": "2015-01-03T11:03:50-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec3b\"", "article_summary": "In the recent debate over Common Core, more Americans have come to understand what these \u201cstrings\u201d mean in terms of their children\u2019s education.\nBush, have to say about his plans as the new head of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee?\nWhat does Sen.
