US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is continuing to attack the Affordable Care Act.

On the floor of the Senate Wednesday, Sen. McConnell said, “A video recently surfaced that should concern all of us. It was three of President Obama's former speechwriters laughing it up. They were reminiscing about the time they apparently helped mislead the American people with a line that would one day become Politifact's Lie of the Year: 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.'”

McConnell says the law is “no laughing matter.”

McConnell is referring to an interview with Charlie Rose on his PBS show which featured several former speechwriters for President Obama.

In the context of the interview, the speechwriters laughed when one of them revealed who wrote the specific line.

Supreme Court

The Affordable Care Act was back in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The Supreme Court sent a case back to a lower court concerning a challenge brought by religious groups opposed to the act's contraceptive mandate.

This was the fourth case challenging the Affordable Care Act and the second challenging the contraceptive mandate.
