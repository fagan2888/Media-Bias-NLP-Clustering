Several Denver television stations filed a motion Monday seeking to put a camera in the courtroom during the Aurora movie theater murder trial of James Holmes.

The motion asks for one video camera in a fixed position inside the courtroom during the trial, currently scheduled to begin with jury selection in December. The TV stations — all of those in the city with a nightly newscast plus the cable channel Court TV — say the camera will not be a disturbance to the trial.

“A television camera which allows a live feed to be sent outside the courtroom actually reduces the number of media representatives in the courtroom,” the stations argue in the motion.

Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour said during a hearing Monday that he will likely set another hearing in September to debate the request.

Monday’s hearing was mostly devoted to the vetting of fingerprint-identification experts. Three analysts — two from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and one from the Aurora Police Department — testified about how they match fingerprints found at crime scenes to suspects. Samour will rule later whether they can be admitted as expert witnesses at trial.

Meanwhile, an order made public Monday means defense attorneys will not be able to obtain the records of a mystery witness.
