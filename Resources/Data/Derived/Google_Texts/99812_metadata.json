But the teen later told police Stough inappropriately touched her.\n\nStough released the girl about a half mile from her home. The girl's father called police and requested an Uber ride, knowing the same driver may have been in the area. Scottsdale Police arrived at the home at the same time as the suspect.\n\nPolice says Stough denied any involvement, but Uber records confirmed that he stopped the fare in the location the victim described..\n\nLab tests allegedly showing Stough's DNA on the victim's shorts were reportedly returned to Scottsdale Police on December 22, and Stough was arrested.\n\nUber says he is no longer with the company.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
