John Kasich (R) isn\u2019t the only Republican governor to embrace Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act, but few have been quite as enthusiastic about it. Kasich has said the policy \u201c makes great sense ,\u201d adding that he believes Obamacare has made \u201creal improvements in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who frequently presents his policy priorities in moral terms, has even suggested his Christianity has led him to embrace the ACA policy. Molly Ball reported this week that Kasich\u2019s posture has apparently annoyed some of his Republican brethren.\n\nMajorities of voters support expanding Medicaid, but many conservatives revile it as a costly expansion of government \u2013 and they aren\u2019t fond of being lectured by Kasich about their supposed heartlessness. \u201cHe likes quoting the Bible \u2013 \u2018Thou shalt expand Medicaid,\u2019 I keep looking for that verse,\u201d John Becker, a conservative member of the Ohio House of Representative, told me. At a closed-door donor forum in Palm Springs hosted by the Koch brothers, Kasich was attacked by two fellow Republican governors, Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, for, in the words of a source who attended the event, \u201chiding behind Jesus to expand Medicaid.\u201d The source added, \u201cIt got heated.\u201d\n\nAs best as I can tell, there is no recording of the closed-door donor forum, so there\u2019s no way to say with certainty whether Kasich was blasted by Haley and Jindal for \u201chiding behind Jesus,\u201d but if so, that\u2019s quite a charge for Republicans to make against one of their own.\n\nIt\u2019s also a reminder of the kind of rhetoric we\u2019re likely to hear if, as expected, Kasich enters the Republican presidential race.\n\nThe report in The Atlantic added\n\nKasich\u2019s reputation as something of a bleeding heart could make it difficult to get through the GOP primary. Just after his recent New Hampshire foray, he met in New York with an influential group of fiscal conservatives including the former CNBC host Larry Kudlow, Reaganite economist Arthur Laffer, and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Stephen Moore. National Review\u2019s report on the meeting, which included a testy back-and-forth on Medicaid, was headlined, \u201cKasich Turns Off Supply Siders in New York City.\u201d\n\nBy any sensible standard, it\u2019s all but impossible to characterize the Ohio governor as a \u201cmoderate.\u201d He is very far to the right on social issues such as reproductive rights ; he\u2019s signed unnecessary voting restrictions into law; his environmental record is a mess ; and his signature federal issue is a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, quite possibly the worst idea in the history of bad ideas.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "On healthcare, the Ohio governor has been willing to break with party orthodoxy to his state's benefit.
