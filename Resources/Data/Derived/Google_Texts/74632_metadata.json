U.S. Government\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday issued a temporary ban on drug imports from an Indian pharmaceutical company\u2019s facility in Mohali for regulatory violations.\n\nRegulators placed an injunction on product imports from Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.\u2019s facility in Mohali, India, saying the pharmaceutical company would remain on \u201cimport alert\u201d until it complies with U.S drug manufacturing practices.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to using the full extent of its enforcement authority to ensure that drugs made for the U.S. market meet federally mandated quality standards,\u201d Howard Sklamberg, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told reporters in a statement. \u201cWe want American consumers to be confident that the drugs they are taking are of the highest quality, and the FDA will continue to work to prevent potentially unsafe products from entering the country.\u201d\n\nThe regulator also ordered that the company\u2019s Mohali facility be subject to specific terms of an injunction issued by the FDA in January 2012, which sought to ensure regulatory compliance \u2014 including issues pertaining to data integrity \u2014 at two other company facilities, located in Paonta Sahib and Dewas, India. The FDA initially put those two facilities on import alert in 2008.\n\nFDA inspectors last September, and again in December, identified \u201csignificant\u201d manufacturing violations at Ranbaxy\u2019s Mohali facility, including a failure to investigate manufacturing problems as well as a failure to establish procedures to ensure quality control. Now, the FDA has prohibited Ranbaxy from manufacturing U.S.-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility. The company is also banned from selling those drugs on the international market, in the United States, and elsewhere.\n\nThe Indian pharmaceutical company will be permitted to resume manufacturing and distribution of U.S.-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility following a successful inspection from a third-party expert to ensure FDA compliance.\n\nThe FDA does not expect the injunction to disrupt the supply of pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ranbaxy laboratories ltd., ranbaxy, ranbaxy import alert, ranbaxy quality control, ranbaxy ban", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA issued an import alert to border authorities regarding an injunction against Indian pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.", "title": "FDA Bans Drugs From Ranbaxy's Mohali, India Plant, Citing Quality Assurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-bans-drugs-ranbaxys-mohali-india-plant-citing-quality-assurance-256880", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/fda-bans-imports-indias-ranbaxy-laboratories-mohali-facility.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA issued an import alert to border authorities regarding an injunction against Indian pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.", "title": "FDA Bans Drugs From Ranbaxy's Mohali, India Plant, Citing Quality Assurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-bans-drugs-ranbaxys-mohali-india-plant-citing-quality-assurance-256880", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/fda-bans-imports-indias-ranbaxy-laboratories-mohali-facility.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/fda-bans-imports-indias-ranbaxy-laboratories-mohali-facility.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-09-16T12:16:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-16T12:16:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA issued an import alert to border authorities regarding an injunction against Indian pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdded9\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert to border authorities regarding an injunction against Ranbaxy Laboratories' facility in Mohali, citing quality assurance concerns.\nNow, the FDA has prohibited Ranbaxy from manufacturing U.S.-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility.\nThe FDA does not expect the injunction to disrupt the supply of pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S.\nThe Indian pharmaceutical company will be permitted to resume manufacturing and distribution of U.S.-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility following a successful inspection from a third-party expert to ensure FDA compliance.\nU.S. GovernmentThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday issued a temporary ban on drug imports from an Indian pharmaceutical company\u2019s facility in Mohali for regulatory violations."}
