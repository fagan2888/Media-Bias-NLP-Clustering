And that premium right-sizing actually could translate to higher premiums as well as smaller federal premium subsidies for members unless they switch plans, according to an analysis from consulting firm Avalere Health. For carriers, the change in pricing could negatively impact renewals.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act pegs subsidy amounts to the \u201cbenchmark plan,\u201d which is the second-lowest-priced silver plan in a given region. Based on an analysis of proposed rates in nine states, the second-lowest-priced plan in six states will lose benchmark status in 2015. Moreover, in seven of the nine states, the lowest cost silver plan will also change in 2015 (see chart, this page).\n\nCarriers that had the lowest-priced option a year ago could wind up losing members to competitors if people base their 2015 decisions on price, Elizabeth Carpenter, director at Avalere Health, tells HEX.\n\nEnrollees Can Be Automatically Re-enrolled\n\nHowever, enrollees who don\u2019t pay attention to cost increases, or who want to ensure continuity of care, might opt to stick with their existing coverage. On June 26, HHS said that people who enrolled in exchange-based coverage for 2014 could automatically be re-enrolled in their current plan for 2015. The idea is to reduce the need to repeat the application process. According to HHS, 95% of people who purchased coverage through the federal exchange could be automatically re-enrolled unless they opt to switch plans.\n\nTo see the full study, visit www.avalerehealth.com.\n\nNew Benchmark Plans May Cause Consumers to Switch Carriers\n\nMonthly Premium and Subsidies, 2014 vs. 2015\n\nConsider the following example: An individual in Maryland with an annual income of $17,500 (150% of the federal poverty level) enrolled in the benchmark silver plan for 2014. Monthly premiums were $214, but the federal subsidy dropped the member\u2019s monthly out-of-pocket costs to $58. However, the federal subsidy amount will be reduced if the plan isn\u2019t a benchmark plan for 2015. In this example, the enrollee would wind up paying $432 a year more in 2015 than in 2014.\n\nSOURCE AND METHODOLGY: Avalere Health, June 2014.
