It adds that the likelihood of poverty usually decreases across subsequent generations of immigrants.\n\nThe study also seemingly debunks the GOP talking point that immigrants commit more crimes than people born inside the U.S., finding that foreign-born men between the ages of 18 and 39 are incarcerated at one-fourth the rate of native-born American men in that same age group.\n\nThe study also looked at health and divorce rates among immigrants, of which it estimates there 41 million immigrants and 37.1 million U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States today. The report was funded, in part, by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nImmigration has been a marquee issue in the Republican primary, with Trump promising to send all illegal immigrants back to their home countries on \u201cday one\u201d in the Oval Office. Many in the crowded GOP field have followed his lead, agreeing that the U.S. should end birthright citizenship and build a wall along the U.S. southern border.\n\nRelated: Can the U.S. Handle 100,000 Syrian Refugees?\n\nOr, in the case of failed presidential candidate and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, build a wall to separate the United States and Canada.\n\nThe debate over immigration, at home and abroad, is likely to rage on after Pope Francis called on Americans to embrace immigrants from the south and those who are part of the exodus out of Syria.\n\n\u201cOur world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War,\u201d the Pope said Thursday in a historic address to a joint meeting of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation,\u201d Francis added. \u201cTo respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays--to discard whatever proves troublesome.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pope Francis Gently Challenges Congress to Do the Right Thing\n\nHis remarks left Republican lawmakers squirming in their seats, while Democrats rose to their feet with applause.\n\nWhile the newly-minted report will likely be welcome by pro-immigration advocates, it points out that there still several challenges that impede progress for those already in the country, including the often unpredictable status of parents who were not born in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s a new academic report out on the state of immigration in the United States and some Republican presidential candidates, especially frontrunner Donald Trump, might want to give it a read before taking the debate stage again.", "title": "New Report Tackles Immigration Stereotypes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/24/New-Report-Tackles-Immigration-Stereotypes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01102013_illegal_immigration_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/24/New-Report-Tackles-Immigration-Stereotypes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01102013_illegal_immigration_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There\u2019s a new academic report out on the state of immigration in the United States and some Republican presidential candidates, especially frontrunner Donald Trump, might want to give it a read before taking the debate stage again.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd365e\"", "article_summary": "Or, in the case of failed presidential candidate and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, build a wall to separate the United States and Canada.\nThere\u2019s a new academic report out on the state of immigration in the United States and some Republican presidential candidates, especially frontrunner Donald Trump, might want to give it a read before taking the debate stage again.\nThe report was funded, in part, by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\nThe debate over immigration, at home and abroad, is likely to rage on after Pope Francis called on Americans to embrace immigrants from the south and those who are part of the exodus out of Syria.\nThe study also looked at health and divorce rates among immigrants, of which it estimates there 41 million immigrants and 37.1 million U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States today."}
