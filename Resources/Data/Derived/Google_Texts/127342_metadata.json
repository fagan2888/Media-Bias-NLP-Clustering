Lynch has been fined $100,000 for twice refusing to speak to the media the past two years. He also has been fined for obscene gestures and wearing the wrong shoes.\n\nBackground: Lynch, 28, grew up on the rough streets of Oakland, then stayed close to home by playing his college ball in Berkeley at California. Three former Cal running backs were named to the Pro Bowl, Baltimore\u2019s Justin Forsett and Denver\u2019s C.J. Anderson being the others. Lynch was a first-round pick, No. 12 overall, by Buffalo in the 2007 draft. When the Bills started 0-4 in 2010, they traded him to Seattle for fourth- and fifth-round picks.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: There are two bad boys playing in this Super Bowl. New England quarterback Tom Brady is one. Lynch is the other. When Patriots defensive tackle Vince Wilfork called Lynch the best back in the NFL, it got me to thinking. Usually, the \u201cbest back\u201d argument is settled by who gains the most yards. But would you rather have Dallas\u2019 DeMarco Murray, who fumbles, or Lynch, who is an automatic third-and-1 back, in the game? Lynch the power runner, Russell Wilson the option-running, erratic-throwing quarterback, and the Seahawks\u2019 aggressive defense have dominated the otherwise pass-happy NFL the past two years. I\u2019m not a fan of Lynch\u2019s act. But that defiance helps make him a championship running back.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Marshawn Lynch,New England Patriots,Seattle Seahawks,Super Bowl,Super Bowl XLIX,Tom Brady,Vince Wilfork", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Spotlight on Marshawn Lynch, the running back for the Seattle Seahawks, and his value to the team in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.", "title": "Marshawn Lynch: Spotlight on the Seattle Seahawks RB", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/24/marshawn-lynch-spotlight-seattle-seahawks-running-back/32313/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/lynch-495x316.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Spotlight on Marshawn Lynch, the running back for the Seattle Seahawks, and his value to the team in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.", "title": "Marshawn Lynch: Spotlight on the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 running back", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/24/marshawn-lynch-spotlight-seattle-seahawks-running-back/32313/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/lynch-495x316.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Spotlight on Marshawn Lynch, the running back for the Seattle Seahawks, and his value to the team in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots."}, "article_summary": "When: Super Bowl week in the Phoenix area, where Lynch and the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks will play the AFC champion New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX next Sunday.\nWhat\u2019s up: There are media obligations for Super Bowl players Monday through Thursday \u2014 the big one coming Tuesday at the US Airways Center, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 arena.\nKlis\u2019 take: There are two bad boys playing in this Super Bowl.\nLynch the power runner, Russell Wilson the option-running, erratic-throwing quarterback, and the Seahawks\u2019 aggressive defense have dominated the otherwise pass-happy NFL the past two years.\nWhen the Bills started 0-4 in 2010, they traded him to Seattle for fourth- and fifth-round picks."}
