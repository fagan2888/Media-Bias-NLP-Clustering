The patient's lawyer, Mike Charnoff, told StatNews he has received multiple calls from patients seeking to file similar lawsuits since then. But most, he said, are less likely to win so resoundingly because the comments in question are less offensive or less likely to be recorded.\n\nMany states' laws, Massachusetts among them, prohibit recording without the consent of all involved parties, but Beth Israel Deaconess lacks a hospital-specific recording policy. To remedy this, hospital leaders have assembled a committee to develop one, with several other hospitals in the city telling the publication they already generally allow patients to record with staff consent.\n\nOther parts of the country are exploring the idea as well; this year, a Wisconsin legislator introduced a bill requiring cameras in every operating room in the state to determine the precise cause of medical errors, the nation's third-leading cause of death. Similar bills have been introduced, but failed to pass, in both Massachusetts and Mississippi, according to the article.\n\nThe Massachusetts Medical Society told StatNews that not only does recording create a sense of distrust between provider and patient by \"anticipating wrongdoing,\" it also raises logistical issues over potential videographer interference with the procedure, as well as the ever-present threat of the video finding its way onto social media.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAnesthesiologist must pay $500K for insulting man under sedation\n\n3 ways hospitals can reduce medical errors\n\nTips to improve patient handoffs, outcomes\n\nStudy: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errors\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nPrivacy violations: Small breaches also pose danger but rarely addressed\n\nCould recording surgeries reduce medical errors?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A contentious debate is unfolding within the healthcare industry over whether hospitals should allow patients to record their surgical procedures,\u00a0StatNews\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A contentious debate is unfolding within the healthcare industry over whether hospitals should allow patients to record their surgical procedures,\u00a0StatNews\u00a0reports.", "title": "Debate heats up over the recording of healthcare procedures", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/debate-heats-over-recording-healthcare-procedures/2015-12-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,doctor-patient relationship,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Privacy,patient safety,surgery,video recording", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "A contentious debate is unfolding within the healthcare industry over whether hospitals should allow patients to record their surgical procedures, StatNews reports.\nThe patient's lawyer, Mike Charnoff, told StatNews he has received multiple calls from patients seeking to file similar lawsuits since then.\nMany states' laws, Massachusetts among them, prohibit recording without the consent of all involved parties, but Beth Israel Deaconess lacks a hospital-specific recording policy.\nSimilar bills have been introduced, but failed to pass, in both Massachusetts and Mississippi, according to the article.\nOther parts of the country are exploring the idea as well; this year, a Wisconsin legislator introduced a bill requiring cameras in every operating room in the state to determine the precise cause of medical errors, the nation's third-leading cause of death."}
