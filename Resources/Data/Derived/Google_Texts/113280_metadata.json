It fits their favorite story line: Liberals are the real racists.\n\nBut even some non-wingnuts have piled on. The Root\u2019s Keli Goff blasted the decision as \u201cprogressive intolerance,\u201d insisting that the Kochs\u2019 support of public sector union busting \u201chas nothing to do with educating African-American students.\u201d That\u2019s led to renewed interest in AFSCME\u2019s move, which president Lee Saunders announced two weeks ago.\n\nIn a letter to UNCF president Michael Lomax, AFSCME\u2019s Saunders called the Kochs \u201cthe single most prominent funders of efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting.\u201d Lomax\u2019s appearance at the Koch brothers\u2019 annual summit, where they plot conservative strategy \u2013 this year\u2019s focus was taking back the Senate in 2014 \u2014 was \u201ca betrayal of everything the UNCF stands for.\u201d Members of AFSCME, a union that supports Democrats with money and people power, voted unanimously to back Saunders\u2019 decision at their annual convention in Chicago last week.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Democrat or Republican issue,\u201d Saunders told Salon, in his first interview since the fracas. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of right and wrong.\u201d\n\nStill, the critics keep coming. Just this week, in the right-wing Daily Caller, Raynard Jackson called it \u201ca stunning move that should anger every Black in America.\u201d In the backyard of Koch-critic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Las Vegas Review Journal called the decision \u201cridiculous,\u201d complaining that \u201cDemocrats and their supporters are quick to and fond of accusing conservatives and Republicans of being racists, but when Republican supporters such as the Kochs aim to demonstrate otherwise, a government employee union responds by causing direct harm to blacks.\u201d The Review Journal is a conservative paper, but the African-American newspaper South Florida Times, which is not, likewise insisted \u201cAFSCME must restore UNCF funding,\u201d though it called Lomax\u2019s decision to join the Koch summit \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that AFSCME has always said it would continue the scholarship program for students of color it began with UNCF, but will find different partners.\n\nClearly the controversy, which involves two venerable organizations, has African-Americans on both sides of the issue. Founded by Mary McLeod Bethune and others in 1944, the UNCF offers scholarships to black students and funds important but embattled historically black colleges and universities. AFSCME, the union Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was supporting when he was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, now has its first black president, Saunders, and African-Americans make up 15 percent of its membership.\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult decision for me to make as an African-American,\u201d says Saunders, the AFSCME leader who first approached former UNCF president Bill Gray with the notion of partnering on a scholarship program for students of color interested in labor movement careers, more than 10 years ago. Saunders says he personally raised money for UNCF for years.\n\nHe adds that if the Kochs had donated $25 million to UNCF \u201cand said \u2018here it is, do what you want to do with it,\u2019 maybe we would have taken a different tack. Maybe I would have swallowed it.\u201d But Lomax\u2019s participation in the Kochs\u2019 annual summit made the union draw \u201ca line in the sand,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Lomax did not respond to requests for comment. In an earlier statement about the controversy he said: \u201cWhile I am saddened by AFSCME\u2019s decision, it will not distract us from our mission of helping thousands of African-American students achieve their dream of a college degree and the economic benefits that come with it.\u201d In an interview with Education Week about some UNCF supporters\u2019 opposition to taking the Koch money, he argued \u201cI think that Washington\u2019s partisanship has really poisoned the thinking of some people all across the country.\u201d Koch spokesperson Melissa Cohlmia told AP the Kochs \u201chave devoted their lives to advancing tolerance and a free society \u2014 where every individual is judged on his or her individual merits and they are free to make decisions about their lives.\u201d\n\nAccording to reporting in the Nation by Lauren Windsor, who obtained a \u201cconfidential\u201d draft meeting agenda and spoke to participants, the summit Lomax attended drew Republican luminaries including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 three close races that are crucial to GOP hopes of taking back the Senate \u2013 along with 2016 presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio. No Democratic officeholders or candidates were included in the annual confab, which took place this year at the St. Regis Monarch Bay Resort in Dana Point, California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a key public sector union cuts ties with United Negro College Fund over Koch funding, the right strikes back", "author": "Joan Walsh", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As a key public sector union cuts ties with United Negro College Fund over Koch funding, the right strikes back", "title": "Koch brothers\u2019 new racial gambit: What\u2019s really behind a quiet battle with AFSCME", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/25/koch_brothers_new_racial_gambit_whats_really_behind_a_quiet_battle_with_afscme/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/saunders_koch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As a key public sector union cuts ties with United Negro College Fund over Koch funding, the right strikes back", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/saunders_koch.jpg", "title": "Koch brothers\u2019 new racial gambit: What\u2019s really behind a quiet battle with AFSCME", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Koch brothers\u2019 new racial gambit: What\u2019s really behind a quiet battle with AFSCME", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AFSCME, David Koch, Editor's Picks, Koch Brothers, koch industries, Labor movement, Lee Saunders, Michael Lomax, The Nation, United Negro College Fund", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe178b\"", "article_summary": "Martin Luther King Jr. was supporting when he was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, now has its first black president, Saunders, and African-Americans make up 15 percent of its membership.\nAFSCME, the union Rev.\nMaybe I would have swallowed it.\u201d But Lomax\u2019s participation in the Kochs\u2019 annual summit made the union draw \u201ca line in the sand,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is not a Democrat or Republican issue,\u201d Saunders told Salon, in his first interview since the fracas.\nFounded by Mary McLeod Bethune and others in 1944, the UNCF offers scholarships to black students and funds important but embattled historically black colleges and universities."}
