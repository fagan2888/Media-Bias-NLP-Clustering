The groups believe the Obama administration\u2019s move to end the health plans of customers who failed to prove their legal immigration or citizenship status violate customers\u2019 rights as immigrants.\n\nThe Obama administration terminated 115,000 customers\u2019 Obamacare exchange health insurance on September 30, after customers failed to submit required documentation to prove their legal status in the U.S. (RELATED: Vitter: Obama Admin \u2018Bending Over Backwards To Give Obamacare To Illegal Immigrants\u2019)\n\nThe administration said it first reached out to each customer between eight and ten times through mail, phone and e-mail in an attempt to get them to update their documents on HealthCare.gov before finally kicking them off their plans.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for some immigrants, according to the complaints, because the many notices and messages were only left in English and Spanish. The notices directed customers to contact HealthCare.gov, but the groups believe that despite being contacted by the federal government up to ten times, some people didn\u2019t understand the severity of the situation.\n\n\u201cCMS is not taking responsibility for completely failing on the language-access provision,\u201d said Thoai Nguyen, SEAMAAC CEO.\n\nThe Obama administration immediately created a special enrollment period for the customers affected, which allows them to sign up for new coverage at HealthCare.gov again at any time, as opposed to waiting for the open enrollment period to begin again on November 15. That\u2019s not good enough either, according to some advocates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried that the people we\u2019re working on behalf of don\u2019t realize that this is available to them,\u201d Alvaro Huerto, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, told Modern Healthcare.\n\nSeveral consumer advocate groups have reported for weeks that despite their attempts to update their information on HealthCare.gov as directed, the website still wasn\u2019t working properly enough for it to go through.\n\nSome couldn\u2019t access their accounts, others had to send in documentation multiple times and even though it appeared to go through on the website, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they had no record of it. (RELATED: Report: HealthCare.gov Still Doesn\u2019t Work)\n\nIn the complaints, the groups worry that customers who were finally kicked off their plans will temporarily lose access to taxpayer subsidies for their coverage.\n\n\u201cMany of ICIRR\u2019s clients are low-income clients and are elderly or disabled,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIf these individuals lose their subsidies, they will not be able to afford the health insurance they need. To make matters worse, many clients submitted the requested immigration or citizenship documents, but for some reason these documents were not processed.\u201d\n\nEither way, open enrollment begins in full-force in just over one month.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'If these individuals lose their subsidies, they will not be able to afford the health insurance they need'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Two immigration groups have filed legal complaints against the Obama administration for kicking over one hundred thousand Obamacare customers off their insurance plans without sending notices in their", "title": "Immigrants Kicked Off Obamacare Now Suing Over Discrimination", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/03/immigrants-kicked-off-obamacare-now-suing-over-discrimination/", "image": {"width": 1185, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "height": 552}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'If these individuals lose their subsidies, they will not be able to afford the health insurance they need'", "title": "Immigrants Kicked Off Obamacare Now Suing Over Discrimination Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/03/immigrants-kicked-off-obamacare-now-suing-over-discrimination/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-03 16:28:19", "sailthru.title": "Immigrants Kicked Off Obamacare Now Suing Over Discrimination", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "immigration,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "immigration", "sailthru.description": "Two immigration groups have filed legal complaints against the Obama administration for kicking over one hundred thousand Obamacare customers off their insurance plans without sending notices in their", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4a1\"", "article_summary": "The groups believe the Obama administration\u2019s move to end the health plans of customers who failed to prove their legal immigration or citizenship status violate customers\u2019 rights as immigrants.\n4336338Two immigration groups have filed legal complaints against the Obama administration for kicking over one hundred thousand Obamacare customers off their insurance plans without sending notices in their native language, Modern Healthcare reports.\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for some immigrants, according to the complaints, because the many notices and messages were only left in English and Spanish.\n(RELATED: Report: HealthCare.gov Still Doesn\u2019t Work)In the complaints, the groups worry that customers who were finally kicked off their plans will temporarily lose access to taxpayer subsidies for their coverage.\n\u201cIf these individuals lose their subsidies, they will not be able to afford the health insurance they need."}
