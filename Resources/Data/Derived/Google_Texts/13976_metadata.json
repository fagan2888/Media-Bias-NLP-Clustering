The office of Bush\u2019s husband, former President George H.W. Bush, issued a statement about her hospitalization: \u201cFormer First Lady Barbara Bush was admitted to Methodist Hospital in Houston\u2019s Texas Medical Center yesterday for treatment on a respiratory related issue. She is in great spirits, has already received visits from her husband and family, and is receiving fantastic care. Updates will be issued when warranted.\u201d\n\nThe former first lady has had a long history of health problems. In 1989, she revealed that she suffered from Grave\u2019s disease. The condition causes the body to overproduce thyroid hormones, which can result in symptoms including hand tremors, bulging eyes, and rapid or irregular heartbeat. In 2008, Mrs. Bush underwent two surgeries: one to close a hole in her small intestine and another to replace her aortic valve.\n\nMrs. Bush remains in \u201cgood spirits\u201d as her family awaits news on when she\u2019ll be able to return home. Her husband has been a frequent visitor during her hospital stay. Current President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton both sent get-well soon messages to Mrs. Bush on Wednesday. \"Michelle and I send our best wishes to Mrs. Bush for a speedy recovery. Barbara is blessed to have both a loving, supportive family by her side and a vibrant spirit that we hope will have her feeling better soon,\u201d President Obama said in a statement released New Year's Day. And Clinton tweeted his well wishes: \"I'll be rooting for Barbara Bush's full recovery while she's rooting for Baylor today. All my best to her and George H.W. Bush.\"\n\n\"She's still doing great, still in great spirits. We have not heard any plans for discharge just yet \u2014 we're still in a wait-and-see mode,\" family spokesman Jim McGrath told the Los Angeles Times. \"She's keen to get home to her dogs and her husband \u2014 and not in that order. When I talk to her, she sounds like she's 100 percent. She doesn't want anybody to make a fuss \u2014 that's Barbara Bush.\u201d\n\nMcGrath said former President Bush and Mrs. Bush celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve by watching the Texas A&M football game together.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "barbara bush, hospitalized", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Former first lady Barbara Bush was hospitalized Monday for a respiratory-related illness.
