INDIANAPOLIS — Nothing creates buzz at the NFL combine like quarterbacks. Their workouts become the sporting equivalent of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Every movement is scrutinized. Every wrinkle examined, every mood analyzed.

Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota delivered in their performances at Lucas Oil Stadium. Winston provided energy and leadership in drills and threw exceptionally well, displaying touch and accuracy. Mariota showed elite athleticism and better footwork on drops than expected.

They headlined the event. John Elway did not when he was the top player in the country.

Funny story about that.

Back in 1983, regional combines provided platforms for players, not a single centralized event. Elway had no plans to attend. That’s when things became weird. He flew to Seattle for an award ceremony. Turns out the banquet and combine hotel were one in the same. Elway picks up the story from here.

“I was going to a Gold Helmet award deal in Seattle, and they were checking all the guys into the combine at the same time. I was checking in for the event, and they grabbed me and checked me into the combine,” Elway said last week. “Then I called my dad and said, ‘Dad there’s a combine up here. I didn’t know anything about it.’ He told me to go the banquet that night and get up early the next morning and get a cab and get a cab to the airport. I was up at 5:30, and left.”

So let history show that Elway checked in, but did not attend. He joked that he didn’t want the evaluators to see his bad knee, admitting he would be “killed now” by the media if he skipped the combine as the draft’s top player. Elway understands the newfound attention for the combine, but defends quarterbacks who do limited work at the event.

“That’s why you have a Pro Day,” Elway said. “You can see them there just as easily.”
