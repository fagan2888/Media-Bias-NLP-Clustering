Your confessional clock is ticking.\n\nWith Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement - starting at sunset Friday (and ending the following night), this is your last chance to wipe your slates clean of the wrongs you\u2019ve committed over the past year.\n\nOh, sure, you\u2019ll be able to participate in a communal confession of sins Saturday in synagogue. But we know as well as you do that your community won\u2019t hear everything you did.\n\nIt\u2019s time to fess up.\n\nBlending ancient tradition with modern innovation, there\u2019s a newish Jewish Web app to help you lighten the load of guilt and spill your bad deeds. It\u2019s called eScapegoat, and the whimsical tool lets you type your confessions in a Twitter-friendly format and see others\u2019 also.\n\nBest of all, you can remain utterly anonymous. Rabbis might call this cheating. We\u2019re having too much fun to care.\n\n\u201cI claimed the soup was vegan. It wasn\u2019t,\u201d wrote one sinner.\n\n\u201cI yell at people from my car, even if they aren\u2019t driving poorly,\u201d shared another.\n\n\u201cI am hot with shame that my son only has a brown belt in his Kung Fu training,\u201d said a third.\n\nThe force behind this endeavor is G-dcast, a San Francisco nonprofit committed to making Jewish learning fun through animated videos, apps and more.\n\nThe organization\u2019s name, if anyone\u2019s confused, is written this way because in the Jewish tradition it\u2019s considered a no-no to write the name of God - hence the hyphen.\n\nCalling the Web app eScapegoat is a play on a practice observed during biblical times when the Temple still stood in Jerusalem and sacrifices were offered for atonement.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked way back then during what we now know as Yom Kippur, according to the confessional tool:\n\nThe High Priest took two goats. He sacrificed one and then he laid his hands on the other, transferring the community\u2019s sins into it. Then, he sent the SCAPEGOAT off into the wilderness. From the goat\u2019s perspective, neither path ended well.\n\nYou, dear friends, can\u2019t rely on some wandering, set-up-to-die goat to do your bidding - which is why you are commanded to make public confessions in synagogue during Yom Kippur.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean burdens can\u2019t be laid on a virtual goat, too. Right?\n\nThe Web app was launched on August 9 during the first week of Elul, the month on the Jewish calendar that precedes the High Holy Days - which start with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and end 10 days later with Yom Kippur.\n\nElul is the time when Jews traditionally self-reflect, look back on their year, take stock of how they behaved and think about what they can do better.\n\nAnd if they can replace \u201ccrappy mobile device time with meaningful mobile device time,\u201d all the better, said Sarah Lefton, G-dcast\u2019s executive director and producer.\n\nBy Thursday night, nearly 5,000 confessions had been \u201claid on the goat,\u201d Lefton reported. And nearly 21,000 \u201cgoaters,\u201d or Web app visitors, had stopped by.\n\nA compilation of some of G-dcast\u2019s favorite sins, so far, also were released as the eScapegoat approached his final hours.\n\nSomeone at G-dcast set out to categorize the kinds of sins that were coming in earlier this week. The resulting themes, Lefton said, generally focused on lying, Internet use, anger, gossip, lack of time spent with loved ones and cheating.\n\nSome of the confessions have been downright heavy.\n\n\u201cI should have had the baby,\u201d one wrote, according to Lefton.\n\n\u201cI was never in love with my fianc\u00e9e and should have told her,\u201d said another on the Twitter account set up to list sins, aptly named @Sinfulgoat.\n\nAlso spotted was the one who wrote in, \u201cFor cutting, starving and disrespecting my body.\u201d\n\nDid Lefton, 40, and the others expect such seriousness?\n\n\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t. At all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the generation after me is so into oversharing, so it shouldn\u2019t surprise me. But it still does.\u201d\n\nAnother surprise has been the number of confessions directly related to Judaism. Several illustrated the tensions some Jews face this time of year.\n\n\u201cMy family is no longer interested in practicing Judaism. I resent them for it. I feel they\u2019ve taken something from me,\u201d wrote one person.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for all the sins I committed that I didn\u2019t even know were sins because I lost touch with my Judaism,\u201d another said.\n\nAnd a third: \u201cI am going to Las Vegas on Yom Kippur \u2026 That cannot be good \u2026\u201d\n\nLefton doesn\u2019t want anyone thinking eScapegoat is a substitute for the real deal.\n\n\u201cThis Web app is in no way trying to replace public confession,\u201d she said. \u201cWe designed it as a lighthearted warm-up for the Day of Atonement. But if people are getting something more profound out of it, that\u2019s great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jessica Ravitz, CNN (CNN) -- Calling all Jews!
