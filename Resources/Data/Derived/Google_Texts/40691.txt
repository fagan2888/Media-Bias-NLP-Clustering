VAIL — In maybe one of the most progressive halfpipe contests ever, a dynamic collection of multitalented snowboarders — from a Cinderella-story 14-year-old newcomer to technically versed, style-rich veterans — thrilled thousands gathered at the Vail halfpipe Saturday.

Shaun White, who qualified first, staked his claim on his 10th Burton U.S. Open title, elevating more than 25 feet on his first run — possibly the largest backside air ever thrown in a halfpipe — and following it with the most technical riding of his career. More than 10 points separated White from the rest of the field for the entire contest as he unleashed his frustration after finishing last in Friday’s slopestyle contest.

Oregon’s Ben Ferguson, 21, was smooth in the transitions and explosive in the air, earning silver with lofty double-corks on his final run. U.S. Open defending champion Taku Hiraoka, of Japan, which boasts a stable of up-and-coming riders who are challenging America’s long-standing dominance, took silver with the contest’s only front-side 1440 at the bottom of the pipe, finishing 0.4 points behind Ferguson.

The crowd favorite was unquestionably Judd Henkes, a 14-year-old who climbed into the finals after winning the U.S. Open’s pre-event junior jam. While lacking the veterans’ technicality, Henkes had some of the most stratospheric airs of the contest.

The women’s halfpipe contest was, once again, the Chloe Kim show. Adding an exclamation point to a virtually perfect season, the 15-year-old Kim linked consecutive 1080s to soar past any other competitor. China’s Cai Xuetong earned silver, followed by 32-year-old Kelly Clark, who battled through a hip injury to stick a run that included the front-side 1080 she pioneered, a trick that has enabled her protégé, Kim, to reach the highest level ever seen in women’s halfpipe riding.
