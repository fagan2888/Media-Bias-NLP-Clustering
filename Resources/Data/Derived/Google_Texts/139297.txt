A simple answer to the attention-grabbing headline you see above would be no, it is not possible for a human being to eat a bus. A more intricate answer would be yes, if a person was born with an abnormally thick stomach and the bus was broken down into tiny pieces that could pass through the gastrointestinal tract unimpeded, they could “eat” a bus.

That person would also most likely suffer from pica, an eating disorder that causes people to eat indigestible objects, such as rubber, metal, and glass. Examples of real-life pica cases in the past have included a child who compulsively ate hair, a 6-year-old boy who refused to stop eating moss, and a mother who claimed she only ate sand and sponges during two pregnancies.

Digestive enzymes are tasked with breaking down food chemically. Although they are found throughout the digestive tract, they are picky about which foods they break down and, unsurprisingly, metal does not make the list. For example, people with lactose intolerance are incapable of producing enough levels of the enzyme lactase which is tasked with breaking down lactose found in milk, yogurt, or cheese.

If you’re looking to calculate the number of inanimate objects a person can eat, look no further than French entertainer Michel Lotito, also known as “Mr. Eat Everything.” Lotito’s list of inedible items consumed includes bikes, shopping carts, televisions, chandeliers, a pair of skis, a coffin, a computer, and, last but certainly not least, an entire Cessna 150 airplane.

Warning: Michel Lotito did, in fact, have an unusually thick stomach lining and did suffer from pica. He also died at age 57 due to “natural causes.” Attempting to eat an entire bus without a thick stomach would undoubtedly lead to a blocked intestine, other surgical emergencies, or lead poisoning.
