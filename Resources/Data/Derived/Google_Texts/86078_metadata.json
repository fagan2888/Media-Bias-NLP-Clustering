The Rockies rookie catcher sat in the dugout, studiously taking notes on a pad of paper, waiting for his turn behind the plate.\n\nHis chance came Sunday. Wolters, the 23-year-old former infielder who had never played above Double-A, started his first game. He passed.\n\n\u201cThat first pitch, my knees were shaking,\u201d Wolters said. A single to right field off San Diego\u2019s James Shields in the fifth inning marked Wolters\u2019 first hit.\n\nBut his throw to second to catch Alexei Ramirez trying to steal in the seventh was the highlight in Wolters\u2019 mind.\n\n\u201cI loved it. If I have a chance, no one will steal on me,\u201d he said.\n\nWolters helped Rockies right-hander Chad Bettis work through seven innings in shutting down the Padres, after they collaborated for two days on a gameplan.\n\nTwo years ago, Wolters was a minor-league middle infielder, until Cleveland manager Terry Francona convinced him to change. He flashed a shortstop\u2019s hands twice in the second inning, tracking back to catch two pop-ups, from Wil Myers and Ramirez.\n\n\u201cHe took control,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many shakes. We clicked well together.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa struggling. The Rockies somehow made it through nine innings Saturday in a blowout loss to the Padres \u2014 a minor miracle in itself when you\u2019re on the wrong side of a 16-3 score \u2014 but it left them with plenty of pitching problems going forward.\n\nNo. 1 starter Jorge De La Rosa struggled again, throwing just four innings. In two starts this season, De La Rosa allowed 12 runs in just 8 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t look like himself,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cThe fastball command was very un-typical. His velocity looked a tick down. He went very soft, a lot of changeups.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa, who walked five batters in the loss, left the clubhouse Saturday night without speaking. Weiss insisted the left-hander was healthy and strong after throwing 97 pitches, even if his velocity was down.\n\n\u201cIt just looked like he was laboring from the get-go,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI guess you can say he got stretched out a little bit, but that\u2019s not the formula we\u2019re looking for here.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa in his career struggles out of the gate. He has a 4.96 in the first half of seasons, but 4.19 in the second half. \u201cHe\u2019s a notoriously slow starter, so we\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nDe La Rosa\u2019s abbreviated outings left the Rockies with a ragged bullpen. They used four pitchers in relief Saturday, forcing Chris Rusin and Miguel Castro to throw two innings apiece. Castro, though, bounced back for another scoreless inning Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe last couple nights, we were just trying to get through the game,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe have the pieces to match up, but you have to get into a position to do it.\u201d\n\nBergman in the rotation. Right-hander Christian Bergman is penciled in to start Thursday for the Rockies against the Giants, moving from his long-relief role in the bullpen into the rotation. He would be the Rockies\u2019 fifth starter \u2014 but only if they don\u2019t need him in relief before then.\n\nJon Gray (abdominal strain) pitched 4 innings Sunday in a rehab start for Single-A Modesto, giving up two runs on four hits. If another rehab start goes well, Gray will take back Bergman\u2019s place in the rotation.\n\nFootnotes. James Shields had won four consecutive games against the Rockies before losing Sunday. He\u2019s now 6-2 with a 4.75 ERA in nine starts at Coors Field\u2026 Carlos Gonzalez extended a hitting streak, dating to last season, to 16 games. Trevor Story has hit safely in all six games this season (seven home runs, two singles).\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Giants RHP Jeff Samardzija (0-0, 5.06 ERA) at Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (1-0, 1.42), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Giants RHP Jake Peavy (0-0, 7.20) at Rockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 13.50), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Giants RHP Matt Cain (0-0, 3.00) at Rockies RHP Christian Bergman (0-1, 12.00), 1:10 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Tony Wolters successful in major-league debut", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Tony Wolters successful in major-league debut", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/10/rockies-tony-wolters-successful-in-major-league-debut/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160410__Tony-Woltersp1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160410__Tony-Woltersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-10T19:32:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T14:04:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Looking AheadMonday: OffTuesday: Giants RHP Jeff Samardzija (0-0, 5.06 ERA) at Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (1-0, 1.42), 6:40 p.m., ROOTWednesday: Giants RHP Jake Peavy (0-0, 7.20) at Rockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 13.50), 6:40 p.m., ROOTThursday: Giants RHP Matt Cain (0-0, 3.00) at Rockies RHP Christian Bergman (0-1, 12.00), 1:10 p.m., ROOT\nHe went very soft, a lot of changeups.\u201dDe La Rosa, who walked five batters in the loss, left the clubhouse Saturday night without speaking.\nWolters helped Rockies right-hander Chad Bettis work through seven innings in shutting down the Padres, after they collaborated for two days on a gameplan.\nWe clicked well together.\u201dDe La Rosa struggling.\nIn two starts this season, De La Rosa allowed 12 runs in just 8 2/3 innings."}
