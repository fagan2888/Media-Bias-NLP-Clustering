Labor-union leaders have been complaining too.\n\nIn July, the presidents of the Teamsters, the United Food Commercial Workers, and UNITE-HERE (combined membership: 2.9 million) wrote a letter to congressional Democrats saying that Obamacare would \u201cdestroy the very health and well-being of our members along with millions of other working Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d they concluded. \u201cYou need to fix it.\u201d\n\nForget for a moment that organized labor supported Obamacare. The union leaders have arguably legitimate complaints.\n\nObamacare does indeed create incentives for employers to reduce the workweek below 30 hours. It also discourages the high-benefit \u201cCadillac plans\u201d that unions have negotiated \u2014 and that are one thing they can promise workers in organization drives.\n\nObamacare taxes premiums on non-profit, multi-employer union plans that cover, for example, workers in multiple small restaurants. And the people in these plans won\u2019t be eligible for subsidies available to policyholders in for-profit insurers.\n\nThe union leaders were understandably ticked at the \u201chuge accommodation for the employer community \u2014 extending the statutorily mandated \u2018December 31, 2013\u2019 deadline for the employer mandate and penalties.\u201d\n\nLike many other Americans, they are angry that President Obama refused to fulfill his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the law.\n\nOn a late Friday afternoon in September, the Obama administration denied the unions\u2019 request that workers with multi-employer health plans receive subsidies on the exchanges. It was also on a late Friday afternoon \u2014 in July \u2013 that the employer-mandate delay was announced.\n\nTo which Terry O\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers International Union, said he wanted the law \u201cfixed, fixed, fixed\u201d and, if not, \u201cthen I believe it needs to be repealed.\u201d\n\nConsistent opponents of Obamacare might take satisfaction from these complaints. And they might observe that the unions backed legislation that tends to encourage union members to drop union plans and to prevent unions from attracting new members by promising Cadillac plans. They got what they deserved.\n\nI take a somewhat different view. Over many decades, union leaders have supported legislation that extends to non-members benefits unions have secured for members.\n\nThey have consistently supported higher minimum wages \u2014 arguably because they bump up (already higher) union wages \u2014 ignoring the strong evidence that higher minimums reduce low-skill employment.\n\nThey supported the creation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act regulating pensions, even though such legislation, by extending benefits to non-union workers, made them less likely to feel a need for union representation. You don\u2019t need a shop steward if you have an OSHA inspector.\n\nAnd in fact, union representation in the private sector has plummeted in the last three decades. Unions\u2019 support of such legislation, and of Obamacare, may have been self-destructive.\n\nBut it could also be characterized as altruistic. Many union leaders wanted to extend to non-members what they believed they extended to members. People like to do well, but they also want to do good.\n\nLet me cite two professions that worked to put themselves out of much business, out of altruism.\n\nFirefighters are the first example. Firefighter unions and other organizations have actively promoted safer building codes, restrictions on use of flammable materials, and restrictions on unsafe building materials.\n\nThese firefighters have lifted the charred bodies of dead children out of burnt-out buildings. They have seen families destroyed by needless fires.\n\nThey have worked to prevent such tragedies. And worked successfully: There are many fewer fires than there used to be.\n\nFirefighters have done themselves out of business. They spend most of their time now on routine services, which less expensive EMS personnel could handle, and their unions struggle to prevent layoffs.\n\nAnother altruistic profession is dentistry. For many decades, dental groups have promoted fluoridation of water. They have vigorously encouraged people to brush \u2014 and floss \u2014 thrice daily.\n\nIn their practices, they have seen the pain people suffer from because of defective teeth and painful abscesses. They want to reduce such suffering.\n\nAs a result, Americans have far fewer cavities and dentists have far less routine work than they did some years ago. In response, they have developed new specialties \u2014 periodontal care, enamelizing, and orthodonture.\n\nSure, all these professions are out to get, in the words of the classic union leader Samuel Gompers, \u201cmore.\u201d\n\nBut labor leaders, firefighters, and dentists have also acted, at risk of losing business, out of altruism, to help others. Let\u2019s give union leaders some credit for that, even as they decry a law they supported.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2013 The Washington Examiner.
