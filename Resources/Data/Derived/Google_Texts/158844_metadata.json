Norovirus is, to put it mildly, misery incarnate. One minute you're fine, and the next you think you're dying -- or that dying would be preferable.\n\nMy first infection was almost certainly acquired at a Hanukkah party several years ago; at least 23 attendees became ill. The next evening at a school event with my grandsons, I abruptly abandoned them to race to the restroom. I sweated through my clothes and could not stand unaided. I spent the night on my bathroom floor, with frequent intermissions on the toilet.\n\nFast forward to this February. The symptoms were virtually identical, but this time I could only guess at the source of my discomfort: a salmon-avocado sushi roll I had eaten for lunch 36 hours earlier.\n\nNoroviruses have the dubious distinction of being the leading cause of gastrointestinal infections in the United States, where they account for an estimated half of all such ailments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that each year noroviruses cause an estimated 21 million illnesses and 800 deaths.\n\nAbout 80 percent of infections occur from November to April, when people tend to congregate in enclosed spaces with little fresh air circulating.\n\nThe current strain, first identified in Sydney in 2012, has been responsible for several outbreaks on cruise ships, where the highly contagious and difficult-to-kill virus can easily infect hundreds of passengers.\n\nNausea, vomiting and diarrhea are the usual symptoms. Others include stomach cramps, muscle aches, low-grade fever, headache and fatigue that can persist for days after the main symptoms abate. Although usually lasting just one to three days, a norovirus infection can be hazardous, particularly for infants, the elderly and people with compromised immunity. The greatest risk is dehydration stemming from vomiting and watery diarrhea.\n\nThe virus spreads readily in confined spaces like day care and retirement centers, schools, hotels and nursing homes.\n\nA case, or capsid, that surrounds the virus makes it especially hard to kill. It can even survive hand (and sometimes machine) dishwashing and laundering. And when a toilet with contaminated excretions is flushed, the virus can become airborne unless the lid is shut first.\n\nContaminated clothing, linens and towels should be handled carefully (preferably with gloves), machine-washed separately in hot water, and machine-dried. Contaminated toilets and other hard surfaces should be washed with a 10 percent bleach solution (one part bleach to nine parts water), hydrogen peroxide, Lysol or a commercial bleach-based cleaning product. Carpets and upholstered furniture need steam cleaning.\n\nNo vaccine is yet available. The existence of at least five genetic groups and 31 subgroups of norovirus makes developing an effective vaccine difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, frequent hand washing with soap and hot water for at least 30 seconds, especially after using the toilet, is the best preventive. Failing to do so risks transferring the virus to foods, drinks or utensils used by others. It takes only a small inoculation of norovirus to cause illness.\n\nFurthermore, the virus can persist for days or weeks on hard surfaces, which speaks to the importance of thoroughly washing your hands before eating, preparing food and drinks or serving others. You can also infect yourself by touching your nose or mouth with virus-contaminated hands.\n\nThere is no treatment other than replacing lost fluids. If vomiting is severe, medications can reduce it, but experts advise against taking an antidiarrheal drug like Lomotil or Imodium, which can prolong the infection.\n\nIt is best to avoid sugary drinks, which can aggravate diarrhea. My doctor advised me to follow a so-called BRAT diet -- bananas, rice, applesauce and toast -- for a day or so, supplemented by plain fluids, broth or diluted juice.\n\nDrink a cup of liquid to compensate for each large, loose stool. A rehydration drink like Pedialyte is suitable for adults as well as babies and children. But avoid foods high in fat and sugar, as well as spicy foods, alcohol and coffee, for about two days after symptoms are gone.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/02/saxoNOROVIRUS.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Failing to do so risks transferring the virus to foods, drinks or utensils used by others.\nAlthough usually lasting just one to three days, a norovirus infection can be hazardous, particularly for infants, the elderly and people with compromised immunity.\nBut now that I've endured two separate bouts of this bug, formerly called Norwalk virus and now known as norovirus, my empathy has skyrocketed.\nThe existence of at least five genetic groups and 31 subgroups of norovirus makes developing an effective vaccine difficult.\nNorovirus is, to put it mildly, misery incarnate."}
