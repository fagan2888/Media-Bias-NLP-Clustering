If you’ve been aching for more brilliance from “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,” or if you just need something uplifting during this bleak summer news cycle, look no further. This weekend’s “StarTalk” was between Neil deGrasse Tyson and Ann Druyan, “Cosmos” creator, executive producer and co-writer, who just won a Creative Arts Emmy.

The lovely conversation covers how Druyan met Carl Sagan — whom she was married to — creating the original “Cosmos” series, writing to keep people hooked during commercials, the “Cosmos” reboot and everything in-between.

“Cosmos is that intersection where your brain, your heart, your eye, your ear, your soul can all be operating at full tilt,” Druyan explains. “It is not any one important human component at the expense of the other. So, in other words, no fantasy, which breaks the laws of science. No science that is demoted of its awe-inspiring impact. You’re allowed to feel. You’re not allowed to lie, you’re not allowed to distort, or deceive yourself or others. No, you’ve got to be straight about how the universe is put together. You’ve got to be honest. But to me it’s the greatest source of that soaring feeling there is.”
