Find the space between its teeth, on the rubbery, wet gums, and hook your fingers inside. Or go for a headlock. Or wedge a hip into the soft space between its neck and shoulder.\n\nDeanna Trujillo-James recommends trying it all.\n\nShe has four pairs of hats, five pairs of boots, good luck jeans and good luck shirts. On weekends, she will drive from her home in Oakland to a beaten-up rodeo ground off the highway in Morgan Hill, sign a waiver, and tussle with cattle for hours. At parties, when people ask her hobbies, she tells them, \u201cI wrestle steers.\u201d\n\nTrujillo-James is one of hundreds of amateur contestants who, every February through October, suit up for the gay rodeo circuit, a series of local rodeo competitions that span gay communities across the nation, including an arena near the famed Las Vegas Strip and the state fairgrounds in Oklahoma City.\n\nOver the course of eight months, competitors work to collect enough points to get the coveted letter in the mail, inviting them to October\u2019s World Gay Rodeo Finals in Fort Worth, Texas. There, the champions walk away with prize money, bragging rights and a collection of the wide, shiny belt buckles that mark rodeo elite in any league. The spectators cheer and party.\n\n\u201cTo compete there,\u201d Trujillo-James said, \u201ctakes your breath away.\u201d\n\nSuch moments of grace aren\u2019t common in the sport. Rodeo is an often muddy, sweaty competition, where chutes clang open, competitors thud into paddock dirt, and cattle and horses throw kicks that can break riders\u2019 bones.\n\nBut it is also a historic American pursuit, a mix of Spanish and Mexican horsemanship and the frontier skills of the American cowboy \u2014 roping, riding, herding. Today, rodeo grounds span the United States and the prairie provinces of Canada.\n\nTraditionally a sport of cattle towns, rodeo is both growing and opening up. Within the United States, gay, Native American, black, Hispanic, and Hawaiian groups all host rodeos.\n\nGay rodeo is a smaller, amateur version of the big-money professional rodeo circuit, but with a more pronounced mission. It had humble beginnings in 1975, when the gay community in Reno wanted to throw a rodeo for charity but struggled to find a local rancher who would rent livestock for a gay event.\n\nOut of that first assortment of five cows, a pig and a pony, gay rodeo has become a complex enterprise. This year, 12 states and Canada will host gay rodeos, and \u201cQueens and Cowboys,\u201d an independent documentary about the circuit, is raising awareness of the sport on the film festival circuit. In keeping with tradition, many rodeos still raise money for charity.\n\nLike a lot of competitors, Trujillo-James did not grow up watching cowboys bucking bulls. She was a studious kid in Southern California, raised by a single mother with a big extended family. When her family discovered she was dating a woman, she and her mother stopped speaking.\n\nJudy James is Trujillo-James\u2019 wife, and a gay rodeo promoter. Her father would take her to rodeos in his native Wyoming every year. Like Trujillo-James, coming out was a trial for James. She ran away from home at 17, after her parents found her love letters to another woman. She was legally emancipated from her family just before turning 18, after a family intervention went bad and her father ended up pointing a gun at her, James said.\n\nBut rodeo was a bond in both families.\n\nOn their last visit to see James\u2019 father before he died, they took him out to the same rodeo she had visited as a child.\n\n\u201cThe greatest joy in my life is that father got to meet Dee, and accepted her,\u201d James said.\n\nTrujillo-James\u2019 mother now regales friends with stories about her cowgirl daughter. For years, she had hoped her daughter\u2019s interest in women was \u201cjust a phase,\u201d but now discusses gay rodeo with pride.\n\n\u201cShe tells people, \u2018My daughter\u2019s a gay cowgirl.\u2019 She loves educating people,\u201d Trujillo-James said.\n\nWhat sets gay rodeo apart from other rodeo leagues is its resolutely amateur nature.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of competitors \u2014 straight and gay \u2014 who choose our rodeo because they are going to get challenged off some pretty good livestock, but not as much as the mainstream rodeo where the livestock are just going to knock you out,\u201d Judy James said.\n\nAlso, gay rodeo is gender-neutral, allowing men and women to compete equally in events. While women are often restricted to barrel racing or other non-contact events in traditional rodeo, women competitors in gay rodeos can bull ride, bareback ride and wrestle steers.\n\nGay rodeo incorporates the traditional events found in any rodeo, like riding and roping, with decidedly non-traditional ones: putting panties on a goat, or helping a drag queen ride a bull.\n\n\u201cThere are things you\u2019re just not going to find anywhere but a gay rodeo,\u201d Trujillo-James said.\n\nUnlike the pro leagues, no one is going to make a living off gay rodeo. Competitors often pay nearly as much in entry fees as they will make in prize money, sometimes more than $100 per weekend for a $250 prize. But Judy James says the finances are beside the point. Instead, it\u2019s an opportunity \u2014 even outside the arena \u2014 to be a part of a deeper culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Batman lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is who we are. I may not wear a cowboy hat here, but it\u2019s still a part of me.\u201d\n\nEven in San Francisco\u2019s Castro District, an epicenter for gay fashion and culture, a cowboy hat and a pair of boots turns heads. Within the Bay Area\u2019s gay community, rodeo competitors are a small, tight-knit group.\n\nDressed in their full Western outfits, they sometimes become objects of fascination on nights out. \u201cIt\u2019s a reversal. Now we\u2019re the grand dames of the ball because there are eight of us in a room full of hundreds of drag queens,\u201d Trujillo-James said.\n\nIn the small towns in the Bay Area where they sometimes compete \u2014 like the mountain town of La Honda in San Mateo County \u2014 the reaction is similar. \u201cWhen we show up, people shout, \u2018Gay cowboys are here!\u2019 We bring in a lot of business to these small communities,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the rodeo world is changing around them.\n\nBill Lyle is an old hand at the sport; he rode his first bull at 14 and aches from old competition injuries. Today, he runs the rodeo grounds where Trujillo-James trains in Morgan Hill, and supplies bulls for gay and traditional rodeos.\n\nLyle has seen rodeo wax and wane in popularity. Its peak saw riders seduced by movies such as \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d in 1980, he said, but the Professional Bull Riders craze has swept a lot of interest away from the traditional competition. Now, when he hosts a rodeo, it\u2019s usually in Spanish.\n\nBoth he and rodeo promoter KC Andersen worry about the future of the sport in a rapidly urbanizing Bay Area. Andersen said the rodeo world tends to stick together, though, and that bodes well for the sport\u2019s longevity.\n\n\u201cGay rodeos, black rodeos, Hispanic rodeos, we all support each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to keep the heritage going.\u201d\n\nJudy James agrees, but is optimistic for the future of the sport: \u201cWe have competitors who have children, who are teenagers now and are getting ready to start competing. It\u2019s what they know. It\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "gay rodeo,gay rodeo circuit,LGBT,Matt Hansen,Matthew Hansen,rodeo,Sports,World Gay Rodeo Finals,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Traditionally a sport of cattle towns, rodeo is growing and opening up.
