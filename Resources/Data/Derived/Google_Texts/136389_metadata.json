Cory Gardner\u2019s Senate run exposed for what it is: A campaign about nothing.\n\nPressed repeatedly by Denver Post political editor Chuck Plunkett and reporter Lynn Bartels on what he believed and what he stood for, Gardner reverted to evasions and canned talking points that apparently pass muster on Fox News. But as swing state central for more than a decade, Colorado reporters have heard it all. Bartels and Plunkett weren\u2019t buying it.\n\nAsked by Plunkett to provide details of his pre-Obamacare health care plan that he claims motivated him to run and that he\u2019s been waving as a bloody shirt, Gardner refused and filibustered. Plunkett asked him why he redacted the name of his family\u2019s plan, the one he said was so cheap. Gardner dodged again. Finally, exasperated, Plunkett told Gardner to audience applause, \u201cSometimes if a candidate doesn't answer a question, that also tells you something about the candidate that voters can know.\u201d\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nYou can see video of the exchange here. You can watch the Q&A from the debate here.\n\nThe problem for Gardner is not just that his non-answers tell voters something, but that Obamacare has become a non-issue for anyone besides the hardcore Republican base in a state with a lot of unaffiliated voters. Today\u2019s Denver Post puts it bluntly: \u201cWhile the [Affordable Care Act] has aided Gardner in some ways, such as fundraising, the issue has not fulfilled its potential as a knockout punch. \u2026 During the critical month of September, the last full month before ballots go out to Colorado voters, the Gardner campaign ran four television ads; not a single one focused on the ACA.\u201d\n\nWith the central pretense of his campaign falling apart, Gardner finds himself constantly arguing that the policy he does support \u2013 the federal personhood bill that would ban all abortion and many forms of birth control \u2013 doesn\u2019t exist and doesn\u2019t matter. Gardner has denied the existence of the Life at Conception Act to (at last count): Fox31 Denver, KUSA/Channel 9 Denver, the Grand Junction Sentinel, Josh Green with Bloomberg News, MSNBC and at the Denver Post debate. Colorado\u2019s BigMediaBlog tallied up the clips.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nEven primary bill sponsor Sen Rand Paul, R-Ky., states that the Life at Conception Act is designed to overturn Roe v Wade. But Gardner keeps insisting that the Life at Conception Act is just a \u201cstatement\u201d that won\u2019t actually do anything.\n\nWhich begs the question: If Gardner thinks his votes and policies don\u2019t affect real peoples\u2019 lives, why is he running?\n\nThe Cory Gardner for Senate Campaign: A campaign about nothing.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Cory Gardner Is Running a Campaign About Nothing Against Udall in Colorado", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Cory Gardner is running the 'Seinfeld' of Senate campaigns in Colorado.", "title": "It's a Campaign About Nothing", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/laura-chapin/2014/10/09/cory-gardner-is-running-a-campaign-about-nothing-against-udall-in-colorado", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ca/03/e2d4a45845d68444eceec3639dae/140930-senate7-gardner-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Cory Gardner Is Running a Campaign About Nothing Against Udall in Colorado", "description": "Cory Gardner is running the 'Seinfeld' of Senate campaigns in Colorado.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Laura Chapin,Gardner, Cory,Senate,2014 Congressional elections,Colorado,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Cory Gardner is running the 'Seinfeld' of Senate campaigns in Colorado."}, "article_summary": "The Cory Gardner for Senate Campaign: A campaign about nothing.\nTuesday night, I sat in the Denver Post auditorium for a Senate debate and watched Rep.
