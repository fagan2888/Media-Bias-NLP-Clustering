A new audio clip finds him once again explaining that Obamacare subsidies are tied to state health exchanges.\n\nA clip of Jonathan Gruber circulated last night in which he states that Obamacare subsidies are tied to the existence of state exchanges. This statement is extremely problematic for the law\u2019s supporters because it appears to confirm the view of plaintiffs in the Halbig case, i.e. that only state-exchanges were intended to deliver subsidies.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis morning Gruber told the New Republic\u2018s Jonathan Cohn that he doesn\u2019t know why he said it at the time in 2012. \u201cI was speaking off-the-cuff. It was just a mistake,\u201d he claims. He added, \u201cMy subsequent statement was just a speak-o\u2014you know, like a typo.\u201d A typo is usually a simple slip of the finger on the keyboard, i.e. a misspelling or missed bit of punctuation. Gruber\u2019s statement is nearly a minute long.\n\nAlso, it turns out it was not the only time he made such a statement. An audio clip from a public appearance Gruber made at the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco on January 10, 2012 reveals he made the same connection between subsidies and state-based exchanges on at least one other occasion (hat tip to MorgenR).\n\nObviously, Gruber can continue to claim he was wrong but it becomes harder to explain this as the equivalent of a typo when he said it more than once.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth pointing out that on this occasion, unlike the one revealed last night, Gruber\u2019s statement was not in response to a question. During both speeches, Gruber listed three possible threats to the implementation of Obamacare. In both cases the third \u201cthreat\u201d was that states would not set up exchanges. In the January 10th speech (above) he simply went into more detail about the nature of that threat. In the January 18th speech that detail wasn\u2019t mentioned until the Q&A.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber make the same mistake twice?
