Former senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum criticized Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) for his role in the partial government shutdown earlier this month, saying Cruz “did more harm” than good by trying to rally support to defund Obamacare.

“I would say that in the end he did more harm,” Santorum noted during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “I think it was not his objective. I think his objective was a laudable one.”

But still, Santorum said, Cruz’s objective wasn’t planned well enough.

“I think he didn’t do a very good job in pointing [his objective] out,” Santorum said. “It’s one thing to have a goal, and another thing to have a plan to get you to that goal, and he didn’t figure that out.”

Prior to the shutdown Santorum backed Cruz’s plan to place anti-Obamacare measures into the government funding bill: “It’s too soon to tell whether the strategy has worked or not, will it move the debate this way? But I think that’s really ultimately, what I think Ted’s is trying to accomplish and I think he’s certainly is pulling out all the bullets to get it done,” Santorum told CNN in September, notes the Huffington Post.
