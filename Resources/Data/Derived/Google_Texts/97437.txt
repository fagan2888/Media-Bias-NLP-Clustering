Nevada County’s recovery from the recession is moving along — although it may take another year to get up to speed, county officials said Tuesday.

“The county’s financial picture is stable and strong, with some challenges,” said Nevada County Executive Officer Rick Haffey. “We’re rebounding from the Great Recession, but it may take until 2016-17 to return to normalcy.”

Haffey made his comments at a special meeting of the Nevada County Board of Supervisors to review a proposed final $201.25 million budget for 2015-16.

The proposed spending plan, up only .06 percent from the current $200.1 million 2014-15 budget that ends June 30, is scheduled for approval and adoption by supervisors at their June 16 public meeting. The meeting will be 9 a.m. at the Rood Center, 950 Maidu Ave., Nevada City.

On Tuesday, Haffey and Martin Polt, chief financial officer, presented highlights of the proposed budget, which has been in the works for the last five months.

The proposed plan calls for 778 county employees, down from the 783 in 2014-15. Most of the employees who left had been hired on a temporary basis to support the county’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Polt said. The total number of employees is down 26 percent from 2001-02.

Another decrease in expenses was realized by a $2.9 million drop in contribution to the California Medical Services Program, a health-care program for indigent adults.

The decrease was triggered by the county’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Property tax revenues are expected to increase 5.5 percent — a positive sign that will help the county continue its recovery, Haffey said.

Polt said real estate transfer taxes, an indicator of future property tax revenues, showed a likely continuing increase over the next year or so at least.

Sales tax revenues are also up 2 percent — projected at $3.37 million for 2015-16 — but still have not caught up to the high point of $3.65 million almost a decade ago.

On the “challenges” side, the county will see five years of increasing expenses for the California Public Employees Retirement System.

To mitigate the expected hit, Polt said the county has transferred an additional $500,000 into its pension reserve fund — now up over $3 million.

The general fund balance, projected at $23.42 million by June 30 of this year, is projected to stay almost flat at $23.539 million by June 30, 2016.

The county has set up three “tiers” of employee retirement benefits, with the lowest level of benefits going to the third tier, or the most recently hired (in 2013).

The county was able to balance the 2015-16 budget “without dipping into the reserves, although that may be necessary in the future,” Polt said. “We continue to be vigilant to mitigate pension costs.”

Other expected challenges will be costs for development of a new corporation yard site to move out of the current site in the Loma Rica area, reconfiguration of the Wayne Brown Correctional Center and continuing consolidation of the Health and Human Services departments.

The county jail reconfiguration is needed because there are more female inmates, and more inmates with substance abuse and mental health issues, Haffey added.

Other expenses will include roads projects in Loma Rica and library kiosks in North San Juan and Chicago Park.

The county is also anticipating costs of $600,000 for completion of the Gold Country Lenders trial, which goes into closing arguments today.
