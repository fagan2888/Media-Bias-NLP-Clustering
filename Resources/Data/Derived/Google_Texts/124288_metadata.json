Donald Trump now has 15 wins to Ted Cruz\u2019s seven and Marco Rubio\u2019s mere two. The media has spent much talk and text characterizing these Trump voters. Everyone agrees that they see Trump as the anti-Republican establishment candidate. Another image that appears is that this voter is undereducated, mostly white, low-wage and very angry.\n\nDoes the Trump voter have a basis for his anger in diminished present and future prospects? Should we look at this voter with some sympathy, rather than at the image presented by pollsters\u2019 demographics?\n\nThe Trump voter is correct that the government hasn\u2019t been working for him or her. Senator Mitch McConnell famously said seven years ago that he wanted to make President Obama a one-term president. How do you do that? You pour sand in the gears of government at every opportunity. The Republican-led Congress has utterly failed to do anything worthwhile to improve this voter\u2019s status \u2014 no jobs bills, no reeducation or training for better work, no funding for our crumbling infrastructure, which in itself would create jobs, and meager assistance to veterans.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t these voters be angry?\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Robert Gates writes in his recent book, A Passion for Leadership, that \u201cnot once \u2026 did Congress approve our appropriations before the beginning of the fiscal year in which the money was supposed to be spent. In a couple of instances, we did not know how much funding would be available until mid-way through the year, and once (and several times since I retired) Congress never did approve our annual appropriations. And when you toss in mindless acts of congressional misgovernance \u2014 such as shutdowns, furloughs and sequestration \u2014 and micromanagement masquerading as oversight, just keeping the doors open is a challenge.\u201d And he is talking about just the defense budget, which the Republicans prioritize before anything else. Sand in the gears of government.\n\nThe Republican establishment has been talking lofty principles for ages, but down here on the ground with the voter, things have not been so grand. In order to halt the expansion of medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Cruz was crucial to engineering the 16-day 2013 shutdown of the government which cost the economy between $12-24 billion. That is a significant opportunity cost for the furloughed, undereducated and low-wage worker, but it\u2019s pocket change to the high rollers who subsidize this year\u2019s Republican candidates, all of whom say it is in their DNA to cut taxes for the rich and cut spending for everyone else. Sand in the gears.\n\nAs the citizens of Flint, Michigan, found out, the focus on money alone means not focusing on people and not focusing on their health. The state of Louisiana is a larger example of mindlessly cutting budgets and not caring about people. An article in last week\u2019s Washington Post goes into great detail about how Republican Governor Bobby Jindal, over eight years, cut taxes for the rich, created subsidies to lure business, gutted university spending, drained the rainy day fund and cut 30,000 employees, including those working in foster care. Yet the economy tanked and the nation\u2019s second poorest state now needs nearly $3 billion over the next 16 months just to maintain what services are left. The future looks grim because 18 percent of the population lives in poverty and the median income is 20 percent below the national average. Sand in the gears.\n\nSo maybe those Trump voters have a point. The good news is that these voters are fed up with \u201cthe government\u201d throwing sand in the gears and bringing the country to a grinding halt. The bad news is that they haven\u2019t actually figured out that it is Republicans in the Congress, primarily the establishment including people like McConnell, Paul Ryan, Cruz and Rubio, but also the Freedom Caucus, including our very own Dave Brat, that are actually throwing the sand.\n\nHaving created the conditions for an angry electorate, stomachs are churning in the Republican establishment as they frantically trying to contain the Trump phenomenon and right the GOP ship in this storm.\n\nMitt Romney, \u201cMr. 47 percent,\u201d recently railed against the electorate: \u201cYou, the Trump voter, are being conned.\u201d This voter may not appreciate the suggestion that he is na\u00efve and foolish. He knows he\u2019s a victim. He\u2019s being told the government sent his job overseas, when in fact this is a business decision in which he has no say. Similarly, the government isn\u2019t telling companies to park trillions of dollars overseas so they don\u2019t have to pay taxes. This is a business decision in which neither he nor the IRS has any say.\n\nPerhaps his anger at the corporations and the establishment are well placed. If so, where will the Trump voter go after the Republican Party succeeds in blocking Trump\u2019s candidacy? Who will they choose? Another Republican sand-thrower?", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Progress", "description": "Trump voters handed more victories to the leading candidate last Tuesday night.
