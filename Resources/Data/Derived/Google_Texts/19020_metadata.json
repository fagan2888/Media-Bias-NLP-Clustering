The Clinton camp was put on high alert, told to look for suspicious behavior and to be aware they may be under video surveillance.\n\nWe now know the rumors are true. O'Keefe has confirmed Project Veritas journalists have in fact conducted an undercover video investigation into Clinton's campaign and have plenty of footage to share.\n\nThe first video shows a paid campaign staffer telling a volunteer that they only want to register voters who will vote for Hillary, a Democrat, when the law requires voters be able to register regardless of their political affiliation or support for a certain candidate.\n\nNew James O\u2019Keefe undercover video shows Clinton campaign playing fast and loose with Iowa election laws, directly contradicting their previous statement to Time Magazine. Hillary campaign organizer Sarah Sterner was captured on hidden camera stating: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make our focus voter registration because then we have to like register everyone regardless of whether they\u2019re supporters or not.\u201d The Clinton campaign \u201cmaintains that its policy is to register all voters, regardless of their preference in candidates.\u201d Yet paid organizer Sarah Sterner was caught instructing staffers to ask potential supporters \u201cHey are you a Hillary supporter? And then if not, then like great move on, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and her top advisers have some serious explaining to do as it pertains to their campaign\u2019s obligation to honor both the spirit and the letter of the law,\" O\u2019Keefe said in a statement about the footage. \u201cThere are two lessons in this story. First, if you are not doing anything wrong you can\u2019t get caught and second, as Hillary is soon to learn the hard way, if you do something wrong, make sure you don\u2019t get caught on camera.\"\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" O'Keefe says in the video. \"In fact, stay tuned Hillary...check your email.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "On tape. .05/26/2016 2:46:37AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "On tape.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - James O'Keefe: Yes Hillary, I Have Undercover Video of Your Campaign", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/26/james-okeefe-yes-hillary-i-have-undercover-video-of-your-campaign-n2044086", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/233/2015-08-21T050425Z_1_LYNXNPEB7K06G_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "On tape.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - James O'Keefe: Yes Hillary, I Have Undercover Video of Your Campaign", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/26/james-okeefe-yes-hillary-i-have-undercover-video-of-your-campaign-n2044086", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/233/2015-08-21T050425Z_1_LYNXNPEB7K06G_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "James O'Keefe: Yes Hillary, I Have Undercover Video of Your Campaign , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca733\"", "article_summary": "New James O\u2019Keefe undercover video shows Clinton campaign playing fast and loose with Iowa election laws, directly contradicting their previous statement to Time Magazine.\nO'Keefe has confirmed Project Veritas journalists have in fact conducted an undercover video investigation into Clinton's campaign and have plenty of footage to share.\nLate last week rumors started swirling about an undercover investigation of Hillary Clinton's campaign being conducted by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, an organization responsible for holding a number of government officials accountable for bad behavior.\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" O'Keefe says in the video.\nThe Clinton camp was put on high alert, told to look for suspicious behavior and to be aware they may be under video surveillance."}
