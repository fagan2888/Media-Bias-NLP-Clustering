For Christians, such times of abstinence from food are a spiritual discipline intended to foster communion with God, purification from sin, and love toward others.\n\nHaeven is referring to words of Jesus in the \u201cSermon on the Mount\u201d (Gospel of Matthew 6:16-18): \u201cWhen you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unpack some of what New Testament experts tell us about this.\n\nFirst, Jesus said \u201cwhen you fast,\u201d and thus assumed, no doubt correctly, that nearly everyone in his Jewish audience observed this discipline and that by extension his later followers would. Prior to delivering the celebrated Sermon, Jesus himself had fasted privately to prepare for the start of his ministry (Matthew 4:2). In Matthew 9:14-17 (paralleled in Mark and Luke) people asked why John the Baptist\u2019s flock and the Pharisees fasted while Jesus\u2019 disciples did not. Jesus explained this would be so only while he was present with them, a time of special celebration like a wedding reception, but that eventually normal fasting would resume with them.\n\nCommentators agree that Jesus\u2019 command to fast \u201cin secret\u201d referred to individuals\u2019 private fasts, not the communal public fasts that all Jews observed such as the annual Day of Atonement and other special occasions. Haeven should note that the interior motive and manner of fasting are the concerns, not rigid secrecy as such. For instance, secrecy wouldn\u2019t apply to family members or close friends who\u2019d naturally know if someone is not eating meals.\n\nAn Orthodox Church in America guide summarizes that Jesus criticized \u201costentation,\u201d showing off of one\u2019s self-denial. Though the Bible\u2019s institution of the public Day of Atonement (Leviticus 23:26-32) said \u201cyou shall afflict yourselves,\u201d the revered medieval Rabbi Jacob ben Asher made Jesus\u2019 precise point about individuals\u2019 personal fasting: \u201cIn no case should one boast of his fasts to others.\u201d Earlier in the Sermon, Jesus applied the same principle of privacy over pride to prayer (the \u201cLord\u2019s Prayer\u201d is part of that section) and to charitable donations (a teaching that\u2019s widely ignored, as we can all regularly observe). The Orthodox Church guide also underscores Paul\u2019s biblical admonition of toleration by those who are fasting toward those who are not: \u201cLet not him who abstains pass judgment on him who eats\u201d (Romans 14:3).\n\nWhen Jesus said \u201cthey have their reward,\u201d the caustic remark means those who purposely show off are just looking for praise from people and will receive it. When he said God \u201cwill reward you,\u201d interpreters explain this doesn\u2019t mean some payoff in health or wealth but spiritual, moral, and emotional strength.\n\nBackground on fasting practices include:\n\nContinue reading \"Should religious fasting be kept secret?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HAEVEN ASKS:\r\n\r\nI\u2019m beginning to fast and was wondering if I should hide it from people \r\nbecause of the verse that says to.
