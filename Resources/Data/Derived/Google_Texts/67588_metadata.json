Researchers at Chalmers University in Sweden and Wroclaw University in Poland have determined that so-called photo therapy may effectively treat neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Their findings may revolutionize therapeutic strategies for diseases currently considered incurable.\n\nIn current scholarship, most neurodegenerative conditions are thought to the be result of detrimental protein accumulations. Essentially, clumps of faulty proteins cause neuronal cell death, which leads to the debilitating symptoms associated with diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. The new study, which is published in the journal Nature Photonics, sought to investigate whether light-based therapy can be used to remove these degenerative aggregations.\n\n\"Nobody has talked about using only light to treat these diseases until now,\u201d lead author Piotr Hanczyc said in a press release. \u201cThis is a totally new approach and we believe that this might become a breakthrough in the research of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We have found a totally new way of discovering these structures using just laser light.\u201d\n\nAlthough previous studies have implicated the same accumulations of proteins, the current paper is the first to advance a reliable method of identifying and isolating such accumulations. By selectively eliminating these protein aggregates, photo therapy may be able to treat and cure neurodegenerative diseases without harming healthy tissue. Eventually, the treatment method may allow physicians and surgeons to phase out current chemical therapies, which are highly toxic and potentially harmful for patients.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, neurodegenerative diseases currently affect millions of people worldwide. The conditions, which are characterize by a gradual loss of nerve functions, usually result in mental decline and an array of cognitive impairments. Some aggressive conditions, like Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease, are invariably fatal and usually kills the patient within a year.\n\nSource: Piotr Hanczyc, Marek Samoc, Bengt Norden.
