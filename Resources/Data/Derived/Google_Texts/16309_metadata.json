Yet, ironically, those of us interested in American sexual politics remember a very different side of Keating: the smut-fighting moral entrepreneur who called for more regulation \u2014 as long as it pertained to matters of obscenity, rather than investment.\n\nKeating\u2019s pioneering activity in junk-bond innovation has all but eclipsed what may, in fact, be his most lasting legacy. As founder and longtime leader of Citizens for Decent Literature (CDL), Keating pioneered a new form of sexual conservatism, modernizing it to meet the changing mores of the mid-20th century. Through CDL, Keating developed a legalistic, pseudo-empirical anti-porn movement that worked hard to show itself as not anti-sex, but rather anti-perversion. As such, Keating brilliantly framed CDL for a post-Kinsey America, leaving a lasting imprint on conservative sexual politics.\n\nA young Catholic lawyer in socially conservative Cincinnati in the 1950s, Keating watched with alarm as the newsstands and paperback racks of the nation filled with pulp novels and Playboy imitators, and he assessed the American moral landscape with a clarity few at the time possessed. Even as the Cold War witnessed a dramatic sexual retrenchment that ranged from aggressively domestic ideals for women to state-sponsored violence and suppression toward queer \u201cdeviants,\u201d anti-smut activism seemed to be at low ebb. \u201cCensorship\u201d was unpopular, viewed through a Cold War prism as a tactic of the totalitarian Soviet Union, not freedom-loving Americans \u2014 none less than President Dwight D. Eisenhower castigated \u201cthe book burners\u201d in 1953. Meanwhile, old forms of moral activism had fallen into disrepute. Anti-smut activist Anthony Comstock, in whose name the 1873 federal obscenity law had been passed, was now viewed through a post-Freudian lens as a repressed Victorian, and Catholic cultural influence was on the wane, with the traditional boycott methods of the Legion of Decency under attack in the media and the Hollywood Production Code disintegrating rapidly.\n\nYet Keating uniquely recognized the opportunities afforded by the Supreme Court, whose 1957 Roth v. United States opinion determined that obscene materials were not protected by the First Amendment. Today we remember Roth for helping unleash the sexual revolution. Because Justice William Brennan restricted obscenity to only those works completely devoid of \u201csocially redeeming value,\u201d the case cleared the path for Henry Miller novels, \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover,\u201d and ultimately \u201cDeep Throat.\u201d But Keating recognized the conservative opportunity the Court afforded: Banning books could be framed as something other than censorship. If a sleazy book with a name like \u201cLust Agent\u201d is obscene, it has no constitutional claim to free speech. Ipso facto, to suppress it is not to censor it.\n\nOr at least, that\u2019s how Keating\u2019s semantic gambit went \u2014 and it worked, marvelously. His CDL rapidly rose from a local Cincinnati group to a national behemoth, easily the nation\u2019s preeminent anti-pornography organization in the 1960s and beyond. Keating stripped the movement against smut of its association with repression and prudery, instead boldly declaring that his cause could be reconciled with a sexually liberated age. \u201cI spent over 8 years in the Navy,\u201d his right-hand man declared in a typical 1962 CDL stock speech, \u201cand I think sex is great!\u201d The right kind of sex, of course: heterosexual and married, not \u201cdeviant.\u201d Though himself Catholic, Keating kept CDL militantly broad-based to avoid the charge that it was an extension of sectarian Catholic beliefs. To the notion that moral offenses were victimless crimes, an idea promoted by Alfred Kinsey and others, Keating had an answer as well.\n\nIn CDL\u2019s miraculously schlocky 1963 short propaganda film \u201cPerversion for Profit,\u201d a barrage of statistics and social science is presented to link obscenity to venereal disease, homosexuality, juvenile delinquency, teen pregnancy and, ultimately, national decline. It plays like camp today, but reflected precisely the sentiments of national leaders like FBI head J. Edgar Hoover at the time. It also revealed another central CDL tactic: offering enough skin, sleaze and tawdriness to generate some real spectatorial frisson \u2014 all in the name of decency, of course.\n\nThe purported evidence of porn\u2019s harms was mostly bunk. A few years later, Keating offhandedly explained the source of the film\u2019s figures: They \u201ccame out of my head,\u201d he shrugged. But the content mattered less than the form. What Keating accomplished through CDL was to wholly reinvent the battle against pornography, distancing it from censorship and the killjoys associated with it \u2014 repressed Victorians with sweaty palms, insular Catholics attempting to impose their cultural politics, and baseless moralism. Scholars at the time saw conservatism as opposed to modernity itself, but CDL was as modern as they come, using sophisticated media tactics and always emphasizing data and law, not overt moralism. You wouldn\u2019t confuse Keating for a character in \u201cThe Scarlet Letter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, to view groups of naked women, undraped muscular men in physique magazines, scenes of bondage, or other such perversions in any other setting was a danger to self and nation; to take them in at a screening of \u201cPerversion for Profit\u201d or CDL\u2019s other short agitprop films was legitimized through the alibi of educational value. \u201cI repeat, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Keating declared in his stock speech, \u201cthat the purpose of showing these pictures\u2026 is not to shock you \u2014 it is to inform you.\u201d That came after reading an extended passage from a pulp novel about how \u201ctaking a girl\u2019s cherry is hell of a gratifying thing.\u201d Such books, Keating warned, somewhat oddly, appealed not just to the lesbian and the homosexual, but even to the \u201ccunalinguist.\u201d Well, it sounded dirty, whether or not audiences understood it. At annual CDL conventions, the room with the smut on display \u2014 for purely informative purposes \u2014 was always well attended. Keeping the prurient interest of the material at hand always just below the surface, CDL always delivered the goods, in the purported interest of suppressing the very texts it sampled for its members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charles Keating was best known for his shady financial dealings, but his politics were even more destructive", "title": "Meet the spiritual forefather of conservatives\u2019 War on Women", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Charles Keating was best known for his shady financial dealings, but his politics were even more destructive", "title": "Meet the spiritual forefather of conservatives\u2019 War on Women", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/13/meet_the_spiritual_forefather_of_conservatives_war_on_women/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/limbaugh_keating_huckabee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Charles Keating was best known for his shady financial dealings, but his politics were even more destructive", "title": "Meet the spiritual forefather of conservatives\u2019 War on Women", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/limbaugh_keating_huckabee.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Whitney Strub", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Censorship, Charles Keating, Citizens for Decent Literature, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca33a\"", "article_summary": "Through CDL, Keating developed a legalistic, pseudo-empirical anti-porn movement that worked hard to show itself as not anti-sex, but rather anti-perversion.\nAs such, Keating brilliantly framed CDL for a post-Kinsey America, leaving a lasting imprint on conservative sexual politics.\nAs founder and longtime leader of Citizens for Decent Literature (CDL), Keating pioneered a new form of sexual conservatism, modernizing it to meet the changing mores of the mid-20th century.\nAt annual CDL conventions, the room with the smut on display \u2014 for purely informative purposes \u2014 was always well attended.\nKeating\u2019s pioneering activity in junk-bond innovation has all but eclipsed what may, in fact, be his most lasting legacy."}
