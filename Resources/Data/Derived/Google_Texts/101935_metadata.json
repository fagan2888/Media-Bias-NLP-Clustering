There is, absolutely, no stopping it no matter how hard Pine Island's \"David,\" Mr. (Phil) Buchanan & PILP activists, try to slay \"Goliath\" news flash it ain't gonna happen! They are coming for the island. Up until now, \"David\" has fought them off in skirmishes, for the most part. As we speak, do you realize how many politicians, lawyers and CPAs are hard at work, on the other side of the bridge, plotting and planning their attack on Normandy? There are millions and millions of dollars to be made off of this island. I believe, Pine Island, should start taking some pre-emptive strikes, before our worst fears are realized.\n\nIn April, I attended a Babson College conference called BabsonConnect/Worlwide2015, in Cartagena, Colombia, South America. Babson College is located in Wellesley, Mass. It is ranked No. 1 in entrepreneurship in 2014 by Money Magazine the last 3 years in a row by the Princeton Review and for 20 years by the U.S. News & World Report. The conference was to be a celebration of the power of entrepreneurship to change people's lives around the world.\n\nI saw two discussions related to health on the agenda: Ecosystems planning, inclusive of healthcare development, and the Harvard, Mass., Eye & Ear Hospital/Babson collaboration to build efficient health clinics all over the world. Since these two topics encompassed healthcare, I was anxious to know, if anyone at the entire conference had ever used or heard of the U.S. SuperTracker. Nope, not one person had. For the record, I have not encountered anyone in my life, including strangers and health workers, whoever used or heard of it. The only reason I went was to provide info to attendees about this website: www.supertracker.usda.gov. It provides all of us with tools to manage our own health, as it can be affected through diet and activity. This site was greatly enhanced as part of the Obamacare strategy to reduce healthcare costs. I also wanted to promote my little sister's book that guides readers through the enhanced SuperTracker site.\n\nO.K., I know you are saying, \"Who cares?\" At this event, I learned of a new project concept called the Babson Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Project (BEEP) .... say what? The definition of ecosystem in this use is: a community and its environment functioning as an ecological unit. I think this approach may lend itself to solving our island's current \"fix.\" There is a region in both Boston and Milwaukee with functioning ecosystems, as guided by Babson College. The goal of the project will be to strike a deal to align the goals, financial and intangible, of Lee County, city of Cape Coral, state, feds, developer groups, stakeholders (Pine Island residents), foundations (Calusa Land Trust and 20/20), organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, PILP activists, historical society, island investors (business consortiums) and philanthropists. The key to our success is to come up with a comprehensive short- and long-term plan for Greater Pine Island, as part of an \"Ecosystem Plan,\" encompassing all groups listed above. We have to make the case to our government, that our plan will generate more fees from developers and parking, as well as taxes (bed, sales, property and income) for the city, county, state and feds, as opposed to killing the golden goose our pristine Pine Island.\n\nIt is a 4-month process. It requires all of the above listed groups to designate influential leaders to be part of the ecosystem. We will set up ecosystem blogs, as the brainstorming forum. There will be an MBA, from Babson, available at zero cost. This person will guide the group interactions as well as prepare and dollarize the impact of the Ecosystem Plan on all parties. We, also, can expect political support by the well-connected college, relating to state and federal issues, if any should surface. I'm not suggesting pulling strings. I mean enabling us to present our issues to the correct governmental agency and the correct decision making person.\n\nThe Babson College president was the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, when Mitt Romney was the governor. At the time, they turned around a very dire financial situation and created and implemented Romneycare, for a grateful state. Subsequently, she worked in the State Department for both the Bush and Obama administrations. She is the first female president at the college and me, the first female graduate. Our island is a bastion of female entrepreneurs. Hmmm ...\n\nI have engaged in discussions with the Pine Island and County Chamber of Commerce, Lee Tran, the city property manager and many business owners. So far, I have been in contact, on aspects of the Ecosystem proposition, with George Welker, the Cupcake Express, Pine Island Taxi, Mel Meo, Roy Kibbe, Nancy Koucky, Perfect Cup, Leoma Lovegrove, Dee Shallow, D&D Tackle, Island Caf, Saltwater Smoke House, Matlacha Cottages, Le's Oriental Cuisine, Captain Jack Boat Tours, Calusa Land Trust and fellow residents.\n\nI have brainstormed with some of the above identified groups. Also, I broached the subject on a local Pine Island blog with incredible results. In only 2 days, the ideas of the 19 bloggers were a breath of fresh air. All of our tech savvy residents can participate, too. Brainstorming on a blog is nirvana! Man, do those idea juices flow. I lay on my cushy recliner with my margarita in one hand and my trusty smart phone in the other, while watching the sunset. It's easy to see how a person could run the world from a recliner! It is such an efficient use of a person's time as opposed to physical meetings. Plus, Mr. (Ed) Franks will be provided a weekly update for Eagle readers. The following examples are the blogger's and other's I have spoken to:\n\n1. Decrease the number of vehicles coming over the bridge via a trolley transportation program. It turns out this is already in the works by the GPICC, along with many other great plans. They agree the key to ease traffic is to locate the trolley parking on the east side of the Matlacha Bridge. As an aside, I know Pine Island Taxi is itching to buy a trolley. Maybe this will make it financially feasible. I often wonder how many of the cars belong to our residents on their way back from Publix, Lowe's or other stores offering products available on the island. I can understand Publix, but you can also shop at Winn-Dixie and buy your fruit and veggies at the market in Subway Plaza or the stands at the south and north ends of the island. If you could at least shop there during season, it will be extremely helpful. This bottleneck even backs up onto Veterans Parkway! How many potential island customers will sit in their car for an hour in order to attend an event, dine, shop at our galleries, go boating with their Freedom Boat Club membership, etc.? How many pull out of the line and take their business elsewhere or, in the case of the boat club, cancel their boat membership? I wish I could dollarize the sales lost, last year. Another question I have, what is the count of island residents returning to the island from work? I don't suppose anyone happened to do traffic counts by month, day and hour? If so, please contact me.\n\n2. The GPICC shared its great idea of tours and demonstrations of our agriculture offerings. They told me people come for miles, specifically, for our exotic fruit. Would there be enough demand for this to make it worthwhile? This prompted me to think maybe historical tours, like Leoma's, could be added as well as a visit to the Calusa Heritage Trail and our true treasure trove the Pine Island Museum.\n\n3. How many times do family and friends ask what is on Pine Island other than an unending desolate road with trees? How about a trolley site seeing tour? I know I would've been the first person on the bus, when I first came to visit my relatives. I'm sure it won't be difficult to find volunteer hosts to narrate I'd love to be one, myself. Anyone that loves Pine Island, loves blabbing about it. The route can simply go from one end of the island to the other, with a swing through Waterfront Road and Country Club Drive. Maybe they can take a quick zip through Pineland Marina with the host pointing out the shrimp and boat club boats, the tiki hut you can rent, Charley Pass and the Alondra sailing vessel, too. Each passenger will be given a \"Center of Adventure\" island booklet that has all of the sites to be seen, as well as the current week live music schedule. The booklet is 80 percent completed, at this writing. It will also be provided to hotels on the trolley route, on and off the Island. The host will give a spiel about sites to be seen in our example. There will be narration, as the trolley passes the many aquatic plus nature preserves, walking trails, boat ramps, kayak \"put ins,\" bike path, FruitScapes, Kingfisher Sightseeing by plane, (I cross lined through attractions that are needed, but no longer here, in hopes someone might fill the void.), the famed Koucky Pottery class studio, Chutney stand, Calusa Ghost Tours via large canoe, golf course with all the osprey nests, Fritz Park, Boca Grande Pass tarpon capital of the world, the fishing pier, a glimpse of our own \"African Queen,\" the Tropic Star, galleries, restaurants, etc. Of course, those darn pesky passengers will want the trolley to stop for a bite to eat somewhere just sayin'. As they hit lulls in the narration, the host will play \"islandy\" music CDs, for sale, by local musicians. Possibly the trolley can pick tourists up at the planned Burnt Store Road and Cape Coral hotels. Tourists might be ferried over from Fort Myers Beach hotels for the trolley tour, lunch or an evening at one of our many island hot spots. They can have an evening of food and drink, listening to live music entertainment. Utilizing the trolley enables our visitors to relax and imbibe with no safety concern of driving, while impaired.\n\n4. Instigate the purchase of the vacant land beside Wild Child Gallery. It will be converted into an enchanting, lush, green park area with tables and chairs so shoppers can grab a bite to eat and relax. Shopping can be very tiring. The average sale price per customer should go up as customers get a second wind at this oasis. The purchase of the land will, hopefully, be paid by public or private investors interested in preserving our pristine island our nature playground.\n\n5. Develop strategies to stop local businesses from disappearing. In the past 10 years, 17 businesses on Pine Island have left. Isn't that shocking! It is doubtful certain business types will return, such as a florist, art supplies and picture framing. We lost our champion bonsai grower, Mr. Wigert, to the Fort Myers market. It sure is hard to make a living on this island. Just last week, we hear the heart wrenching news of our beloved Red's closing its doors, too.\n\n6. Have farmer's markets like they have once a week by Woody's 2nd restaurant. Have \"off\" season monthly \"yard sale\" weekends. Many people visit Pine Island on Friday and Saturday mornings, specifically, for our yard sales. After, they patronize our restaurants and shops. Why not make it a happening? As usual, everyone will post their signs on Stringfellow Road and the 4-way. Residents with a few things can display them at designated business locations, such as the White Plantation, the Cupcake Express and Subway Plaza. I'm sure artisan wares and E-bay/Craigslist items will find their way.\n\n7. We now have 8 eateries within a half-mile radius of Pine Island Center. That's an awful lot for our population, but each one, for me, has something special I love to eat. I'm sure others agree. Maybe we can help them out with a catchy name for this cluster like they use for cars, the \"Auto Mile.\" For example, on Creative Coast weekends tourists to Matlacha ask what is on Pine Island. Now we can say: \"It's just 2 miles up the road and you're smack dab in the middle of 'Auto Mile' and galleries.\" If each restaurant took advantage of posting pictures of dishes to local and Cape Coral Facebook group sites, it might make a dramatic impact on your business. Just ask Melissa at Pine Island Pizza. Helpful islanders can private message you about problems with your food, service, hours, etc. This is great info for islanders, too. I love take out. I don't buy it that often. Since I have seen dish pictures online with corresponding islander comments, we are eating a lot more take out, a lot more! Lots of time I forget I love something, then bing, it pops up on Facebook.\n\n8. Share databases of such groups as the Garden Club, Art Association, etc. This enables advertising events, to thousands of people, at the push of a button.\n\n9. I was thrilled to see an island flag is in the works. Maybe we can have an island mascot figurine, too a great blue heron with island Reeboks or something. This can be sold on the trolley and our gift shops with a portion of sales going to Island charities.\n\n10. Develop and provide our Realtors a desired profile of future residents who would live, work and play on the island such as high tech. We can build the Information Super Highway parallel to Stringfellow Road (yuck, yuck!).\n\n11. Promote Pine Island as a \"Daytripper\" center of \"Adventure,\" tapping into this craze. Also, our eateries are more and more serving food made with quality ingredients and beautifully ripe fresh fruit. Maybe this can be incorporated into promotions.\n\n12. Maybe Fort Myers Beach hotels can host a triathlon. The first leg can be kayaking to St. James City, then do a 5K run up Stringfellow Road and a return 5K speed walk back to their kayaks to make the return trip to Ft Myers Beach.\n\n13. Bring back MangoMania, bring back MangoMania or maybe a second mini-MangoMania and other events we use to have on the Island.\n\n14. If you haven't already, link your local business website to the state and county websites for tourists. They are really well done.\n\n15. Dollarize the impact of county red tape on business owners, the county and taxpayers, for potential improvements. I know the details about Mel's mullet wagon and the Cupcake express. If there is any other business, currently, having difficulties, please contact me via FoodYouLoveDiet.com. Again, you will see a feedback box. Just enter your name. This will go directly to my email. I will respond as quickly as I can. If you prefer to submit it to the Eagle editor, that will be even better.\n\nIf approximately 40 people came up with these 15 ideas, can you imagine all the ideas the Pine Island brain cells can conjure up? It's exciting!\n\nI must preface my closing. Yes, I am obnoxious and some say presumptuous, but if we don't give this a shot, I fear regrets, later. It's a given, many islanders do not want any more residents or businesses on the island. I get it. In addition to covering your ears, while jumping up and down screaming and kicking now, you can cover your eyes, too or you can jump on the jolly trolley and tour the island everyone refers to as Key West, before all the land development. Every person on this island can contribute. If you can come up with an idea to increase the revenues of government without hurting our Island, please contact me by going to FoodYouLoveDiet.com. You know the drill. No idea is silly, although I've been called a silly pot roast troll. No one is going to see it except me. If you prefer to submit it to the Eagle editor, that's fine, too. It may be a gem that could save the island! I am hoping the above list of ideas will spur thoughts of that gem. One thought can stimulate another. Write down any idea as you read so you won't forget it like comedians, but you don't need to use a napkin. I guess on Pine Island it would be toilet paper who uses napkins? He, he! I know our island can rise to the occasion. We can do it!\n\nIn conclusion, I have lived under a rock for 61 years. I saw daylight in Cartagena a renewal of my faith in mankind. So much of the conference related to social issues. This didn't square with the Babson College I remembered. There was no social conscious, as I saw in Cartagena. It was a rich kid's school (as a roofer, hubby paid for my tuition). Everything was exclusively about profits. I have a searing memory of debating Edsel Ford (Henry Ford's great grandson). The topic was \"Labor Unions.\" I was for them and he was against. I couldn't believe his and other's disdain for the common man. Now, I couldn't be prouder of my school. I learned from my college president, we can affect our own destiny by working with the private and public sectors to align their goals with ours. I would like to support this new approach, with those that are game. We know what we have to lose if nothing else, I feel like I owe to the memory of the late Mr. and Mrs. Tapenger.\n\nGo Trump! We ain't taking it anymore! Besides, Hillary will probably do more good for women and the world, devoting her time to the work of their incredible foundation. I can't bear another 4 years of investigations for every move she makes. I think Mrs. George Bush got it right no Clintons or Bushs!", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "letters, letter to the editor, editor, Pine Island Eagle, pineisland-eagle.com, Pine Island, Matlacha, Matlacha, St. James City, Bokeelia and Pineland, newspaper, Ogden, Florida, FL", "description": "They are coming \u2026 they are coming..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a25\"", "article_summary": "Another question I have, what is the count of island residents returning to the island from work?\nI believe, Pine Island, should start taking some pre-emptive strikes, before our worst fears are realized.\nAlso, I broached the subject on a local Pine Island blog with incredible results.\nFor example, on Creative Coast weekends tourists to Matlacha ask what is on Pine Island.\nMany people visit Pine Island on Friday and Saturday mornings, specifically, for our yard sales."}
