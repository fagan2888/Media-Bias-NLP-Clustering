He did admit to making the calls,\u201d said MCSO Det. Brian Mackiewicz. \u201cHe was very proud that he threatened the sheriff, and since then he\u2019s been very uncooperative.\u201d\n\nMr. Crow has spent at least four separate stints in Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s jails on charges of shoplifting, threatening and intimidating. He has also spent time in a Pennsylvania prison for making terroristic threats, the Phoenix station reported.\n\nMr. Crow was reportedly being held in a Los Angeles County jail Thursday evening on $50,000 bond.\n\nThe sheriff was scheduled to be in California Thursday for a speech, his office said.\n\n\u201cWe took this threat very serious[ly], because we didn\u2019t know if the suspect was actually waiting for the sheriff in L.A. or in California to carry out this threat,\u201d Det.
