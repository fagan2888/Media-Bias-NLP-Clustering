County Civil Grand Jury report examined the initiative this summer, assessing how EHR implementation and integration of EHR systems and data among county departments could set the pace for development of a countywide health information exchange for both private and public providers.\n\nL.A. DHS Faces Unique Challenges\n\nLos Angeles DHS is the second largest public health system in the U.S. and serves nearly 10 million residents, according to the report. Robert Bart, CMIO of the department, said DHS includes four traditional hospital-based facilities \u2014 Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, Olive View-UCLA Medical Center and Ranchos Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center \u2014 as well as several offsite clinics.\n\nData from DHS\u2019 EHR system operating in six primary facilities cannot be shared with other providers.\n\n\u201cThe simple task of transporting a patient from a DHS hospital to another hospital can be highly inefficient and cumbersome,\u201d the report noted. \u201cPaper medical records are photocopied while transport ambulances may sit idling\u201d and, \u201cin some instances, the receiving hospital may not have complete medical information about an incoming patient because all the paper records may not have been forwarded,\u201d the report added.\n\nThis \u201csilo effect\u201d will be eliminated with the implementation of a countywide EHR system, according to the report.\n\nFixing a Fragmented System\n\nDHS began work on its EHR system \u2014 called the Online Real-time Centralized Health Information Database, or ORCHID \u2014 in May 2013. The system is being created by Cerner.\n\nBy launching a \u201cuniform, standardized and fully integrated\u201d countywide EHR system, the agency aims to:\n\nComply with requirements to attest to the meaningful use program;\n\nImprove patient safety and care quality;\n\nMake DHS more competitive in the health care industry;\n\nReplace the county\u2019s \u201cfragmented and obsolete\u201d health record system; and\n\nSupport outpatient care restructuring as part of health care reform.\n\nThe new EHR system also will include a master patient index, with unique identifiers for each patient, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe movement to an [EHR] system is important to DHS for reasons that go beyond the usual factors as to why modern medical groups are adopting [EHRs] \u2026 having one system will bring us together as a single integrated system,\u201d DHS Director Mitchell Katz said.\n\nThe new EHR system will be \u201ca single source of truth so that we can have a single medical record for each person that receives health care at DHS,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt will be a huge improvement in patient safety and we hope also in \u2026 employee satisfaction and patient satisfaction.\u201d\n\nMaking Progress\n\nSo far, the first two steps of the design and building of ORCHID \u2014 a system review and system validation \u2014 have been completed. Cerner now is adding hardware, software and infrastructure to support the system. Unit system integration and user acceptance testing are expected to begin soon and wide-scale training of staff was slated to begin last month. Bart said \u201ca large number of \u2026 physicians, nurses, therapists, admission registration staff [and other stakeholders] have been involved in the building and designing of the solution.\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201cgo-live\u201d dates for EHR implementation will be ongoing, with about one launch date every three months \u2014 beginning Nov. 1 with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and a few of the comprehensive health clinics. The department already has begun initial training for staff at Harbor-UCLA and has gotten \u201cencouraging\u201d feedback, Bart added.\n\nThe implementation originally was set for Aug. 1. Bart said the federal government\u2019s decision to delay ICD-10 conversions was a factor in the decision to change the timing. Bart said the delay \u201ckind of gave [DHS] an opportunity to sort of re-examine things as well as some of the internal operations that we had.\u201d\n\nThe county Sheriff\u2019s Department, Probation Department and the Department of Mental Health also offer patient care and have separate EHR systems. \u201cCurrently, these departments have limited ability to share each other\u2019s patient information electronically,\u201d according to the report.\n\nBart said DHS is \u201cworking on a health information exchange to connect these medical records so that there can be appropriate movement of health information so that we can deliver care in a more effective and efficient way.\u201d\n\nA Model for Others\n\nBart said the department\u2019s new health IT efforts are essential to keeping the county up to date in care delivery methods. \u201cFor DHS to be able to transform care delivery and transform the reimbursement for care delivery, we need to move on to this type of modern platform in order to stay current and in order to support the changes that the Affordable Care Act is asking of health care delivery in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nBart hopes the county\u2019s EHR implementation project \u201cwill be a model not just for California, but also for other county, city or state government health care delivery organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to set an example that being able to have a modern technology infrastructure to support health care and leveraging that \u2014 both at the individual level and the level of the population we care for \u2014 will result in improved quality of care, improved efficiency of care \u2026 and improved efficiency for those who are delivering care,\u201d Bart said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>In an ideal world, patients' health data would follow them when they move from one health facility to another.
