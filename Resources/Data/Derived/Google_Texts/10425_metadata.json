(WHTM) \u2013 Jim Lamancusa is a certified public accountant in Camp Hill. He talked to us about how to be prepared during tax season.\n\nWhat are the hottest topics this year with taxes?\n\n\u201cThe two hottest tax topics this tax season are the Affordable Care Act and preventing tax refund fraud,\u201d Lamancusa said.\n\nNow the big question is how does it affect your taxes?\n\n\u201cIt can affect your tax return in two ways: taxpayers need to determine if they owe a shared responsibility payment or if they are eligible for a premium tax credit. Now, with the shared responsibility provision, taxpayers need to report if they had adequate health insurance for the entire 2015 tax year. If they were not covered during the entire year, then they will be subject to a federal tax penalty based on months not covered. However, there are hardship exemptions that may apply which absolve any liability created,\u201d Lamancusa said.\n\nWhat about the premium tax credit? How does that effect your taxes?\n\n\u201cThe premium tax credit is available to individuals who purchase their health insurance through the marketplace,\u201d Lamancusa said.\n\nHow do you know if you purchased insurance through the marketplace?\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have health insurance through your employer, Medicare, or Medicaid then most likely you had to seek out coverage through the marketplace. By now, taxpayers should have received a Form 1095-A which confirms that a person received coverage through the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nAny other last minute advice for our taxpayers?\n\n\u201cIt relates to protecting ourselves from tax refund fraud and identity theft. The IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email, phone, text or any other social media channel to request personal or financial information. The IRS will contact you by mail and will not threaten you to make payment immediately. Keep all your personal information safe and be skeptical of those contacting you for this information,\u201d Lamancusa said.\n\nFor more tax tips and information about tax season, visit Jim Lamancusa\u2019s facebook page.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Certified public accountant Jim Lamancusa talked to us about how to be prepared during tax season.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=394896224", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "Certified public accountant Jim Lamancusa talked to us about how to be prepared during tax season.", "title": "How to be prepared during tax season", "url": "http://abc27.com/2016/03/06/how-to-be-prepared-during-tax-season/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/tax-tips.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ABC27.com", "description": "Certified public accountant Jim Lamancusa talked to us about how to be prepared during tax season.", "title": "How to be prepared during tax season", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/tax-tips.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@abc27News", "site": "abc27news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Local, Top Video", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, weather, traffic and sports for Harrisburg, Pa.
