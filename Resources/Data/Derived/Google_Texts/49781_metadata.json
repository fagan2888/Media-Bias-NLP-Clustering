The initial conservative reaction to the disaster, you will recall, was to blame the crisis on the people at the bottom, on minorities and proletarians lost in an orgy of financial misbehavior. Sure enough, when taking on ordinary people who got loans during the real-estate bubble, the president\u2019s Department of Justice has shown admirable devotion to duty, filing hundreds of mortgage-fraud cases against small-timers.\n\nBut high-ranking financiers? Obama\u2019s Department of Justice has thus far shown virtually no interest in holding leading bankers criminally accountable for what went on in the last decade. That is ruled out not only by the Too Big to Jail doctrine that top-ranking Obama officials have hinted at, but also by the same logic that inspires certain conservative thinkers\u2014that financiers simply could not have committed fraud, since you would expect fraud to result in riches and instead so many banks went out of business.\n\n\u201cBenjamin Wagner, a U.S. Attorney who is actively prosecuting mortgage fraud cases in Sacramento, Calif., points out that banks lose money when a loan turns out to be fraudulent,\u201d reported a now-famous 2010 story in the Huffington Post. \u201cBut convincing a jury that executives intended to make fraudulent loans, and thus should be held criminally responsible, may be too difficult of a hurdle for prosecutors. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that they would be deliberately defrauding themselves,\u2019 Wagner said.\u201d\n\nSo forget those thousands of hours of Congressional investigation and those thousands of pages of journalism on the crisis. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to the man in charge. No jury would be convinced. Case closed.\n\nAs it happens, a trial just ended in Sacramento in which a jury was convinced that \u201cexecutives intended to make fraudulent loans.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing, though: It wasn\u2019t the government that made the case against the financiers; it was the defendants.\n\n*\n\nThe case started as a routine mortgage-fraud prosecution, brought by none other than the aforementioned U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner. A group of eastern European immigrants had bought houses in California in 2006, in a real-estate market that was in the early stages of collapse. According to the indictment, filed in 2012, these people\u2019s mortgage applications contained blank spots and wrong information; they were accused of getting the mortgages in order to sell the houses to one another at pumped-up prices in what is called a \u201cstraw buyer\u201d scheme. Also, they defaulted on the loans.\n\nHowever, members of the immigrants\u2019 legal defense team\u2014several of them appointed by the state\u2014had read the newspapers over the years and were aware of the kinds of things that had gone on in real estate during the bubble. They knew, for example, that in the go-go days of the last decade, the mortgage origination industry routinely cranked out \u201cstated income\u201d loans\u2014also known as \u201cliar\u2019s loans\u201d\u2014to people who were obviously unable to make the payments. The bankers back then almost never checked on whether the borrower was telling the truth about their income; they just wanted to make the loan. So the defense team in Sacramento came up with a novel strategy: How can the borrower have committed fraud on a mortgage application if the lender didn\u2019t care whether their answers were truthful?\n\nAnd lenders so didn\u2019t care back in the bubble days. They invented liar\u2019s loans and blanketed the country with them during the Oughts not because the poors talked them into doing it, or because the liberals in the Bush Administration forced them to do it\u2014on the contrary, the government warned them against issuing these things, just as the government warns us against swallowing arsenic. The reason bankers did it was because liar\u2019s loans were making bankers rich.\n\nThis is a difficult thing to understand\u2014indeed, not understanding it is the stated reason Obama Administration officials have made no effort to send financiers to jail\u2014so let us take this slowly. Executives at the mortgage origination companies got huge bonuses in those days for writing lots of loans. OK? They wanted to write more of them, and the only way to really crank out mortgages on a vast scale was by giving one to anyone who wanted one, regardless of their ability to pay, a feat that is only possible by means of the \u201cliar\u2019s loan.\u201d So: Liar\u2019s loans = rich bankers.\n\nNow, it just so happens that liar\u2019s loans are a lousy product, something that is virtually guaranteed to fail when prices stop rising, something that everyone knew at the time would fail when the bubble burst. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see liar\u2019s loans when banks are honest and regulators are on the job. Because the bank that makes liar\u2019s loans\u2014and the investor who buys a security based on liar\u2019s loans\u2014will eventually lose their money. That\u2019s why they are banned today. So: Liar\u2019s loans = dead banks. Liar\u2019s loans = slow-acting arsenic. But on the other hand, the immediate bonuses that mortgage execs were collecting for making these poisonous loans were so sweet that they didn\u2019t really care about the long-term effects. So while those awful loans they wrote eventually sank all the big subprime houses\u2014and wrecked the global economy to boot, with Europe still in ruins, etc.\u2014the bankers themselves lived to sail away into the sunset, their yachts laden with bullion.\n\nDo you see what I\u2019m saying? Executives do not always share the interests of the corporation that employs them. They weren\u2019t \u201cdefrauding themselves,\u201d as our federal protector laughs, they were defrauding the suckers that paid their bonuses, the shareholders that invested in them, the European pension funds that believed their excreta was Grade A Prime.\n\nThe name for this kind of scheme is a \u201ccontrol fraud\u201d; it happens when the officers who control a firm use their power over the firm to enrich themselves while driving the firm itself to the boneyard. The country has seen control frauds many times before; indeed, the man who invented the term was a regulator of S&Ls during the S&L meltdown of the 1980s, and he saw the pattern so many times back then that he wrote a book about it. I am referring to my friend Bill Black, a professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and also a Distinguished Scholar in Residence for Financial Regulation at the University of Minnesota\u2019s School of Law. Control fraud, Black says, always follows the same recipe, with banks growing rapidly by making vast numbers of extremely risky loans, executives immediately getting rich with big bonuses, and the bank eventually collapsing under the weight of those malicious loans.\n\nThe last decade\u2019s epidemic of crap financial instruments\u2014liar\u2019s loans, NINJA loans, interest-only ARMs and all the rest\u2014fit the pattern perfectly. \u201cIt makes no sense for an honest banker to lend in this fashion,\u201d Black told me. \u201cIf you lend in this fashion, you will suffer catastrophic losses. So honest banks don\u2019t make loans without effective underwriting. But dishonest banks find, under the fraud recipe, that it optimizes their fraud scheme. To make not just a few bad loans, but to have a regular practice of making, day in and day out, enormous numbers of bad loans. . . . You\u2019re mathematically guaranteed to make the officers rich and then they can walk away while the place collapses.\u201d\n\n*\n\nBill Black worked for many years as a bank regulator and a lawyer for the Federal government, but these days the Federal government has little interest in litigation against bankers. That\u2019s why the mortgage-fraud case in Sacramento saw him appearing as an expert witness for the defense, on whose behalf he testified at great length about the role of control fraud in pumping the real-estate bubble.\n\nThe defense wanted the jury to hear Black\u2019s theory because the essence of our government\u2019s law-enforcement work on mortgage fraud is that banks were the victims. Those poor unfortunate financiers were tricked by little people like the \u201cneighbor\u201d that Rick Santelli once ranted against, trying to get an extra bathroom that he didn\u2019t deserve.\n\nWhat the defense team sought to prove was that this picture was completely upside-down\u2014that the banks didn\u2019t care if people lied on liar\u2019s loans. According to the legal definition of fraud, the lie in question has to be \u201cmaterial,\u201d meaning it has to influence the decision-makers. When a bank is honest, that is an easy thing to show. But it\u2019s different if the decision-makers are themselves trying to crank out lousy (but profitable) loans.
