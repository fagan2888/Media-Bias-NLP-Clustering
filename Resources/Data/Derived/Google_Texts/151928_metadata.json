Mark Pryor (D-AR) is feverishly working to distance himself from President Barack Obama and his unpopular policies. In fact, Pryor is trying so hard to avoid being tied to the White House that he wouldn\u2019t answer a Politico reporter\u2019s question about whether he would vote for Obamacare again if he had to do it all over:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things about the president that I don\u2019t approve of \u2014 in terms of his policies,\u201d Pryor said, adding he\u2019s worked with presidents of both parties. Similarly, asked in a follow-up email if he would vote for Obamacare again if he had the chance, Pryor didn\u2019t answer directly. He said the law \u201cisn\u2019t perfect\u201d and he\u2019d \u201cwork to make it better,\u201d but \u201csomething needed to be done\u201d to rein in the insurance industry.\n\nWell, Pryor has already answered that question.\n\nDuring an April appearance on KARK-TV, the Arkansas Democrat was asked virtually the same question, to which he replied, \u201cYou know, I would have. Of course I would want to see some changes back then,\u201d said Pryor. \u201cBut I think on something like this, it\u2019s big, it\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you\u2019ve really done something.\u201d\n\nObamacare has become a central issue in Senate races in which vulnerable Democrats incumbents are running, including Arkansas, where 60 percent of voters hold an unfavorable view of the law.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "2014 election,Arkansas,Barack Obama,Mark Pryor,ObamaCare,Politico,Senate Democrats,Senate Election 2014,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Like so many Senate Democrats running for reelection this year, Sen.
