But then again so was Stalin. When you can kill anyone you want, things tend to get done. For a while anyway.\n\nIs a Socialist really going to lecture ISIS on fantasy governments that can't function in the world? Last I checked, much of the country is out of work, the national debt is so high it's beyond unsustainable and the only reason the country hasn't collapsed is that oil is cheap.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at ISIL, it has no governing strategy,\u201d Obama said Sunday in an interview on CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria GPS. \u201cIt can talk about setting up the new caliphate, but nobody is under any illusions that they can actually in a sustained way feed people or educate people or organize a society that would work.\u201d\n\nSo it's more like California then?\n\nBut what difference does it make. And I don't ask that in a Hillary sort of way. ISIS isn't winning because it has good government. The whole idea that we needed a good government on the ground to win over people was a crazy COIN delusion that got a lot of soldiers killed. And not much else.\n\nISIS simply kills people. It governs because it has the guns. Like the left.\n\nThe only plan is to keep expanding, seizing more territory, looting it, etc. To a prog it doesn't sound like much of a plan, but the USSR and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan all made use of it.\n\nYou don't need government if you have warlords. Just ask Genghis Khan.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "So it's just like ObamaCare.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "So it's just like ObamaCare.", "title": "Obama: ISIS a \"Fantasy That Can't Function in the World\"", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/250584/obama-isis-fantasy-cant-function-world-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/250584/obama-isis-fantasy-cant-function-world-daniel-greenfield", "description": "So it's just like ObamaCare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: ISIS a \"Fantasy That Can't Function in the World\""}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T19:34:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4df\"", "article_summary": "Is a Socialist really going to lecture ISIS on fantasy governments that can't function in the world?\nObama said it\u2019s important \u201cwe maintain a proper perspective,\u201d on the Islamic State, describing it as a \u201cdeath cult or a entirely backward-looking fantasy that can\u2019t function in the world.\u201dSo it's just like ObamaCare.\nAccording to Obama, his administration does have something in common with ISIS.\nExcept that ISIS seems to be more effective than Obama.\n\u201cWhen you look at ISIL, it has no governing strategy,\u201d Obama said Sunday in an interview on CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria GPS."}
