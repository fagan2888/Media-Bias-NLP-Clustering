A park ranger found the body of the experienced hiker in an off-trail area he was known to frequent, about a half-mile from the Elephant Back Loop Trail near Lake Village on Friday afternoon.\n\nPartial tracks at the scene led investigators to believe an adult female grizzly and at least one cub were involved in the attack. Heavy rains in the area on Friday evening hindered further recovery of bear DNA evidence by rangers and wildlife biologists.\n\nThe area including the Elephant Back Loop Trail has been closed until further notice.\n\nWildlife biologists have set traps in the area and, if they capture and identify a bear involved in the attack, the animal will be euthanized.\n\n\u201cWe may not be able to conclusively determine the circumstances of this bear attack, but we will not risk public safety,\u201d said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk in a prepared statement. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim as they work to cope with the loss of someone who loved Yellowstone so very much.\u201d\n\nKevin Simpson: 303-954-1739, ksimpson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ksimpsondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Yellowstone hiker believed to be victim of grizzly bear attack", "title": "Yellowstone hiker believed to be victim of grizzly bear attack", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/yellowstone-hiker-believed-to-be-victim-of-grizzly-bear-attack/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_045414_grizzly-bear.jpg", "height": 372}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_045414_grizzly-bear.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T16:48:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:21:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3d9\"", "article_summary": "The body of a hiker in Yellowstone National Park reported missing on Friday morning was found later that day partially consumed and covered, and preliminary results of an investigation point to a grizzly bear attack.\n\u201cWe may not be able to conclusively determine the circumstances of this bear attack, but we will not risk public safety,\u201d said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk in a prepared statement.\nHe was reported missing when he failed to show up for work Friday morning.\nHeavy rains in the area on Friday evening hindered further recovery of bear DNA evidence by rangers and wildlife biologists.\nWildlife biologists have set traps in the area and, if they capture and identify a bear involved in the attack, the animal will be euthanized."}
