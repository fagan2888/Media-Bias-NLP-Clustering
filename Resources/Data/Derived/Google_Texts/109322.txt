LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on the slaying of a Chinese herbalist and his family in Santa Barbara (all times local):

12:41 p.m. Saturday

The sister of a 27-year-old man arrested in the slaying of a Chinese herbalist and his family says she is in shock.

Nadine Jolie Courtney, a beauty blogger and author, said in an email Saturday that Pierre Haobsh is her brother.

Courtney says she can’t wrap her mind around the tragedy and condemned the killings and extended her prayers to the Han family.

Haobsh was arrested in the shooting death of popular Chinese herbal medicine practitioner Dr. Weidong “Henry” Han, Han’s wife and 5-year-old daughter in Santa Barbara County.

The victims’ bodies were found shot, wrapped in plastic and duct-taped in the garage of their palatial two-story home.
