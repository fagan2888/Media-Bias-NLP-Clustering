A poll conducted in late December by Pat Caddell confirmed a growing rift between voters and Republican leaders in the House and Senate.\n\nAs a result of this loss of faith in the Republican leadership, a broad coalition of conservative activists, thinkers, leaders and organizations came together to put on paper specific policy proposals for the new Republican majority on a wide range of economic, social and national security issues.\n\nThey come under the headings of \u201cFighting for our Founding Principles, Smaller Government and Constitutional Rights,\u201d \u201cShine the Light of Oversight on Abusive Power,\u201d \u201cPromote and Fight for Limited, Accountable Government,\u201d and \u201cReturn to Regular Order.\u201d The mandate document concludes with a strong admonition to honor the verdict of the voters and not deviate:\n\n\u201cCongress has an historic opportunity to lay down a marker for freedom and stop the erosion of freedom emanating from the pen of President Obama. They were elected to do just that, to not only stop the fundamental transformation of America, but to create the alternative vision of a prosperous, free America where citizens know that hard work is the pathway to success. They were elected to protect and defend the Constitution from the tidal wave of encroachments that threaten the basic God-given freedom from government that individuals are guaranteed. They were elected to stop and reverse the President\u2019s agenda and policies. They were not elected to relinquish more power, compromise and enable Obama to use their acquiescence to justify continued abuses.\u201d\n\nThe November election was a repudiation of President Obama\u2019s dramatic expansion of government power both through legislative and executive actions. The voters demanded that Congress stop this President's fundamental transformation of America using every power at their disposal, restoring Constitutional balance of power, and ending the Executive Branch abuses against both the citizenry and the foundational concept that individual rights are derived from God, not government.\n\nThe new Congress was elected to stop and reverse the President\u2019s agenda and policies. They were not elected to relinquish more power, compromise and enable Obama to use their acquiescence to justify continued abuses.\n\nFailure to fully engage in this historic political battle over the future of the nation is not statesmanship or governing, it is a base betrayal of both the principles Congress swore to defend and those who entrusted them to do just that.\n\nWe expect to take stock of Congress\u2019 progress annually on the American Mandate to preserve America\u2019s greatness, as started by the 56 men who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish self-government and liberty as opposed to being governed by a king. It is the least this Congress can do to push back for us and those daring founders who had a bold vision.\n\nWe urge all CHQ readers to read the mandate and then contact their Senators and Representative (the capitol Switchboard is 1-866-220-0044) and urge them to stop caving in to Obama and Washington\u2019s Big Business elite and to follow the CITIZENS MANDATE FROM THE NOVEMBER 2014 ELECTION. We have also adopted a social media \u201chashtag\u201d for the Mandate: #NoRetreat. We urge you to use the #NoRetreat in social media to help spread the word to your friends, family and contacts through social media posts.
