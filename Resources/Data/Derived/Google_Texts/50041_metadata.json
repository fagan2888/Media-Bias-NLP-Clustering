An \u201ceye-watering\u201d result, one analyst called it.\n\nDiminishing wars and plunging defense spending had slashed the weapons maker\u2019s revenue and left some subsidiaries worth far less than it had paid for them. But the company was already pushing in a new direction.\n\nSoon after Congress passed the landmark Affordable Care Act, the maker of submarines and tanks decided to expand its business related to health care. Its 2011 purchase of health-data firm Vangent instantly made it the largest contractor to Medicare and Medicaid, huge government health plans for seniors and the poor.\n\n\u201cThey saw that their legacy defense market was going to be taking a hit,\u201d said Sebastian Lagana, an analyst with Technology Business Research, a market research firm. \u201cAnd they knew [the ACA] was going to inject funds into the health care market.\u201d\n\nThey were right. In a way that is deeply changing Washington contracting, growth opportunities from the federal government have increasingly come not from war but from healing, an examination by Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post shows.\n\nPolitics are frozen. Budgets are tight. But business purchases by the Department of Health and Human Services have doubled to $21 billion annually in the last decade and are expected to continue rising.\n\nPolitics are frozen. Budgets are tight. But business purchases by the Department of Health and Human Services have doubled to $21 billion annually in the last decade and are expected to continue rising.\n\nHHS is now the No. 3 contracting agency, thanks to health-law spending combined with outlays for computer upgrades and Medicare\u2019s drug program that grew during the administration of George W. Bush. HHS outranks NASA and the Department of Homeland Security in business deals and spends more than the departments of Justice, Transportation, Treasury and Agriculture combined, federal data show.\n\nIf health care is \u201cthe new oil,\u201d as some investors hope, HHS is one of the richest fields \u2014 along with massive opportunities in health-related computer spending by the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Treasury.\n\n\u201cThe DOD market is very weak,\u201d said Steve Kelman, a Harvard management professor and contracting specialist. \u201cThe two growth markets are cybersecurity and health care. So everybody\u2019s trying to get into those.\u201d\n\nThe new money is buying medical-record software, insurance websites, claims processing, data analysis, computer system overhauls, consumer education and consulting expertise to control costs and identify fraud.\n\n\n\nTrue, it\u2019s a fraction of the $200 billion-plus the Pentagon spent on planes, bombs and other purchases in fiscal 2014. But thanks largely to automatic cuts set in 2011, defense contracting has dipped by more than a third since 2008 despite continuing conflict in Afghanistan and the Middle East.\n\nFew expect that to happen to health contracting \u2014 even with limited budgets and Republicans opposed to the health law controlling both sides of Congress. Analysts expect the Ebola crisis to add billions more to an HHS budget that was already expected to grow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard to find more money,\u201d said Stephen Fuller, an economist at George Mason University who follows federal spending closely. \u201cBut I would think HHS is in a position to sustain their funding levels and gain some as well where other agencies are going to find it more difficult just to keep what they have.\u201d\n\nThis KHN story also ran in The Washington Post. It can be republished for free (details). logo washingtonpost110\n\nHHS\u2019 contracting budget is separate from the billions the agency pays in reimbursement to caregivers of Medicare patients; its grants to states for Medicaid; and its awards through the National Institutes of Health to clinical research institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIf health care is \u201cthe new oil,\u201d as some investors hope, HHS is one of the richest fields \u2014 along with massive opportunities in health-related computer spending by the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Treasury.\n\nTraditionally HHS vendors processed Medicare claims, made vaccines and managed information technology. HHS spending had already spiked in 2009, before the health law was passed, thanks to extraordinary purchases of H1N1 flu vaccines. But the ambitious ACA, intended to expand health coverage, overhaul payments and reengineer care \u2014and with ample budgets to attempt all three \u2014 changed the game.\n\n\u201cJust because of the Affordable Care Act our health care business has probably doubled in the last five years,\u201d said Nelson Ford, CEO of LMI Government Consulting, which helps HHS analyze and regulate the new, private insurance plans sold under the law.\n\nThe law effectively created major companies from scratch as well as growing new divisions at established businesses.\n\n\u201cIt just occurred to me: If this bill does become law it will be a level playing field [for contractors] and we\u2019ll have a head start,\u201d said Sanjay Singh, who founded Reston-based hCentive based on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s promise. \u201cAnd we can build a company.\u201d\n\nToday hCentive employs more than 650 people. The company built the federal government\u2019s online marketplace for small-business health plans and is working on insurance portals for Massachusetts, New York, Colorado and Kentucky.\n\nBusiness at HighPoint Global, with offices in Virginia, Maryland and Indiana, ballooned from a few million to more than $100 million annually after it landed the job of training and quality control for dozens of call centers handling questions about the insurance marketplaces, federal data show. HighPoint CEO Ben Lanius declined a request for an interview.\n\nFor contractors, profiting from the health law goes far beyond the $840 million-plus HHS has already spent on the troubled healthcare.gov portal. (This year the agency fired CGI Federal, the site\u2019s primary contractor, and replaced it with Accenture. HHS contracted with CGI for work worth $339 million the last two years; with Accenture, $192 million in contracts, records show.)\n\nDefense giant Serco has done more than $400 million worth of business with HHS in the past two years, records show, much of it for collecting paper insurance applications that surged when the online marketplaces failed.\n\nHHS\u2019 innovation lab, with a $10 billion budget over a decade, is hiring research firms such as Mathematica to test alternatives to traditional, \u201cfee for service\u201d medicine that encourages unnecessary procedures. The ACA also furnished an extra $350 million to hire cyber sleuths to fight Medicare fraud.\n\nA related law, the HITECH Act of 2009, steered another $30 billion via Medicare reimbursements to spur hospitals and doctors to buy medical-record software from private industry.\n\nFor traditional defense contractors, health care isn\u2019t the new oil. It\u2019s the new F-35 fighter or Zumwalt-class destroyer.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty exciting time to be in the federal health IT space,\u201d said Horace Blackman, Lockheed Martin\u2019s vice president of health and life sciences. \u201cThe biggest opportunities I would point to are efforts associated with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nWhile Lockheed has run HHS computers for a long time, its business with the agency has increased by more than half since 2006 to $300 million annually, according to federal records.\n\nThe company won part of a $15 billion data management contract from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2012, along with Accenture, CGI Federal and others. It\u2019s bidding with many others on another giant health job \u2014 an $11 billion Pentagon contract to modernize the military\u2019s computer medical records.\n\nDefense vendors are recycling products from battlefield to bedside. Lockheed says it converted missile-defense software into a hospital tool for the early identification of sepsis, a life-threatening response by the body to infection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of these companies quietly repositioning and reusing their legacy capabilities,\u201d said John Caucis, a senior analyst with Technology Business Research.\n\nAlong with cybersecurity smarts, Washington employers especially prize health analytics skills, recruiters say.\n\n\u201cWe have 200 epidemiologists. We have clinical statisticians. We have physicians. We have nurses,\u201d said Amy Caro, head of the health division at Northrop Grumman, better known for its B-2 stealth bomber.\n\nAmong other HHS work, Northrop manages data sharing for the National Institutes of Health; helped launch the health law\u2019s accountable care organizations to control costs and improve care; and turned telecommunications software into a Medicare fraud detector.\n\nThe quickest way to acquire a particular expertise needed by HHS, some contractors have found, is often to mimic General Dynamics and buy somebody already doing the work.\n\nIn October Xerox said it acquired Consilience Software, maker of patient case-management and disease-surveillance programs for government agencies. The same month defense and intelligence giant Booz Allen Hamilton said it bought the health division of Genova Technologies, a tech company that has done $90 million in HHS business since the health law was passed, according to federal records.\n\nThe deal is part of a larger push by Booz, majority owned by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, to sell technology services and consulting to HHS.\n\nIts yearly business with the agency has quadrupled in the last decade to $170 million even as its overall revenue from the federal government has shrunk, according to contracting data. (However, the extent of Booz\u2019s government work is unclear because its jobs for spy agencies don\u2019t show up in official records, contracting specialists say.)\n\nThis summer Booz won part of a huge (potentially $7 billion) job to help HHS\u2019 innovation lab design, run and evaluate tests to improve care results and control costs. Other awardees include RTI International, a nonprofit; Deloitte, a consulting firm; the Lewin Group, a consultancy owned by insurer UnitedHealth Group; and Truven Health Analytics, a research shop owned by private equity investors Veritas Capital.\n\nBooz officials did not respond to repeated requests for interviews.\n\nHealth-care acquisitions by defense contractors don\u2019t always work smoothly. In 2011 General Dynamics paid Veritas nearly $1 billion for Vangent, a seller of health information technology and business services.\n\nGeneral Dynamics did not make executives available for interviews. But the deal did not go as well as the company hoped, as Vangent\u2019s corporate culture clashed with that of the buyer, said Technology Business Research\u2019s Lagana. Part of General Dynamics\u2019 $2 billion quarterly loss at the end of 2012 was \u2014 ironically \u2014 related not to defense but to Vangent and its health-care work, he said.\n\nBut thanks to Vangent, the company got the task of staffing call centers to explain healthcare.gov to consumers. That job became bigger than anybody imagined when the site crashed during insurance enrollment a year ago. General Dynamics ended up hiring 8,000, mostly temporary workers to run hotlines for Obamacare as well as Medicare.\n\nThis year healthcare.gov is working better, by many accounts. Enrollment began Nov. 15. Again General Dynamics has been hiring to answer the phones. The company\u2019s $815 million in spending commitments from HHS made it the agency\u2019s top contractor for fiscal 2014, not counting vaccine makers.\n\nAnd because its call-center jobs are \u201ccost-plus\u201d contracts, every hire comes with a built-in profit.\n\nThis story is republished from Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post.
