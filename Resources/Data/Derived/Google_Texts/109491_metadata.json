But it\u2019s a perennial and important topic worth another look, this time limited to Christianity. [Thus the following leaves aside the pressing problem of Islam's growing faction that applies religiously motivated terrorism against the innocent, fellow Muslims included.]\n\nThe Christian discussion involves especially two Bible passages. In the Ten Commandments, God proclaims, \u201cYou shall not kill\u201d (Exodus 20:13, repeated in Deuteronomy 5:17). Or so say the familiar Douay, King James, and Revised Standard versions. However, most recent Christian translations instead follow the same word choice as the Jewish Publication Society editions of 1917 and 1985: \u201cYou shall not murder.\u201d\n\nHebrew scholars tell us the verb here refers specifically to illegitimate taking of life, that is \u201cmurder,\u201d as distinct from various other types of \u201ckilling.\u201d\n\nConservative Judaism\u2019s commentary explains that throughout Scripture the verb in the commandments \u201cis never used in the administration of justice or for killing in war\u201d that may be justifiable. Richard Elliott Friedman of the University of California, San Diego, lists situations where other verbs are used: \u201cmanslaughter, killing through negligence, killing in war, execution for crimes, killing animals, animals killing humans, and human sacrifice,\u201d plus deadly mistakes treated in Deuteronomy 4:41-42. (Friedman notes the vigorous debate over whether \u201ckilling\u201d in abortion and assisted suicide is the equivalent of biblical \u201cmurder.\u201d)\n\nThe late Canadian Rabbi W. Gunther Plaut wrote \u201cThe Torah: A Modern Commentary\u201d for Judaism\u2019s liberal Reform branch. This work said correct understanding of the Hebrew means \u201cthose supporting pacifism or the abolition of capital punishment cannot justifiably base themselves on this word, but must look to other reasons.\u201d\n\nClear enough. But did Jesus Christ reinterpret this teaching? That brings us to the second scriptural passage, Jesus\u2019 \u201cSermon on the Mount\u201d in the New Testament\u2019s Gospel of Matthew, often seen as patterned after God\u2019s giving of the Old Testament law to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\nThis challenging section raises major interpretive questions. Old Testament law functioned when Jews had their own government, whereas the New Testament speaks to Jews and Gentiles utterly lacking in political power. Do Jesus\u2019 words apply only to personal relationships or, as advocates of non-violence and pacifism believe, require that Christians always refuse to bear arms?\n\nAs with the Old Testament translations, modern New Testaments have Jesus quote the commandment as \u201cyou shall not murder\u201d instead of \u201ckill\u201d in Matthew 5:21-22. Non-pacifists figure Jesus would have followed Old Testament acceptance of certain killings as morally justified since he didn\u2019t overturn this concept.\n\nContinue reading, \"How do Christians -- past and present -- interpret 'Thou shall not kill'?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GEORGE\u2019S QUESTION:\r\n\r\nWhen are we as Christians allowed to fight back and protect our \r\ncivilization?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY\u2019S ANSWER:\r\n\r\nGeorge wonders whether Christians should work in police departments, whose \r\nconduct is much in the news, as well as the armed forces or other security \r\nvocations that\u00a0 involve use of violence and possible\u00a0\u00a0injury or death.\r\n\r\nThe Religion Guy previously addressed various religions\u2019 views of military \r\nservice in this post.
