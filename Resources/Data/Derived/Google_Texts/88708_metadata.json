Merrill Jr., a small publisher who served on the Literature Committee of the Century Association, where Woolsey went for lunch after the \u201cUlysses\u201d hearing. For more information, consult Kevin Birmingham\u2019s \u201cThe Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce\u2019s \u2018Ulysses.\u2019 \u201d At times a headline-grabber like Charlie Merrill gets credit where none is due, while the modest committee man loses the distinction he deserves.\n\nLANGDON HAMMER\n\nNEW HAVEN\n\nThe writer is chairman of the \u00adEnglish department at Yale.\n\n*\n\nOvercritical Reader\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI have been a reader of the Book Review for many years and have encountered many critical reviews. However, I do not remember reading anything as meanspirited as Leah Price\u2019s review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma: A Modern Retelling\u201d (May 31). Any legitimate criticism she may have had was lost in the snide tone of her remarks. One can only hope that she is more constructive in her assessment of her students.\n\nTOBY LAMARCHE-DEUTCHMAN\n\nSARASOTA, FLA.\n\n*\n\nPoetry Recital\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised David McCullough included Billy Collins among the \u201cbest contemporary writers\u201d (By the Book, May 31). I had the privilege of meeting McCullough in November 2013. When our talk turned to poetry, his bright eyes took on even more of a twinkle, and he began reciting poetry he had learned as a child with such joy and enthusiasm that I no longer saw an 80-year-old historian, but the 8-year-old who fell in love with language and hasn\u2019t stopped playing with it since.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDONNA MARIE MERRITT\n\nWATERTOWN, CONN.\n\n*\n\nUrban Jungle\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe Vanessa Grigoriadis\u2019s review of Wednesday Martin\u2019s memoir \u201cPrimates of Park Avenue\u201d (May 31): How insecure Martin must be to require a Birkin bag as her \u201csword and shield\u201d for navigating the sidewalks of the Upper East Side. Whenever I wander into the \u201choneyed and moneyed\u201d precincts west of Lexington Avenue (from my plebeian home eastward) with nothing but my guile and ratty tote bag to fortify me, I somehow manage to secure safe passage.\n\nCLINTON J. GUTHRIE\n\nNEW YORK\n\n*\n\nArt of the Profile\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nCalling Joseph Mitchell\u2019s work \u201cnonfiction,\u201d as it is in Blake Bailey\u2019s review of \u201cMan in Profile\u201d (May 24), does a disservice to every journalist trying to get it right. Mitchell\u2019s routine use of what Bailey calls \u201ccomposites of various New York characters\u201d is by definition fiction. There must be some way to honor Mitchell\u2019s talent without mischaracterizing his work as journalism.\n\nJACK ISENHOUR\n\nNASHVILLE\n\n*\n\nLoving Lovelace\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWe are not amused. In what dusty attic at Windsor Castle did you discover a reviewer for Sydney Padua\u2019s \u201cThe Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage\u201d (June 7), that learned and brilliantly absurdist pictorial romp? I\u2019ve had a copy for weeks and have shown it to several friends who fell all over themselves laughing; it was hard to get it back into my own hands.\n\nNo, I am neither a teenage geek nor a steampunk fan \u2014 I\u2019m an 81-year-old woman who knows a thing or two about both Lovelace and Babbage. My 87-year-old husband knows nothing about them, or steampunk either, and as I write he is sitting in the living room chuckling as he reads the book and snickering at your review.\n\nGERMAINE WARKENTIN\n\nTORONTO\n\n*\n\nAn Astonishing Life\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nPhillips Verner Bradford, who wrote \u201cOta Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo\u201d with me, died in 2013. He cannot respond to your review of \u201cSpectacle,\u201d by Pamela Newkirk (June 7), and defend our portrayal of his grandfather, Samuel Phillips Verner, who played an important role in the story.\n\nSo I will do it for us both: At no time did we try to shield S. P. Verner from responsibility for bringing African pygmies to the United States, first for display at the St. Louis World\u2019s Fair of 1904, and then, in the case of Ota Benga, for particular exploitation by William Temple Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo.\n\nIf Newkirk has indeed uncovered new material, that is welcome news to me, as it would have been to my co-author. Ota Benga led, as the subtitle of Newkirk\u2019s book asserts, an \u201castonishing life.\u201d But nobody owns Ota Benga, neither the racist zookeeper who sought to cage him nor any subsequent authors or artists.\n\nHARVEY BLUME\n\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150617150158, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to recent essays about \u201cUlysses,\u201d a review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma\u201d and more.", "title": "Letters: A More Fascinating Detail", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/letters-a-more-fascinating-detail.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003734653"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/letters-a-more-fascinating-detail.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003734653", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/letters-a-more-fascinating-detail.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "books/review", "hdl_p": "Letters", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/books/review/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 17, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Books and Literature", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "SCG": "review", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers respond to recent essays about \u201cUlysses,\u201d a review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma\u201d and more.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Readers respond to recent essays about \u201cUlysses,\u201d a review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma\u201d and more.", "CG": "books", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 17, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section": "Sunday Book Review", "modified": "2015-06-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/books/review/index.jsonp", "tag": "Books and Literature", "published": "2015-06-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "7B052F64-13C5-4631-ACE4-F1BAA9706061"}, "slug": "21letters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150619230202, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/letters-a-more-fascinating-detail.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Readers respond to recent essays about \u201cUlysses,\u201d a review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma\u201d and more.", "title": "Letters: A More Fascinating Detail"}, "pdate": 20150617, "des": "Books and Literature", "articleid": 100000003734653, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Letters: A More Fascinating Detail", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "*Overcritical ReaderTo the Editor:I have been a reader of the Book Review for many years and have encountered many critical reviews.\nOta Benga led, as the subtitle of Newkirk\u2019s book asserts, an \u201castonishing life.\u201d But nobody owns Ota Benga, neither the racist zookeeper who sought to cage him nor any subsequent authors or artists.\nGERMAINE WARKENTINTORONTO*An Astonishing LifeTo the Editor:Phillips Verner Bradford, who wrote \u201cOta Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo\u201d with me, died in 2013.\nIf Newkirk has indeed uncovered new material, that is welcome news to me, as it would have been to my co-author.\nHowever, I do not remember reading anything as meanspirited as Leah Price\u2019s review of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s \u201cEmma: A Modern Retelling\u201d (May 31)."}
