Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was the winner of the Puerto Rico primary, the Associated Press said, after voters in the U.S. territory cast their ballots today for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

Rubio, who campaigned in Puerto Rico Saturday, has now won one state and one territory.

Frontrunner Donald Trump called for Rubio to drop out of the race Saturday night.

“I think it’s time for Marco to clean the deck. I do. And I say that respectfully,” Trump said.

Puerto Ricans do not vote in presidential elections, but they do participate in the primary process electing delegates for the Republican and Democratic conventions.

In the 2012 GOP primary, Mitt Romney was backed by former Gov. of Puerto Rico Luis Fortuño and earned a whopping 85 percent support compared to second-place finisher Rick Santorum, who garnered 8 percent of the vote.
