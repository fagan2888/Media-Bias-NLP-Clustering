You can crowdsource employees, answers, R&D, data, funding and accommodations. Some of the reasons crowdsourcing works so well are that the crowd amplifies the company\u2019s reach, the company can interact with the crowd and members of the crowd can interact with each other to gather information and solve problems.\n\nSeveral years ago, when I was choosing between grad schools, I went to the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s admissions office and asked if they could match the merit-based aid package offered by a similarly-ranked school. They plugged the school into their database and responded: \u201cOnly 8% of students choose that school over us, so no\u2026\u201d I remember looking around their office and thinking it would be great if applicants could have access to that information, or better yet, access to their file cabinets stuffed with the application details of accepted students. I had spent many a sleepless night speculating and worrying about the contents of those drawers.\n\nTogether with another equally frustrated classmate, I created AdmitSee. Our goal was simple: bringing transparency to college admissions. This is what we learned about building a business on crowdsourced information and labor:\n\nCrowdsourcing work to students. To get our first users, we hit the road, handing out AdmitSee logo sunglasses at college orientations. We anticipated that students would ask questions about our then-barren website, but the most common question we received was: \u201cDo you have any internships?\u201d We saw an opportunity.\n\nWe created a virtual internship program modeled after the popular crowdsourcing sites Fiverr and oDesk. Recruiting interns is incredibly easy. It\u2019s free to post on college job boards and platforms like internships.com. We ask students to submit their resumes through a contact form on our site \u2014 this helped build early traction. We interview and hire interns through Skype. Then we send out emails every Monday with a list of tasks to be completed (e.g., post flyers, write a blog post, get coverage of AdmitSee in your campus paper).\n\nLow cost of content acquisition. College students have access to hundreds of classmates\u2019 emails through dorm and extracurricular listservs and they\u2019re willing to share their favorite websites with their networks. On Facebook it costs a lot less to advertise to college students than to parents \u2014 our cost per click is around $.05 for students in comparison to $.20 for parents. You still have to create incentives for students to share their personal information \u2014 we split sales with college students, pay them for mentoring high school applicants and pay referral fees for new profiles.\n\nWillingness to disclose personal information. Some may be shocked at how much detail students are willing to share, but this is the Facebook generation. Most of our users were born in the late 1990s; Facebook launched when they were still in elementary school. We have application essays about sneaking into the country illegally, overcoming cancer, forging signatures for insurance benefits and other deeply personal experiences. These students are comfortable providing profile pictures and other identifying information alongside these essays.\n\nCrowdsourcing as a market disruptor. We\u2019ve received pushback from private college consultants who fear us as a market disruptor. Right now, the average consultant charges $4,035 per client. Some worry they\u2019ll be pushed out of the market, much like travel agents were replaced by data aggregators such as TripAdvisor and Kayak. Thankfully, there are just as many who want to partner with us. Admissions consulting companies use our database to train staff, provide examples to clients and manage parents\u2019 expectations.\n\nUltimately, AdmitSee\u2019s crowdsourced data and the ability to message college students aren\u2019t going to make one-to-one consulting for those who can afford it obsolete. However, it does help bridge the gap in access to information. That\u2019s why we are harnessing the crowd to lift the curtain on the mysterious college admissions process.\n\nMs. Fayal is the co-founder and CEO of AdmitSee, a college-oriented social-networking site.\n\nFollow @AdmitSee\n\n\n\nFollow @WSJstartup\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Lydia Fayal: Crowdsourcing for Students", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/10/28/lydia-fayal-crowdsourcing-for-students/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Small Business", "article.headline": "Lydia Fayal: Crowdsourcing for Students", "article_section": "Small Business", "author": "Adam Janofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Accelerators Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Accelerators", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-28T21:50:35-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/10/28/lydia-fayal-crowdsourcing-for-students/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-232B-3189", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Small Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/10/28/lydia-fayal-crowdsourcing-for-students/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "Lydia Fayal: Crowdsourcing for Students"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Accelerators", "article.id": "BL-232B-3189", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-28T21:50:35-04:00"}, "article_summary": "On Facebook it costs a lot less to advertise to college students than to parents \u2014 our cost per click is around $.05 for students in comparison to $.20 for parents.\nUltimately, AdmitSee\u2019s crowdsourced data and the ability to message college students aren\u2019t going to make one-to-one consulting for those who can afford it obsolete.\nCollege students have access to hundreds of classmates\u2019 emails through dorm and extracurricular listservs and they\u2019re willing to share their favorite websites with their networks.\nThat\u2019s why we are harnessing the crowd to lift the curtain on the mysterious college admissions process.\nYou still have to create incentives for students to share their personal information \u2014 we split sales with college students, pay them for mentoring high school applicants and pay referral fees for new profiles."}
