Looking at a terrace she said that Jefferson loved to admire the landscape from there. POTUS said that he\u2019d like to take a look and seemed delighted to \u201cbreak the protocol\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a President, I can do whatever I want\u201d he quipped, walking to the terrace with his guest and Ms. Bowman. Pool now in the mansion as the leaders will come and visit Jefferson\u2019s study.\n\nThe White House will likely insist that Obama made the comment in a strictly joking manner and only about the prospect of breaking \u201cprotocol\u201d at Monticello. Ironically, the pool report came at around the same time it was revealed that the White House plans to unilaterally delay the Obamacare mandate for some businesses.\n\nLawmakers have argued that the White House\u2019s decision to unilaterally delay parts of Obamacare represents a violation of the Constitution.\n\nPresident Hollande is in the U.S. on a state visit.\n\n(H/T: Weekly Standard)\n\n\u2013\n\nUPDATE: Fox News has the video of President Obama\u2019s joke:\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "During a visit with French President Francois Hollande at Monticello in Charlottesville, Va., President Barack Obama reportedly quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a president, I can do whatever I want.\u201d    Per the official pool report: At 4:45 POTUS and president Hollande walked out from a...", "creator": "@jason_howerton", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/10/obama-thats-the-good-thing-as-a-president-i-can-do-whatever-i-want/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x552.jpg", "title": "Obama: \u2018That\u2019s the Good Thing as a President, I Can Do Whatever I Want\u2019", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "obama, thats, good, thing, president, i, can, do, whatever, i, want", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, politics, us, author-jason-howerton, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 13151, "gplus-count": 24, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/759891", "categories": "barack-obama,politics,us", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 252, "description": "During a visit with French President Francois Hollande at Monticello in Charlottesville, Va., President Barack Obama reportedly quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a president, I can do whatever I want.\u201d    Per the official pool report: At 4:45 POTUS and president Hollande walked out from a...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "During a visit with French President Francois Hollande at Monticello in Charlottesville, Va., President Barack Obama reportedly quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a president, I can do whatever I want.\u201d    Per the official pool report: At 4:45 POTUS and president Hollande walked out from a...", "title": "Obama: \u2018That\u2019s the Good Thing as a President, I Can Do Whatever I Want\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/10/obama-thats-the-good-thing-as-a-president-i-can-do-whatever-i-want/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x552.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 552}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-10T18:11:43+00:00", "twitter-count": 443}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fc7\"", "article_summary": "During a visit with French President Francois Hollande at Monticello in Charlottesville, Va., President Barack Obama reportedly quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a president, I can do whatever I want.\u201dPer the official pool report:At 4:45 POTUS and president Hollande walked out from a portico and strolled in Front of your pool with Leslie Bowman, president of the Monticello Foundation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the good thing as a President, I can do whatever I want\u201d he quipped, walking to the terrace with his guest and Ms.\n(H/T: Weekly Standard)\u2013UPDATE: Fox News has the video of President Obama\u2019s joke:Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\nPresident Hollande is in the U.S. on a state visit.\nLawmakers have argued that the White House\u2019s decision to unilaterally delay parts of Obamacare represents a violation of the Constitution."}
