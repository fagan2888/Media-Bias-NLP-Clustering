So was pretty much everyone else. The midterms were done, the opposition party had ridden a wave to a wipe-out.\n\nThe political world was already looking past President George W. Bush. Obama was leading the charge.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Friday, Obama stood at the podium at the White House and dared anyone to try the same with him.\n\n\u201cInteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Obama said, at the outset of the 2014 wrap-up press conference at the White House, as he promised a year that would be heavy on outreach to Congress but also moving forward on his own \u2014 protecting health care and financial regulations, and pushing forward on immigration reform.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Operation Revenge)\n\nOr, as he put it in the subject line of the email that went out from his old political group Organizing for Action as the press conference wrapped up: \u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d\n\nIn part, Obama\u2019s got the larger political dynamics to thank. At this point in the run-up to 2008, everyone knew who the candidates were going to be, and most of the candidates had already started picking out office space for their headquarters.. This time around, even the politician most expected to run \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 has pushed off a final announcement until the spring. The action\u2019s so slim that Jeb Bush\u2019s Facebook post that he was \u201cactively exploring\u201d a presidential run was enough to come off like a cannonball.\n\nAnd as much as White House aides gloat about the recent run of good news that\u2019s fed the sense of a turnaround \u2014 \u201cIt gets better,\u201d was the year-end message Obama stressed as he closed up the press conference and got ready to head to Hawaii for two weeks \u2014 they admit that they\u2019ve gotten lucky in the timing. The climate deal with China, the booming Obamacare enrollment numbers, the teetering of the Russian economy \u2014 were all the result of long planning but ripened in close succession more on their own timetable than due to any great plan to jam-pack the last few weeks of the year.\n\nThey count the surprise rush of long-languishing confirmations in the closing days of the Senate as gravy.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama: America is leading)\n\nThen there\u2019s the president\u2019s reopening of relations with Cuba. Beyond revamping one of the longest-standing pieces of American foreign policy, Obama on Wednesday pulled off a total surprise, with the news not leaking until the plane carrying freed American Alan Gross was already in U.S. airspace. Sure Obama\u2019s planning on opening an embassy in Havana, but the move allowed him to project more than that: He\u2019s got stuff up his sleeve most people aren\u2019t even thinking about, and there\u2019s no predicting what he might do next \u2014 on his own.\n\nRepublicans should take notice, people in the West Wing think, but Democrats, too.\n\nHow good was Obama feeling about the closing note he\u2019d put on the year? He told an extended story of joking around with Ra\u00fal Castro about who was the most long-winded while the two men were on the phone Tuesday.\n\nThe result: Of the eight reporters Obama called on Friday, three of them asked about Cuba. None of them asked about the Republicans\u2019 midterm rout. None of them asked about the torture report. None of them asked about the war he stoked with liberals last week by endorsing an omnibus spending plan that peeled back part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations and blew the door open on campaign contributions. None of them asked about Ebola, or Veterans Affairs, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or any of the other things that engulfed the president earlier in the year.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Women rule Obama presser)\n\nThe questions about working with the new Republican majority were limited to a wonky one about corporate tax reform and one asking whether he was worried that his executive action emphasis was going to spoil relations with the new Congress.\n\nObama, as he did on nearly every question \u2014 including one on race relations, which he\u2019s often struggled to address in similar settings \u2014 quickly and calmly ran through lines he\u2019d clearly prepared. He reiterated that he wants to work with Republicans, dismissing their argument that they would be legislating more if not for his executive actions.\n\nObama\u2019s point: \u201cI intend to continue to do what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\nIn a rarity for a big Obama press conference, there weren\u2019t any major slip-ups. The most he gave Twitter was a declaration of love for \u201cJames Flacko,\u201d co-star of the \u201cThe Interview.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough to distract from the news Obama eagerly made by calling Sony\u2019s decision to cancel the release of the movie a \u201cmistake,\u201d and one that he would have urged the company not to make if they\u2019d checked with him.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The week the GOP primary began)\n\nSince they didn\u2019t, he took the company to task from the White House podium for giving into North Korea and setting a dangerous precedent for self-censorship brought on by a leader Obama only referred to as \u201csome dictator someplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get into that way of doing business,\u201d Obama said.\n\nEven taking a question from one more reporter than was on his pre-set list, Obama kept the press conference under an hour and kept his answers short, punchy and pointed. Though he did eventually work in a jab at reporters \u2014 for covering \u201ccrises that look like they\u2019re popping\u201d \u2014 he spent most of the press conference in a calm conversation with them, with some good-natured teasing thrown in.\n\nAnd he started to seed the ground for what\u2019s next. Dropped in to his comments about race relations was the fact that the prison population and crime rate were both dropping simultaneously for the first time in years, which creates an opportunity to \u201cthink smarter\u201d \u2014 as he wants to do with sentencing reform. Shortly after, he released a statement pushing forward on another of his original priorities as president, closing the prison at Guantanamo, where there are clearly behind-the-scenes negotiations underway.\n\n\u201cThe Guantanamo detention facility\u2019s continued operation undermines our national security,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe must close it.\u201d\n\nThroughout the midterm campaigns, Obama would talk privately about missing being out on the campaign trail. Aides raged against Democratic strategists for sidelining him.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s someone who is very good at making an argument and very good at campaigning,\u201d a senior White House aide said earlier this week, reflecting on their sense of the president at the end of the year, \u201cwho could not make an argument, who couldn\u2019t campaign.\u201d\n\nThose days are over, the aide said.\n\nFollow @politico\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cInteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter.
