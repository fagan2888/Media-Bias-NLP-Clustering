The ACA gives everyone certain health screenings at no charge and without a deductible.\n\nOver at Credit Sesame, they have a long list of free medical tests and procedures. They include the typical things you should get tested like cholesterol levels and colorectal cancer. This is the time of year people start planning next year's health insurance plan, so you can figure some of these free tests into your planning.\n\nThey also point out that if you do these tests, you'll need to prepare for the results. The tests won't count against your deductible, but the treatments might. Those results also help you plan for next year should these tests turn up a medical problem. Don't wait until December to get these tests done. Medical offices get busy towards the end of the year as people wait until the last-minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the link for the full list of covered tests.\n\nSave on Healthcare Costs With Free Wellness Checkup | Credit Sesame\n\nSponsored", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, medicine, doctors, obamacare, health care, Lifehacker", "author": "Dave Greenbaum", "og": {"site_name": "Lifehacker", "description": "The Affordable Care Act (aka the ACA, aka &quot;Obamacare&quot;) doesn't just let more people buy health insurance.
