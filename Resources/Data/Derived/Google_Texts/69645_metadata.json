It is a time to look forward, contemplate the potential of the future and feel enough remorse about last week\u2019s 5,000-calorie Christmas dinner \u2014 and a time to resolve to be healthier.\n\nThis year, as you struggle to keep your health-related resolutions, you might get a little help from a surprising place: the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nMany of us are blissfully unaware of the numbers of calories in the foods we eat, particularly when it comes to food purchased at some very popular locations. But our ignorance about much of what we ingest may soon end.\n\nJollibee, on North King Street in Honolulu, lists calorie counts on its menu, albeit in tiny text.\n\nCory Lum/Civil Beat\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act that kicks in by November requires chain restaurants, vending machines, and many food establishments to post the number of calories in their food for everyone to see.
