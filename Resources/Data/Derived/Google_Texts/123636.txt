MountainView Hospital says business is good.

Business is so good, the hospital is embarking on a $90 million expansion that will begin this month.

The project will add 64 hospital beds, expand the emergency department along with other patient services.

The expansion of MountainView Hospital comes two years after completion of another expansion project.

Chris Mowan, CEO of MountainView Hospital, told KNPR's State of Nevada that the first phase will add two more floors to the new south tower. It will also include a new medical office building for doctors who want to set up shop on the property.

The second phase will increase the hospital's labor and delivery department and the nursery. It will also improve the neo-natal intensive care unit from a level two to a level three, allowing them to care for sicker babies and mothers.

Mowan said the expansion is needed to keep up with the demand.

"We're seeing a large, increasing demand over the last three or four years for health care services in Las Vegas," he said.

Mowan said now that more people have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act they are seeking health care through emergency rooms because it is difficult to get a primary care physician.

Mowan pointed out that Nevada ranks 48th in the nation for physician shortage. To help with that, the hospital is also starting a new residency program to train medical school graduates to become doctors specializing in internal medicine and family practice.
