As of Jan. 1 of this year, all American citizens are required to have health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare. Americans must apply for enrollment by March 31 or face a penalty next year.\n\nSince fall 2013, the CSU Health Insurance Education Project (CSU HIEP) has been on an educational campaign to get students to enroll. The project began after the CSU received a $1.6 million grant from Covered California, the state\u2019s healthcare exchange, to educate students on all the CSU campuses. The grant was spearheaded by Dr. Walter Zelman, chair of the Health Sciences department at CSU Los Angeles.\n\nZelman and his team designed the strategy for executing the CSU campaign. Last semester, they placed importance on tabling, classroom presentations and educational forums to reach students. Each CSU campus has two student coordinators and a professorial supervisor to reach students on their specific campus.\n\nCSUN\u2019s professorial supervisor, Dr. Bethany Rainisch, assistant professor in the Public Health program, said that students were interested in getting information about getting covered. She said the three educational forums that were hosted at CSUN last semester were so crowded with students, that not enough chairs were available.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly, a lot of people were interested and we felt this was an indication that there are a lot of people out there, not just students, but friends and family members of students, who have an interest in learning more about Covered CA,\u201d Rainisch said.\n\nZelman said this semester\u2019s strategy aims to provide students with enrollment assistance on top of general education. He described a three-part plan to get students covered.\n\nThe first component of the plan is to keep encouraging students to enroll online, as he thinks most students are computer savvy.\n\n\u201cWe think most of our students can enroll online and they won\u2019t need to get personal help,\u201d Zelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form. So many students have applied for financial aid and they have the key information that they need, which is things like how many people are in your household, what\u2019s the income, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nThe second component would be to direct students to call the Covered CA 800 number if they run into trouble online.\n\nThe third component, the newest phase in the plan, would be to set up office hours on every campus and have certified enrollers to help students with the enrollment process itself. Since the student coordinators are not certified to help with enrollment, enrollers from Covered CA will be available at no extra cost to the CSU HIEP.\n\nHIEP CSUN: why our campus matters\n\nWendy Lee, the regional coordinator for the northern and some southern CSU campuses, said the project\u2019s progress at CSUN is significant to the overall project because of its population, which is just over 36,000 total students.\n\n\u201cCSUN has one of the largest student bodies in the CSU system,\u201d Lee said. \u201c(It) has among the largest potential numbers of students to reach, so the work we\u2019re doing at CSUN is very important.\n\nRainisch pointed out that CSUN\u2019s diversity is also valuable for the project\u2019s success, in addition to its large population. According to College Portrait, a demographics analysis website, 12 percent of CSUN students identify as Asian or Pacific Islander, six percent as Black, 28 percent as White and 37 percent as Hispanic or Latino. Rainisch thinks the high population of minority students might account for interest in getting covered, as these students may not have had access to healthcare due to socio-economic disadvantages.\n\n\u201cWe have a very large population of minority students, especially the Latino population,\u201d Rainisch said. \u201cIt could be that our students have a different perspective on insurance than the general young adult population because many of our students might be the first in their family to go to college, and so maybe they are more attuned to what the perils are of living (without health care) and (what it is like) needing accessibility to healthcare.\u201d\n\nInvincible?\n\nFrom the public health and administration point of view, the strategy to encourage young adults to sign up for health care has been based on the premise that young people do not feel they need health insurance because they believe they are \u201cinvincible,\u201d Rainisch said. However, the CSU HIEP released poll results this week that found the invincible theory is largely untrue among CSU students.\n\nAccording to a poll of 836 students across three of the largest CSU campuses at San Jose, Fresno and Los Angeles, about one-third of surveyed students are not insured. Almost 80 percent of students said that they did not have insurance because they could not afford it. Seven percent said that they did not think they needed it, and only two percent said that they \u201cdid not want it.\u201d Four percent reported they wanted insurance, but had been rejected.\n\nJennifer Jimenez, 22, junior psychology major, said she is currently in the process of enrolling through Covered CA. Since she turned 18, Jimenez has not had insurance because her father\u2019s plan only covered her mother.\n\n\u201cI was not able to have health care before because I applied for MediCal, but they told me I was over 18,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nJimenez would not have been likely to afford insurance before the ACA allowed for single young adults to receive Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid. She said she learned about Covered CA through a link to a CSUN webpage about Covered CA listed on the Klotz Health Center website.\n\nAccording to the poll, 73 percent said that they should have insurance because \u201cI will have access to care if I need it.\u201d Nineteen percent said having insurance is the \u201cresponsible thing to do.\u201d Only five percent said they did not think they needed it, or that they could go to a clinic or public hospital if they needed care.\n\nRainisch said that while many young adults have not experienced major health problems and feel \u201cinvincible,\u201d some young adults are aware of the importance of health insurance because of their personal experiences.\n\n\u201cThere are some young adults who might have a background or a family life where they have really discovered that tragic things happen, or they understand that something could happen to them that is dangerous,\u201d Rainisch said. \u201cThen there could be the exact opposite. What we are trying to do with this project is to address both students who think they are invincible and not.\u201d\n\nKatie Rubalcava, senior psychology major, said that though she is currently insured through her parents\u2019 plan, there have been periods during her childhood when her parents could not provide insurance due to loss of employment. Rubalcava suffered from chronic migraines and respiratory issues, presenting an issue during the periods where she was not covered.\n\nBecause of her personal experience, she believes it is important for children and young adults to have access to healthcare, although she understands that adults can choose not to get covered if they don\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cIf you are under the age of 18 and you don\u2019t have that choice and it falls on your parents to take care of you and they don\u2019t have access, thats when it becomes a problem,\u201d said Rubalcava. \u201cOnce you are an adult and you may not seek health treatment, that\u2019s your choice, [but] preventing someone who may not have developed a sense of whether or not its a choice, they just see that they can\u2019t get something and they\u2019re not feeling well and that\u2019s where I think its really an issue.\u201d\n\nDr. Rainisch also said that healthy young adults should think about the consequences should an accident occur while a student is not covered.\n\n\u201cIf you think you are invincible, then think about how much it would cost to go to the ER if you break your leg,\u201d said Rainisch. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, then consider how cheap it will be even if you just want to go to the hospital to get preventive care because its much more affordable than it was before.\u201d\n\nAccording to the poll, 57 percent of students think that the most important reason students should have healthcare is to have coverage in case \u201csomething really bad happens.\u201d Thirty-five percent see access to regular or routine health care is the most important. Only six percent replied that having health insurance is important for both catastrophic and regular care, which shows students do not want help only if something catastrophic occurs.\n\nOlder students\n\nRainisch also said she thinks the CSU HIEP would be successful if it convinced students age 26 and above to get covered before the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThe age that most young people need insurance is age 25 or 26 and up,\u201d Rainisch said. \u201cThey are either too young and are covered already with parents. If we can get a quarter to a third of the older students to enroll, that\u2019s successful.\u201d\n\nThe poll result confirms her opinion that older students get coverage, as it found older students tend to be more uninsured. Although students age 26 or above make up only about 16 percent of students surveyed, 26 percent are uninsured.\n\nJose Beltran, graduate student in Chicano Studies, said he is getting insurance through his employer in March. Beltran said he feels lucky not to have had any major health problems, but he knows the importance of staying healthy as a father to a 2-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cI know keeping myself healthy is important so I can care for her, so having health care is vital to my daughter and I,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cIts important for anybody. Sickness or illness don\u2019t care if you are an undergraduate student or if you are an older student.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\nPocket\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Hansook Oh", "og": {"site_name": "The Sundial", "description": "As the deadline for enrolling for healthcare is approaching, the Cal State University system is working to encourage students to sign up.
