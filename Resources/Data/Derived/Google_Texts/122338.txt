“Saturday Night Live” cast member Kate McKinnon cold-opened this week’s show with her top shelf Hillary Clinton impression, poking fun at Clinton’s backfired photo-op on the Bronx 4 train Thursday.

“I love being back in the Fat Apple, my home state,” McKinnon-as-Clinton said. “Except for Illinois and Arkansas, but they already voted for me, so we cool, we cool.”

Noting how cold New York has been this week, she put on her “favorite hat that I’ve worn so many times of over the years” — a two-sided Yankees-Mets cap with the price tag ($1.99) still on.
