Thus, they call for a Quadruple Aim that emphasizes the original three goals plus the goal of improving caregivers' experiences, echoing a similar piece published late last year in the Annals of Family Medicine.\n\nNever has such an effort been more important, as reams of research indicate that many healthcare workers not only fail to find joy and meaning in their work, but also are at risk of serious physical and psychological harm on the job, the piece argues. Indeed, worker injuries are sky-high in the healthcare industry, workplace violence is on the rise, and peer bullying and burnout take their toll on many clinicians.\n\n\"The precondition for restoring joy and meaning is to ensure that the workforce has physical and psychological freedom from harm, neglect and disrespect,\" the authors write. \"For a health system aspiring to the Triple Aim, fulfilling this precondition must be a non-negotiable, enduring property of the system.\"\n\nTo achieve this, the authors write that healthcare organizations must improve metrics in two broad areas: workforce engagement and workforce safety. To assess worker engagement and burnout, they say, organizations must conduct annual surveys and compare the results to benchmarks within and outside of the healthcare industry.\n\nTo ensure safer workplaces, they suggest organizations keep track of work-related injuries, including those that result in lost time, disability or death. Often this effort is primarily up to providers, as government entities like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have in the past been able to do little to protect healthcare workers, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nOrganizations may also want to encourage their clinicians--especially nurses--to practice self-care, which can help combat worker infighting and other stressors in the workplace, Susan Groenwald, Ph.D., R.N., president of the Chamberlain College of Nursing, recently told FierceHealthcare.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nShould the Triple Aim become the Quadruple Aim?\n\nTo prevent burnout, hospitals must care for caregivers\n\nNurse self-care: Solution to peer bullying?\n\nWhy healthcare must fight against doc, nurse burnout\n\nTo take care of patients, first take care of yourself and your staff\n\nHigh burnout rates risk patient safety, doc workforce\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In its current form, the Triple Aim--better care, better health and lower costs--fails to acknowledge workers' critical role in transforming healthcare, Rishi Sikka, of Advocate Health Care, Julianne Morath, of the Hospital Quality Institute, and Lucian Leape, of the Harvard School of Public Health, write in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0in the&nb", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In its current form, the Triple Aim--better care, better health and lower costs--fails to acknowledge workers' critical role in transforming healthcare, Rishi Sikka, of Advocate Health Care, Julianne Morath, of the Hospital Quality Institute, and Lucian Leape, of the Harvard School of Public Health, write in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0in the&nb", "title": "Why healthcare organizations must embrace the 'Quadruple Aim'", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-healthcare-organizations-must-embrace-quadruple-aim/2015-06-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,employee engagement,HR & Workforce Management,Quadruple Aim,self-care,Triple Aim,workplace safety,workplace satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce372\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the opinion pieceRelated Articles:Should the Triple Aim become the Quadruple Aim?\nThe movement to add a fourth component to the healthcare industry's ideal of the Triple Aim appears to be gaining steam.\nTo achieve this, the authors write that healthcare organizations must improve metrics in two broad areas: workforce engagement and workforce safety.\n\"For a health system aspiring to the Triple Aim, fulfilling this precondition must be a non-negotiable, enduring property of the system.\"\nWhy healthcare must fight against doc, nurse burnoutTo take care of patients, first take care of yourself and your staffHigh burnout rates risk patient safety, doc workforce"}
