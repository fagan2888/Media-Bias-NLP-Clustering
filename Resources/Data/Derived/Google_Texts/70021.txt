LG also collaborated with Bang & Olufson to release the HiFi Plus, an amplifier that can also clip onto the phone to enhance the quality of audio coming from the device.

The handset manufacturer has had a difficult few months: Its mobile division reported a 48.3 billion won ($38.9 million) loss in 2015 under stiff competition from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Huawei.

LG will be hoping the G5 can reverse its fortunes. Analysts said the device marks a clear push by LG to appear innovative in the eyes of consumers, but mounting a challenge against the major smartphone players could be a challenge.

"LG has clearly decided that this is the year it wants to step up and make itself more prominent again, as it's been quiet and the fact they are having the biggest press event they have ever done, that speaks volumes in terms of the scale of investment," Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone.

"But the challenge is where do they sit alongside Apple and Samsung who have consistently outspent them in terms of marketing and have a significant market position. It's a big mountain to climb but they have some innovative products to support that."
