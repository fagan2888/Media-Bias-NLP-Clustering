Such an impact could potentially end civilization as we know it.\n\nThe story turned out to be a hoax, a prank slipped into the cracks of CNN\u2019s \u201ciReport\u201d project, an effort to tap CNN\u2019s audience for stories that will help \u201d paint a more complete picture of the news.\u201d\n\niReport is an interesting experiment, except for the part where CNN declares that \u201cThe stories here are not edited, fact-checked or screened before they post.\u201d\n\nBut never fear: \u201cCNN\u2019s producers will check out some of the most compelling, important and urgent iReports and, once they\u2019re cleared for CNN, make them a part of CNN\u2019s news coverage.\u201d\n\nSo maybe the threat of the extinction of all human life 27 years from now wasn\u2019t imminent enough to be considered important and urgent for CNN\u2019s producers. Or maybe the relevant producers were enjoying themselves at a BBQ instead of monitoring CNN-branded self-publishing. But here\u2019s the problem: In the 24 hours that the asteroid hoax was online, it was shared on Facebook at least 24,000 times, while racking up a quarter million views. And the average person that sees a story like this in their Facebook news feed probably doesn\u2019t have a clue that CNN iReports is something that by definition is completely unreliable. The CNN brand is upfront and center, and once upon a time, that brand supposedly signified \u201cthe most trusted name in news.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What happens when a news org fails to fact-check or monitor user-generated content?
