He said in an interview in March that he would need $300,000 to $400,000 in his war chest. There is no Democratic candidate, so the winner of the primary will become commissioner.\n\nMosley said in an interview Tuesday that he\u2019s going to put more into his campaign chest.\n\nHe cited contributions to Chaney, a former state senator and representative, from large insurance companies. The Travelers Insurance group based in Hartford, Ct. contributed $5,000. Farmers Insurance of Los Angeles donated $1,000. Nationwide Mutual Insurance of Columbus, Ohio, gave $1,000.\n\nChaney said in a March interview that \u201cwe don\u2019t take money from big insurance companies.\u201d He also said that \u201cif I see where I have to regulate somebody\u201d who has offered campaign money he said he would refuse it.\n\nEfforts to reach Chaney to ask him whether any of the large-insurer donors come under his authority were not successful by press time on Wednesday.\n\nMarty Wiseman, former political science professor and director of The Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, said that \u201cfor a somewhat obscure position like insurance commissioner, it goes without saying that [Chaney] has developed a significant following, in large measure because of his efforts with insurance exchanges . . . a very popular move on his part.\n\n\u201cOf course, it went against the grain of the prevailing Republican Party sentiment. He began an effort to create a system of exchanges during the Barbour administration.\n\n\u201cHaley Barbour was for that before it even became part of Obamacare. Chaney did his homework and created what would\u2019ve become . . . very effective, and [current Gov. Phil] Bryant blocked it.\n\nChaney spokesman Joseph Ammerman said Barbour urged Chaney to establish exchanges. \u201cIt started out as very much a Republican idea. Then suddenly it changed and it became \u2018Obamacare\u2019 and Phil was very much against it. He didn\u2019t want to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nOne exchange would have been the one that many states now operate under the Affordable Care Act of 2010, Ammerman said. One was established for small businesses, he said, but it no longer exists.\n\n\u201cI think it would be very hard to beat [Chaney] because he\u2019s going to be able to pull a lot of votes from across the board. He\u2019s a popular Republican, but yet he\u2019s going to get Democratic and independent votes,\u201d Wiseman said.\n\nMosley is a plaintiff in one of many lawsuits that are being tried in the U.S. District Court for Middle Florida. As a candidate, he proposes changes in state laws to make it harder for insurer abuses.\n\nSeveral hundred body shop owners from many states contend that insurance companies practice \u201csteering\u201d of customers to certain body shops that use after-market and inferior replacement parts.\n\nState Attorney General Jim Hood wrote a letter dated March 13 to then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, asking him to investigate the alleged practice.\n\nHood spokeswoman Jan Schaefer said on Tuesday that no response has been received from Holder, who subsequently resigned, or his successor, Loretta Lynch, but that Hood was checking with the federal agency on the matter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nInsurance Commissioner Mike Chaney is far outstripping his challenger in campa...", "title": "Chaney easily outdoes challenger in campaign fundraising", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mike_Chaney_courtesy_MCforweb_t670-566x330.jpg", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/05/chaney-easily-outdoes-challenger-in-campaign-fundraising/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Govt/Politics", "tag": "Travelers Insurance Group", "published_time": "2015-05-14T10:21:38-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney is far outstripping his challenger in campaign contributions as they head toward a Republican primary on Aug. 4.
