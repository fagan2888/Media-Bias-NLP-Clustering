Mike Pence \u2013 a move that some candidates surely regretted after Pence then called for clarifications to his state\u2019s new religious protections law \u2013 Fiorina waited, and, in fact, recommended early in the week that everyone \u201cstep back and cool off here and look at the facts, on both sides.\u201d\n\nHow incredibly refreshing, and how wonderfully consistent with something that Republicans are supposed to stand for: the right of state governments to work out most issues without interference from the feds.\n\nLater in the week, Fiorina articulated an appropriately more nuanced view of the issues at hand (when compared not only to the rest of the Republican field, but to voices on the left as well). She spoke about the difficult topic with clear compassion for the views on both sides, of both gay couples and religious business owners. She reminded us that ours is a great country that surely ought to have room and tolerance for both views as we have what she calls a \u201cclarifying debate.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections]\n\nAgain, how refreshing.\n\nBut perhaps the most delightfully fresh thing that Fiorina did this week was something all too rare for Republicans these days: She held corporate America to account.\n\nIn interviews with CNBC and USA Today, Fiorina highlighted the fact that big business has a habit of quickly caving to the \u201cTwitterverse.\u201d How true. Corporate America will change any position, it seems, to keep a PR kerfuffle at bay. Meanwhile, Fiorina pointed out, companies are not adequately dealing with substantive, chronic problems like the under-representation of women in the tech sector or the treatment of women and gays in the countries where these large American corporations do business. She even said that \u201ccrony capitalism is alive and well\" in her interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nAs a former corporate CEO herself, Fiorina\u2019s critique of corporate America is not only highly relevant, it is politically smart, as most Americans tend to have only sightly more confidence in big business than they do in Congress.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nMeanwhile, Fiorina is the only Republican presidential hopeful consistently talking about one of American\u2019s favorite groups, small business. And she is doing so in a way that indicates real understanding and empathy, as well as appropriate economic alarm over the fact that small business is declining while big business thrives. I suspect the small-business voting bloc, one that tends to vote Republican, has noticed this.\n\nAnd if you are a Republican, Christian, caterer/baker/florist who hopes to not get sued out of existence should you turn down a piece of gay wedding business, Fiorina's understanding of your struggles as a business owner just might trump another candidate\u2019s passing of a religious litmus test.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "opinion-blog/blogentries", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "Carly Fiorina Gets It on Indiana Religious Liberty Law and Small Business", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "2016 long shot Carly Fiorina shows what being a thoughtful candidate looks like.", "title": "Carly Gets It", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/04/02/carly-fiorina-gets-it-on-indiana-religious-liberty-law-and-small-business", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7d/b4dd2b69d510de2e572143b3ad0fc2/media:b290f1bc34394d91a92941ee164d277eGOP2016Fiorina.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2016 long shot Carly Fiorina shows what being a thoughtful candidate looks like.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Carly Fiorina Gets It on Indiana Religious Liberty Law and Small Business"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 2, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,TJS,picks,2016 presidential election,Fiorina, Carly,Republican Party,small business,corporations,economy,Decision 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "2016 long shot Carly Fiorina shows what being a thoughtful candidate looks like."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f81\"", "article_summary": "She spoke about the difficult topic with clear compassion for the views on both sides, of both gay couples and religious business owners.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]Meanwhile, Fiorina is the only Republican presidential hopeful consistently talking about one of American\u2019s favorite groups, small business.\nCorporate America will change any position, it seems, to keep a PR kerfuffle at bay.\nIn interviews with CNBC and USA Today, Fiorina highlighted the fact that big business has a habit of quickly caving to the \u201cTwitterverse.\u201d How true.\nAnd she is doing so in a way that indicates real understanding and empathy, as well as appropriate economic alarm over the fact that small business is declining while big business thrives."}
