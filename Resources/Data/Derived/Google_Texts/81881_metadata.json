The Democrats, of course, oppose the plan.\n\nMaryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen told Fox News there would probably be opposition to the Republican plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that Democrats will oppose this budget. You can never say for sure. But last year, it was 100 percent.\u201d\n\nThe budget proposed by Republicans, unveiled Tuesday, proposes to cut $5.5 trillion from social programs over the next ten years while increasing the military budget at the same time and without raising taxes.\n\nIf it passes, the Republican budget would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and change Medicaid into block grants given out to the states who would then be responsible for it.\n\nThey also propose privatizing Medicare and forcing people to buy health insurance on the open market.\n\nRepublicans think the entitlement program has grown too large and has no business using taxpayer money to pay for things like sex changes.\n\nSocial Security, meanwhile, is left to fend for itself, as House Republicans have no plans to shore up the SS Disability Trust Fund, which will run out of money next year.\n\nThe budget would also freeze student loan programs at their current levels. The plan would freeze the Pell grant at $5,775 for the next 10 years instead of adjusting it to inflation, according to the Washington Post.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican-led Senate also announced a budget proposal last week that would cut many entitlement programs. It doesn\u2019t go as far as the House budget, though.\n\nThe Democrats, of course, don\u2019t agree with the proposed budget.\n\nObama and fellow Democrats presented an alternative plan that would preserve many of the social programs and increase defense spending.\n\nObama told the Motley Fool the House Republican budget was bad for America and bad for the middle class.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is a failure to invest in education, infrastructure, research, and national defense. All the things that we need to grow, need to create jobs, to stay at the forefront of innovation and to keep our country safe.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, the two sides will have to hash out a deal to keep the government running and the impetus is on the Republican to show they have the power to govern now that they control both the House and Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House of Representatives will take up a Republican budget next week that proposes to drastically change the country's social programs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The House of Representatives will take up a Republican budget next week that proposes to drastically change the country\u2019s social programs.", "title": "Republican Budget Proposes Drastic Changes To Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Social Security, And Student Loans", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1947092/republican-budget-proposes-drastic-changes-to-medicare-medicaid-obamacare-social-security-and-student-loans/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Budget.jpeg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T20:42:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-22T20:52:25+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Budget.jpeg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-03-22T20:42:05+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "budget,democrat,proposal,republican,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Budget.jpeg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The House of Representatives will take up a Republican budget next week that proposes to drastically change the country\u2019s social programs."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe69\"", "article_summary": "The Republican budget would balance the budget in ten years, mainly by slashing social and entitlement programs.\nObama told the Motley Fool the House Republican budget was bad for America and bad for the middle class.\nThe House of Representatives will take up a Republican budget next week that proposes to drastically change Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Social Security, and student loan programs.\nObama and fellow Democrats presented an alternative plan that would preserve many of the social programs and increase defense spending.\nIt doesn\u2019t go as far as the House budget, though."}
