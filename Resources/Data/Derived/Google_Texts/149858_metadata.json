Brooks\u2019 \u201cstrange sensation\u201d that he is feeling seems reminiscent of the thrill up his leg for the President that MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews once spoke of experiencing.\n\nBrooks has been with the Times for over 12 years, and is also a political analyst for PBS. That would be more than enough left-wing influence to severely cloud anyone\u2019s judgment, and clearly Brooks has not been immune.\n\nThe mainstream media refuse to throw away their rose-colored glasses when judging Obama because the reality of this President\u2019s corruption and dishonesty contradicts the liberal narrative. To the contrary, if Brooks were to be believed, President Obama has demonstrated \u201cbasic care and respect for the dignity of others,\u201d sound decision-making, \u201cgrace under pressure,\u201d and \u201coptimism.\u201d And yes, just like former senior Obama advisor David Axelrod, Brooks argues that President Obama has been \u201cremarkably scandal-free\u201d when compared with prior presidencies.\n\nThe question of presidential legacy, however, revolves not around a president\u2019s demeanor but rather his policy successes and failures, as well as his character. From the IRS scandal, to Fast & Furious, to Benghazi, and the mistreatment of veterans, there have, in reality, been a multitude of scandals under President Obama\u2019s leadership. These scandals, and the ensuing cover-ups, have stained Obama\u2019s reputation less publicly than in previous administrations not because of their minor importance, but rather because a corrupt media is willing to overlook massive amounts of evidence of malfeasance to benefit their allies in the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, for the Obama administration, it\u2019s proven easier to deny the media\u2019s access to information that might reveal further scandals than to admit the truth about its own deep-seated corruption,\u201d we wrote in 2015, when Brooks made a similar outrageous claim. The mainstream media continue to be more than content to leave stones unturned whenever it becomes clear that new evidence might harm Obama.\n\n\u201cIf the Obama Administration is willfully giving guns to Mexican drug gangs, allows veterans to die waiting for health care, makes a concerted effort to stifle free speech while refusing to help the four Americans under assault from terrorists doesn\u2019t merit the word scandal in David Brooks\u2019 book then he demonstrates no capacity for reason,\u201d argues Aaron Goldstein for The American Spectator, who also took note of this latest Brooks column.\n\nDuring his ongoing war against journalists, President Obama has abused the Espionage Act while investigating administration leaks. \u201cThis is the most closed, control-freak administration I\u2019ve ever covered,\u201d argued David Sanger of the Times. Maybe Brooks should consult with Sanger, or another Times colleague, James Risen, who said that the Obama administration has been \u201cthe greatest enemy of press freedom that we have encountered in at least a generation.\u201d\n\nBut for Brooks there can only be kind, wistful words about the end of an Obama presidency. \u201cNo, Obama has not been temperamentally perfect,\u201d Brooks writes. \u201cToo often he\u2019s been disdainful, aloof, resentful and insular. But there is a tone of ugliness creeping across the world, as democracies retreat, as tribalism mounts, as suspiciousness and authoritarianism take center stage.\u201d\n\nBy ugliness, Brooks obviously meant to snipe at Republican presidential candidates such as Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz (TX). In contrast to Trump, Brooks argues, President Obama combatted Islamophobia by making a \u201cwonderful speech\u201d at the Islamic Society of Baltimore.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama, meanwhile, went to a mosque, looked into people\u2019s eyes and gave a wonderful speech reasserting their [Muslim\u2019s] place as Americans,\u201d writes Brooks.\n\nBrooks writes opinion pieces, and he\u2019s certainly entitled to his opinions, but he clearly didn\u2019t do any background research on the mosque that Obama visited, nor the speech itself. \u201c[Islamic Society of Baltimore] leaders have amassed a record of support for radical Islamic causes over the years, including endorsing the Chechen jihad and Palestinian suicide bombings,\u201d reports the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT). \u201cIts former imam was active in a charity later linked to terror financing including Hamas, the Taliban, and for providing \u2018hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 to Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\nDaniel Pipes, writing for IPT, accuses President Obama of excess optimism when it comes to Islamic terror. \u201c\u2026but what about the dark side, the unique and repeated role of mosques in parlaying totalitarian ideas and fomenting violence?\u201d Pipes asks. \u201cThat goes unsaid in the president\u2019s rose-colored presentation.\u201d\n\nIn another interpretation of Obama\u2019s mosque speech, Dennis Prager points to how the President championed the fact that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams each owned a copy of the Koran. What the President failed to mention, Prager points out, was that these founders owned Korans in order to understand why Muslims were using their religion to justify enslaving Americans.\n\nClare Lopez pointed out numerous factual errors in Obama\u2019s comments at the mosque, including the meaning of the word \u201cIslam.\u201d\n\nIn one instance, Brooks seeks to favorably compare Obama to Mrs. Clinton, alluding to her email scandal as a \u201cvaguely shady shortcut\u201d rather than the serious scandal with criminal implications at its heart.\n\nRecent news reports, including from the Times, confirm that Mrs. Clinton sent or received over 1,300 emails containing classified information using her private server. One cannot also overlook that Mrs. Clinton was serving in the Obama administration at the time. EmailGate is, therefore, also an Obama scandal. According to the Times, there are \u201c18 emails exchanged between Mrs. Clinton and President Obama\u201d that the administration is refusing to make public.\n\nFor Brooks, Obama\u2019s only missteps in terms of foreign policy have been because he has been \u201ctoo cautious.\u201d But according to another of Brooks\u2019 colleagues at the Times, Roger Cohen, Obama\u2019s \u201ccaution\u201d has been instrumental in a Syrian civil war that has resulted in 250,000 deaths, 4.5 million refugees, and 6.5 million people internally displaced. Speaking of Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo, currently under siege by the Assad government, Cohen writes that the situation \u201cis a result of the fecklessness and purposelessness over almost five years of the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post editorial, entitled \u201cMr. Obama stands by silently as Russia continues its onslaught in Syria,\u201d argues that \u201cthe United States has paved the way for the ongoing military debacle.\u201d\n\nObama has thrown caution to the wind with yet another debacle\u2014the phony nuclear deal\u2014one which will empower Iran to gain the bomb while ensuring that this totalitarian regime receives enough funding to continue to spread terror abroad. Yet MSNBC\u2019s Steve Benen, while reflecting on Brooks\u2019 \u201ccompelling case,\u201d argues that \u201cquite a few folks are likely to miss the president once he\u2019s left the stage, for more reasons than one.\u201d\n\nThe mainstream media continue to delude themselves into thinking that President Obama\u2019s legacy will inspire admiration from both sides of the aisle once he leaves office. If enough journalists remain as detached from reality as Brooks, they might be proven right.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Brooks\u2019 \u201cstrange sensation\u201d that he is feeling seems reminiscent of the thrill up his leg for the President that MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews once spoke of experiencing.", "title": "The Times\u2019 David Brooks Misses Obama\u2014and a Few Facts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/David-Brooks-YouTube-screenshot-PBS-NewsHour.jpg-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-11T16:12:00+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/the-times-david-brooks-misses-obama-and-a-few-facts/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2016-02-10T14:16:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-11T16:12:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brooks\u2019 \u201cstrange sensation\u201d that he is feeling seems reminiscent of the thrill up his leg for the President that MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews once spoke of experiencing.", "title": "The Times\u2019 David Brooks Misses Obama\u2014and a Few Facts", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/the-times-david-brooks-misses-obama-and-a-few-facts/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/David-Brooks-YouTube-screenshot-PBS-NewsHour.jpg-2.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "In contrast to Trump, Brooks argues, President Obama combatted Islamophobia by making a \u201cwonderful speech\u201d at the Islamic Society of Baltimore.\nOne cannot also overlook that Mrs. Clinton was serving in the Obama administration at the time.\n\u201cPresident Obama, meanwhile, went to a mosque, looked into people\u2019s eyes and gave a wonderful speech reasserting their [Muslim\u2019s] place as Americans,\u201d writes Brooks.\nBrooks has been with the Times for over 12 years, and is also a political analyst for PBS.\nAccording to the Times, there are \u201c18 emails exchanged between Mrs. Clinton and President Obama\u201d that the administration is refusing to make public."}
