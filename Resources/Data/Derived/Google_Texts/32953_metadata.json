I mean, we all love drama, trash talk, big hair, orange makeup \u2014 you know, with the line (along the chin) \u2014 but we have other stories to tell about the real Jersey girls.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Does height help businesswomen? Experts offer their take\n\n\n\nLike how in 1789, Jersey girls had the right to vote in the very first presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was probably an oversight,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNothing in the state law said they could but nothing said they couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nOr how last month, voters sent the first woman to Congress in a dozen years, and the first African American woman ever in New Jersey\u2019s political history.\n\n\n\n\u201cWomen get stuff done,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a year ago, during the government shutdown when the male partisans at the top were dug in, six women saved this country. Three Republican senators and three Democratic senators sat down in a room and solved the problem. Even Sen. John McCain gave them full credit for it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just solve problems \u2014 we build things: families, communities and companies.\u201d\n\n\n\nJust look at the statistics, she said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Association of Women Business Owners and the National Women\u2019s Business Conference, 9 million businesses are owned by women in the United States, creating more than 23 million jobs and generating almost $1.5 billion in sales.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe economic impact of women-led and women-owned businesses in this country is more than $3 trillion,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd women-owned firms are growing at twice the rate of male-owned companies and 1.5 times the rate of all businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday \u2014 for the first time in American history \u2014 there are more women in the workforce than men, and 40 percent are the sole or primary breadwinner in their household.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in Jersey alone?
