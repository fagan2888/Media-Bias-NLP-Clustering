Pyrek\n\nCentral venous catheters (CVCs) play an integral role in healthcare, however studies have shown that they are among the most frequent cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Their use is associated with a risk of bloodstream infection caused by microorganisms colonizing the external surface of the device or the fluid pathway when the device is inserted or in the course of its use. The Joint Commission\u2019s CLABSI Toolkit notes that \u201cEmploying relatively simple evidence-based practices to reduce, if not eliminate, CLABSIs appears to be within the reach of even resource-limited settings. Within this framework, HAIs\u2014and CLABSIs in particular\u2014are more and more being viewed as \u2018preventable\u2019 events.\u201d\n\nVascular access experts say they believe that clinicians can avoid adverse events if they are meticulous in their practices and treat central lines as they life-giving and life-saving devices that they are.\n\n\u201cWe must pay close attention to all vascular access devices (VAD),\u201d confirms Sophie Harnage, RN, BSN, VA-BC, former clinical educator for infusion services, and former head of the vascular access team at Sutter Roseville Medical Center (SRMC), in Roseville, Calif. \u201cThe majority of patients admitted into hospitals today require an intravenous device to administer their ordered therapy. Without such a device in place, treatment can be delayed, and patients will suffer negative outcomes. These devices or lines must be treated and understood to be the patient\u2019s lifeline. So the question becomes, \u2018How do we insert and maintain these lifelines so our patients will be able to enter a hospital and be free from infection throughout their journey?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI believe that catheter insertion overall around the country is 100 percent improved, but that\u2019s only one small piece of the puzzle. The biggest piece is care and maintenance of these lines. What happens to these lines post insertion, say day 5, 7 or three weeks into an ordered treatment plan? We can eliminate CLABSIs, it is not difficult. In fact, it\u2019s quite easy if facilities have the resources, the support, and understand the dire importance of educating their healthcare personnel.\u201d\n\nMichelle DeVries, MPH, CIC, senior infection control officer for Methodist Hospitals in Gary, Ind., echoes Harnage\u2019s concerns about maintenance being the most challenging part of the process.\u201dThe most significant challenge I tend to hear from other clinicians is how we are tending to our dressings,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must maintain the dressing properly, taking action when it\u2019s not clean, dry and intact. But how, specifically, are we managing our dressings? Ideally they are staying on for a week, but just because they can last a week doesn\u2019t mean they should last a week when they are compromised. My suspicion is that the problem is multifactorial. For example, are the dressings we are using meeting our needs? If you are placing a dressing down and it is only adhering for a day or two, is that a product failure or is it how we used it? So we grab a roll of tape and tape it back down. There is nothing in the standards I can find that actually supports how tape is to be used to reinforce dressings. If the edges are peeling, taping them back down to prevent it from flipping up and exposing the insertion site is probably okay, but once it\u2019s actually detached and opened up, it\u2019s not okay. So we still have the challenge of teaching personnel when it\u2019s not okay to simply reinforce a dressing.\u201d\n\nAnother issue DeVries has observed and heard from others around the country is faulty documentation in the electronic medical record \u2014 a behavior that can have significant ramifications for the patient. \u201cThere is a documentation disconnect between what we chart as clean, dry and intact, and what the reality is,\u201d she says. \u201cHow many times do we go back when we do line audits and say, \u2018this dressing was suboptimal\u2019 and we\u2019ll go ahead and get it changed, only to find that it was clearly recently documented as clean, dry and intact \u2014 yet in all likelihood it wasn\u2019t. Check the patient, not the box.\u201d\n\nThese missed opportunities are a byproduct of numerous competing priorities, DeVries says, something she hears from \u201cevery hospital, big and small, urban and suburban \u2014 everyone is struggling with so many competing demands on staff. I can\u2019t say for sure that causes it, but I am a strong believer that fully staffed vascular access teams can help drive good outcomes.\u201d\n\nChampioning the Vascular Access Team\n\nA vascular access team (VAT) is usually composed of nurses who are specially trained in infusion therapy. These highly skilled and knowledgeable nurses are often certified by the Certified Registered Nurse Infusion (CRNI) credentialing program, or board-certified vascular access nurses (VA-BC), thus bolstering patient safety and positive outcomes. The VAT performs numerous critical functions such as placing and maintaining lines, but also trouble-shooting obstructed or otherwise problematic vascular devices; gathering and analyzing surveillance data for the facility\u2019s quality and Infection prevention departments; providing infusion consultation services to medical and nursing staff; and teaching patients and cases managers how to care for an IV line once the patient returns home.\n\n\n\nVAT members conduct a vascular access assessment of patients to determine the most appropriate type of IV line that is needed at the most optimal time. The condition of the patient\u2019s veins, the patient\u2019s disease and anticipated prescribed therapies are considered, coupled with other line placement factors such as how long the treatment will be needed, the type of therapy and the patient\u2019s preferences. Studies have indicated that conducting an early vascular assessment often results in a faster start of treatment of IV drug therapies which can result in a shorter hospital stay and reduced costs. After assessing the patient, Vascular Access Team nurses consult with the patient\u2019s other caregivers to develop appropriate treatment plans. Selecting the proper catheter early in the course of a patient\u2019s IV therapy leads to a safer, more efficient administration of IV therapy with the best possible outcome. If the patient already has an IV line in place upon admission, the VAT will consult to ensure that the line is monitored daily.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to put in the most appropriate vascular access device within 24 to 48 hours of that patient\u2019s admission,\u201d explains Harnage. \u201cWe want to ensure the right line for the right patient, for the right diagnosis, and for the right therapy. That\u2019s how you start on the right track from the point of admission.\u201d\n\nThe value of a specialized team is underscored when facility leadership is made to understand how floor nurses can be overwhelmed by their workload and patient responsibilities. \u201cVascular access is very specialized,\u201d Harnage says. \u201cIt requires expertise and strong clinical leadership. A nurse in a small hospital may be providing 1:1 care in the ICU but she is also supposed to go out on the floor and put in a PICC line and come back to the ICU. So, you can imagine what goes through this nurse\u2019s mind when her ICU patient has a pulse of 35 \u2014 to her the PICC line is probably not the most important thing she is doing that day; however, to a vascular access team, that is the most important thing. So in my opinion you have to educate the C-suite about the value and importance of having a vascular access team. As an example, our chief nursing officer once said it might not be right financially but if it\u2019s the right thing for patients, it\u2019s the best thing for the hospital. The biggest complaint I hear is that resources are sorely lacking. I suggest that clinicians remind administration that when we do what we do best \u2014 by having a vascular access team \u2014 we have zero infections \u2026 and that we are saving them money by protecting our patients.\u201d\n\nThe value of a specialized team is underscored when facility leadership is made to understand how floor nurses can be overwhelmed by their workload and patient responsibilities. \u201cVascular access is very specialized,\u201d Harnage says. \u201cIt requires expertise and strong clinical leadership.

(2014) emphasize, \u201cAccountability is an essential principle for preventing HAIs. It provides the necessary translational link between science and implementation. Without clear accountability, scientifically based implementation strategies will be used in an inconsistent and fragmented way, decreasing their effectiveness in preventing HAIs. Accountability begins with the chief executive officer and other senior leaders who provide the imperative for HAI prevention, thereby making HAI prevention an organizational priority. Senior leadership is accountable for providing adequate resources needed for effective implementation of an HAI prevention program. These resources include necessary personnel (clinical and nonclinical), education and equipment.\u201d\n\nDeVries says that she has witnessed increased engagement among members of her hospital\u2019s C-suite as a result of healthcare reform-driven initiatives. \u201cWith the advent of the Affordable Care Act and value-based purchasing, my goals as an infection preventionist and the goals of the C-suite became 100 percent aligned,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause CLABSIS, CAUTIs, MRSA and other infections now directly impact my hospital\u2019s finances. Before, it could be dismissed as merely soft numbers, but now they are directly affecting my hospital\u2019s viability. And so the ability to have that conversation with the C-suite is occurring on a level that I have not seen before.\u201d\n\nDeVries continues, \u201cI am a frequent participant in our quality meetings, sharing infection rate data and the action plans against those numbers, so I have always been involved with our board, but over the last three years my level of involvement and the frequency of the reports and the detail of the reports being requested, have increased dramatically. They always cared and supported us, but for the programs that have not been that fortunate in the past, I think it has become a much, much easier conversation. Not everyone is in a structure where they are given that same opportunity. It\u2019s unconscionable not to have that direct access to the C-suite to make their pleas for resources. When I started talking about the Affordable Care Act and value-based purchasing impacts, honestly I felt that\u2019s not why I do my job, but understanding that it\u2019s what is resonating right now in the C-suite, I knew I could learn how to use that to leverage our program goals. And more of our peers are speaking that same language in a more compelling manner.\u201d\n\nAn understanding of the outcomes associated with hospital-acquired CLABSI can advance that dialogue. According to Marschall, et al. (2014), CLABSIs trigger an increased length of hospital stay as well as increased cost (the non-inflation-adjusted attributable cost of CLABSIs has been found to vary from $3,700 to $39,000 per episode). And as the Joint Commission\u2019s CLABSI Toolkit explains, \u201cCLABSI costs include those related to diagnosis and treatment, prolonged hospital stays, and, more recently in some countries, lack of reimbursement by third-party payers for expenses incurred. Lack of consistency in the methods used by various researchers to estimate CLABSI costs and differences in financial systems in various parts of the world add to the complexity of quantifying these costs.\u201d The toolkit also notes that \u201cAn essential component in understanding the costs attributable to CLABSI is having reliable and valid surveillance data on the incidence of infection. Three types of economic analyses are frequently used in healthcare decision making: cost-effectiveness analysis, cost\u2013utility analysis, and cost\u2013benefit analysis. A business case analysis is most closely related to a cost\u2013benefit analysis. Conducting a business case analysis is helpful in determining whether the financial benefits of a new or increased investment in activities to prevent HAIs will outweigh their additional cost. In preparing the business case, it is important not to under-estimate staff time and costs or to overstate benefits. A well thought-out business case can help show that infection prevention is an investment rather than an expense.\u201d\n\nBest Practices\n\nThe literature is rife with recommendations for CLABSI prevention strategies, techniques and technologies, and a number of organizations have provided recommendations. The Joint Commission\u2019s CLABSI Toolkit address some important concepts:\n\n- Hand hygiene is a key component of any effective patient safety and infection prevention program.\n\n- Aseptic technique, a method used to prevent contamination with microorganisms, is recommended by the evidence-based guidelines for all instances of insertion and care of central venous catheters (CVCs).\n\n- When preparing to insert CVCs, healthcare personnel should be attentive to maximal sterile barrier precautions, skin preparation, catheter selection, and use of catheter kits or carts.\n\n- Using an insertion checklist can improve adherence to best practices and reduce error. The insertion process includes catheter site selection, insertion under ultrasound guidance, catheter site dressing regimens, securement devices, and use of a CVC insertion bundle.\n\n- Proper maintenance of CVCs includes disinfection of catheter hubs, connectors, and injection ports and changing dressings over the site every two days for gauze dressings or every seven days for semipermeable dressings. A dressing should also be changed if it becomes damp, loose, or visibly soiled.\n\n- Healthcare personnel must ensure that a patient\u2019s CVC is removed or replaced at the appropriate time and in a safe manner. Such considerations include daily review of line necessity, changing administration system components, and CVC exchanges over a guidewire.\n\nFor additional real-world implementation strategies, there is the Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2014 Updates, a series of articles sharing evidence-based strategies to help healthcare professionals effectively control and prevent the spread of HAIs. Last June, infection prevention and control experts released new practical recommendations to assist acute-care hospitals in implementing and prioritizing prevention efforts, including CLABSI prevention. The guidance was published in the July 2014 issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology and produced in a collaborative effort led by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Hospital Association, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology and the Joint Commission.\n\n\u201cThere is no shortage of guidelines and recommendations to prevent CLABSI, including those from government, public health and professional organizations. But translating this evidence into practice, while challenging, is critically important,\u201d says Leonard Mermel, DO, ScM, co-lead author of the guidelines with Jonas Marschall, MD. \u201cWe\u2019ve included examples of successful implementation approaches and references to published examples that can be adapted and adopted by hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe updated guidance includes a special section on implementation, emphasizing engagement with healthcare personnel through the supportive, vocal healthcare leaders and sharing of data with employees on the frontlines to track prevention progress. Implementation recommendations are highlighted below.\n\n- Engage both hospital frontline staff and senior leadership in the process of an outcome improvement plan. Focus on a culture of safety including teamwork, technical process and promotion of accountability. Work to make the problem real to all those involved by identifying a patient in the unit who has suffered harm as a result of developing a CLABSI and sharing that story with the team.\n\n- Educate healthcare personnel involved in the insertion and care of central lines. Educational programs should employ multiple teaching strategies to best engage diverse learners.\n\n- Execute best practices by standardizing the care process to help increase staff compliance. Consider using quality improvement methodologies to structure prevention efforts.\n\n- Evaluate the impact of strategies. Multidisciplinary strategies, using quality improvement collaboratives, should be used to set goals and identify the key factors to be measured. Feedback should be given to all personnel with the goals for improvement clearly and frequently articulated.\n\nMarschall, et al. (2014) recommend the following basic practices for preventing and monitoring CLABSI:\n\nBefore insertion\n\n- Provide easy access to an evidence-based list of indications for CVC use to minimize unnecessary CVC placement.\n\n- Require education of healthcare personnel involved in insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs about CLABSI prevention. Include the indications for catheter use, appropriate insertion and maintenance, the risk of CLABSI, and general infection prevention strategies. Ensure that all healthcare personnel involved in catheter insertion and maintenance complete an educational program regarding basic practices to prevent CLABSI before performing these duties. Periodic retraining with a competency assessment may be of benefit. Ensure that any healthcare professional who inserts a CVC undergoes a credentialing process (as established by the individual healthcare institution) to ensure their competency before independently inserting a CVC. Reeducate when an institution changes components of the infusion system that requires a change in practice (e.g., when an institution\u2019s change of the needleless connector requires a change in nursing practice). Consider using simulation training for proper catheter insertion technique.\n\n- Bathe ICU patients over 2 months of age with a chlorhexidine preparation on a daily basis.\n\nAt insertion\n\n- Have a process in place to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion in ICU and non-ICU settings, such as a checklist. - Ensure and document adherence to aseptic technique.\n\n- Checklists have been suggested to ensure optimal insertion practices. If used, the documentation should be done by someone other than the inserter.\n\n- Observation of CVC insertion by a nurse, physician, or other healthcare personnel who has received appropriate education to ensure that aseptic technique is maintained. Such healthcare personnel should be empowered to stop the procedure if breaches in aseptic technique are observed.\n\n- Perform hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation. Use an alcohol-based waterless product or antiseptic soap and water; use of gloves does not obviate hand hygiene.\n\n- Avoid using the femoral vein for central venous access in obese adult patients when the catheter is placed under planned and controlled conditions. Controversy exists regarding infectious and noninfectious complications associated with different short-term CVC access sites. The risk and benefit of different insertion sites must be considered on an individual basis with regard to infectious and noninfectious complications. Do not use peripherally inserted CVCs (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. The risk of infection with PICCs in ICU patients approaches that of CVCs placed in the subclavian or internal jugular veins.\n\n- Use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit. A catheter cart or kit that contains all necessary components for aseptic catheter insertion has to be available and easily accessible in all units where CVCs are inserted.\n\n- Use ultrasound guidance for internal jugular catheter insertion\n\n- Use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion. A mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves are to be worn by all healthcare personnel involved in the catheter insertion procedure.\n\n- Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation. Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing more than 0.5 percent CHG to the insertion site. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture.\n\nAfter insertion\n\n- Ensure appropriate nurse-to-patient ratio and limit the use of float nurses in ICUs\n\n- Disinfect catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports before accessing the catheter. Before accessing catheter hubs, needleless connectors, or injection ports, vigorously apply mechanical friction with an alcoholic chlorhexidine preparation, 70 percent alcohol, or povidone-iodine. Alcoholic chlorhexidine may have additional residual activity compared with alcohol for this purpose. Apply mechanical friction for no less than 5 seconds to reduce contamination. It is unclear whether this duration of disinfection can be generalized to needleless connectors not tested in these studies. Monitor compliance with hub/connector/port disinfection since approximately half of such catheter components are colonized under conditions of standard practice.\n\n- Remove nonessential catheters. Assess the need for continued intravascular access on a daily basis during multidisciplinary rounds. Remove catheters not required for patient care. Audits to determine whether CVCs are routinely removed after their intended use may be helpful. Both simple and multifaceted interventions are effective at reducing unnecessary CVC use.\n\n- For non-tunneled CVCs in adults and children, change transparent dressings and perform site care with a chlorhexidine-based antiseptic every five to seven days or immediately if the dressing is soiled, loose or damp\n\n- Replace administration sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipids at intervals not longer than 96 hours\n\n- Perform surveillance for CLABSI in ICU and non-ICU settings. Measure the unit-specific incidence of CLABSI (CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter-days) and report the data on a regular basis to the units, physician and nursing leadership, and hospital administrators overseeing the units. Compare CLABSI incidence with historical data for individual units and with national rates. Audit surveillance as necessary to minimize variation in interobserver reliability.", "article_metadata": {"vpi-date": "2015-07-13", "description": "Central venous catheters (CVCs) play an integral role in healthcare, however studies have shown that they are among the most frequent cause of", "og": {"url": "http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/2015/07/taking-central-line-infection-prevention-to-the-next-level.aspx", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Central venous catheters (CVCs) play an integral role in healthcare, however studies have shown that they are among the most frequent cause of", "title": "Taking Central Line Infection Prevention to the Next Level"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ICT_magazine", "description": "Central venous catheters (CVCs) play an integral role in healthcare, however studies have shown that they are among the most frequent cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).
