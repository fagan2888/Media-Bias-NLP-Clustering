Ted Cruz, who was introduced by Gov. Scott Walker and talk radio host Vicki McKenna.\n\nThe contrasting receptions illustrated why the Texas senator has surged past the real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity in the latest polls, especially in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nPalin opened with a call for unity among the candidates in supporting former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Jerry Kramer\u2019s induction into the NFL Hall of Fame, a joke that mostly fell flat. Her free-flowing, seemingly stream-of-consciousness speech from prepared notes criticized crony capitalists on Wall Street for profiting from open borders, free trade and military intervention while regular people suffer.\n\n\u201cThe establishment\u2019s interest runs counter to the interests of the people,\u201d Palin said. \u201cCommon sense is an endangered species in Washington.\u201d\n\nPalin said Trump is the only candidate who creates jobs, balances budgets, builds \u201cbig things\u201d and \u201cunderstands this reality.\u201d\n\nAfter Palin, McKenna, whom Trump hung up on during an intense interview earlier in the week, fired up the crowd by slamming Trump\u2019s criticisms of Walker and the Wisconsin economy.\n\n\u201cGov. Walker is the single most substantive governor in the history of this state,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI am tired of people coming into my state and telling me how bad it is.\u201d\n\nWalker then introduced Cruz as a candidate who would bring to Washington the same \u201ccommon-sense conservative leadership\u201d that Walker brought to Wisconsin.\n\nPalin was the second featured speaker after Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who had a small contingent of supporters in the crowd and was introduced by former Gov. Tommy Thompson.\n\nKasich noted that recent polls have shown 38 percent of voters in the state don\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re positive all the time and don\u2019t enter a demolition derby,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nPalin is also scheduled to join Trump at town hall events in Racine and Rothschild on Saturday. Palin will also participate in a solo meet-and-greet event in Marathon City on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe former Alaska governor\u2019s past visits to Wisconsin include a 2013 book signing at a Wausau Wal-Mart and a 2011 tax day rally in Madison, where she defended Walker\u2019s controversial changes to public sector collective bargaining.\n\nSarah Palin in Wisconsin Mike De Sisti / Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel Former Alaska Gov.

Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president, in Milwuakee, Wis., on April 1, 2016. (Mike De Sisti / Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel) (Mike De Sisti / Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel)\n\n\u201cYour governor did the right thing, and you won,\u201d Palin said in 2011. \u201cYour beautiful state won.\u201d\n\nThis week, after Walker endorsed Cruz, Trump laid into Walker for the performance of Wisconsin\u2019s economy, telling hundreds of supporters in Janesville \u201che\u2019s not doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee County has become Cruz country as conservative talk radio has aligned against the real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity and behind the first-term senator. The latest Marquette Law School Poll found Cruz leading Trump 53 percent to 15 percent in Milwaukee County. Kasich came in second with 22 percent support.\n\nAttendees at Friday night\u2019s event said the vast majority of the crowd were Cruz supporters, which was borne out by the response to the speakers.\n\nAmong the Cruz supporters was Christina Bauman, 53, a registered nurse from Waukesha who said Republicans in Wisconsin are supporting Cruz because \u201cwe are ground zero for conservatism.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are just fed up,\u201d Bauman said. \u201cWe want results.\u201d\n\nWarren Matson, 57, a Realtor from West Allis, said he is undecided, but has been leaning toward Trump after Ben Carson dropped out of the race. However, Trump\u2019s gaffes over the past week, such as reversing a statement that women who receive abortions should be punished if abortion were to become illegal, have raised doubts about Trump. Matson\u2019s wife, Maggie, is supporting Cruz.\n\n\u201cWe may need marriage counseling after this if I vote for Trump, and I almost want to do it,\u201d Matson said, adding the way the Republican establishment has moved to stop Trump illustrates how \u201che isn\u2019t beholden to anyone.\u201d\n\nMichael Willner, a cable CEO from New York, traveled to Wisconsin Friday to volunteer for Kasich.\n\n\u201cHe has a fabulous record,\u201d Willner said. \u201cHe really was the Republican architect of the last balanced budget this country has had.\u201d\n\nHis assessment for why Kasich hasn\u2019t caught fire in Wisconsin, a purple state, is because it is less moderate than states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania and more divided between conservatives and liberals.\n\nThomas Kroon, 50, a truck driver from Oak Creek, said he supported Walker for president, then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and now Cruz. He said the antipathy toward Trump among many Wisconsin voters is driven by how he distorted Walker\u2019s record during last August\u2019s Republican debate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about Trump that\u2019s conservative,\u201d Kroon said.\n\nKroon also knocked Kasich for taking federal money as part of a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, something Walker has resisted.\n\n\u201cKasich wants to keep everything the way it is,\u201d Kroon said. \u201cWe need bold changes at this point.\u201d\n\nMatthew DeFour, Wisconsin State Journal", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sarah Palin gets tepid response stumping for Donald Trump in Wisconsin", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "In her Wisconsin debut as a Donald Trump surrogate, Sarah\u00a0Palin was met with tepid applause and stone-faced silence Friday night at a Milwaukee County Republican gathering.", "title": "Sarah Palin gets tepid response stumping for Donald Trump in Wisconsin", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-sarah-palin-wisconsin-20160402-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56ffc9fc/turbine/ct-sarah-palin-wisconsin-20160402", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "sarah palin wisconsin, sarah palin trump", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86418902", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-02", "Description": "In her Wisconsin debut as a Donald Trump surrogate, Sarah\u00a0Palin was met with tepid applause and stone-faced silence Friday night at a Milwaukee County Republican gathering.
