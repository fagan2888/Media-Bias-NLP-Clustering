And that\u2019s just one player,\u201d Rasool Mohammad, President and CEO of Select Sands Corporation told Oilprice.com.\n\nRelated: Why Waterless Fracking Holds So Much Promise\n\nFrack sand exponentially increases the return on investment for a well, and oil and gas companies are expected to use some 95 billion pounds of frack sand this year, up nearly 30% from 2013 and up 50% from forecasts made just last year.\n\nPushing demand up is the trend for wider, shorter fracs, which require twice as much sand. The practice of downspacing\u2014or decreasing the space between wells\u2014means a dramatic increase in the amount of frac sand used. The industry has gone from drilling four wells per square mile to up to 16 using shorter, wider fracs. In the process, they have found that the more tightly spaced wells do not reduce production from surrounding wells.\n\nThis all puts frac sand in the drivers\u2019 seat of the next phase of the American oil boom, and it\u2019s a commodity that has already seen its price increase up to 20% over the past year alone.\n\nFrac sand is poised for even more significant gains over the immediate term, with long-term contracts locking in a lucrative future as exploration and production companies experiment with using even more sand per well.\n\n\n\nPioneer Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE:PXD) says the output of wells is up to 30% higher when they are blasted with more sand.\n\nCiting RBC Capital Markets, The Wall Street Journal noted that approximately one-fifth of onshore wells are now being fracked with extra sand, while the trend could spread to 80% of all shale wells.\n\nOilfield services giants such as Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE:BHI) are stockpiling sand now, hoping to shield themselves from rising costs of the high-demand product, according to a recent Reuters report. They\u2019re also buying more sand under contract\u2014a trend that will lead to more long-term contracts and a longer-term boost for frac sand producers.\n\nIn this environment, the new game is about quality and location.\n\nFrac sand extraction could spread to a dozen US states that have largely untapped sand deposits, but the biggest winners will be the biggest deposits that are positioned closest to major shale plays such as Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, Barnett, Haynesville and the Tuscaloosa marine shale play.\n\nThe state of Wisconsin has been a major frac sand venue, with over 100 sand mines, loading and processing facilities permitted as of 2013, compared to only five sand mines and five processing plants in 2010.\n\nBut with the surge in demand for this product, companies are looking a bit closer to shale center to cut down on transportation costs and improve the bottom line.\n\nOne of the hottest new frac sand venues is in Arkansas\u2019 Ozark Mountains, which is not only closer by half to the major shale plays, saving at least 25% per ton on transportation costs, but also allows for year-round production that will fill the gap in shortages when winter prevents mining in northern states.\n\nRelated: Fracking Outlawed in Texas in Symbolic Vote\n\n\u201cIn the southern US, we can operate year round, so there is no fear of a polar vortex like that which we saw last year with some other producers,\u201d says Mohammad of Select Sands, which has two known producing frac sand mines in northeastern Arkansas, in the Ozark Mountains, and sells the bulk of its frac sand to producers in the Eagle Ford, Barnett and Haynesville shales, as well as in the new marine shale, Tuscaloosa.\n\nChicago-based consulting company Professional Logistics Group Inc. found in 2012 that transportation represented 58% of the cost of frac sand, while Select Sands (TSX.V:SNS), estimates the costs between 66-75% today.\n\nThe competition is stiff, but this game is still unfolding, while increased demand is reshaping the playing field.\n\nUS Silica Holdings Inc. says demand for its own volumes of sand could double or triple in the next five years, and its three publicly-traded rivals\u2014Emerge Energy Services (NYSE:EMES), Fairmount Santrol (NYSE:FMSA) and Hi-Crush Partners (NYSE:HCLP), have also made strong Wall Street debuts over the past two years.\n\nThis article originally appeared at OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nWhat Low Oil Prices Mean For The U.S. Economy\n\nThis Company Could Revolutionize Energy Utilities\n\nThe 2014 Oil Price Crash Explained", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it takes up to four million pounds of sand to frack a single well, it\u2019s no wonder", "title": "This Is Where the Real Fracking Money Is", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/25/Where-Real-Fracking-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-05-09T200756Z_1_CBREA481JXH00_RTROPTP_2_FRACKING-HOMEOWNERS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/25/Where-Real-Fracking-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-05-09T200756Z_1_CBREA481JXH00_RTROPTP_2_FRACKING-HOMEOWNERS.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it takes up to four million pounds of sand to frack a single well, it\u2019s no wonder", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The practice of downspacing\u2014or decreasing the space between wells\u2014means a dramatic increase in the amount of frac sand used.\nThey\u2019re also buying more sand under contract\u2014a trend that will lead to more long-term contracts and a longer-term boost for frac sand producers.\nThe state of Wisconsin has been a major frac sand venue, with over 100 sand mines, loading and processing facilities permitted as of 2013, compared to only five sand mines and five processing plants in 2010.\nFrac sand is poised for even more significant gains over the immediate term, with long-term contracts locking in a lucrative future as exploration and production companies experiment with using even more sand per well.\nIn the process, they have found that the more tightly spaced wells do not reduce production from surrounding wells."}
