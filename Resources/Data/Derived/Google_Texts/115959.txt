Six years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act remains a charged political issue and one that will play an important role in the 2016 election.

Eighty-five percent of Americans say that Obamacare will factor into their presidential vote, according to a new survey by insuranceQuotes.com.

“Health care will certainly be a hot-button issue during the 2016 election,” Laura Adams, senior analyst at InsuranceQuotes.com said in a statement.”

Americans remain evenly split in their support of the law: 45 percent of those surveyed would like to keep it and 44 percent want it repealed.

Millennials were the group most likely to support the ACA and most likely to say their health insurance situation is better now than it was a year ago. Boomers ages 50 to 64 were the most likely to favor repealing the law or to say that their health insurance situation has deteriorated in the past year.

Open enrollment for Obamacare began two years ago. Last year 10 million people purchased coverage through the law’s state and federal exchanges. Meanwhile, the rate of uninsured Americans has hit a record low. In the first quarter of 2015, 9.2 percent of all Americans were uninsured, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, down from 11.5 percent in 2014.

Nearly half of those surveyed by insuranceQuotes said that they were worried about having affordable health insurance in the future, down from 55 percent last year. Women and Hispanics were the most anxious about the future affordability of insurance.
