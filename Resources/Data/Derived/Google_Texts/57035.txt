A dust storm blew through Arizona on Saturday night.

The dust storm warning from the National Weather Service was for areas near Phoenix, Casa Grande, Florence, Gila Bend, and parts nearby interstates 8 and 10.

Afternoon thunderstorms around southeast Phoenix created the areas for the dust storm. The storm went through that area and moved west towards the valley throughout the night.

The dust storm warnings took place from roughly 6:45 p.m. until 9:00 p.m.

This is the first significant dust storm of the summer.

APS reported power outages across the valley.
