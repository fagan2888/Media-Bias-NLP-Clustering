On March 17, UCSF decided to postpone the closure through July.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the largest youth clinic in The City,\u201d said Jackson-Morgan, who refers youths to New Generation from her office at 3rd Street Health Center and Clinic. \u201cI think UCSF is not really aware of the ramifications of closing this.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of April, her petition has received more than 4,500 signatures. Jackson-Morgan said she is worried other clinics won\u2019t be prepared to take on the volume of services offered at New Generation.\n\nNew Generation\u2019s goal is to reduce unwanted teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. According to a UCSF news release from 2011, 90 percent of the 2,500 youths and young adults who visited the clinic in 2010 were female. A majority of the patients are black and Latino and from The City\u2019s southeast neighborhoods.\n\nYet the number of patient visits at the clinic dropped by 27 percent from 2011 to 2015, according to UCSF, which attributes the drop to the increased access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the physical location of the clinic is important to the community and are working with the San Francisco health care community to identify other clinics that provide these services for young adults,\u201d the most recent UCSF statement reads.\n\nNew Generation patients will be referred to other locations including San Francisco General Hospital, according to UCSF. The Department of Public Health is set to take over educational outreach New Generation offered at high schools and wellness centers around The City.\n\nJackson-Morgan said the center is popular among youths because it\u2019s confidential, discreet and insurance isn\u2019t needed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to run into your auntie or neighbor at New Generation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you might if you have to go to [SFGH].\u201d\n\nJackson-Morgan said there is a stakeholders meeting at SFGH to discuss the closure on Wednesday.\n\nNew Generation began as a weekly clinic at SFGH in 1974. The clinic also sees a large number of undocumented women and men, according to Jackson-Morgan.\n\nClick here or scroll down to comment", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The San Francisco Examiner", "description": "Stakeholders will meet next week to discuss the impending closure of a free UC San Francisco health clinic at the edge of Potrero Hill that serves disadvantaged youths.
