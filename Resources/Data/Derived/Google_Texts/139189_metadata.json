Kevin Brady, (R-TX), chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, summarized the U.S. economy\u2019s subpar recovery several months ago, in May: \u201cOur economy has a real GDP growth gap of $1.5 trillion in this recovery compared with the average of other post-1960 recoveries. And that has left us with a private-sector jobs gap from the end of the recession of 5.7 million jobs.\u201d\n\nSpecifically related to the cause of the economy\u2019s poor levels of job creation and household income growth, an August 25 report in Forbes by economist John Goodman documented via Federal Reserve surveys that Obamacare is a key reason for the nation\u2019s persevering joblessness and declining levels of inflation-adjusted household income.\n\n\u201cThree Federal Reserve Banks \u2014 in Philadelphia, New York and Atlanta \u2014 have released business surveys that confirm what many of us have been predicting,\u201d Goodman reported. \u201cThe new health law is discouraging a significant number of firms from hiring and is also pushing workers into part-time rather than full-time jobs.\u201d\n\nBased on its August 2014 survey of manufacturers, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that 18.2 percent of employers said they cut workers because of the Affordable Care Act versus 3 percent who hired more.\n\nSimilarly, 18.2 percent of employers said their proportion of part-time workers is higher because of Obamacare versus 1.5 percent who said it was lower.\n\nCorrespondingly, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York found that 21 percent and 16.9 percent of employers in the manufacturing and service sectors, respectively, said they were cutting employees because of Obamacare.\n\nMr. Obama may think \u201cthe American economy and the American workers are better off\u201d under his watch, but the American public appears to be under no such illusion.\n\nA recent IBD/TIPP poll shows less than a third of the public giving Obama good grades for his economic performance. \u201cJust 31 percent give him an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 for his handling of the economy, 29 percent good marks for his management of the federal budget and 32 percent on how he\u2019s doing on creating jobs and growth,\u201d reported Investor\u2019s Business Daily on September 3. \u201cAmong independents, the numbers are 19 percent, 17 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s aforementioned 31 percent approval on his handling of the economy matches his 31 percent approval rating in the survey on how he\u2019s handled the Islamic State crisis.\n\nBottom line? After more than five years of Obama\u2019s economy \u2014 the ill-designed \u201cgrowth\u201d programs that drained job-creating money out of the private sector, the \u201cshovel ready\u201d boondoggles that weren\u2019t ready, the bailouts for political cronies that transferred capital from the productive to the non-productive, the boom in welfare spending that weakened incentives for productivity at both the top and bottom, and hundreds of billions in \u201cstimulus\u201d spending that ended up to be more about spending than stimulating \u2014 all the ill-fitting pieces came together to produce a record-breaking $7 trillion in additional federal debt and a public that\u2019s increasingly opposed to President Obama\u2019s prescription for economic recovery.\n\n\u201cAlmost half the country still thinks we\u2019re in a recession and 52 percent say the economy isn\u2019t getting any better,\u201d reports Investor\u2019s Business Daily, summarizing the recent IBD/TIPP poll.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Obama may think \u201cthe American economy and the American workers are better off\u201d under his watch, but the American public appears to be under no such illusion.\n\u201cThree Federal Reserve Banks \u2014 in Philadelphia, New York and Atlanta \u2014 have released business surveys that confirm what many of us have been predicting,\u201d Goodman reported.\nA recent IBD/TIPP poll shows less than a third of the public giving Obama good grades for his economic performance.\nAt a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee, President Obama turned the limelight on himself, approvingly and inaccurately.\nCorrespondingly, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York found that 21 percent and 16.9 percent of employers in the manufacturing and service sectors, respectively, said they were cutting employees because of Obamacare."}
