Many flocked to Blue Cross plans that covered the expensive procedures and included doctors at the top health centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just transplants. Knee replacements, dialysis treatment, cancer therapy and the process of getting the uninsured into the health care system all piled up.\n\n\u201cI could list a whole bunch of things,\u201d said Dr. Dan McCoy, chief medical officer. \u201cThere was a significant amount of pent-up demand and costs.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s largest insurer wasn\u2019t alone in misjudging the risk of covering people who signed up on the ACA exchanges. Last month, UnitedHealth Group said it would lose $700 million on exchange business nationwide and warned that it may eventually exit the segment.\n\nSuch results have renewed fears about the future of Obamacare, which is helping 17 million Americans get coverage through private insurance and Medicaid. Open enrollment is underway for 2016, and 317,000 Texans had signed up by Dec. 5.\n\nTo right the business, insurers are jacking up premiums, dropping some products and cutting their provider networks. Many eliminated out-of-network benefits beyond emergency care.\n\nBlue Cross of Texas dropped its PPO for the individual market for 2016 and raised premiums on its HMO by almost 19 percent. It\u2019s also changing the prescription formulary and some deductibles and co-pays in the HMO.\n\nIf insurers can find a way to slow the growth in costs without hurting patient outcomes, their exchange experience will seep into the employer insurance market, which accounts for about half the coverage in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a long journey, and we\u2019ve only taken the first few steps,\u201d McCoy said about the ACA.\n\nIn 2014, the first full year of the health care law, about two-thirds of insurers lost money in the individual market even as enrollment and revenue soared, according to McKinsey & Co. This year, Blue Cross Blue Shield units in 30 states are projected to post an aggregate loss for the first time since the late 1980s \u2014 and exchange losses are the key driver, said a Goldman Sachs analyst.\n\nThe Scott & White Health Plan, which expanded into the Dallas area last year, got walloped with high claims, too. For 2016, its premiums on the exchange are increasing an average of 32 to 34 percent. That compares with increases of about 5 percent in its commercial business, said CEO Marinan Williams.\n\nDoes this look like the beginning of the \u201cdeath spiral\u201d that many Obamacare critics have warned about?\n\n\u201cNot yet \u2014 I\u2019m not ready to call that yet,\u201d Williams said.\n\nUnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said his company could not continue to have such losses: \u201cWe can\u2019t really subsidize a marketplace that doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be sustaining itself,\u201d he told analysts last month.\n\n\u2018I am appalled\u2019\n\nAbout 1 million Texans buy health insurance through the federal exchange and about 85 percent get subsidies. That softens the hit from higher premiums but raises the costs for the federal government. And those who are healthy and earn too much to get assistance are feeling the sting.\n\n\u201cI am appalled and livid,\u201d Diane Blythe of Dallas wrote in an email.\n\nShe included a note from her broker that showed her 2016 Blue Cross plan going up 28.5 percent for coverage that was more limited.\n\n\u201cThis is not right,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am still as healthy as ever.\u201d\n\nWilliams of Scott & White said she hopes the market will stabilize in the next couple of years. Newcomers will learn how to navigate the system and stay healthier, she said. And more \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d will buy coverage, in part because penalties are rising for those who go without insurance.\n\nBut big premium increases raise the risk of what the industry calls adverse selection. Those who need care sign up for insurance and push up claims. And healthy people decide to not pay higher premiums because they don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll get their money\u2019s worth.\n\nIf an illness strikes, they can sign up next time and not worry about being denied coverage, as in the past. Indeed, Blue Cross said it had a spike in high-priced claims from members who signed up during special enrollment periods; within the first month, they had 28 percent more claims over $35,000, the insurer said.\n\nSmaller networks\n\nNarrowing the provider networks can reduce costs in several ways. Insurers usually get better terms with doctors and hospitals because they funnel more patients their way. They can also coordinate care by sharing digital records and setting standards for treatment.\n\nSmaller networks are generally seen as a negative, at least in Dallas. Blue Cross\u2019 PPO is so large that most providers are included and customers are accustomed to having many choices. But Scott & White emphasizes a narrow network, arguing that it produces more patient satisfaction at a lower cost.\n\nAt the hospital company, Baylor Scott & White Health, employees in North Texas have been using a \u201cpreferred\u201d network for two years. That has helped reduce health costs by $24 million, or 6 percent, for a group of 34,000 health care workers and dependents, said Gary Brock, chief integrated delivery network officer.\n\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t estimates, they\u2019re actual numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results are verified by a third-party audit, he said. Hospital admission and readmission rates were cut about 10 percent, and there was a nearly 5 percent increase in switching to generic drugs, Brock said.\n\nSeveral corporate clients, including the city of Dallas, are offering the Baylor network at a lower out-of-pocket cost for those who stay within it, he said.\n\nBlue Cross is getting into the same game. Starting in January, it will add a product for local companies that has fewer Dallas-area hospitals \u2014 and a lower price point. The strategy is reminiscent of its fix for the exchange business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another lever to control costs,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cAnd we need all the levers available.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "With claims and losses soaring on the individual health exchange, insurers are jacking up rates and narrowing provider networks.", "og": {"description": "With claims and losses soaring on the individual health exchange, insurers are jacking up rates and narrowing provider networks.", "title": "Cracks emerge in health care act", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151204-cracks-emerge-in-health-care-act.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151204-health_overhaul_premiums_47331585.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_PREMIUMS_47331585", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-12-10T20:53:03Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-12-04T18:10:26Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cracks emerge in health care act\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151204-cracks-emerge-in-health-care-act.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151204-health_overhaul_premiums_47331585.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_PREMIUMS_47331585\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2564204\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-04T18:10:26Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151204-health_overhaul_premiums_47331585.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_PREMIUMS_47331585", "publishtime": "2015-12-04T18:10:26Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Knee replacements, dialysis treatment, cancer therapy and the process of getting the uninsured into the health care system all piled up.\nThat has helped reduce health costs by $24 million, or 6 percent, for a group of 34,000 health care workers and dependents, said Gary Brock, chief integrated delivery network officer.\nHow did Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas lose $400 million in its first year on HealthCare.gov?\nThe Scott & White Health Plan, which expanded into the Dallas area last year, got walloped with high claims, too.\nAt the hospital company, Baylor Scott & White Health, employees in North Texas have been using a \u201cpreferred\u201d network for two years."}
