Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman endorsed John Kasich for president Friday.

Whitman's endorsement comes the same day that the current Garden State governor, Chris Christie, endorsed billionaire candidate Donald Trump for president.

"Governor Kasich is the lone voice of reason and optimism in a very loud room," Whitman said in a statement. "His winning combination of tax cuts, balanced budgets and job creation will revive the American economy."
