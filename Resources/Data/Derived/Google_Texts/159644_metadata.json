Increased use of EHRs has, however, resolved safety hazards such as potential miscommunication due to misread handwriting, according to the article.\n\nHowever, part of the problem is that system design reflects the wishes and needs of administrators or tech leaders rather than doctors, according to Robert Wachter, interim chair of the University of California San Francisco's department of medicine.\n\n\"It's one thing to have a computer, and informaticists on your staff, or have a doctor come in and look at this [particular design feature],\" Wachter told KHN. \"It doesn't get into this issue of what does it look like to be using this system at 4 in the morning, when you have nine other patients and a trauma patient running into the ER, and your beeper's going.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMedical errors now third-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nPhysician proficiency increases with EHR experience\n\nResearchers: Medical interns spent up to 7 hours a day using EHRs\n\nResidents who use EHRs provide less direct patient care\n\nIndiana University, Regenstrief develop EHR training tool\n\nMed students need more access to EHRs\n\nAMA adopts policy encouraging med student training in EHRs\n\nDocs must follow 'POISED' best practices when using EHRs in the exam room", "article_metadata": {"description": "As electronic health records become a part of healthcare's \"new normal,\" particularly in the emergency department, experts are concerned the new status quo is introducing new categories of medical error, according to Kaiser Health News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As electronic health records become a part of healthcare's \"new normal,\" particularly in the emergency department, experts are concerned the new status quo is introducing new categories of medical error, according to Kaiser Health News.", "title": "Room for error: EHRs in the ER pose safety risks", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/room-error-ehrs-er-pose-safety-risks/2016-03-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,electronic health records,Emergency Physicians,Emergency Room,Health Information Technology,medical errors,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Increased use of EHRs has, however, resolved safety hazards such as potential miscommunication due to misread handwriting, according to the article.\nAs electronic health records (EHRs) become a part of healthcare's \"new normal,\" particularly in the emergency department, experts are concerned the new status quo is introducing more opportunity for medical errors, according to Kaiser Health News.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:Medical errors now third-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\"It's one thing to have a computer, and informaticists on your staff, or have a doctor come in and look at this [particular design feature],\" Wachter told KHN.\nFurther complicating matters, many systems only allow users to edit one patient record at a time, which means doctors could make errors and have no way to keep track of them."}
