(Photo: Denise Henhoeffer/Courier-Post)\n\nThis struggling city was named a Promise Zone on Tuesday, giving Camden an edge in seeking federal funds and expertise for its turnaround efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are elated,\u201d Mayor Dana Redd said at an upbeat press conference outside City Hall.\n\nThe Promise Zone program, launched last year by President Barack Obama, provides no immediate funding but helps selected high-poverty areas compete for federal aid. The program is intended to boost economic activity, reduce violent crime and upgrade standards of living, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\u201cThis program really does make a difference,\u201d said Holly Leicht, a regional administrator for HUD.\n\nAmong other benefits, Camden will get extra points when being scored for competitive grants. Five communities already in the program, including Philadelphia, have received more than $100 million in federal aid, Leicht said.\n\nIn addition, a federal staffer will help Camden officials navigate the 14 U.S. agencies involved in the program. Five Americorps staffers will be dispatched to assist the city\u2019s recovery efforts, Leicht added.\n\nCamden was among eight low-income communities added to the program Tuesday. The newcomers were chosen from 123 applications in 36 states, including Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.\n\nHUD noted Camden, with about 77,000 residents, was designated the nation\u2019s poorest city in 2013. It has a poverty rate of 43.9 percent, an unemployment rate of 22.93 percent and the state\u2019s lowest-performing school district, the agency said.\n\nThe agency said all of the selected regions have developed plans to partner with local business and civic leaders.\n\nRep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, said the city\u2019s recovery effort is based on a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d \u2014 with public safety improvements expected from the Camden County Police Department, job gains from a state law that gives tax breaks to firms moving to Camden, and educational improvements from privately run Renaissance schools.\n\nAccording to HUD, the program\u2019s primary partners will be the Mayor\u2019s Office and a local nonprofit, the Center for Family Services. The center, which already has conducted an assessment of the city\u2019s needs, will help coordinate Camden\u2019s turnaround efforts, said Richard Stagliano, the nonprofit\u2019s president.\n\nOther partners include Campbell Soup Co., Cooper\u2019s Ferry Partnership, the city\u2019s school district and Housing Authority, and the county police.\n\nHUD said Camden\u2019s plan includes continued revitalization efforts through a higher-education and health care task force. It also features a Youth Justice Task Force \u201cto provide interventions and supports in non-school settings for the most at-risk students.\u201d\n\nAmong other measures, the plan calls for efforts to reduce childhood obesity and hunger, in part by providing school gardens and nutrition education.\n\nAnd the city is expected to provide quality homes \u201cby rehabilitating existing multifamily housing units with supportive services and demolishing vacant properties.\u201d\n\nOther cities to be named Promise Zones on Tuesday were Hartford, Connecticut; Indianapolis; Minneapolis; Sacramento, California; and St. Louis.\n\nAlso selected were the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and the Low Country region of South Carolina.\n\nHUD noted Philadelphia\u2019s Promise Zone activities include a partnership with Drexel University to expand access to early learning, and a new entrepreneurship center to provide technical assistance on financing for new businesses.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1zmgwj3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The year-old program partners federal agencies with local leaders in high-poverty areas", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The year-old program partners federal agencies with local leaders in high-poverty areas", "title": "Camden named \u2018Promise Zone\u2019", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2015/04/28/camden-named-promise-zone/26550867/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The year-old program partners federal agencies with local leaders in high-poverty areas", "title": "Camden named \u2018Promise Zone\u2019", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0713420457329e2d64d4862c36f6cec96efd11d1/c=1028-0-5116-4088&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/04/28/AsburyPark/B9317158876Z.1_20150428221715_000_GLJAKPN3H.6-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaba\"", "article_summary": "Camden was named a Promise Zone, which will aid the city in getting federal funding.\n(Photo: Denise Henhoeffer/Courier-Post)This struggling city was named a Promise Zone on Tuesday, giving Camden an edge in seeking federal funds and expertise for its turnaround efforts.\nThe Promise Zone program, launched last year by President Barack Obama, provides no immediate funding but helps selected high-poverty areas compete for federal aid.\nHUD noted Philadelphia\u2019s Promise Zone activities include a partnership with Drexel University to expand access to early learning, and a new entrepreneurship center to provide technical assistance on financing for new businesses.\nOther partners include Campbell Soup Co., Cooper\u2019s Ferry Partnership, the city\u2019s school district and Housing Authority, and the county police."}
