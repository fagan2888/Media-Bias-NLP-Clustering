Police searched her home in the 4700 block of Newport Dr. in Del City shortly after the arrest and found the items all over the home.\n\n\"It's creepy,\" said Dustin Walker, who lives two doors down from the house. \"I mean, I have a young one myself, so it's good to know what happened.\"\n\nWalker says the women who lived there kept to themselves, but he says there were usually a lot of cars in the driveway.\n\n\"What it appears to be is a shooting gallery type home, where people go to inject drugs,\" said Capt. Jody Suit with the Del City Police Department.\n\n5/21/2014 Related Story: Missing 5-Year-Old Boy Found Walking With Stranger\n\nDel City police originally arrested McDonald on a complaint of public intoxication. But now she will be facing the much more serious charge of child endangerment because of what police found in her home.\n\n\"He could have picked up a needle and stuck himself very easily,\" said Suit.\n\nPolice also arrested 28-year-old Elizabeth Ayala, who was also inside the house.\n\n\"It's a felony to have a child in a home where drugs are being used and sold,\" said Suit. \"And it is also a felony to bring them into the homes.\"\n\nPolice say McDonald claimed she found the little boy wandering outside a convenience store and though she didn't know him, brought him home to feed him. Police also say Ayala told them she told McDonald to call police to report the missing kid, but officers say neither of the women did that.\n\nDel City police say there were also two men inside the house when the boy was there. The boy was checked out a local hospital and is doing OK. He is back at home with his family.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Del City Police say the woman who found a missing 5-year-old boy will face child endangerment charges, after police searched her home and found drugs and syringes inside.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25593600/del-city-woman-facing-endangerment-charges-after-finding-missing-boy", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25593600_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Del City Police say the woman who found a missing 5-year-old boy will face child endangerment charges, after police searched her home and found drugs and syringes inside.", "title": "Del City Woman Facing Endangerment Charges After Finding Missing Boy"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25593600_SA.jpg", "description": "Del City Police say the woman who found a missing 5-year-old boy will face child endangerment charges, after police searched her home and found drugs and syringes inside.", "card": "summary", "title": "Del City Woman Facing Endangerment Charges After Finding Missing Boy"}, "wnreadableurl": "del-city-woman-facing-endangerment-charges-after-finding-missing-boy", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/05/22", "KEYWORDS": "del city,child endangerment charges,woman,drug den,adrianna iwasinski,kwtv,cbs,news9,crime", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "del city,child endangerment charges,woman,drug den,adrianna iwasinski,kwtv,cbs,news9,crime"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa83\"", "article_summary": "Del City Police say the woman who found a missing 5-year-old boy will face child endangerment charges, after police searched her home and found drugs and syringes inside.\n5/21/2014 Related Story: Missing 5-Year-Old Boy Found Walking With StrangerDel City police originally arrested McDonald on a complaint of public intoxication.\nDel City police say there were also two men inside the house when the boy was there.\nPolice say McDonald claimed she found the little boy wandering outside a convenience store and though she didn't know him, brought him home to feed him.\nCarmen McDonald, 36, was arrested on Wednesday after officer found her walking down the street with the child."}
