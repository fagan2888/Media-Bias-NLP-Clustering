Some Rocky Mountain Health Plans are eligible for the special enrollment period.\n\nThe extensions only apply to people seeking coverage that begins on New Year's Day. Shoppers can still purchase plans for next year through Jan. 31, however that coverage will begin later in 2016.\n\nThe two-day extension came amid a heavy rush of shoppers to Colorado's exchange, which was established in light of the Affordable Care Act as a one-stop marketplace to purchase health insurance plans. It is the only place for Coloradans to receive federal tax credits that reduce monthly insurance premiums.\n\nOn Wednesday, Connect for Health Colorado announced that slightly more than 116,000 people had enrolled in plans through the exchange. That included people who had coverage in 2015 and who were automatically re-enrolled in plans.\n\nPeople who go without health insurance in 2016 will face a much larger tax penalty than in 2015 - $695 per adult ($347.50 per child younger than 18) or 2.5 percent of a person's yearly household income, whichever is greater.
