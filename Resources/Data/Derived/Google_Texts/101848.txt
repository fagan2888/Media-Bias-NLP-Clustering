SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ California’s Supreme Court has voted to prohibit state judges from belonging to the Boy Scouts of America on grounds that the group discriminates against gays.

The court says its seven justices unanimously voted Friday to heed a recommendation by its ethics advisory committee barring judges’ affiliation with the organization.In 1996 the state Supreme Court banned judges from belonging to groups that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, but made an exception for nonprofit youth organizations.

An ethics advisory committee in February recommended eliminating the exception to enhance public confidence in the judiciary.

The Boy Scouts allows the participation of openly gay boys but continues to prohibit gay and lesbian adults from serving as leaders.

Judges will have until January 21, 2016 to comply with the new rule.
