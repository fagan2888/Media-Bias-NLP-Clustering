Officials at a zoo in Columbus, Ohio, are bringing charges against a man who hopped a fence in order to pet a pair of cougars, the Associated Press reports.

The man, who made a YouTube video of himself with the cougars, is being charged with trespassing.

While putting his hands on the two cougars, the man is reported to have said, “Kitty, kitty, kitty.”

Tom Stalf, the CEO of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, called the video of the man “alarming.”

The man told an Ohio television station that he regrets his decision to hop the fence.

“I’m an animal lover,” he said. “The cats were looking like they wanted some love and [I] just jumped over and petted them.”
