This simple flowchart provides a resource to understand the Affordable Care Act's penalties for not offering coverage in 2015 and 2016.\n\nPenalties for Employers Not Offering Coverage - Flowchart\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not require employers to provide health coverage to their employees, but larger employers face penalties if they don\u2019t make affordable coverage available. This provision of the ACA is commonly referred to as the \"employer shared responsibility\" or the \"employer mandate.\"\n\nThis simple flowchart by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) illustrates which employers may face penalties for not offering coverage, when the penalties apply, and the amount of the penalties.\n\nNote: The flowchart simplifies the \"transition relief,\" which provides leniency to employers in the first year (2015). For more information on the transition relief, read this article.\n\nSource: kff.org\n\nFor more information on the Affordable Care Act and how it impacts your business, download this free Guide: Affordable Care Act 101.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the penalties for employers not offering coverage?
