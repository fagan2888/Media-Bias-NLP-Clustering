A 31-year-old woman was taken to the hospital Saturday morning after jumping from the Arthur Ravenel Bridge, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

A Coast Guard officer says a woman was pulled from the water after jumping from the bridge around 6:30 a.m. and transported to a nearby hospital via EMS.

According to an incident report, the woman was spotted by Mt. Pleasant police around 2:40 a.m. after an officer saw a black Saturn with its flashers on near one of the diamonds of the bridge.

Police say the woman was sitting on the edge of bridge over the railing, and claimed she was having "rough issues".

Officials say she suffered minor injuries from the jump.

Southbound lanes on the bridge were closed early Saturday during the incident. The lanes were reopened just before 7 a.m.
