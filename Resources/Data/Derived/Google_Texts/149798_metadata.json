I've noticed Vice President Joe Biden appearing a lot recently with President Obama at big news conferences\u2014the Cuba embassy announcement, when the Supreme Court upholding a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the heckler scene at the White House's LGBT Pride Dinner, the first White House reaction to the Charleston massacre. Biden is such a big, everyday presence in public life\u2014like furniture in a comfortable room\u2014that I wanted to see if there were any common threads I could pick out about him by watching these appearances. Has he visibly changed over the years in the same way Barack Obama has, for example? In what ways has his public performance changed over the years?\n\nInstead, all I noticed was...his itchy face. He scratches his face a lot. More than other people behind the podium, or on stage. Far more. It's true, it must get pretty boring, listening and clapping and laughing so much. And imagine if you wanted to scratch your face, it would build up and you would really want to scratch it.\n\nNow, it's all I can see.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Now that I've seen it, I cannot unsee it, and I will see it forever.", "title": "Supercut: Joe Biden has a really itchy face", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2015/07/supercut-joe-biden-has-really-itchy-face", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/itchy-bidenmaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Supercut: Joe Biden has a really itchy face", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2015/07/supercut-joe-biden-has-really-itchy-face", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/itchy-bidenmaster.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/itchy-bidenmaster.jpg"}, "creator": "jameswest2010", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "And imagine if you wanted to scratch your face, it would build up and you would really want to scratch it.\nInstead, all I noticed was...his itchy face.\nHe scratches his face a lot.\nIn what ways has his public performance changed over the years?\nHas he visibly changed over the years in the same way Barack Obama has, for example?"}
