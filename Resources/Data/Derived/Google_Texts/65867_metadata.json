Hassan was convicted of two additional counts of lying to the FBI and received a 10-year sentence.\n\nDefense attorneys appealed on several grounds. Among them, they argued that U.S. District Judge Michael Davis should have recused himself because he made several statements suggesting he equated fundamentalist Islam with terrorism and was prejudiced. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.\n\n\u201cThis assertion is baseless,\u201d the judges wrote. For example, during sentencing, Davis asked the women questions about the meaning of jihad and al-Shabab\u2019s strict interpretation of Islam.\n\n\u201cPlucked from context, some of these questions may appear unconventional,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cHowever, rather than showing bias or partiality, when viewed in context, these questions demonstrate that the court sought to comprehend Ali\u2019s understanding of al Shabaab\u2019s goals and actions, a legitimate topic for a sentencing court to explore\u201d in a case of this nature.\n\nRandolph Daar, an attorney for Hassan, said he was disappointed in the decision. He hadn\u2019t yet talked with his client to determine whether they will appeal.\n\nThe women, both U.S. citizens of Somali descent, were among more than 20 people charged in Minnesota\u2019s long-running federal investigations into recruiting and financing for al-Shabab, which the U.S. considers a terrorist group. Investigators believe more than 22 men left Minnesota to join al-Shabab since 2007.\n\nProsecutors said the women went door-to-door in the name of charity and held religious teleconferences to solicit donations, which they then routed to the fighters.\n\nDefense attorneys painted the women as humanitarians who gave money to orphans and the poor, as well as to a group fighting to rid Somalia of foreign troops.\n\nDuring the trial, Davis held Ali in contempt 20 times when she refused to stand for the court, citing her religious beliefs. Defense attorneys pointed to that as another reason for Davis to recuse himself. But the appellate court said Davis gave Ali a chance to explain herself, and the ensuing discussion shows the nature of the disagreement, not bias on Davis\u2019 part.\n\nDefense attorneys also argued that evidence obtained by wiretap violated the Constitution, the women\u2019s trials should have been separated and that their sentences were unreasonable and enhancements that allowed for longer sentences should not have been applied.\n\nThe appeals court judges disagreed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal appeals court upheld the convictions and prison sentences Tuesday for two Minnesota women found guilty of conspiring to funnel money to a terror group in Somalia despite claiming they were collecting funds and clothing for the poor.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal appeals court upheld the convictions and prison sentences Tuesday for two Minnesota women found guilty of conspiring to funnel money to a terror group in Somalia despite claiming they were collecting funds and clothing for the poor.", "title": "Convictions upheld for women who raised funds for al-Shabab", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/convictions-upheld-for-women-who-raised-funds-for-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/c0560f0f283c2326800f6a70670031fa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/c0560f0f283c2326800f6a70670031fa.jpg", "description": "A federal appeals court upheld the convictions and prison sentences Tuesday for two Minnesota women found guilty of conspiring to funnel money to a terror group in Somalia despite claiming they were c", "card": "summary", "title": "Convictions upheld for women who raised funds for al-Shabab"}, "Author": "AMY FORLITI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "For example, during sentencing, Davis asked the women questions about the meaning of jihad and al-Shabab\u2019s strict interpretation of Islam.\nThe appeals court judges disagreed.\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A federal appeals court upheld the convictions and prison sentences Tuesday for two Minnesota women found guilty of conspiring to funnel money to a terror group in Somalia despite claiming they were collecting funds and clothing for the poor.\nAli also was found guilty of 12 counts of providing such support and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nHassan was convicted of two additional counts of lying to the FBI and received a 10-year sentence."}
