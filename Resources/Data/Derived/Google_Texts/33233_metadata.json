It\u2019s a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi. Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks. I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up. Most voters have made up their minds. And I\u2019m grateful for that. The same here. And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what\u2019s going on here. I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again. I take classified information seriously. I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released. This is a dispute about retroactive classification, quite a mouthful. So what people talk to me about is how I\u2019m going to get incomes up, how I\u2019m going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt. That\u2019s what\u2019s on voters\u2019 minds. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight.\n\nAs for the buzz about the FBI becoming more involved in the investigation, Clinton dismissed it as \u201cselective leaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything I\u2019m aware of,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved. But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks. And I\u2019m glad it isn\u2019t. Because the facts are the facts. No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families. And I\u2019ve been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response I\u2019ve been getting, the crowds that we had. That last event last night was just overwhelming. I\u2019m looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary: 'Nothing New' on Emails, 'Selective Leaking'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary: 'Nothing New' on Emails, 'Selective Leaking'", "title": "Hillary: 'Nothing New' on Emails, 'Selective Leaking' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 932, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Clinton21.jpg", "height": 699}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/01/hillary-nothing-new-on-emails-selective-leaking/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary: 'Nothing New' on Emails, 'Selective Leaking'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Clinton21.jpg", "title": "Hillary: 'Nothing New' on Emails, 'Selective Leaking' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Alisyn Camerota, Hillary Clinton, Hillary emails,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hillary emails", "published_time": "2016-02-01T06:19:58-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "So what people talk to me about is how I\u2019m going to get incomes up, how I\u2019m going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt.\nAnd I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what\u2019s going on here.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s on voters\u2019 minds.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton likened the controversy to the investigation of her role during the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and that the issues was not on voters\u2019 minds.\nIt\u2019s a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi."}
