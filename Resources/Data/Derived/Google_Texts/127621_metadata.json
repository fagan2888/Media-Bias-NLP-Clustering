Last year, actor Zach Galifianakis invited Obama on his sketch comedy web show \"Between Two Ferns.\"\n\nIn December, Mr. Obama repeated his pitch on \"The Colbert Report.\"\n\nBut pundits were quick to criticize he timing of Thursday's video that followed the death of 26-year-old American Kayla Mueller, who had been held hostage by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\n\"You know who else sees it? The rest of the world. Alright? Do you think ISIS is quaking in their boots because knowing the president makes goofy faces in the mirror,\" National Review contributor Jim Geraghty said on Fox News.\n\nWemple said Mr. Obama could not care less about the reaction.\n\n\"He cares about the audience. He knows [about] the charges of the diminishment of the office,\" Wemple said. \"He's trying to push this thing and Buzzfeed is an excellent partner for that.\"\n\nOfficials involved said Mr. Obama had a lot of fun doing this. At the end when he says \"yolo, man,\" you can hear people laughing because that part was ad-libbed. So, yes, the president knows what \"yolo\" means.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Buzzfeed video shows the president making faces in the mirror and taking fake free throws, but critics say the timing is innapropriate", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/13/5f1f3b9b-976a-480b-9078-420c4b1b6058/thumbnail/1200x630/cb922f6329d525c1d367271c3a44e574/obamabuzzfeed.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The Buzzfeed video shows the president making faces in the mirror and taking fake free throws, but critics say the timing is innapropriate", "title": "Obama's Buzzfeed video promoting healthcare deadline gets criticism"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Buzzfeed video shows the president making faces in the mirror and taking fake free throws, but critics say the timing is innapropriate", "title": "Obama's Buzzfeed video promoting healthcare deadline gets criticism", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbsthismorning", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/13/5f1f3b9b-976a-480b-9078-420c4b1b6058/thumbnail/1200x630/cb922f6329d525c1d367271c3a44e574/obamabuzzfeed.png", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-buzzfeed-video-promoting-healthcare-deadline-gets-criticism/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSThisMorning"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A new video promoting President Obama's healthcare plan is creating a lot of \"buzz.\"\nIt's not the first time the White House has touted its health care plan under the guise of millennial-favored media.\nIn December, Mr. Obama repeated his pitch on \"The Colbert Report.\"\nOfficials involved said Mr. Obama had a lot of fun doing this.\nWemple said Mr. Obama could not care less about the reaction."}
