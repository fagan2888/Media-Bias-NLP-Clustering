The punchline is more shocking than anything in Fifty Shades of Grey, though nearly as funny as the book\u2019s prose. I imagine this is how the average Fox News viewer/at least one of your crazy relatives on Facebook imagines the world. \u201cDamn ISIS is picking up our young girls!\u201d\n\nTHANKS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMACARE. Meanwhile, the people have spoken:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rainelachance/status/571897032916529152\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WoodfordDeb/status/571909104639221760\n\n'Just when you think its safe to go into water, #SNL spoofs #ISIS. Producers channeling #JeSuisCharlie? Vile. #nbc #DakotaJohnson \u2014 Kathy Murphy (@katmur23) March 1, 2015\n\nJust saw maybe the most unfunny #SNL piece of all time. Is ISIS really a good subject for humor? #nbc And I've loved SNL for decades. \u2014 Ed Tate (@edwardtate) March 1, 2015\n\nI just watched my last SNL! They're making jokes about ISIS and it makes me sick! #snl #losers \u2014 Ryan Herndon (@Myaz75tweet) March 1, 2015\n\nhttps://twitter.com/manxie809/status/571897377834983424\n\nI'm going to go ahead and voice my opinion on the #SNL ISIS skit. Absolutely hell no, under any circumstance. Poor poor taste! \u2014 Matthew Lyle (@mlyle2) March 1, 2015\n\nDear #SNL, jokes about Isis are not funny. See how much you laugh when you have to see your loved one(s) being slaughtered. No respect. \u2014 Chas.
