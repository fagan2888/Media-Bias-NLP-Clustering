As the House votes Tuesday to repeal Obamacare, the White House is launching an offensive to call attention to the law’s positive results.

President Obama will meet at the White House Tuesday morning with 10 people from around the nation who have benefitted from Obamacare. A White House official said the meeting comes as House Republicans attempt to “take these benefits away from millions of Americans.”

“Congress has tried to repeal or undermine this law more than 50 times, but the president will continue to stand with the families who have better care and choices as a result of the law,” the official said.

The House on Tuesday is expected to approve a bill that would repeal the president’s signature law, and take steps to come up with a replacement for the program. The White House is threatening to veto the legislation.

Among the invitees who will meet with the president are Maria Villavicencio of Fairfax, Virginia; Lynnette Jackson of Hyattsville, Maryland; and Dr. Susanne Choby of Morgantown, West Virginia. The open enrollment deadline for Obamacare is Feb. 15.
