A crew comes in to assess the house and, more often than not, decides it\u2019s better to knock the small, dilapidated home down and start over rather than deal with the home\u2019s huge flaws (structural integrity, mold, etc.).\n\nI can\u2019t help but think of that show as I read about this week\u2019s conflicting court decisions on the health care law. With countless delays, crashes, adjustments, regulatory gymnastics, lawsuits and tweaks already making up the short history of the law, and now with the courts drawing opposite conclusions over some pretty fundamental elements, it seems to me that we are at a point where we need to admit that there are just too many problems. The law was not well written and the regulatory band-aids are not holding. Like a house that can\u2019t be held together by patches, it would be so much easier to start over, to build a new law, than to fix the dilapidated one that we have.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nOf course that won\u2019t happen any time soon. The chances of the president calling Congressional leaders and saying \u201cGuys, this isn\u2019t going well. What do you say we start over?\u201d are less than zero.\n\nBut I refuse to believe that we are stuck with this turkey of a law forever. This is America, and we can do better.\n\nIn my perfect world (I am a Republican), the health care law will be scrapped and replaced in 2017 \u2014 when we have a Republican president and Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate. Having control of both branches of government won\u2019t be enough, mind you. The revolutionaries who are opposed to the health care law \u2014 most likely led by the small-business community \u2014 will have to be ready to make a slam-dunk case against it, and they\u2019ll need to be ready for battle. They\u2019ll need data and horror stories. They\u2019ll need experts who will rail against the law, adorable children who are being hurt by it and kittens on YouTube who make fun of it. They\u2019ll need an arsenal of pure public relations and government relations gold. This will take time to amass. Good thing we\u2019ve got time.\n\nTime will also bring with it wave after wave of the law\u2019s inevitable failures. Instead of jumping on every single horror story, every single day between now and 2017, conservatives would do well to just ... wait ... for ... it. This thing is going to get worse. Be patient. And again, when it is time, be ready. A lot of deals were cut when this thing sailed through the capitol in 2010, and a lot of deals will have to be undone. Monied interests will need to be appeased, and/or enemies will need to be made. The good news is that there are people in Washington who regret the deals they made ... and who crave atonement for their sins.\n\n[READ: Ready for Hillary? Is Hillary Ready?]\n\nIronically, I can see major change coming \u2014 again, if the revolutionaries are ready \u2014 even under a Hillary Clinton presidency. Mrs. Clinton doesn\u2019t need to look out for Mr. Obama\u2019s ego. I think we can be confident that she won\u2019t give a hoot about the legacy of the first black president when history is making way for the legacies of the first female president. And who better to fix something like health care than a woman, a mother, a former first lady who tried to reform health care from the East Wing once up on a time herself?\n\nAnd we know how she likes the \u2018reset\u2019 button.\n\nI understand that talk about repealing Obamacare is enough to earn me the \u201ccrazy\u201d label inside the beltway, but I prefer the term \u201coptimist.\u201d My advice to the health care revolutionaries: Come to 2017 ready for battle and committed to achieving the thing that we all know, deep down, we need, an \"Extreme Makeover: Healthcare Edition.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "GOP Needs 'Extreme Makeover: Obamacare Edition'", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Come 2017, be ready to tear down the failed health care law and start over.", "title": "'Extreme Makeover: Obamacare Edition'", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/07/24/gop-needs-extreme-makeover-obamacare-edition", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7c/d8/74be772949439adec2246ed724bb/140624daily2-cartoon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Come 2017, be ready to tear down the failed health care law and start over.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP Needs 'Extreme Makeover: Obamacare Edition'"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,health care,Republican Party,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Come 2017, be ready to tear down the failed health care law and start over."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd258d\"", "article_summary": "I can\u2019t help but think of that show as I read about this week\u2019s conflicting court decisions on the health care law.\nAnd who better to fix something like health care than a woman, a mother, a former first lady who tried to reform health care from the East Wing once up on a time herself?\nIf you\u2019ve ever watched \u201cExtreme Makeover: Home Edition,\u201d you\u2019re familiar with the renovation approach of just-knock-it-down-and-start-over.\nThey\u2019ll need an arsenal of pure public relations and government relations gold.\nThey\u2019ll need data and horror stories."}
