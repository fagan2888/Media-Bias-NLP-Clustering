THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL FOR SPOKANE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

IS AUGUST 31ST.

BUT IT'S THE SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL THAT'S IN QUESTION.

JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TEACHERS WENT ON STRIKE.

ASKING FOR MORE FUNDING TO PUBLIC EDUCATION.

WITH THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR APPROACHING, THEY COULD BE

RIGHT BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

DEBBY CHANDLER, VP SEA :43

WE WOULD MUCH RATHER BE IN OUR CLASSROOMS IN OUR SCHOOLS,

THAN HAVE TO START FIGHTING FOR THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT

WE DESERVE EVERYDAY.

SPOKANE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION VICE PRESIDENT, DEBBY

CHANDLER SAYS THE DECISION TO STRIKE WILL BE MADE

BY THE TEACHERS IF CONTRACT AGREEMENTS ARE NOT MET.

THE BIGGEST HOLD UP RIGHT NOW IS COMPENSATION FOR

BOTH TEACHERS AND SUPPORT STAFF- WHICH INCLUDES RESOURCE

OFFICERS, MAINTENANCE STAFF AND INSTRUCTION ASSISTANTS.

DEBBY:50

A LOT OF THEIR COMPENSATION IS SO LOW AND SO POOR

A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES GET FREE AND REDUCED

LUNCH AND THEY ARE ON OBAMACARE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

AFFORD THE INSURANCE FOR THEM.

SINCE JULY, 100 DIFFERENT OFFERS HAVE BEEN SENT BACK

AND FORTH BETWEEN S-E-A AND SPOKANE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

KEVIN MORRISON, SPS

EVERY EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS ARE

IN THE CLASSROOM ON TUESDAY MORNING.

BUT KEVIN MORRISON WITH SPOKANE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SAYS

THE DISTRICT IS ALSO BEING REALISTIC.

MORRISON

THE STATE HAS ONLY GIVEN US SO MUCH TO WORK WITH AND

WHAT THEY HAVE GIVEN US WE HAVE PASSED ONTO THE CLASSROOMS

AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

WHERE THE TWO PARTIES AGREE IS THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION

EACH CHILD DESERVES.

DEBBY :30

EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA SERVES TO HAVE WORLD CLASS

TEACHERS AND SUPPORT STAFF THAT HELP THEM ENRICH THEIR

LIVES.
