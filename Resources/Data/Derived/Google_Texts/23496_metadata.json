In July, the Obama administration delayed the mandate\u2019s implementation by one year from 2014 to 2015, or after the mid-term elections.\n\nThe Treasury made its latest decision after accepting feedback from local fire and EMS departments.\n\n\u201cWe think this guidance strikes the appropriate balance in the treatment provided to traditional full-time emergency responder employees, bona fide volunteers, and to our Nation\u2019s first responder units, many of which rely heavily on volunteers,\u201d Mark J. Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy, wrote in the blog post.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly, Indiana Democrat, praised the move as a way to maintain local fire departments.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the Treasury will protect the ability of fire departments across our state to continue to serve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that fire departments are able to distinguish between full-time, paid emergency personnel and volunteer personnel so they can keep costs low and services at full capacity.\u201d\n\nMr. Donnelly and Sen. Susan Collins, Maine Republican, introduced a bill last year that would define a full-time work week as a traditional 40 hours, and not 30 as the health care law prescribes.\n\nCritics of the law say the employer mandate is causing businesses to cut employees\u2019 hours or trim payroll to stay under the 50-employee threshold and avoid fines or the cost of providing health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Treasury said Friday it will not count \"nominally compensated\" volunteer firefighters or emergency medical services personnel as full-time employees when the employer mandate tied to Obamacare takes effect next year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Treasury said Friday it will not count \u201cnominally compensated\u201d volunteer firefighters or emergency medical services personnel as full-time employees when the employer mandate tied to Obamacare takes effect next year.", "title": "First responders exempt from Obamacare employer calculations: Treasury", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/10/first-responders-exempt-obamacare-calculations/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/09/house-firejpeg-091cc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/09/house-firejpeg-091cc.jpg", "description": "The Treasury said Friday it will not count \"nominally compensated\" volunteer firefighters or emergency medical services personnel as full-time employees when the employer mandate tied to Obamacare tak", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "First responders exempt from Obamacare employer calculations: Treasury"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Labor, Joe Donnelly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ece\"", "article_summary": "The Treasury said Friday it will not count \u201cnominally compensated\u201d volunteer firefighters or emergency medical services personnel as full-time employees when the employer mandate tied to Obamacare takes effect next year.\nThe controversial mandate, which defines full-time work as 30 hours a week, penalizes employers with 50 or more employees that do not provide health coverage.\n\u201cI am pleased that the Treasury will protect the ability of fire departments across our state to continue to serve,\u201d he said.\nCritics of the law say the employer mandate is causing businesses to cut employees\u2019 hours or trim payroll to stay under the 50-employee threshold and avoid fines or the cost of providing health coverage.\nThe Treasury made its latest decision after accepting feedback from local fire and EMS departments."}
