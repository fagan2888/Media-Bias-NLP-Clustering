Facing growing uncertainty, market volatility and financial stress, employees are looking to their companies for help. Our survey highlights the nature of employees\u2019 struggles and the ways in which employers can support employees as they work toward greater financial wellness. In particular, our research finds that employers can play a key role in helping employees build sound financial habits essential for financial security.\n\nAt Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we are committed to helping employers and their employees in this effort. We encourage employers to draw on our research and insights to gain understanding about the most important trends affecting workplace benefits programs, and to help employees achieve both short- and long-term financial success.\n\nHealth care cost \u2013 Financial wellness slips\n\nEmployees\u2019 responses indicate declines in financial wellness since our 2013 survey. The percentage of participants categorized as \u201cNot At All Secure\u201d rose from 31% to 41%.\n\nThe fact that financial wellness did not improve, while the economy did, suggests that external factors alone may have limited influence in driving wellness improvements.\n\nHow we measured financial wellness\n\nOur 2013 and 2015 surveys asked employees 10 questions, each covering a different aspect of their financial lives. They were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements such as \u201cI am always able to pay my monthly mortgage or rent,\u201d \u201cI am saving enough for retirement\u201d and \u201cI am always able to pay for health care costs.\u201d In each case respondents could choose responses ranging from a strong positive (such as \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d) to a strong negative (\u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d). A respondent received a point for each question that he or she answered with the most positive response. Level of wellness was categorized based on the respondent\u2019s point total. Note that our wellness measure is based entirely on self-reported sentiment, not on actual financial standing.\n\nNearly all components of financial wellness that we measured declined between 2013 and 2015. The largest declines came in response to the following questions:\n\nThe only component for which responses improved was, \u201cI am saving enough for my retirement.\u201d Nineteen percent strongly agreed with this statement, compared with 15% in 2013.\n\nUncertainty leads to stress\n\nWhen we dig deeper into the wellness findings, we discover that the declines in our measure of financial wellness occurred not because employees\u2019 attitudes about their financial situations turned outright negative. Rather, employees became much more likely to select the second-most-positive response instead of the most positive response. We interpret this shift to mean that employees feel less certain about their finances, even if their actual financial conditions may not have worsened.\n\nEmployees\u2019 lack of certainty about their finances seems to manifest itself in high levels of financial stress. Fully 60% of employees report being \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d stressed about their financial situation, up from 50% in 2013.\n\nPlanning makes the difference\n\nExamining the responses of the most financially well employees, and contrasting them with the responses of the least financially well employees, highlights the different habits of the two groups and the places where employer assistance could be especially effective.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the groups we\u2019ve labeled Very Secure and Not At All Secure comes down to one word: planning. Very Secure employees appear far more likely than Not At All Secure employees to envision the future and take steps to prepare for it financially.\n\nThese findings suggest that employers who want to cultivate financial wellness should focus on helping employees build healthy financial habits, particularly with regard to planning. Employers looking to help their less financially secure employees become more like their more financially secure employees \u2014 and to help reduce employees\u2019 financial stress \u2014 might consider making financial professionals available, simplifying enrollment in benefits programs and communicating around tools and resources that can help with planning.\n\nEmployees need day-to-day assistance\n\nBefore they can plan for the future, employees need to manage their finances today. Employees\u2019 responses show that they are struggling to juggle competing financial priorities, and in many cases are sacrificing the future to make ends meet.\n\nEmployers can help. Fully 55% of employees agreed with the statement \u201cI need help managing my finances.\u201d Employers can provide resources that help employees improve their understanding of their overall financial lives, enabling them to set sound priorities and allocate their resources more wisely.\n\nSee full PDF below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements such as \"I am always able to pay for health care costs.\"", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0", "og": {"site_name": "ValueWalk", "description": "They were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements such as \"I am always able to pay for health care costs.\"", "title": "Health Care Cost Have Risen For 69% Of Population Over Past 2 Yrs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1071, "identifier": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Health-Care-Cost-6.jpg", "height": 468}, "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/04/health-care-cost-soar/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare: 69% Have Experienced A Rise In Health Care Cost Over The Past Two Years by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Employees want help pursuing wellness Employees show a growing need for help [...]", "creator": "@ valuewalk", "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/04/health-care-cost-soar/", "image": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Health-Care-Cost-6.jpg", "title": "ObamaCare: 69% Have Experienced A Rise In Health Care Cost Over The Past Two Years", "site": "@valuewalk", "card": "photo"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 294013504001864, "pages": 144640855575863}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-ValueWalk-site-icon-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/valuewalk", "section": "Business", "tag": "self-reported sentiment", "published_time": "2016-04-13T17:22:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/valuewalk"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Health care cost \u2013 Financial wellness slipsEmployees\u2019 responses indicate declines in financial wellness since our 2013 survey.\nEmployees need day-to-day assistanceBefore they can plan for the future, employees need to manage their finances today.\nVery Secure employees appear far more likely than Not At All Secure employees to envision the future and take steps to prepare for it financially.\nThe fact that financial wellness did not improve, while the economy did, suggests that external factors alone may have limited influence in driving wellness improvements.\nNearly all components of financial wellness that we measured declined between 2013 and 2015."}
