In many cases, constitutional and statutory text is imprecise or opaque, admitting multiple interpretations. In such cases, judges consider many variables, including the real-world consequences of their decisions.\n\nConsequences of decisions have always affected justices' thinking. It is part of the difficult business of calling balls and strikes\n\nBrown v. Board of Education is a paradigmatic example. There, the justices did not limit their inquiry to the scope of the 14th Amendment or the application of past precedents, like Plessy v. Ferguson. Instead, they considered a range of things, including social science data suggesting that racial segregation had detrimental psychological effects on the black children consigned to Jim Crow\u2019s under-resourced public schools.\n\nIn addition to these domestic concerns, the Brown court also confronted segregation\u2019s effects on American diplomacy abroad. In an amicus brief, the Justice Department noted that racial segregation had \u201can adverse effect upon our relations with other countries,\u201d furnishing grist for Communist propaganda mills and jeopardizing the nation\u2019s \u201cmoral leadership\u201d around the globe. Thus, when the court voted unanimously to overrule \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d it knew that its decision would not only dismantle de jure segregation in the South, it would rehabilitate America\u2019s image around the world.\n\nOf course, the consideration of a decision\u2019s consequences does not always lead to landmark decisions like Brown. More often, the court\u2019s attention to real world practicalities is more prosaic. In City of Chicago v. Morales, the court invalidated a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance aimed at reducing gang violence. In doing so, the court focused on practical matters, including the difficulty of enforcing the ordinance. Poorly drafted, the ordinance offered police officers little guidance for appropriate enforcement, and its imprecise terms deterred ordinary citizens from otherwise lawful conduct. Even the dissent grappled with the practical effects of the ordinance and the court\u2019s decision to strike it down. Justice Antonin Scalia had no trouble with the ordinance, which he pronounced a \u201csmall price to pay\u201d to secure Chicago\u2019s streets. Justice Clarence Thomas worried that the decision would sentence \u201claw-abiding citizens to lives of terror and misery.\u201d\n\nThis term, the court will hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act and state-level bans on same-sex marriage. The outcomes in these cases will affect the lives of millions of Americans in ways both prosaic and profound. Because these cases involve constitutional and statutory provisions that are subject to multiple interpretations, practical considerations will, at some level, inform the court\u2019s decision-making. This realization may prompt claims of judicial activism. But attention to the real-world consequences of its decisions has always played a role in the court\u2019s work. It is simply part of the difficult business of calling balls and strikes.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/26/opinion/RFDSupremeCourt/RFDSupremeCourt-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/26/opinion/RFDSupremeCourt/RFDSupremeCourt-articleInline.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/the-supreme-court-meets-the-real-world", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/26/opinion/RFDSupremeCourt/RFDSupremeCourt-articleInline.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/26/opinion/RFDSupremeCourt/RFDSupremeCourt-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Consequences of decisions have always affected justices' thinking.
