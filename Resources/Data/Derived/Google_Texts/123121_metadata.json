It hasn't moved since then.\n\nDeSantis uses Obamacare as one of the ways Congress has exempted themselves from the rules. He says they created a separate exchange with separate subsidies that aren't included in the statute.\n\n\"And I'm not a part of this because I declined the subsidy because I don't think it's legal,\" DeSantis says. \"This is an example of making a special accomodation for Congress, which is obviously unfair because so many Americans, if they have a problem with Obamacare, they don't have that type of recourse. They basically have to eat the cost.\"\n\nHe also says the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act didn't apply to Congress for about 30 years after it was passed.\n\n\"That very law that now people celebrate - Congress did not apply it to itself,\" DeSantis says. \"I think when people see that, I think they just shake their heads.\"\n\n\n\nThe Republican also introduced another constitutional amendment a month later that proposed a 3-term limit on House members and a 2-term limit for Senators. It's also currently sitting in subcommittee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A local congressman is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would require all United States Congress members to live by all the laws they pass.", "og": {"url": "http://www.wokv.com/news/news/local/ron-desantis-introduces-constitutional-amendment-m/nq8mc/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/01/29/4a/8b/OfficialHeadshot.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A local congressman is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would require all United States Congress members to live by all the laws they pass.", "title": "Ron DeSantis introduces constitutional amendment making..."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/01/29/4a/8b/OfficialHeadshot.jpg", "description": "A local congressman is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would require all United States Congress members to live by all the laws they pass.", "site": "@WOKVNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Ron DeSantis introduces constitutional amendment making Congress live by its own laws"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "wokv", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wokv.com/news/news/local/ron-desantis-introduces-constitutional-amendment-m/nq8mc/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3319255/news/news/local/ron-desantis-introduces-constitutional-amendment-m/nq8mc/", "keywords": "United States Congress,Term limits,Ted Yoho,Ron DeSantis,Matt Salmon,Laws,Constitutional amendment,Affordable Care Act", "news_keywords": "Term limits, Laws, Constitutional amendment, United States Congress, Ted Yoho, Ron DeSantis, Matt Salmon, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "Ron DeSantis formally introduced the amendment on Wednesday along with co-sponsor and fellow Republican Matt Salmon of Arizona.\nThe Republican also introduced another constitutional amendment a month later that proposed a 3-term limit on House members and a 2-term limit for Senators.\nBy Robert Alonso and Gene WexlerA local congressman is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would require all United States Congress members to live by all the laws they pass.\n\"I think it would be a source of political hygiene,\" DeSantis says, also acknowledging that passing the amendment will be \"an uphill battle.\"\n\"And I'm not a part of this because I declined the subsidy because I don't think it's legal,\" DeSantis says."}
