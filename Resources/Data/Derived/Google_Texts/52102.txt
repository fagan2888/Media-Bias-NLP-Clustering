A motorcyclist is dead after colliding with a vehicle in Boulder County, officials said Saturday.

The crash happened just after noon in between Neva Road and Nebo Road on U.S. 36 around mile marker 29, said Colorado State Patrol Trooper Alisha Danko.

The victim was driving a 2011 Honda CBR Motorcycle when he turned left and collided with the right front side of a 2014 BMW that was heading westbound.

The Boulder County Coronerâ€™s Office has identified the victim as a white male, but has yet to release his name. The cause of death will be determined after an autopsy is performed.

The other driver sustained minor injuries.

The eastbound highway was closed for several hours at the Neva access roads, Danko said. It re-opened around 4 p.m., according to a tweet from the Colorado Department of Transportation.
