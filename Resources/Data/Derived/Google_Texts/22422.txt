Heat related illness can be very serious and with temperatures forecast to reach 100 degrees across the state, the chances of heat exhaustion and heat stroke increase.

According to the CDC, symptoms of heat-related illness usually start with muscle cramping.

People who are experiencing heat exhaustion might start the sweat heavily; experience weakness; have cold, pale and clammy skin; be nauseous; or faint or are dizzy.

Treating heat exhaustion can be as simple as taking the person to a cool location and having them lie down. Applying a cool, wet cloth to their body will help and have them stay hydrated. If the person is vomiting, they should seek medical attention.

Heat Stroke is much more serious.

Symptoms of heat stroke include a body temperature above 103 degrees; a rapid pulse; hot, red, dry or moist skin; or unconsciousness.

If someone is experiencing heat stroke, they need medical attention immediately. The CDC says to call 911. To help cool the person down, move them to a cooler environment, if possible, get them into a cool shower. Do not give them any fluids.

To avoid heat-related illnesses, try to limit being outside to the morning and late evening hours.

People that have to be in the heat should stay hydrated and try to avoid sun exposure.
