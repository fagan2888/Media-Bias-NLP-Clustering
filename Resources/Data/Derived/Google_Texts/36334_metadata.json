As I noted last month, 63 out of 100 adults had jobs before the recession. Now 59 do.\n\nThe unemployment rate continues to decline because a growing share of the nonworking population is not even trying to find jobs. Some policy makers argue that the unemployment rate is a more accurate barometer of economic conditions because it\u2019s impossible to tell how many of the larger group of those not working actually want jobs, and how many don\u2019t.\n\nOthers say reversing the trend is beyond the power of short-term measures like the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary stimulus.\n\nBut these views only raise further questions: Why are more Americans choosing not to work? What kinds of government policies might be able to reverse the trend? And, if we cannot, what are the long-term consequences for our nation\u2019s fiscal and economic health?", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130906095321, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 6, 2013", "keywords": "Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,United States Economy,The Jobs Report", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "GBLC": "The Jobs Report", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Population Growth Outpaces Jobs ( 20130906 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "byl": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "twitter": {"description": "The share of adults with jobs fell slightly to 58.6 percent in August.
