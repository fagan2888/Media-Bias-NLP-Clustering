The beach beckons. The kids are underfoot. There\u2019s a fresh, gorgeous salmon sizzlin\u2019 on the grill.\n\nOn days like this, priorities can run amok and the truly important things can get lost. In all of this family time, smart phones can get left behind. Facebook becomes a shell of its winter self, when we were all taking pictures of the snow and making unhappy emoticon faces. On lazy summer days, especially a day as full of festivities as the Fourth of July, we sometimes forget to get mad at the political happenings in this nation.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help. We feel obliged. It\u2019s truly our pleasure.\n\nBehold: the top five things you should be angry about this week. We\u2019ve compiled a cheat sheet so that you can get right to the heart of what\u2019s happening. You can get mad.\n\nThen you can go back to the beach\u2014and the BBQ.\n\n1. Hobby Lobby\n\nSCOTUS ruled 5-4 in favor of Hobby Lobby that closely held corporations can be exempt from the mandate of the Affordable Care Act that covers contraception\u2014intrauterine devices (IUDs) and Plan B pills\u2014because of their sincerely held religious beliefs. Ginsburg authored dissent (spurring \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d memes\u2014questioning whether this applies to Christian Scientist corporate owners who are against blood transfusions, etc. Progressives consider this ruling to be a serious blow to what they feel to be a stunning setback for women\u2019s reproductive rights. All three female Justices dissented, arguing that this ruling places limits on women\u2019s rights. In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated, \u201cThe exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would\u2026deny legions of women who do not hold their employers\u2019 beliefs access to contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nShe concluded emphatically that \u201capproving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be \u2018perceived as favoring one religion over another,\u2019 the very \u2018risk the [Constitution\u2019s] Establishment Clause was designed to preclude.\u2019\u201d\n\nDo these words whet your appetite for more RBG dissenting words? Perhaps in song form? Thanks to YouTube\u2019s one-a-day songwriter Jonathan Mann, we can satisfy that craving.\n\nBottom line: Huge blurred lines between church and state, far-reaching implications that could influence overturn of Roe v. Wade.\n\n2. Harris v. Quinn\n\nThis landmark case dealt a blow to organized labor by ruling that health care workers in Illinois don\u2019t have to pay union dues as they are not considered fully public sector workers. Union leaders nationwide are nervous that this caveat undermines financial support of unions by encouraging freeloading\u2014essentially reaping the negotiating benefits of organized labor without contributing.\n\nBottom line: Another blow to organized labor from the establishment.\n\n3. Ann Coulter\n\nShe wrote something that has liberals frothing in self-righteous anger. She said that the United States\u2019 newfound interest in the World Cup is a sign of the nation\u2019s moral decay and that anyone whose great-grandfather was born here isn\u2019t watching soccer. It\u2019s a sign that we\u2019ve been overtaken by the brown people. Also because soccer isn\u2019t dangerous and is low-scoring, it\u2019s a dream for liberals who like to reward those who don\u2019t risk. Or something.\n\nBottom line: Why is she relevant? Oh right, because people like me like to write about what an idiot she is.\n\n4. The Boehnler\n\nRepublican Speaker of the House John Boehner is using taxpayer money to sue the president for his overuse of executive power. This is a president gone rogue. He\u2019s being a maverick. Oh wait, wasn\u2019t that a good thing when McCain/Palin were headlining their road show?\n\nThe truth is Obama has used executive orders less than both Reagan and GWB.\n\nBottom line: Obama\u2019s all, Dude, somebody has to work around here. \u201cSo sue me,\u201d he said.\n\n5. App-Block\n\nSCOTUS blocked Obama\u2019s recess appointments to the national labor relations board (9-0) because Congress wasn\u2019t truly in recess but on a three-day pro forma meeting spree. This is giving conservatives a boehner and giving them incentive for the above lawsuit.\n\nBottom line: This was a slap back from the judiciary to POTUS.\n\nThere you go kids. You have everything you need to argue with your belligerent uncle at the Fourth of July barbecue this weekend.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jaime Franchi", "og": {"site_name": "Long Island News from the Long Island Press", "description": "The Boehnler strikes again!", "title": "Top Five Things You Should Be Angry About This Week [July 4th Edition]", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/johnboenerresize2.jpg", "height": 422}, "updated_time": "2014-07-02T18:51:51-04:00", "url": "https://www.longislandpress.com/2014/07/04/top-five-things-you-should-be-angry-about-this-week/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Boehnler strikes again!", "creator": "@jaimimimama", "image": "https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/johnboenerresize2.jpg", "title": "Top Five Things You Should Be Angry About This Week [July 4th Edition]", "site": "@longislandpress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 122297088961}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/longislandpress", "section": "Brain Candy", "tag": "top 5", "published_time": "2014-07-04T09:28:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T18:51:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Union leaders nationwide are nervous that this caveat undermines financial support of unions by encouraging freeloading\u2014essentially reaping the negotiating benefits of organized labor without contributing.\nBehold: the top five things you should be angry about this week.\nBottom line: Another blow to organized labor from the establishment.\nOn days like this, priorities can run amok and the truly important things can get lost.\nProgressives consider this ruling to be a serious blow to what they feel to be a stunning setback for women\u2019s reproductive rights."}
