Ignore the fearmongering on TV and the Internet. Take the state-sponsored feel-good sales pitches with a grain of salt, too.\n\nInstead, go to NYStateofHealth.ny.gov and use the tax credit and premium estimator to figure out the bottom line for you and your family.\n\nBecause the true test of the Affordable Care Act is whether it really is affordable for the people who are supposed to buy it.\n\nThere\u2019s no one answer to the cost question because Obamacare offers a sliding scale of discounts based on income, and because different plans charge different premiums in different areas.\n\nFor each plan, consumers can also choose a benefit level, ranging from \u201cplatinum\u201d (with higher monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket expenses) to \u201cbronze\u201d (with lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket expenses).\n\nSome adults up to 30 also have the option of a bare-bones plan that covers catastrophic medical coverage but not routine tests and office visits.\n\nTo boil down all these variables, here are a couple of typical scenarios, as provided by Elisabeth Benjamin of the Community Service Society:\n\nA family of four in Brooklyn with income of $48,000 will be able to buy \u201csilver\u201d coverage for a net cost of about $315 per month. (That\u2019s a $788 premium minus $473 in tax credits.)\n\nA single woman in Queens making $27,000 a year, meanwhile, would pay just $112 a month for \u201cbronze\u201d coverage (a total premium of $308 minus tax credits of $196).\n\nBy the standards of New York City \u2014 where family coverage can cost $27,000 a year \u2014 these are huge bargains. Yet for a middle-class family living paycheck to paycheck, finding even a few hundred dollars a month can be a lot to ask.\n\nObama is betting that most people will bite the bullet and sign up \u2014 thus improving their access to basic care and gaining the security of no longer living one car accident or cancer diagnosis away from bankruptcy.\n\nIf enough people take the leap \u2014 as they did under a similar law in Massachusetts \u2014 Obamacare will be a historic success.\n\nBut if too many decide they\u2019d rather pay the tax penalty \u2014 which, in the first year, will be $95 or 1% of family income, whichever is more \u2014 the President\u2019s signature accomplishment will be an undeniable bust.\n\nThis is the pragmatic scale on which the law should be judged \u2014 not the absurd ideological arguments thrown around by Republicans in Congress.\n\nIs Obamacare a government takeover of health care? Give me a break. The government is already up to its neck in health care \u2014 licensing doctors, inspecting hospitals, operating Medicare, etc. \u2014 without destroying the republic. This law is about helping people buy private insurance, not socializing medicine.\n\nDoes it take away freedom of choice? Uninsured New York City residents who buy insurance through the state marketplace can choose from nine health plans offering five benefit packages \u2014 a total of 45 choices.\n\nDoes it drive up costs? Health premiums have been soaring since long before Obama took office. The premiums being offered through the marketplace average 53% lower than what was previously available to individuals without employer-based coverage \u2014 largely because more people are joining the insurance pool. And that doesn\u2019t include tax credits that bring prices even lower.\n\nSome propaganda goes so far as to turn young people off on the whole idea of medical care. One series of ads features a creepy Uncle Sam preparing to perform Pap smears and rectal exams \u2014 preying on squeamishness about procedures that save lives.\n\nWhat next Tuesday is really about is finally giving 45 million Americans a realistic chance to enjoy the health benefits and financial security of being insured.\n\n\u201cAt 8 a.m., I will be enrolling people in my office, and I can\u2019t wait,\u201d the Community Service Society\u2019s Benjamin says. \u201cFor people like me who\u2019ve been trying to help consumers access health coverage for my entire professional life, . . . this is our Super Bowl moment.\u201d\n\nI, for one, hope that it works.\n\nwhammond@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Bill Hammond", "twitter": {"description": "Hammond: Unless Republicans follow through on their threat to shut down the entire federal government, Obamacare will start delivering on its core promise \u2014 of providing decent, affordable health coverage to the uninsured \u2014 next Tuesday, Oct. 1.", "title": "How to tell if Obamacare works", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-works-article-1.1465344", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1465343.1379978336!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-health-care.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "New York City, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Community Service Society, United States, U.S. Republican Party, New York, Elisabeth Benjamin, Barack Obama", "parsely-author": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "New York City, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Community Service Society, United States, U.S. Republican Party, New York, Elisabeth Benjamin, Barack Obama", "news_keywords": "New York City, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Community Service Society, United States, U.S. Republican Party, New York, Elisabeth Benjamin, Barack Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-works-article-1.1465344", "parsely-title": "How to tell if Obamacare works", "sailthru.date": "2013-09-24T04:30:17-0400", "sailthru.title": "How to tell if Obamacare works", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-24T08:30:17", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1465343.1379978336!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-health-care.jpg", "description": "Hammond: Unless Republicans follow through on their threat to shut down the entire federal government, Obamacare will start delivering on its core promise \u2014 of providing decent, affordable health coverage to the uninsured \u2014 next Tuesday, Oct. 1.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Hammond: Unless Republicans follow through on their threat to shut down the entire federal government, Obamacare will start delivering on its core promise \u2014 of providing decent, affordable health coverage to the uninsured \u2014 next Tuesday, Oct. 1.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Hammond: Unless Republicans follow through on their threat to shut down the entire federal government, Obamacare will start delivering on its core promise \u2014 of providing decent, affordable health coverage to the uninsured \u2014 next Tuesday, Oct. 1.", "title": "How to tell if Obamacare works", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-works-article-1.1465344", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1465343.1379978336!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-health-care.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1465343.1379978336!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-health-care.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde666\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFor people like me who\u2019ve been trying to help consumers access health coverage for my entire professional life, .\nBy the standards of New York City \u2014 where family coverage can cost $27,000 a year \u2014 these are huge bargains.\nThe government is already up to its neck in health care \u2014 licensing doctors, inspecting hospitals, operating Medicare, etc.\nIs Obamacare a government takeover of health care?\nHealth premiums have been soaring since long before Obama took office."}
