In 1982, the summer between his junior and senior seasons at Stanford, Elway played for the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A New York Penn League. He hit .318 with four homers, 25 RBI and 13 stolen bases in 45 games.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, left-handed Johnson played college ball at USC where his catcher was Jack Del Rio, who is now the Broncos\u2019 defensive coordinator. Johnson wound up with 303 major-league wins and 4,875 strikeouts. He started his pro career with the Jamestown Expos in the New York Penn League.\n\nWride is a long-time researcher and statistician for the NY Penn League.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jack Del Rio,John Elway,Randy Johnson", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Broncos' GM John Elway has been elected into the New York Penn League's Hall of Fame, along with pitcher Randy Johnson and statistician Charlie Wride.", "title": "John Elway joins Randy Johnson in New York Penn League's Hall of Fame", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/09/john-elway-joins-big-unit-new-york-penn-leagues-hall-fame/28681/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/elway-baseball-social.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Broncos' GM John Elway has been elected into the New York Penn League's Hall of Fame, along with pitcher Randy Johnson and statistician Charlie Wride.", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/09/john-elway-joins-big-unit-new-york-penn-leagues-hall-fame/28681/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/elway-baseball-social.jpg", "title": "John Elway joins Randy Johnson in New York Penn League\u2019s Hall of Fame", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Broncos' GM John Elway has been elected into the New York Penn League's Hall of Fame, along with pitcher Randy Johnson and statistician Charlie Wride."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5b9\"", "article_summary": "Broncos\u2019 general manager John Elway has been elected into the New York Penn League\u2019s Hall of Fame, along with pitcher Randy Johnson and statistician Charlie Wride.\nHe started his pro career with the Jamestown Expos in the New York Penn League.\nIn 1982, the summer between his junior and senior seasons at Stanford, Elway played for the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A New York Penn League.\nWride is a long-time researcher and statistician for the NY Penn League.\nBut before earning money through football, Elway was selected in the second round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft as a left-handed hitting outfielder for the New York Yankees."}
