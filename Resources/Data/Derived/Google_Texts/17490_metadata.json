They really don\u2019t care if a picture is flattering or not.\u201d So observes veteran photojournalist Mark Peterson of the 2016 presidential hopefuls whom he has been following throughout the current campaign. An exhibition of his coverage so far just opened this week in the Second Floor Gallery at Hudson Beach Glass in Beacon: home of Fovea Exhibitions, renowned for its specialization in social and political documentary photography. Peterson will be on hand for an artist talk and presentation this Saturday, February 13 from 6:30 to 9 p.m.\n\nDisheartened by an assignment to cover carefully stage-managed Tea Party rallies against the Affordable Care Act in 2013, Peterson decided to undertake a more warts-and-all approach to the next presidential race, peeling back the veneer of official photo ops to expose the candid underbelly of the campaign trail. Peterson employs unusual angles to chronicle imperfect moments, weaving body language and unscripted moments to present a strong editorial perspective: a stark contrast to the intention of the politicians\u2019 controlled environment. Highlighting the artifice of the political persona, he runs the photographs taken with his DSLR through his iPhone and then several iPhone apps, adding filters to emphasize the cartoonish drama.\n\nBy now we\u2019ve doubtless all seen plenty of examples of Peterson\u2019s work, uncredited, in the form of uncharitable Internet memes mocking one Oval Office aspirant or another. The Fovea show, titled \u201cPolitical Theatre: Photographs by Mark Peterson,\u201d takes a deeper dive into the photographer\u2019s sardonic point of view via 20 high-contrast black-and-white images, described by the presenters as \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cOrwellian.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition is on view daily through March 6 in the Second Floor Gallery, located at 162 Main Street in Beacon.
