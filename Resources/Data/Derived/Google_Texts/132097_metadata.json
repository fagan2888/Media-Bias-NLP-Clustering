Again.\n\n\u201cIt is a results business, for sure,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cYou have to win games at this time of year.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins have done that precisely three times in their past dozen games (3-8-1), which is why, with less than a week remaining in the regular season, their bid to secure an Eastern Conference playoff spot is infused with more suspense than an Agatha Christie novel.\n\nThe Penguins (42-26-11) have lost three consecutive games, all in regulation, and still hold the first wild-card spot in the East. But they are tied in points with Detroit and are just two ahead of Ottawa, although the Penguins would win the first tiebreaker.\n\nThe Penguins will face Ottawa at 7:38 p.m. Tuesday at the Canadian Tire Centre.\n\nSuddenly, a game that seemed like a nice playoff tuneup a few weeks ago has become the most critical of their season.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d right winger Craig Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s the middle of January, and we\u2019re going through a tough stretch.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do any mental gymnastics here. We just have to win.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins played well enough to do that Sunday, and likely would have if Mason hadn\u2019t picked that game to do a more-than-passable impersonation of Bernie Parent.\n\n\u201cMason was unbelievable,\u201d Penguins defenseman Rob Scuderi said.\n\nIf not for Mason, the Penguins might have put the game out of reach by the first intermission. They ran up a 22-4 edge in shots in the opening 20 minutes and had more than a few quality chances.\n\nBrandon Sutter converted one of those, on shot No. 18, at 16:21, but just more than two minutes later, Penguins winger Daniel Winnik was penalized for cross-checking Sean Couturier in the neutral zone.\n\nThe Flyers got the tying goal from Jakub Voracek 47 seconds later.\n\nJohnston wondered aloud whether the call on Winnik was appropriate \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t think he came in with a lot of force\u201d \u2014 but acknowledged that Voracek\u2019s goal \u201chad a huge impact.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Penguins\u2019 penalty-killing is tied for fourth-best in the league, Philadelphia owns the NHL\u2019s most lethal power play on home ice.\n\nIt proved why again at 12:20 of the second period, when Brayden Schenn scored what proved to be the game-winner while Blake Comeau was serving a hooking minor.\n\nThe Penguins killed Philadelphia\u2019s next chance with the extra man, but it was a moot point. They weren\u2019t going to get another puck past Mason, no matter how many they threw at him.\n\nThe goals Ryan White and Michael Del Zotto scored in the third period served only to rub it in a bit more as the Flyers earned their eighth consecutive victory against the Penguins and swept the season series for the first time since 1983-84.\n\nSuch numbers don\u2019t concern the Penguins now, though.\n\nNot when they\u2019re faced with more pressing issues, like trying to make sure their season doesn\u2019t end before the coming weekend does.\n\n\u201cWe know where we\u2019re at,\u201d Sutter said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware.\u201d\n\nDave Molinari: Dmolinari@Post-Gazette.com and Twitter @MolinariPG", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Penguins\u2019 stretch-drive swoon continued today, as they lost to Philadelphia, 4-1, at the Wells Fargo Center.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Mike Johnston will see a lot of things he likes when he reviews the video of this game.
