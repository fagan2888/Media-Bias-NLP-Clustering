Four weeks ago, former CBS News Investigative Correspondent Sharyl Attkisson resigned from her position after 20 years at the network. It was reported at the time by POLITICO that liberal bias was a major factor in the submission of her resignation.

Last night on the one month anniversary of her resignation, Attkisson appeared on the O'Reilly Factor to explain why she made that decision. She described being classified as a 'troublemaker' for looking into serious stories like Benghazi and explained how the network slowly killed off investigative pieces about Operation Fast and Furious and Obamacare.

"We had to quit pursuing the the story [Fast and Furious] more or less due to lack of interest well before we found answers to a lot of questions," Attkisson said. "It just came to be that I don't think on the viewers part but on the people that decide what stories go into the broadcast and what there's room for they felt very early on that this story was over when I felt as though we had barely begun to scratch the surface. They didn't ask me what was left to report they just decided on their own that the story was done."
