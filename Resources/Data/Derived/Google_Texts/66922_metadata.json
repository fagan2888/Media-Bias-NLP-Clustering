Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) proposed the SWEET Act, an excise tax on sweetened beverages. The tax, which has been billed as a national soda tax, would lay a one-cent duty on every teaspoon of sugar in soft drinks and other beverages. The proposal is intended \"to curb obesity, diabetes, and the resulting health care costs.\"\n\nIt would add about 50 or 60 cents to the average cost of a six-pack of soda.\n\nWhy is this a good idea?\n\n\u201cWhen a two-liter cola is 99 cents and blueberries are over three dollars, something has gone very wrong,\u201d DeLauro told attendees.\n\nFor the record, a pint of blueberries contains more than 40g of sugar. That\u2019s about as much sugar as you\u2019ll find in a pint of soda.\n\nRep. DeLauro\u2019s bill, H.R. 5279, would exclude calorically sweet drinks I can only suspect that DeLauro and her Connecticut constituents enjoy, including soy, rice, or dairy-based milk products, pure fruit and vegetable juices, and alcohol beverages.\n\nThe bill is a lousy idea for several reasons, many of which I\u2019ve discussed previously. First, research has shown that soda taxes are an ineffective tool for combating obesity. Some untaxed drinks will contain more sugar than those that are taxed. Soda taxes\u2014like lotteries\u2014serve primarily to tax those in lower income brackets. Soda consumption has fallen over the last decade even as obesity has risen. What\u2019s more, people should be able to drink a damn soda\u2014or a rice-based milk substitute, for that matter\u2014without the taxman judging them for their choices.\n\nMost Americans agree. Charitably, DeLauro\u2019s bill has gained little traction. A Rasmussen poll this month found just 1 in 5 Americans surveyed support DeLauro\u2019s proposed tax. Only a handful of soda summit attendees were quick to throw their support behind the measure. Congressional co-sponsors were tougher to find. Reports at the time of the bill\u2019s introduction claimed DeLauro was \u201cin conversations with a potential SWEET Act co-sponsor.\u201d Ultimately, just three of the DeLauro\u2019s 434 House colleagues joined her in supporting the measure, which appears to have stalled in committee.\n\nBut the handful of soda tax supporters may be insulated from these facts, given the echo chamber in which they reside. For example, Rep. DeLauro publicly announced her intentions to introduce the tax during a videotaped appearance at the Center for Science in the Public Interest\u2019s insiders-only \u201csoda summit\u201d in June, shortly before a New York State court sounded the death knell for New York City\u2019s reviled soda ban. (The fact one New York City health department official who spoke at the \u201csoda summit\u201d described the city\u2019s appeal as \u201ccritical for future efforts by the department to take action\u201d can only be described as good news for those who think the city\u2019s future efforts shouldn\u2019t include such buffoonery.)\n\nThe CSPI summit was co-sponsored by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s philanthropic arm. DeLauro\u2019s proposed tax is similar to a one-peso-per-liter tax that took effect this year in Mexico. That tax became law thanks to a $10 million donation from the same Bloomberg charity that co-sponsored the CSPI soda summit.\n\nIf these names seem to pop up again and again\u2014Bloomberg, DeLauro, CSPI\u2014that\u2019s no coincidence. When few favor soda taxes, those few rule the pulpit.\n\nBut successful movements often result from many diverse voices rising above the din. Conversations about soda taxes and bans, however, are the result of a select few in positions of power who make a lot of noise. If it seems like you hear the same names\u2014DeLauro, CSPI, Bloomberg, Marion Nestle, Mark Bittman\u2014over and over again on this issue, that\u2019s largely because they constitute the tiny faction of Americans who support such policies. As a result, when it comes to soda taxes, it\u2019s safe\u2014even advisable\u2014to ignore their noise.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Rep.
