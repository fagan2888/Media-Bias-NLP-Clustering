'Hope' and 'Change' gave way to insularity and ineffectiveness, and Obama is now perilously close to falling below a 40-percent approval rating. The liberal base is anywhere from frustrated to outraged over a litany of failed efforts and unfulfilled promises. The rollout of the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislation, continues to plague his legacy. The thrill, as Riley B. King said, is gone.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should expect Matthews to morph into Bill O'Reilly. He's still a liberal. Discussing the forthcoming interview this week, Matthews compared the disastrous Obamacare rollout to \"a brilliant writer, perhaps, with a great theme who turns in a paper with a lot of misspelling or bad handwriting.\" That echoes Matthews' sentiments about everything Obama has done wrong, from the Denver performance to his reluctance to get on the phone with Republican lawmakers: Of course he's brilliant! He just can't close... often because he doesn't seem to want to. He lacks the Clintonian instinct.\n\nIt's ok for President Obama to be depicted as weak by Fox News -- they'll paint him that way no matter what -- and it's even tolerable for him to endure bad press on CNN (hey, it's just horse-race minutae, and no one's watching anyway). It is an entirely different thing for the president to lose Chris Matthews and MSNBC. What Matthews takes away from that interview will reverberate throughout the network's programming and shape the network's tone toward the president for the months ahead. That will in turn influence the attitudes of the base, and could determine whether Obama's approval rating heads into the high 30s or back toward the mid-40s.\n\nFor MSNBC: No major news outlet has supported Obama as much as MSNBC, and no major news outlet has been so shafted by him. Though it can sometimes seem like an arm of the White House and the DNC, MSNBC has an extraordinarily hard time booking Obama.\n\n\"The fact that President Obama has done Fox News, CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC -- what is the only major TV outlet that he has not done? He has not done us,\" MSNBC president Phil Griffin compained in October. Griffin attributed that to the fact that the president couldn't count on MSNBC giving him an easy interview. His interviewer, from The Hollywood Reporter, had a different theory: \"Do you think Obama hasn't done an MSNBC interview because he thinks that everyone who watches MSNBC is going to vote for him anyway.\"\n\nMatthews and MSNBC have a chance to display some journalistic integrity here. To push the president where he needs to be pushed and, after the interview, criticize him where he deserves criticism. In that October interview, Griffin said MSNBC was \"not here to be the voice of the administration.\" This interview and its post-game analysis offer a trial run for that thesis.\n\nFor that reason, it's a good thing for MSNBC that the White House gave the interview to Matthews, rather than, say, Ed Schultz or Lawrence O'Donnell. Though often mocked by the right for his fawning statements about then-Sen. Obama, Matthews has been uninhibited in expressing his disappointment. Other MSNBC hosts seem to feign enthusiasm and outrage; with Matthews, you know where he stands.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>Chris Matthews serves as a barometer for baby-boom progressives' attitudes.</p>", "title": "Why Matthews' Obama interview matters", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/12/why-chris-matthews-obama-interview-matters-178929.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/111030_chris_matthews_605_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>Chris Matthews serves as a barometer for baby-boom progressives' attitudes.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Though often mocked by the right for his fawning statements about then-Sen.
