"At Local Motors, we are hell-bent on revolutionizing manufacturing," said John B. Rogers, Jr., CEO and co-founder of Local Motors.

"Car manufacturers have been stamping parts the same way for more than 100 years. We now have the technology to make the process and products better and faster by linking the online to the offline through DDM (Direct Digital Manufacturing). This process will create better and safer products, and we are doing exactly that."

There are several versions of 3D printing. The most common method uses a laser to form various materials, from epoxy resins to powdered titanium, into solid objects. Local Motors uses a slightly different deposition process that also builds up objects essentially one pixel at a time. Both methods are relatively slow compared to conventional manufacturing but offer the advantage of allowing near endless customization.

Local Motors publicly demonstrated its concept at the Detroit Auto Show in January. That prototype, dubbed the Strati, had barely 50 individual parts, beyond the electric power train.
