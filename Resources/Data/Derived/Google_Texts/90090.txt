The federal judge who was shot outside his Detroit home last year will lead a walk against gun violence Friday evening.

Judge Terrence Berg was shot in the knee while moving trash cans outside his home in the city’s University District last March. Just a month after the shooting, Berg’s family and community members joined together for the first Walk of Hope to call for an end to gun violence.

This year, Berg has recovered enough to lead the walk himself.

He says one goal of the walk is to show the love and support he’s felt from the community.

“The next thing is, I think, to show how much people are committed to try to do something about the level of gun violence and pull together and show that the community is against it and believes that by pulling together they can make their neighborhoods safer,” Berg said.

Berg says more jobs…better education and more police are key to addressing violence. The walk is one mile long. It starts and ends at Gesu Church in Detroit.
