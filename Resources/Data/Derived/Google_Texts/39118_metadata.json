In both Iowa and New Hampshire, 61 percent of voters believe Congress should \u201cmodify the Patriot Act to limit government surveillance and protect Americans\u2019 privacy,\u201d the poll found. Twenty-eight percent of likely Iowan voters and 33 percent of likely voters in New Hampshire disagreed, and said that Congress could renew the law unchanged.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonLibertarian Party eyes 2016 as breakthrough year Poll: Military voters prefer Trump over Clinton Clinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick MORE and other top Democratic White House hopefuls have supported reforming the NSA.\n\nOn the Republican side, Sens.
