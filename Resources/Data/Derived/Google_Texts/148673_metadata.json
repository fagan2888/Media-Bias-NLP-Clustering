Or will the policy holder be responsible for bearing the cost?\n\nA: \u201cTax credit\u201d this and \u201ctax credit\u201d that. You\u2019re probably sick of that term.\n\nI know my editor is.\n\nTax credits get the glory because they will significantly reduce health insurance costs for some people who buy from Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. Tax credits are applied to monthly premiums.\n\nBut yes, Jerry from Petaluma, there\u2019s another, lesser-known form of financial assistance called \u201ccost-sharing subsidies.\u201d Think of these subsidies as the red-headed step-children to the tax credits.\n\nCost-sharing subsidies will be applied to out-of-pocket expenses, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. Unlike monthly premiums, these are costs you pay when you receive medical services. Think of the check you write at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nHowever (and you knew one was coming), not everyone eligible for a tax credit can get a subsidy.\n\nYou will qualify for a tax credit if your income falls between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). This year, 400 percent equals $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four. (Click here for FPL guidelines.)\n\nTo receive the cost-sharing subsidy as well, you must fall between 139 percent and 250 percent of FPL. This year, 250 percent equals $28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four.\n\nBut wait. There\u2019s more.\n\nIn order to receive the subsidy, you also must purchase a plan at the \u201csilver\u201d level.\n\nCovered California offers tiers of plans that cover different percentages of medical costs. A \u201csilver\u201d plan pays an average of 70 percent of your medical costs. (The bronze plans pay out less; the gold and platinum more. The more of your medical expenses the plan covers, the higher the monthly premium.)\n\nAn individual with a regular silver plan would pay a $45 copay to see a primary care doctor and $65 to see a specialist. The annual out-of-pocket maximum is $6,350.\n\nBut someone with cost-sharing subsidies would pay between $3 and $40 to see a primary care doctor and $5 and $50 to see a specialist. (The subsidies vary with income.) The out-of-pocket maximum would be $2,250 or $5,200. (Check out pages 5 and 6 of this document for more information.)\n\nIt all makes perfect sense, right? Now I bet you\u2019re longing for the good-old days, when it was only about tax credits.\n\nQ: I am 58, a U.S. Army veteran and have no private insurance. I have used the VA Medical Center almost exclusively since being discharged in 1973. Under the Affordable Care Act, will I face a fine or penalty if I don\u2019t buy private insurance?\n\nA: Just in time for Veterans Day, some good Obamacare news!\n\nI feel like a broken record, but in case anyone has been living on the International Space Station for three years (or really, really hasn\u2019t been paying attention), Jan. 1 signals a new era in health insurance. Starting then, you must carry a minimum level of health coverage or face a penalty.\n\nChances are, you probably already meet the requirement if you currently have health insurance, whether it\u2019s Medi-Cal, Medicare or job-based coverage. The same goes for many veterans like Jim.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the following veterans programs meet Obamacare\u2019s insurance requirement:\n\n\n\nIf you are covered by one of these programs \u2026 STOP! You don\u2019t have to switch plans or buy a new one.\n\nThat also applies to family members covered by these programs.\n\nQ: My family is enrolled in TRICARE, but we want to see if we can find a better deal from the health insurance exchange. Are we allowed to do that?\n\nA: There is a blessedly simple answer to your question: Yes.\n\nYou can indeed purchase health insurance for your family from Covered California. And if your household income qualifies, you may be eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of your premiums.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t always work this way for people who are eligible for government health care programs. As I have previously reported, if you merely qualify for Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), for example, you can\u2019t get tax credits, even if you haven\u2019t enrolled.\n\nIn the case of TRICARE, which is the Department of Defense health care program for military families and retirees, it\u2019s not eligibility that disqualifies you from tax credits. It\u2019s enrollment.\n\nSo if your income qualifies and you want those credits, call Covered California and TRICARE to find out how to proceed, given that you\u2019re already enrolled.\n\nThe same rule applies for other veterans health programs, says Anne Gonzales of Covered California.\n\n\u201cIf an individual is offered but declines to enroll in the Veterans program \u2026 then they can be eligible to receive tax credits if they meet all other eligibility requirements,\u201d she says.\n\nIn other words, yes.\n\nLearn more about Emily here.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And if your household income qualifies, you may be eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of your premiums.\nTax credits get the glory because they will significantly reduce health insurance costs for some people who buy from Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nThe same rule applies for other veterans health programs, says Anne Gonzales of Covered California.\nNow I bet you\u2019re longing for the good-old days, when it was only about tax credits.\nIt doesn\u2019t always work this way for people who are eligible for government health care programs."}
