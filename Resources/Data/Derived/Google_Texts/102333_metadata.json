When that plan fizzed in the Legislature the exchange asked for $5.4 million from the state, but it was only granted $2 million. Some lawmakers said it was important to support the institution, because if they didn\u2019t, it could potentially be vulnerable to a partial federal takeover.\n\nKissel said he appreciates the Legislature\u2019s investment, calling it a vote of confidence, but he did not have immediate details on how the exchange would make ends meet.\n\n\"We\u2019re working literally daily with the administration to see if there are ways we can save costs by working with other government agencies and sharing resources,\" Kissel said. \"Until we work out those plans, I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to have to scale up or back enrollment.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s Board of Directors Friday, Kissel said the federal government has released some essential grant money, but the bulk of federal grant money is restricted.\n\nThere are 37,000 people enrolled in health insurance through the exchange, which far exceeds its goal of 27,260 by June 30, and which marks a turnaround from last year.\n\n\"I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re going to generate a lot more revenue ultimately, but we\u2019ve got to close the gap between what we\u2019ve got now and what we\u2019re going to generate later,\" Kissel said\n\nAt the meeting, board members played down fears of a federal takeover, which some believe could threaten the state\u2019s Prepaid Health Care Act, Hawaii\u2019s unique law that requires employers to subsidize health insurance. They explained that discussions with the federal government about possibly moving some technology functions to the federal system applied to the individual side of the exchange, not the employer side of the exchange. That\u2019s important because plans that are compliant with Prepaid are only sold on the employer side of the exchange.\n\n\"Currently the feds have acknowledged, that on the SHOP (employer) side, they wouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate the Prepaid plans,\" said Gordon Ito, Hawaii\u2019s insurance commissioner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "The state's financially troubled health exchange is responding now that the Legislature has approved less than half the money it requested.", "title": "State health exchange deals with money problem | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "url": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/state-health-exchange-deals-with-money-problem-2/", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02-b1-migrant5.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Business", "tag": "news", "published_time": "2015-05-08T14:04:08-10:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "twitter": {"description": "The state's financially troubled health exchange is responding now that the Legislature has approved less than half the money it requested.", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/02-b1-migrant5.jpg", "title": "State health exchange deals with money problem | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ad3\"", "article_summary": "State health exchange deals with money problemThe state\u2019s financially troubled health exchange is responding now that the Legislature has approved less than half the money it requested.\nThere are 37,000 people enrolled in health insurance through the exchange, which far exceeds its goal of 27,260 by June 30, and which marks a turnaround from last year.\nWhen that plan fizzed in the Legislature the exchange asked for $5.4 million from the state, but it was only granted $2 million.\nAt a meeting of the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s Board of Directors Friday, Kissel said the federal government has released some essential grant money, but the bulk of federal grant money is restricted.\nThat\u2019s important because plans that are compliant with Prepaid are only sold on the employer side of the exchange."}
