However, researchers must conduct a randomized clinical trial to measure the effect of the intervention on improving individuals' level of resilience, as well as improving psychological outcomes in symptoms like anxiety, depression, burnout and PTSD, according to the study.\n\nBut the nursing profession itself causes a certain amount of stress that impacts all nurses, according to a Nursing Times survey of 2,200 nurses conducted last year. Eight of 10 nurses report they are under more pressure than the previous year and suffer physical ailments as a result. And earlier this year, University of Akron researchers found that caring, nurturing and altruistic nurses actually experience more stress and burnout.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAltruistic nurses more likely to burn out on the job\n\nStudy: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stress\n\nSurvey: Nurses overworked, understaffed and stressed\n\nHospitals try holistic approach to treat docs' stress, burnout", "article_metadata": {"description": "Resilience training among\u00a0intensive care unit\u00a0nurses may help them cope with stressful work experiences and prevent psychological side effects, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Critical Care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Resilience training among\u00a0intensive care unit\u00a0nurses may help them cope with stressful work experiences and prevent psychological side effects, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Critical Care.", "title": "Resilience training may help prevent ICU nurse burnout", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/resilience-training-may-help-prevent-icu-nurse-burnout/2014-11-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Intensive Care Unit,job stress,Nursing", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5cf\"", "article_summary": "Resilience training among intensive care unit (ICU) nurses may help them cope with stressful work experiences and prevent psychological side effects, according to a new study published in the American Journal of Critical Care.\n\"ICU nurses sometimes leave their profession because the ICU is a stressful place to work, with high patient mortality and morbidity, daily confrontations with ethical dilemmas and a tension-charged atmosphere,\" authors wrote.\nAnd earlier this year, University of Akron researchers found that caring, nurturing and altruistic nurses actually experience more stress and burnout.\nBut the nursing profession itself causes a certain amount of stress that impacts all nurses, according to a Nursing Times survey of 2,200 nurses conducted last year.\nResearchers found the resilience training was feasible to conduct and acceptable to ICU nurses, and both nurses in the treatment group and the control group showed a significant decrease in their PTSD scores after the intervention."}
