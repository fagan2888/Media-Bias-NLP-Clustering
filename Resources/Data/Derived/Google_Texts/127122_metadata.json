Which is all the Sisters had sought, and which revealed the ideological ferocity behind Obama\u2019s dismissal of First Amendment protections.\n\nOn Friday, Sister Loraine Maguire, the order\u2019s mother provincial, wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe have never asked the court to prevent the government or insurance companies from offering this coverage to women who want it.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cthe government or an insurance company could provide a supplemental plan that covers these services\u201d under a separate policy, such as through Medicaid or Obamacare health exchanges, that is truly independent.\n\nThe Sisters are asking Obama only to show respect for their faith, as the Supreme Court also appears to be doing.
