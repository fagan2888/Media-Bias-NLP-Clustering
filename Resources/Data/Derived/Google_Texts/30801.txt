A study commissioned by the Council of Community Clinics finds that a year after health insurance became available under Obamacare, 275,000 individuals in San Diego County still lack coverage.

The number of uninsured is down from a high of 500,000 before the Affordable Care Act, which is popularly known as Obamacare, according to the study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.

The study found that some people think it’s too expensive, or don’t understand that subsidies are available, while others are undocumented individuals who are simply not eligible.

Henry Tuttle, CEO of the Council of Community Clinics, a nonprofit organization representing sixteen health centers with more than 100 sites of care in San Diego, Riverside and Imperial counties, said the information will help his staff design outreach programs that specifically target uninsured individuals.

“Not only do our health centers provide outstanding health care to the medically under-served, we work to educate individuals about their insurance options and get them linked to coverage. Many people don’t realize that affordable health insurance is available to them,” Tuttle said.

The report found that as a result of Obamacare, the percentage of uninsured in San Diego County has decreased from 22 percent to 14 percent, while 60 percent of the population continues to receive health benefits through their employers.

Open enrollment for coverage under Obamacare began Nov. 15 and continues through Feb. 15. You can apply online through Covered California, the online marketplace implementing Obamacare in California.
