Arias' attorneys asked for the computer back, and only received it on Oct. 20, at which point they say another defense expert was able to detect the deleted files.\n\nThey say the new analysis found thousands of files were deleted in a 3-hour period on June 19, 2009, when the computer was in the custody of the Mesa Police Department.\n\nThe defense said in the motion that such misconduct would merit a complete dismissal of all charges without prejudice. It also sought to drop the possible death penalty, which would halt the current trial, set to reconvene Wednesday.\n\nArizona v.
