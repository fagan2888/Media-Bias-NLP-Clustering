(WWLP) \u2013 It\u2019s time to think about what changed for you and your family over the past year, and it\u2019s not just for the holiday card. There are steps you should be taking right now so you\u2019re prepared for the quickly approaching tax season.\n\n\u201cIf you had a child you want to look at the benefits that derive from having a child. If you bought a home, make sure you have the documents put together to bring to your tax preparer or prepare your own so you can take deductions that might be available,\u201d said Ray Maagero at Liberty Tax in West Springfield.\n\nAnd the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing some major changes too: it\u2019s the first filing season with new laws under the Affordable Care Act. Even though Massachusetts was at the forefront of health care reform, the national changes could still impact people in our state.\n\nThe IRS asked for a budget to help them cover costs of implementing the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Congress cut their budget by $341 million. For people who normally call the IRS during tax season with questions, only about half of those calls are estimated to go through.\n\n\u201cYour tax return is going to be more complicated bc the federal government has additional forms bc of Obamacare that you\u2019re going to have to pay attention to,\u201d said Maagero.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, you can expect a bigger fine this year. Take the necessary steps to get covered so you can minimize those penalties. Either way, organize your documents early so you\u2019re ready to file during what\u2019s expected to be a complicated season.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "Upcoming tax season expected to be complicated", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "Many of us are focused on upcoming events, shopping, and travel for the holidays. 22news looked at what else you should be preparing for: tax season.", "title": "Upcoming tax season expected to be complicated", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2014/12/10/upcoming-tax-season-expected-to-be-complicated/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tax-season.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many of us are focused on upcoming events, shopping, and travel for the holidays. 22news looked at what else you should be preparing for: tax season.", "title": "Upcoming tax season expected to be complicated", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tax-season.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2014-12-10T23:11:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-11T00:31:13+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Many of us are focused on upcoming events, shopping, and travel for the holidays. 22news looked at what else you should be preparing for: ta\u2026"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1470\"", "article_summary": "Either way, organize your documents early so you\u2019re ready to file during what\u2019s expected to be a complicated season.\nFor people who normally call the IRS during tax season with questions, only about half of those calls are estimated to go through.\nThere are steps you should be taking right now so you\u2019re prepared for the quickly approaching tax season.\nEven though Massachusetts was at the forefront of health care reform, the national changes could still impact people in our state.\n\u201cYour tax return is going to be more complicated bc the federal government has additional forms bc of Obamacare that you\u2019re going to have to pay attention to,\u201d said Maagero."}
