Elijah Cummings, D-Md., couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He told Gruber he had just handed the Republicans \u201ca public relations gift.\u201d\n\nI was shocked when Cummings said that, because he was more concerned about the production of a Democratic nightmare than he was about getting at the truth of what Gruber had said. That is politics at its very lowest!\n\nSo what did the Democrats do to take the people\u2019s mind off this PR nightmare? (I can just see the White House and leading Democrats desperately trying to come up with something to distract the American people. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall as the panicked Democrats tried to find a solution!)\n\nVoila! Let\u2019s release the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report about how the CIA misled Congress and was illegally torturing detainees in the war on terror on the very same day as Gruber\u2019s congressional grilling!\n\nFor those who are living on a political island, it\u2019s called wag the dog, a strategy in which a leader diverts negative attention away from a politically damaging issue to an issue of allegedly greater significance, which often builds up his character and reputation while tearing down his opponents. The goal is for the attention to the latter to drown out the negative press of the former event.\n\nThe classic example happened in 1997, when Tinseltown produced a movie by the same name, \u201cWag the Dog, ( tiny.cc/dywyqx ) \u201d about an American president who started a war in the Balkans to distract people from his sex scandal. A little more than a year after its release, then-President Bill Clinton, while facing a sex scandal, actually entered us in a war in the Balkans.\n\nThere\u2019s no better tail-wagging Washington weasel than the current president himself. Or do you think strokes of deflective luck just keep coming Barack Obama\u2019s way as his administration fumbles and tumbles in its cesspool of ineptness?\n\nYou think the Democrats just happened to release a report shredding the CIA and Bush administration (again) on the same day as Gruber\u2019s garbage testimony?\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure it was a coincidence in December 2009 \u2014 at the very moment when Obamacare\u2019s passing seemed to be in jeopardy in the Senate \u2014 that Obama ordered the mission for the U.S. to attack an alleged al-Qaida camp in Yemen that allegedly caused the deaths of civilians, including women and children. And I\u2019m sure it was just a coincidence a few years into Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 when he was being hit hard from Main Street to Wall Street about the skyrocketing price of oil and the failure of his economic stimulus and policies \u2014 that he unilaterally decided it was a good time to start dropping bombs on Libya. And I\u2019m sure it was just a coincidence that when National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden prompted Obama\u2019s scandal about electronic spying on the private lives of almost every voter in America, the president thrust our attention oversees with his surprise decision to provide weapons, ammunition and air power to the Syrian rebels. And I\u2019m sure it was just a coincidence that when Obama and his Department of Veterans Affairs started to nosedive over the debacle in the veterans hospital, Obama again lured our eyes abroad by deciding to trade five Guantanamo Bay detainees for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. And I\u2019m sure it was just a coincidence that when the select committee formed to investigate what really happened in Benghazi, Libya, Obama and his cronies drew the world\u2019s attention to how much they were concerned for the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls. (All that heartfelt concern, yet then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to declare Boko Haram a terrorist organization.) And I\u2019m sure it was just a coincidence that when the Islamic State group was hacking the heads off Americans in the Middle East, Obama put people\u2019s attention over in Africa, sending 3,000 military personnel to Liberia to help combat Ebola, the Pentagon\u2019s No. 1 priority. (Remember Ebola, the virus the White House initially said would never reach the U.S.?) And I\u2019m sure it is just a coincidence, too, that Obama has utilized the recent riots and protests over police brutality for his political expediency. (He actually prefers to have others create the wag for him!) As the media and nation focus their attention on race baiting, Obama\u2019s executive order about illegal immigration has been pushed out of their minds.\n\nMilwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who would make an exceptional secretary of homeland security, even said about Obama: \u201cHe built this racial divide. It was a wound that had been healing for a number of years \u2014 a number of decades, I should say \u2014 and he reopened it with his divisive politics \u2026 (a) divide-and-conquer strategy (that has been) very destructive for America.\u201d\n\nObama has taken past presidents\u2019 periodic political manipulation to a new level; all we see is his tail. His foreign policy has been built largely upon wagging the dog to get attention off his failed domestic leadership and policies, including Obamacare. That is what started this recent \u201cwag the dog\u201d show. He wanted to divert the American public\u2019s focus from Gruber\u2019s testimony about Obamacare, so now there\u2019s the Senate report about the CIA.\n\nThat is one more reason I believe that Obama deserves an Oscar for his role as \u201cMaster of Deceptive Persuasion\u201d!\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt hit the political nail on the head when he said decades ago: \u201cIn politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.\u201d\n\nAbout:\n\nAction hero and Second Amendment activist, Chuck Norris is one of the most enduringly popular actors in the world.
