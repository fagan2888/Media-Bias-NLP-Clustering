They\u2019re waiting to have Connor Franta, an affable 22-year-old Internet personality best known for delivering diary-like monologues on YouTube, sign a copy of his new memoir.\n\nThe irony of a YouTube star drawing a massive crowd at a bookstore isn\u2019t lost on talent manager Andrew Graham.\n\n\u201cA year ago, I went to New York and tried to get a book publisher to take a meeting with me,\u201d said Graham, who represents Franta and other mega-popular YouTubers. \u201cI had one meeting, and they laughed at me. Here we are a year later at Barnes & Noble in Los Angeles with a New York Times best-selling author who is a client. I think that says it all. It\u2019s a 180-degree turn.\u201d\n\nFranta isn\u2019t a singer, chef, comedian or athlete. He\u2019s a YouTube star angling to be the Oprah Winfrey for millennials.\n\nIn its 10-years of existence, YouTube has evolved from a playground for kitty videos to a $20 billion visual menagerie. Along the way, it\u2019s also become an incubator for a new type of celebrity \u2014 a digital Brat Pack that\u2019s leveraging smartphone stardom to write books, drop albums, design products and break into Hollywood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful marketing platform in the world for millennials,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to reach that audience of girls gathered downstairs, YouTube is the venue to do that. Look at an artist like Fred (Lucas Cruikshank). He went off to Hollywood, created some films, neglected his channel, came back to YouTube and \u2026 crickets. No one was there anymore. You can\u2019t abandon it.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, YouTube, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, has propped up YouTubers like Franta \u2014 \u201ccreators,\u201d the site calls them \u2014 who attract millions of subscribers that regularly watch their online videos and the advertising attached to them.\n\nTheir popularity is still eclipsed by music videos, which continue to account for YouTube\u2019s most watched clips. Yet the fandom that creators are inspiring, and the ad revenue they\u2019re bringing in, can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nWith his playful grin and doe eyes, Franta currently boasts more than 4.4 million devotees to his personal YouTube channel, where he speaks to viewers about life, dating, candy, whatever at least once a week. He began posting videos in 2010 while still attending high school in La Crescent, Minnesota. Now, he\u2019s releasing music compilations and a line of locally grown coffee.\n\nFor every Justin Bieber or Psy, perhaps YouTube\u2019s biggest success stories, there are dozens of Frantas. It\u2019s a form of celebrity that didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago, when YouTube was born and made it simple to post video online. Franta, who continues to upload videos despite his other endeavors, is young enough to have been inspired by the YouTube vloggers that came before him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "title": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "title": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/after_a_decade_online_youtube_is_redefining_celebrity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/youtube-anniversary-the-stars.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "title": "After a decade online, YouTube is redefining celebrity", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/youtube-anniversary-the-stars.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Derrik J.
