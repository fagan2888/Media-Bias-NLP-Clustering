Both are part of Trinity Health.\n\n[Also: Aetna buys Humana]\n\nMembers who see providers that are part of the ACO will pay lower out-of-pocket costs, according to Aetna.\n\nThe two health systems will deliver care under a value-based, patient-centric model designed to offer more coordinated care, an enhanced patient experience and better healthcare outcomes.\n\nThirty percent of Aetna claims payments are going to doctors and providers who practice value-based care. Aetna has committed to increasing that number to 75 percent by 2020, it said.\n\nAetna, which plans to buy Humana for $34 billion, provides health benefits to more than 1.6 million people in Pennsylvania.\n\nEarlier this year, Aetna, St. Mary Medical Center and Nazareth Hospital signed a separate agreement that established the hospitals as Tier 1 providers under Aetna's Savings Plus network. Mercy Fitzgerald, Mercy Philadelphia and Mercy Suburban hospitals also are included as Tier 1 providers under a previous agreement.\n\n\"For too long, the system has paid for care based on volume, rather than on the value the care brings,\" said Laurie Brubaker, president of Aetna's Pennsylvania operations.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/aetna-forms-aco-mercy-health-system-st-mary-medical-center-pennsylvania", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Aetna-HQ-Hartford-wikipedia-featured_0.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Aetna has signed accountable care organization agreements with systems affiliated with Trinity Health, the benefits company announced Tuesday.", "title": "Aetna forms ACO with Mercy Health System, St. Mary Medical Center in Pennsylvania"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Aetna-HQ-Hartford-wikipedia-featured_0.png"}, "description": "Aetna has signed accountable care organization agreements with systems affiliated with Trinity Health, the benefits company announced Tuesday.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Aetna forms ACO with Mercy Health System, St. Mary Medical Center in Pennsylvania"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Aetna has signed accountable care organization agreements with systems affiliated with Trinity Health, the benefits company announced Tuesday.&#13; The ACO affiliation with Mercy Accountable Care and Quality Health Alliance will serve commercial customers in southeastern Pennsylvania.&#13; Mercy is part of the Mercy Health System and Quality Health Alliance is part of St. Mary Medical Center.
