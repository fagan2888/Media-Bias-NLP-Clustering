Dianne Feinstein, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, released the executive summary of a report detailing CIA agents\u2019 shocking abuses of terrorist detainees. But it\u2019s still making headlines, and probably will for the near future.\n\n[READ: Why Iran Loves the CIA Torture Report]\n\nWhich brings us to today\u2019s Long Read, another mash-up of sorts, explaining the how - and why - of the the debate over torture and whether the U.S. can continue maintaining its moral authority. We open with some video of former Vice President Dick Cheney and his remarkable appearance Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Cheney would mount a full defense of a policy most people believe he\u2019s responsible for; after all, he\u2019s defending his legacy as vice president. Rare is the politician that wouldn\u2019t at least try to rationalize a major decision that was later proven wrong.\n\nWhat IS surprising is that Cheney doesn\u2019t blink when Chuck Todd questions him on the fact that some torture victims did nothing other than end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Todd points out that 27 of the men who were tortured were later found to be innocent, and released without so much as an apology for the error.\n\n[ALSO: Cheney: I'd Do It Again]\n\nEnter the New Yorker\u2019s Amy Davidson, who not only critiques Cheney\u2019s appearance, but also links it to CIA director John Brennan\u2019s ambivalence at a press conference last week -- and CIA officers\u2019 pique at not getting praise for eliciting information from terrorist suspects, even if some of them didn\u2019t know anything or made stuff up so the abuse would stop. A sample:\n\nIt would be comforting to dismiss Cheney as a historical oddity, to picture him sitting in the dimly lit room of a motel, changing the pitch of his voice to pretend he wasn\u2019t alone. But he\u2019s got company, and it\u2019s dangerous. The way that many, including the present and former directors of the C.I.A., have responded to the Senate report has been shameless and sordid. (There have been exceptions, as Jane Mayer notes.) They have spent a lot of time complaining that the Agency hasn\u2019t been sufficiently praised. The word \u201ctorture\u201d upsets them.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet President Barack Obama, Davidson writes, hasn\u2019t exactly emerged as a champion for good in this issue. The same president who talked a tiny bit of human-rights smack to the Chinese, and met with Burmese opposition leader Aun San Suu Kyi on his Asia trip a few weeks ago has decided not to bring the CIA to heel once and for all by sacking Brennan:\n\nJohn Brennan works for Barack Obama. As Mayer writes in the magazine this week, the President, when it comes to torture, has preferred avoidance to accountability. Obama looks back in sorrow, and seems to think that everyone else does, too. But if this past week has proved anything, it\u2019s that the legacy of torture is not quite repentance but impunity. This President has told his agents not to torture, and Brennan says he can work with that, while the C.I.A. waits for instructions from the next one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mayer piece Davidson refers to is this one from the New Yorker\u2019s current issue, which examines the White House\u2019s role in bringing the torture report to light but also underscores some new poll numbers in which the public doesn\u2019t seem all that bothered by what the CIA did, and whom they did it to. Mayer writes:\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, whether the report will spur lasting reform. Darius Rejali, a professor of political science at Reed College and an expert on torture regimes, doubts that it will. For one thing, despite {John} McCain\u2019s testimony, torture is becoming just another partisan issue. This wasn\u2019t always the case\u2014it was Ronald Reagan who signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture, in 1988. But polls show both a growing acceptance of the practice and a widening divide along party lines. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a lot like the death penalty,\u201d Rejali said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pew poll released yesterday backs that up. According to the poll, roughly 51 percent believe the CIA abuse of detainees was justified, compared with just 29 percent who don\u2019t - and 20 percent who don\u2019t have an opinion on the issue. The divide is even sharper when political affiliation is factored in: a whopping 76 percent of Republicans say that torture was justified, while Democrats were split, 37 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed.\n\nCourtesy of Pew Research Center\n\nEven more fascinating - or troubling, depending on your perspective - is the fact that the public was almost evenly split over whether to release the report. Forty-three percent thought it was a good idea, while 42 percent thought it would do more harm than good.\n\nKeep that in mind, however, while reading the final segment of the Long Read: a report by The Daily Beast\u2019s Noah Schachtman which suggests we ought to brace ourselves for photos of detainee and prisoner abuse that could be released as early as Friday. That\u2019s when a federal judge is set to rule on an American Civil Liberties Lawsuit that could release dozens of shocking images of abuse that make the ones from Abu Ghraib look like a child\u2019s tea party:\n\nSome photos show American troops posing with corpses; others depict U.S. forces holding guns to people\u2019s heads or simulating forced sodomization. All of them could be released to the public, depending on how a federal judge in New York rules\u2014and how hard the government fights to appeal. The government has a Friday deadline to submit to that judge its evidence for why it thinks each individual photograph should continue to be kept hidden away.\n\nThe photographs are part of a collection of thousands of images from 203 investigations into detainee abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan and represent one of the last known secret troves of evidence of detainee abuse. While the photos show disturbing images from the Bush administration\u2019s watch, it is the Obama administration that has allowed them to remain buried\u2014all with the help of a willing Congress.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Long Read: The Partisan Divide Over Torture", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Former vice president Dick Cheney rises to defend the enhanced interrogations, while Barack Obama shows no sign of ditching his CIA chief.", "title": "Long Read: The Partisan Divide Over Torture", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/12/15/long-read-the-partisan-divide-over-torture", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/cf/31/9cc0b88441b9b6b23c3d247f3c0b/141215-cheney-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Former vice president Dick Cheney rises to defend the enhanced interrogations, while Barack Obama shows no sign of ditching his CIA chief.", "card": "summary", "title": "Long Read: The Partisan Divide Over Torture"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
