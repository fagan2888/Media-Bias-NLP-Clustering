Close followers of the controversy surrounding the IRS\u2019s improper scrutiny of tea party groups certainly do. But you might not know about Merrick Garland\u2019s role in the case.\n\nGarland, President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick, took the IRS to task and ruled for the conservative pro-Israel group in what our Toby Eckert called \u201cthe most notable tax case\u201d Garland saw during his tenure at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The appeals court found last year that Z Street could proceed with a suit asserting that its tax-exempt application received more scrutiny and faced delays because the group didn\u2019t agree with the Obama administration about Israel, in what conservative activists called an opening act to the IRS\u2019s tea party controversy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor his part, Garland spared no scorn with the IRS\u2019s argument that it had a 270-day cushion protecting it from the suit. \"You don't really mean that, right? Because the next couple words would be the IRS is free to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, religion, race [for 270 days]. You don't actually think that?\" Garland said, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"Imagine the IRS announces today a policy that says as follows: No application by a Jewish group or an African-American group will be considered until one day short of the period under the statute.\" More here: http://politico.pro/1nOQAq.\n\nWELCOME TO THURSDAY, where your Morning Tax author remains grateful to no longer live in the Adams Morgan section of D.C. on St. Patrick\u2019s Day.

Among them: cutting Great Britain\u2019s corporate tax rate from 20 percent to 17 percent, which would be the lowest rate in the Group of 20 nations, and the capital gains rate on assets sales from 18 percent to 10 percent. And how to pay for that? How about a new tax on sugary drinks, and a further crackdown on corporate tax avoidance. The new proposals came as Osborne \u201cpresented lower growth forecasts for the U.K. economy, reflecting a darkening global outlook and a gloomier prognosis for British productivity, which has fallen sharply behind that of other major economies.\u201d More from the WSJ: http://on.wsj.com/1pL9D6Q\n\nHere\u2019s more from our colleagues at POLITICO Europe on the soda tax, to be launched in two years and expected to raise around $740 million in its first year. http://politi.co/1QXUoAr\n\nAnd have you heard how dropping oil prices are causing problems for policymakers all around the world? The U.K. will scrap a tax on petroleum revenues in an effort to boost struggling North Sea producers. http://politico.pro/1MoAZ7H\n\nDON\u2019T STOP BELIEVING: More than two dozen business groups \u2014 including usual suspects like the International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Retail Federation and the Retail Industry Leaders Association \u2014 sent a new letter to House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte this week urging action on online sales tax legislation. Read between the lines \u2014 like \u201cwe have appreciated numerous meetings with you\u201d \u2014 and you can almost hear the frustration the groups have with a chairman who has shown only the most perfunctory interest in the issue. But the groups also make their case that, with states taking matters into their own hands in the face of federal inaction, the time is now for Congress to act: \u201cThe lack of movement from Congress on the issue of remote sales tax collection has left states, local governments and our merchants with no choice but to seek disjointed and confusing remedies through individual state activity.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Z2KXCX\n\nCRUNCH TIME FOR THE FAA: Senators have gone public with their opposition to the House\u2019s stopgap extension of the FAA, which would extend aviation policy for just a few months but extend for a full year the taxes that fund it. Pro Transportation\u2019s Heather Caygle reports that with a March 31 deadline looming, the Senate might tweak the House-passed extension to have both the FAA policy and taxes run through July 15. And in true Capitol Hill fashion, the Senate might do that today \u2014 their last workday before a two-week Easter break that would push into April.\n\nThat means the House might not have a choice but to accept the Senate position, which would potentially keep another revenue measure in play for 2016. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady has made it clear that he won\u2019t deal with any of the tax extenders this year, but advocates for some temporary provisions \u2014 for renewable energy, for instance \u2014 probably wouldn\u2019t mind if the FAA bill was kept around as a potential vehicle. But don\u2019t take it from us \u2014 take it from Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, via Heather: \u201cThere\u2019s others who want to attach some sort of revenue provision to this because they see it as the only train leaving town,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s other people who have some energy provisions and blah-be-blah-be-blah.\u201d\n\nBUDGET GRIDLOCK, CONT\u2019D: The Ways and Means Committee passed a trio of measures aimed at helping to smooth the passage of a budget out of the House, as our Brian Faler reports. The proposal to block undocumented workers from getting the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit, an idea that Democrats and Republicans have been going back and forth about for years, passed after sharp debate, Brian notes. (The other two bills would require people who get insurance subsidies through Obamacare to shoulder more of any overpayments, and kill the Social Services Block Grant.) http://politico.pro/1PcPYBo\n\nAs for that budget those bills are supposed to help pass \u2014 well, Ben Weyl and Matthew Nussbaum report that the House Budget panel passed the measure just as darkness was setting in on Wednesday, certainly earlier than expected. But the votes still aren\u2019t there for the floor. A complicating factor, Matt reports: The new RSC budget calls for top rates of 25 percent, lower capital gains rates, a territorial system, reducing fraud in the Earned Income Tax Credit, exempting workers over the retirement age from the payroll tax and what we\u2019ll call the Ted Cruz approach \u2014 getting rid of the IRS and shifting tax collection \u201cto a new entity at the Treasury Department.\u201d (The IRS is currently housed within the Treasury Department, and accounts for the vast majority of its budget.) http://politico.pro/1Pc6L7E\n\nRUBIO\u2019S TAX LEGACY: Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential candidacy is only recently deceased (suspended, technically). But his tax plan could continue to illustrate the divide between more traditional supply-side Republicans who like big cuts in tax rates and the so-called reform conservatives who want GOP tax policy to be more tailored to average families. The reformicons found a lot to like in Rubio\u2019s plan, with its juiced-up child tax credit. (Maybe not so much the zero percent rate on capital gains.) Yet Rubio faced some skepticism \u2014 like \u201cnormally, it's liberals who like to use the tax code to further social policy\u201d \u2014 from supply-siders during GOP debates in recent months. And while Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation said Rubio\u2019s plan could be \u201ca starting point for reform in the future,\u201d he also had this to say about the proposal\u2019s more robust child credit and the at least $2.4 trillion that Rubio\u2019s plan would lose over a decade: \u201cThis provision alone would reduce federal revenues by about $2 trillion over a decade, without contributing to economic output in any meaningful way.\u201d\n\nSAYING NO TO A TRANSACTIONS TAX: The Investment Company Institute is out with a new letter trying to warn House Democrats against proposing a financial transactions tax in their budget alternative. \u201cQuite frankly, an FTT is a terrible idea,\u201d wrote ICI\u2019s Paul Schott Stevens. \u201cIt would harm all investors, especially middle-income American workers saving for retirement.\u201d Perhaps even more prominently, Sen. Bernie Sanders has also pushed for a transactions tax in his bid for the Democratic nomination. http://bit.ly/1pvdp4D\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014\n\nEU WANTS MORE: The European Commission said Wednesday it still needs some more information on Apple\u2019s tax arrangements with Ireland, Reuters reports. \"Ireland did not reply in full to the Commission's last request for information, which is why the Commission has sent a reminder to Ireland to request the missing data,\" an EC spokesman said in a statement. http://reut.rs/1LrArD0\n\nSTATE NEWS \u2014\n\nJUNEAU AS WASHINGTON: Alaska officials are having a debate that will sound familiar to those of us in the nation\u2019s capital. Gov. Bill Walker\u2019s proposals would rely on taxes to balance the budget, but Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee aren\u2019t having it. \u201cI\u2019m not getting into the tax business while I know government is still too big. How do I know? Because we cut a whole bunch of fat off of it and nothing happened,\u201d said Sen. Pete Kelly of Fairbanks, a co-chair of the committee.
