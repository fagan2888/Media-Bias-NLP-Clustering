If you complain of shortness of breath, your phone\u2019s heart rate monitor will instantly report how well your heart has functioned over the last month. Those readings then could be aggregated with others in your community, revealing hidden trends. As your doctor thinks about the best treatment for you, big-data analysis will help her assess how various options have worked for others with similar histories and body chemistry.\n\nThis is the promise of big data in healthcare. And, it\u2019s not just while you\u2019re at the doctor. Medical research and findings are now being combined into massive searchable databases, making it easier to assess and compare results. Databases can absorb terabytes worth of disparate data, including things like the weather. This will make it clearer whether it\u2019s the drug \u2014 or something extraneous like humidity \u2014 that\u2019s making people feel better.\n\nBut all this is in its infancy, with the sector moving slowly and cautiously. The Affordable Care Act now mandates that doctors switch to electronic health records when they treat Medicare patients. So far, they\u2019re not especially sophisticated.\n\n\u201cElectronic health records right now are only collecting about 100 megabytes of data per patient, per year,\u201d says Dale Sanders, senior vice president of strategy at Health Catalyst, an analytics firm. \u201cMost patients, if they knew how poorly informed healthcare was from a data perspective, would be really disappointed.\u201d\n\nHealth Catalyst is one of a number of companies \u2014 big and small \u2014 working to change that, seeing the immense potential to both improve care and save money. US healthcare industry expenditures are approaching $3 trillion annually. The McKinsey Global Institute estimated in 2013 that deploying big data could create $100 billion in value every year across the healthcare industry.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, a major hospital system teamed up in March with the city\u2019s biggest universities to advance big-data analytics in healthcare. As part of a consortium, Carnegie Mellon University is working on artificial intelligence that draws on databases of studies and health records.\n\nAndrew Moore, Dean of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s School of Computer Science, imagines a day when his phone gives his doctor a more accurate report on his health than he can himself.\n\n\u201cIf he or she asks me, \u2018have you been getting out of breath much lately?\u2019 and I say, \u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 at that point I would like my cell phone to chime in and say, \u2018yes, you have, actually, Andrew,'\u201d he says. \u201cThat would be awesome for me and the physician.\u201d\n\nInsights from By making real-time communication between machines possible, the Industrial Internet is an important part of improving the patient experience. For example, the Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Florida has employed Industrial Internet solutions to cut emergency room wait times by 68% in just nine months. See how GE Software is changing the future of healthcare \u00bb\n\nMoore expects the systems to be able to trace hospital-borne infections back to a specific piece of equipment or patient. Or, some might make it possible to diagnose a rash with a smartphone photo.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Health Alliance plans to spend $10-$20 million a year on its big-data collaboration. Carnegie Mellon joins with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh on the project, and UPMC already takes in info from 200 sources.\n\nAnd big data has the potential to become big business. In 2013, investors put nearly $200 million into analytics and big-data startups, according to research firm Gartner. There have been similar size investments in digital medical devices and personalized medicine. The government is investing millions in analyzing medical databases, too. That\u2019s not to mention health-tracking research and products from the likes of Apple, Google, and FitBit.\n\n\u201cHospital systems realize that healthcare is becoming more and more an information technology business,\u201d Moore says.\n\nFor all the excitement over big data\u2019s potential for personalized medicine and better public health, it\u2019s not without obstacles and risks. Moore worries about security, knowing that any breach of privacy will threaten public acceptance of the whole industry.\n\nSanders of Health Catalyst thinks the real promise of big data is improving the basics of healthcare. \u201cWe keep attaching big data to these moonshot kinds of expectations,\u201d he says. To Sanders, big data isn\u2019t a revolution. It\u2019s a way to improve the fundamentals of care, like reducing hospital-borne infections.\n\n\u201cReducing variability in care and reducing overtreatment of patients is probably the most important place for any organization in healthcare to start,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest challenge for big data is culture. Doctors and hospitals tend to be understandably cautious and skeptical about adopting new technology, waiting for it to be sufficiently proven safe and effective. But as analytics improve, and the pressure to bring down the cost of healthcare builds, most agree big data will become a big deal in medicine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Dan Bobkoff", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The big data revolution in medicine.", "title": "Going to the doctor will be very different in the not-so-distant future", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-and-healthcare-2015-7", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/559c06e56bb3f7a571fc8f85-506-253/going-to-the-doctor-will-be-very-different-in-the-not-so-distant-future.jpg", "site": "sai", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "sai,industry-iq,science", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Industry IQ, Big Data, Health Care, Dan Bobkoff", "description": "The big data revolution in medicine.", "author": "Dan Bobkoff", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-07", "sailthru.title": "Going to the doctor will be very different in the not-so-distant future", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/559c06daeab8ea576009635d-50-50/going-to-the-doctor-will-be-very-different-in-the-not-so-distant-future.jpg", "news_keywords": "Industry IQ, Big Data, Health Care, Dan Bobkoff", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/559c06daeab8ea576009635d/going-to-the-doctor-will-be-very-different-in-the-not-so-distant-future.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-07-07", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/dan-bobkoff"}, "sailthru.description": "The big data revolution in medicine.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The big data revolution in medicine.", "title": "Going to the doctor will be very different in the not-so-distant future", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-and-healthcare-2015-7", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/559c06e56bb3f7a571fc8f85-1190-625/going-to-the-doctor-will-be-very-different-in-the-not-so-distant-future.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Going to the doctor will be very different in the not-so-distant future", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/559c06daeab8ea576009635d/going-to-the-doctor-will-be-very-different-in-the-not-so-distant-future.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "sai"}, "article_summary": "But as analytics improve, and the pressure to bring down the cost of healthcare builds, most agree big data will become a big deal in medicine.\nAnd big data has the potential to become big business.\nThis is the promise of big data in healthcare.\nThe McKinsey Global Institute estimated in 2013 that deploying big data could create $100 billion in value every year across the healthcare industry.\nSanders of Health Catalyst thinks the real promise of big data is improving the basics of healthcare."}
