One quickly helped him trade his midrange silver plan for a more economical bronze plan.\n\n\"If people knew how simple it was,\" he said before leaving, \"they would all be here.\"\n\nOther consumers were equally as satisfied.\n\n\"It wasn't bad at all,\" said Petal Pennycooke, 55, a full-time psychology student who enrolled in coverage for herself and her teenage daughter during a break between classes.\n\nThe orderly, efficient scene at USF \u2014 on the second day of the annual open enrollment period \u2014 was a far cry from the inaugural open enrollment in 2013, when computer glitches kept thousands of consumers from purchasing plans.\n\nThis time, there were no technical problems. College students and members of the public streamed in for meetings with navigators well into the afternoon. Most left with coverage.\n\n\"The system is running nicely,\" said Xonjenese Jacobs, a navigator who helped with the kickoff event at USF. \"We were able to get someone enrolled within 15 minutes.\"\n\nStill, the navigators face a herculean task over the next three months. In addition to helping existing consumers like Calwhite shop around, they're hoping to enroll an estimated 825,000 uninsured Floridians eligible for financial assistance, but who have yet to sign up.\n\n\"We have a lot of opportunity,\" said Melanie Hall, of the nonprofit Family Healthcare Foundation.\n\nLast year, more than 1.3 million Floridians signed up for individual insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. About 90 percent received tax credits to help offset the cost of coverage.\n\nInitiatives like Florida Covering Kids & Families, a project of USF and the state's largest recipient of federal funding for navigators, played a significant role in the enrollment effort. The organization and its 11 consortium partners met with more than 200,000 consumers before the close of last year's open-enrollment period, project director Jodi Ray said.\n\nThe Florida marketplace will look a little different in 2016.\n\nThe state Office of Insurance Regulation expects premiums to rise an average of 9.5 percent for consumers across Florida. But federal health officials have said the average cost of the popular \"benchmark plan\" \u2014 the second lowest-cost silver plan \u2014 will drop by 2.4 percent for consumers in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nOne thing is certain to increase: the penalty for not having coverage.\n\nAdults who choose to go without health insurance coverage will now be charged $695 or 2.5 percent of their household income \u2014 whichever amount is higher.\n\nEfforts to boost enrollment for 2016 are under way. Some are focusing on the so-called \"young invincibles\" \u2014 healthy adults under age 35 who don't see the need for health insurance. Others are specific to the black and Hispanic communities.\n\nCommunity leaders are rallying behind the cause. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn attended the event at USF and pledged to put \"the full weight\" of his office behind open enrollment.\n\n\"This is a program that makes a difference in the lives of people in this community in very real and tangible ways,\" he said.\n\nRay said she believed the 2016 open enrollment would be successful, especially in light of its smooth start Sunday and Monday.\n\n\"I have no doubt we will once again exceed enrollment projections,\" she said.\n\nContact Kathleen McGrory at kmcgrory@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8330.
