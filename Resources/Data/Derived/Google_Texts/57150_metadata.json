Or is it an elaborate marketing campaign for our ambitious metropolis masquerading as a hemispheric festival of art and ideas?\n\nAs the event enters its third incarnation, with parties, exhibits and high-powered panels kicking off Tuesday, it is shaping up as a little bit of both, though neither one in particular.\n\nIn fact, the event\u2019s biggest boosters, with Gov. John Hickenlooper leading the pack, are claiming success on both fronts. This biennial is a multi-tasker, a good fit for the age we live in.\n\n\u201cOne of the intentions of the biennial was to have people in Denver and Colorado think about their community in different ways, to be more global, more sophisticated,\u201d said Hickenlooper, who did all he could while mayor of Denver to support the nonprofit event\u2019s start in 2010.\n\nBut if business people make connections during the course of meetings, or if artists land work or universities recruit foreign students, well, that\u2019s just the way of the world. And it\u2019s the real power behind the kind of global confab the biennial aspires to be, modeling its various parts after the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Venice Biennale or the Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re all at the same conference, there\u2019s an understanding that you\u2019ll take meetings with everybody you can,\u201d said Hickenlooper. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of networking going on that pays for the ideas and the culture.\u201d\n\nThat thinking keeps the biennial on a mission to be all things to all people.\n\nIt specializes in art, setting up world-class exhibits in Denver\u2019s best galleries. But it also specializes in politics and commerce, with flashy panels at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House, moderated by celebrities like Tina Brown and featuring assorted global go-getters, like former Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek and Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nThere\u2019s also a behind-the scenes emphasis on social issues. The biennial hosts a series of day-long \u201cclinicas,\u201d not open to the public, where on-the-ground leaders in education, technology, health and economics chat amongst themselves on international issues.\n\nThe variety gives the biennial substance \u2014 the quality is high, the subjects serious \u2014 but it can be its worst enemy as well. Organizers acknowledge the event still suffers from an identity crisis. Five years in, too many people still ask, \u201cWhat is the biennial?\u201d\n\nThat makes it a tough sell, despite its good offerings, and this go-round might be particularly challenging.\n\nTwo years ago, the biennial included large-scale artworks downtown. There was a giant wooden tower on Speer Boulevard, for example, and an artist-made \u201chotel room\u201d on a large crane in a parking lot on 14th Street. You couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\nThis year, the events are more subtle and largely indoors, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the McNichols Building in Civic Center, a Biennial Pavilion set up in a new office building in LoDo. People will have to come to the biennial instead of it coming to them.\n\nThe event has upped its marketing and social media, and it has worked hard to make a name for itself. Slowly, it\u2019s making headway. \u201cFolks are starting to understand how everyone can benefit from this,\u201d said biennial CEO Erin Trapp.\n\nShe points to growth in both programming and sponsorship. This year\u2019s budget is $3.5 million, about a third more than the organization reported spending in 2013.\n\nOther local organizations are getting with the effort. The Denver Art Museum, Clyfford Still Museum and Newman Center for the Arts are doing coordinated programming. The Bonfils-Stanton Foundation, an important funder of local culture, stepped in with a $125,000 grant for the art program.\n\nMore significantly, the biennial is drawing international backing for the first time, a marker, Trapp says, of its growing reputation. Among the 2015 sponsors is Brazilian mega-bank Itau.\n\n\u201cWe have the largest commercial bank in Brazil as a sponsor,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are paying attention.\u201d\n\nStill, the biennial is keeping its options open. It wants to draw big crowds this week, but doesn\u2019t want to be thought of just as a party for intellectuals or a Colorado pep rally.\n\nUnlike other cultural gatherings. like the Whitney Biennial in New York or the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., this event was originally powered by bureaucrats and not artists, and there\u2019s interest in working all the angles.\n\nLast summer, the Biennial of the Americas led a mission from Denver to Mexico City that was as much about touring cultural sites as it was about helping Colorado businesses get a piece of the action as Mexico\u2019s government works to privatize government-run industries.\n\nNext year, there\u2019s talk of a similar trip to Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d said Trapp.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Biennial of the Americas: Art, parties, big ideas \u2013 and some business deals, too", "title": "Biennial of the Americas: Art, parties, big ideas \u2013 and some business deals, too", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/09/biennial-of-the-americas-art-parties-big-ideas-and-some-business-deals-too/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150709__20150712_E1_FE12FABIENNIAL1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150709__20150712_E1_FE12FABIENNIAL1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T16:56:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T08:25:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc94b\"", "article_summary": "The Denver Art Museum, Clyfford Still Museum and Newman Center for the Arts are doing coordinated programming.\nOr is it an elaborate marketing campaign for our ambitious metropolis masquerading as a hemispheric festival of art and ideas?\n\u201cIf you\u2019re all at the same conference, there\u2019s an understanding that you\u2019ll take meetings with everybody you can,\u201d said Hickenlooper.\nIs Denver\u2019s Biennial of the Americas a massive, cultural gathering that just happens to shine a bright light on the city?\nThe Bonfils-Stanton Foundation, an important funder of local culture, stepped in with a $125,000 grant for the art program."}
