His body was found Nov. 12 in an alley in Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The couple had recently moved to nearby Selinsgrove from North Carolina.\n\nSEE ALSO: German cop accused of slaying man who wanted to be killed and eaten\n\nAccording to Sunbury police, Elytte Barbour told investigators he hid in the backseat of the couple\u2019s SUV as his wife picked up LaFerrara at a mall Nov. 11. He told police that, on his wife\u2019s signal, he wrapped a cord around LaFerrara\u2019s neck, restraining him while Miranda Barbour stabbed him.\n\nThe 42-year-old Port Trevorton man was stabbed 20 times, police said.\n\nMiranda Barbour was charged Wednesday. She initially denied knowing LaFerrara, but her story evolved as investigators gathered evidence, including the discovery that the last call received by the victim\u2019s cellphone was made from her number, according to a police affidavit.\n\nThe affidavit said Miranda Barbour acknowledged meeting the victim in Selinsgrove and driving with him to Sunbury, where they parked. She said LaFerrara groped her and she took a knife from between the front seats and stabbed him after he put his hand around her throat, according to the affidavit.\n\nPolice said Miranda Barbour had told them she purchased cleaning supplies at a department store after stabbing LaFerrara, then picked up her husband and took him to a strip club for his birthday. On Friday, police said, Elytte Barbour told them he was the one who had purchased the cleaning products, an account investigators said was backed up by surveillance footage.\n\nFollowing his wife\u2019s arrest, Elytte Barbour told The Daily Item of Sunbury that Miranda Barbour, whom he married Oct. 22, regularly hired herself out as a \u201ccompanion\u201d to men she met on various websites, a business venture he said he supported because it didn\u2019t involve sexual contact.\n\nBarbour said his wife made anywhere from $50 to $850 by meeting with men for such activities as having dinner together or walking around a mall. The ads she placed on websites including Craigslist all said upfront that sex was not part of the deal, he said.\n\n\u201cShe is not a prostitute,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat she does is meet men who have broken marriages or have no one in their lives, and she meets with them and has delightful conversation.\u201d\n\nElytte Barbour didn\u2019t have an attorney at his arraignment Friday night. A phone message left for his wife\u2019s public defender early Saturday was not immediately returned.\n\nSunbury police Chief Steve Mazzeo told The Daily Item that investigators will also be looking into the death of a man with whom Miranda Barbour had a 1-year-old child.
