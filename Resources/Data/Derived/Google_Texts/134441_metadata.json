Then he spilled the secret. \u201cThere are no secrets these days, anyway.\u201d\n\nYohan Flande, the Rockies\u2019 28-year-old rookie lefty with an 0-5 record and a 5.04 ERA, will move back into Colorado\u2019s starting rotation to finish off the 2014 season. He will start Thursday against the Dodgers at Coors Field.\n\nThe Rockies, finishing out a losing 2014, will begin their search for 2015 starters early. They\u2019ve used 15 starters this season \u2014 Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s 30 games leads them all, with Morales second at 22.\n\n\u201cFlande will get a couple starts before it\u2019s all over,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nFlande was called up on June 25 to replace the injured Christian Bergman, who replaced the injured Jordan Lyles. Now all three will reunite in the Rockies rotation.\n\nThe Rockies dropped Flande back to Triple-A Colorado Springs in August, then called him back as a reliever. In five appearances out of the bullpen, he allowed two hits and no runs in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nBut Colorado wants another look at Flande as a starter, where he had a 5.52 ERA over nine games.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t given up on him as a starter,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe feel like he can transition easily to the bullpen. When we put him in the bullpen, he was very effective. He\u2019s a strike-thrower, very effective against lefties, keeps the ball down in the zone.\u201d\n\nMorales similarly skipped back and forth between the bullpen and a starting spot. He\u2019s 5-8 with a 5.46 ERA in 22 starts this season. He has a 4.50 ERA in 11 relief appearances.\n\nBut the Rockies know what they have in Morales. So instead, they\u2019ll use their remaining time this season to test-drive Flande for 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just matter of getting another look before we wrap it up,\u201d Weiss said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Christian Bergman,Franklin Morales,Jordan Lyles,Yohan Flande", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Yohan Flande, the Rockies' 28-year-old rookie lefty with an 0-5 record and a 5.04 ERA, will move back into Colorado's starting rotation to finish off 2014.", "title": "Yohan Flande back to Rockies pitching rotation for 2015 tryout", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/09/15/yohan-flande-moves-back-rockies-pitching-rotation-2015-tryout/18637/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/yohan-flande.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Yohan Flande, the Rockies' 28-year-old rookie lefty with an 0-5 record and a 5.04 ERA, will move back into Colorado's starting rotation to finish off 2014.", "title": "Yohan Flande moves back in Rockies pitching rotation for 2015 tryout", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/09/15/yohan-flande-moves-back-rockies-pitching-rotation-2015-tryout/18637/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/yohan-flande.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Yohan Flande, the Rockies' 28-year-old rookie lefty with an 0-5 record and a 5.04 ERA, will move back into Colorado's starting rotation to finish off 2014."}, "article_summary": "Walt Weiss played coy to start, saying only that he moved Franklin Morales to the Rockies\u2019 bullpen.\nThe Rockies dropped Flande back to Triple-A Colorado Springs in August, then called him back as a reliever.\nSo instead, they\u2019ll use their remaining time this season to test-drive Flande for 2015.\nThe Rockies, finishing out a losing 2014, will begin their search for 2015 starters early.\nThey\u2019ve used 15 starters this season \u2014 Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s 30 games leads them all, with Morales second at 22."}
