Britton, SD

A grain bin in Britton, SD collapsed this afternoon. No one was injured.

According to an official with the facility, they first noticed the bin leaking and began to take pictures. Then another leak was discovered. They began taking video of the bin as soon as they noticed the second leak. Thatâ€™s when the bin collapsed.

General Manager of Wheaton Dumont CO-OP Phillip Deal says the bin was relatively old and the top bin failed and opened like a zipper. The bin was filled with spring wheat.

Officials will be at the scene on Monday to get a better look at the damage.
