The Adams County Sheriff’s Office is searching for a 20-year-old man charged with kidnapping, stalking, theft and domestic violence who reportedly removed the ankle monitor he was wearing while awaiting trial.

Manuel David Hernandez’s ankle monitor was found Saturday morning in Thornton. Authorities first received a notification that Hernandez had tampered with the strap of the bracelet Friday evening.

The Adams County Sheriff’s Office news release says Hernandez threatened a victim of his alleged crimes Friday night.

He is described as a Hispanic man who is around 5’9″ tall and 150 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone with information about Hernandez is asked to contact local law enforcement.
