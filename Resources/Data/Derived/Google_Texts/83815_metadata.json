Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, Scott Garrett, R-N.J., Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., and Sean Duffy, R-Wis., is that Operation Choke Point \u201chas caused small businesses, financial institutions and the American people to lose confidence in our nation\u2019s banking regulators.\u201d\n\n>>> Read the full letter below.\n\nThe program has since been criticized for being used to target a number of legal, but politically unpopular industries like gun sellers, ammunition manufactures and payday lenders.\n\n\n\nThe Daily Signal has reported on a number of small business owners who believe their bank accounts and other financial services were shut down as a result of the Justice Department\u2019s self-titled program.\n\nSince the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which examines and supervises more than 4,500 banks, came under fire for its alleged involvement in Operation Choke Point and was forced to change its regulatory policies, some Republicans believe that other Obama administration agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have stepped up their role in implementing Operation Choke Point.\n\n>>> Read More: FDIC Changes Tactics in Response to Operation Choke Point\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal last week, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said he is \u201cfearful\u201d that Operation Choke Point is now moving beyond just the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201c[W]e request that you publicly disclaim your agency\u2019s past, present, and future involvement in Operation Choke Point,\u201d -@FinancialCmte.\n\nOperation Choke Point was launched by the Justice Department in 2013 as a way to fight consumer fraud by discouraging banks from doing business with industries that regulators considered \u201chigh risk.\u201d\n\nRichard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testified in front of Congress during a March 6 hearing that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of Operation Choke Point \u201cuntil it burst into public view,\u201d suggesting that his agency is not involved in the initiative.\n\nBut critics say Operation Choke Point-like tactics were used by the bureau as recently as March 26 in a lawsuit that was filed against more than a dozen debt collectors faulted for enabling third-party payment processors to commit fraud.\n\nIn addition to calling on regulatory agencies to publicly disavow their involvement in the program \u201cor any similar operation,\u201d Republicans also requested in their letters that the banking agencies implement a series of new policies that would ensure that customers\u2019 bank accounts are not closed for political reasons.\n\nThese are the same guidelines that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed upon after facing backlash by Luetkemeyer, who has introduced federal legislation to end Operation Choke Point.\n\n>>> Read More: Congressman Reintroduces Bill to End Operation Choke Point\n\n\u201cYour proactive efforts to require your staff to follow similar guidelines as those issued by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] would help demonstrate to Congress, the public and the financial institutions that you regulate\u201d that agencies take seriously \u201cthe need for transparency and fairness in examinations,\u201d the congressmen said.\n\n>>> Republicans to Government Agency: Why Has No One Been Fired Over Choke Point?\n\nIn the wake of reports last week from Florida that gun sellers are still being choked from their bank accounts, the Financial Services Committee said it would continue its investigations into the controversial program.\n\nMembers gave the heads of the Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration until April 15 to issue a response to their timetable in complying with their requests.\n\nThe Justice Department has not responded to The Daily Signal\u2019s recent press inquiries regarding the impacts of their program, Operation Choke Point.\n\nCommittee Leaders Call on Federal Agencies to Disavow Operation Choke Point", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans on Wednesday formally demanded that five federal financial
