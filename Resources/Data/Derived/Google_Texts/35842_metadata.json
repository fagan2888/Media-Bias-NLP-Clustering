Analysts had expected ENI per share to drop to 37 cents in the quarter from $1.37 a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nENI is a key earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms that accounts for unrealized gains or losses in investments, also known as the mark-to-market value.\n\nBlackstone shares were last down 4 percent at $28.25.\n\nTough market conditions meant Blackstone was not able to sell some investments for a handsome profit and as a result, had much less cash to return to investors.\n\nDistributable earnings, which show the cash that Blackstone has to pay as dividends, dropped 69 percent to 33 cents compared with a year ago.\n\nBut Michael Chae, chief financial officer at Blackstone, said despite the soft start to the year, there was a chance that 2016 may be a \"significant year\" for Blackstone to buy assets from or issue loans to troubled firms at bargain prices.\n\nTo that end, he said Blackstone is raising its third mezzanine fund that could be $6 billion in size.\n\nWe \"see a moment of opportunity\", Chae said.\n\nThe report showed all of Blackstone's main businesses had cashed in on fewer investments. The asset manager's highly profitable real estate arm sold $3.5 billion worth of holdings between January and March, less than half of the $9.1 billion worth of investments sold in the same period a year ago.\n\nSpooked by tumbling oil prices and scuppered financing for a handful of takeovers late last year, the high-yield bond and loan market has slowed since November and has yet to fully recover.\n\nBut even in a challenging market, investors handed Blackstone more cash to manage. Assets under management grew 11 percent to a record $343.7 billion, ranking the firm comfortably as the world's largest alternative asset manager.\n\n(Reporting by Koh Gui Qing; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Meredith Mazzilli)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The earnings report resonated with a cooldown in private equity dealmaking this year,", "title": "Blackstone eyes bargains after first quarter earnings miss forecast", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Blackstone-earnings-miss-forecast-choppy-markets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mphasis-m-a-blackstone-group_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Blackstone-earnings-miss-forecast-choppy-markets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mphasis-m-a-blackstone-group_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The earnings report resonated with a cooldown in private equity dealmaking this year,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "ENI is a key earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms that accounts for unrealized gains or losses in investments, also known as the mark-to-market value.\nThe earnings report resonated with a cooldown in private equity dealmaking this year, as the market for high-yield bonds and loans, the lifeblood of private equity, struggles to recover after stumbling late last year.\nDistributable earnings, which show the cash that Blackstone has to pay as dividends, dropped 69 percent to 33 cents compared with a year ago.\nThe asset manager's highly profitable real estate arm sold $3.5 billion worth of holdings between January and March, less than half of the $9.1 billion worth of investments sold in the same period a year ago.\nBut even in a challenging market, investors handed Blackstone more cash to manage."}
