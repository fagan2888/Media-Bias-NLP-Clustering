“After probably spending too long early in his term trying to negotiate with Republicans, he’s in the other extreme, where he has no interest in trying to negotiate anything,” Ryan Lizza says of President Obama. Lizza joins fellow staff writer Jeffrey Toobin and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week’s Political Scene podcast to talk about Obama’s new approach to executive power in the face of a hostile Congress. They discuss the negotiations to avoid a Homeland Security shutdown, the use of the Administrative Procedures Act to halt the President’s executive action on immigration, and the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court case challenging the Affordable Care Act, King v. Burwell.

“It’s not a grand Constitutional case, but in terms of the stakes, for actual people’s lives, it may be the most important Supreme Court case of our lifetime,” Toobin says.
