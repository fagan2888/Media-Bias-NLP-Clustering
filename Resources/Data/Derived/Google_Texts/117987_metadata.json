Premiums may go up on the plans and customers may choose to switch instead to a policy on the new insurance marketplace.\n\nLast month, President Barack Obama gave states and insurers the option to renew the plans for one year. The proposal was meant to make good on Obama\u2019s promise that Americans who liked their plans could keep them.\n\nAbout 185,000 Illinoisans have received cancellation notices. Blue Cross has the most customers in Illinois\u2019 individual market. It plans to notify customers and brokers about the options.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
