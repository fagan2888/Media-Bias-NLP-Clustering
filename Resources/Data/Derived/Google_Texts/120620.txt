Two fugitives who fled from parole supervision Thursday were apprehended Saturday by the Colorado Department of Corrections Fugitive Apprehension Unit, according to a news release from the Department of Corrections.

The department took 46-year-old William Wasikowski into custody at 9 a.m. Saturday in Colorado Springs.

Authorities captured 31-year-old Wesley Jones two hours later in Englewood.

Both were arrested on nationwide warrants and may face additional charges.

Police are looking for Dennis Simonton, 36, who escaped parole supervision Wednesday.

“This man should be considered armed and dangerous,” the news release said. “Do not attempt to contact or apprehend this individual.”

The Department of Corrections issued a fugitive alert out of Colorado Springs on Friday for the three men.

Simonton and Jones, who officials believed were traveling together, have been linked with the 211 Crew, a white supremacist prison gang.

Evan Ebel, a parolee who in 2013 shot and killed Tom Clements, then the head of Colorado prisons, also was associated with the 211 Crew.

New details recently emerged in the case of Thomas Guolee, a man once considered a person of interest in Clements’ murder and associated with the gang.

Court documents allege that Guolee tried in December to break into the house of another former corrections official, as the former official’s wife and young children were inside.

El Paso County prosecutors have charged Guolee with 11 felonies, including attempted murder of a peace officer, attempted first-degree burglary, attempted armed burglary and vehicular eluding.

Guolee is expected to appear in court April 6 for a preliminary hearing.

Anyone who sees Simonton is encouraged to call 911.

Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact local law enforcement or the Colorado Department of Corrections Fugitive Apprehension Unit at 1-866-873-6305.
