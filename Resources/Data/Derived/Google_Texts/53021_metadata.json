Medicare covers these hospice services and pays nearly all of their costs: \u2022 Doctor services \u2022 Nursing care \u2022 Medical equipment (such as wheelchairs or walkers) \u2022 Medical supplies (such as bandages and catheters) \u2022 Drugs for symptom control and pain relief \u2022 Short-term care in the hospital, including respite and inpatient for pain and symptom management \u2022 Home health aide and homemaker services \u2022 Physical and occupational therapy \u2022 Speech therapy \u2022 Social work services \u2022 Dietary counseling \u2022 Grief support to help you and your family \u2022 Medicare hospice benefits do not cover the cost of care home or nursing home room and board.\n\nVEGAS INC coverage More business stories\n\nFor years, private hospice providers in the Las Vegas Valley have built a profitable business model around easing terminally ill patients toward a comfortable death.\n\nThe drill seemed simple enough, with noble intent: Set up an office; brand a soothing name; hire or contract doctors, nurses, social workers and religious counselors to visit patients at their homes or care facilities; and get reimbursed by Medicare. The profit would rise or fall depending on the needs of the patients: Those who demanded less attention would offset the cost of serving those who needed a higher level of care.\n\nBut because of the demands of additional federal quality-control reporting requirements and shrinking Medicare reimbursements for patient care and pharmaceuticals, companies that take care of the dying are learning the business isn\u2019t as simple or as financially rewarding as it once was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to run a successful hospice today than it was five years ago, or even one year ago,\u201d said Candis Armour, executive director of Las Vegas Solari Hospice Care. \u201cThe cost of health care is going up and some providers are faced with the challenge of having to provide more care with fewer resources.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, because Las Vegas isn\u2019t lacking for an elderly population approaching death, investors on the hunt for profitable businesses still are attracted to the hospice industry. By some estimates, between 40 and 50 hospice providers \u2014 most of them for-profit organizations \u2014 operate in Southern Nevada.\n\nKaren Rubel, vice president of development for the region\u2019s most prominent nonprofit hospice, the Nathan Adelson Hospice, said more for-profit hospice companies are establishing themselves in Las Vegas each month.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean that there is a need for more hospices, or that the demand has increased,\u201d she said. \u201cThis simply means that more individuals are looking for ways to increase their current business profit margin and feel that hospice is a good business venture.\u201d\n\nBut the business is getting more complicated. Providers are having to grow their back-office operations to comply with new government regulations and accounting demands, all while profits are dipping. Hospice providers normally operate on a 4 percent profit margin but because of the fallout of funding cuts wrought by Washington\u2019s sequestration, that margin is now about half that, said Jon Redulovic, vice president for communications at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\nAmanda Holbein, clinical director of Hospice Del Sol, noted that not all providers claim the same credentialing, member affiliations or accreditation \u2014 which, she said, \u201cworks to the detriment of patients in the community. The choice (of a hospice) becomes overwhelming and/or confusing. It is already an overwhelming experience to face losing a loved one.\u201d\n\nAt minimum, a hospice should be certified by Medicare, which pays the lion\u2019s share of a patient\u2019s bills.\n\nNationwide, as many as 1.6 million patients are receiving hospice care, according to industry estimates, while the number of hospice organizations grew from 5,150 in 2010 to 5,560 in 2012, becoming a $17 billion, mostly for-profit industry. Of that patient tab, an estimated $15 billion is reimbursed to the hospice organizations by Medicare.\n\nMedicare has created specific criteria for hospice eligibility, requiring the patient\u2019s primary care physician to make an assessment, based on disease-specific factors, that the patient likely will die within six months. A person may have terminal cancer or incurable Parkinson\u2019s disease, for instance, and not yet qualify for hospice services.\n\nOne of the industry\u2019s ongoing tasks is to get people to understand what hospice is and what it\u2019s not. Fundamental to hospice is the patient\u2019s decision to forgo further medical efforts, including aggressive treatments, to prolong life in exchange for medical and emotional care \u2014 ranging from pain-reducing morphine to the comforting hand of a prayerful minister \u2014 to promote a peaceful death. Some programs include various sorts of therapy \u2014 physical, music and art, for instance.\n\n\u201cMost people believe hospice is a place where you go to die,\u201d said Maurice Gregory, chief of operations and compliance for Comfort Hospice Care. \u201cThis is not true anymore. Today, hospice is a way in which one can live one\u2019s life free of pain and with the ability to maintain one\u2019s dignity in the remaining days, usually surrounded by loved ones. It relies on palliative rather than curative care. This might be the reason why people are not \u2018dying in six months or less,\u2019 which was the standard set for determining hospice eligibility. Adding some quality to their life has given them the ability to sustain longer.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some patients might begin hospice care and then withdraw from it because their condition has stabilized; others might have their hospice care renewed if, after six months, they are still seen as likely to die within the next six-month period.\n\nThe bureaucracy\n\nHospice providers in Nevada are regulated by the Bureau of Healthcare, Quality and Compliance, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). They are licensed by the state, and CMS certifies the programs offered by hospice facilities.\n\nNevada\u2019s Division of Health Care Financing and Policy works with CMS to assist in providing care to eligible individuals and families with low incomes and limited resources. Both Medicare and Medicaid offer hospice benefits, as do many private insurance companies.\n\nHospice can be a lucrative business, Rubel said, \u201cif you only take on patients with insurance and simply provide the basics of what is required from Medicare.\n\nHospice has been affected by sequestration and other governmental cost-savings strategies. Reimbursement has decreased by 2 percent each year and will continue to decline over the next 10 years. Significantly more restrictive interpretations of regulations governing reimbursement for hospice services are creating urgent need for hospices to reorganize and restructure their operations, and additional patient monitoring and reporting demands by Medicare \u2014 with financial fines for shortcomings \u2014 are adding to the challenges of running a hospice.\n\nHolbein, whose family-owned Hospice Del Sol serves about 35 patients, shrugs it off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little sticky, but in the whole grand scheme of things, it\u2019ll be great to have quality and performance measurements to compare hospices,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea. But when you start something new, people can get a little crazy sometimes.\u201d\n\nRubel also looks at the bright side, saying she and her colleagues are \u201cembracing these changes and looking forward to the positive benefits of the (Affordable Care Act). But we are aware there will be a few growing pains along the way.\u201d\n\nHospice has always been a low-cost option for patients and the government.\n\n\u201cHowever, under the Affordable Care Act, hospices are going to have to learn how to do more with less,\u201d Armour said. \u201cHospices are being hit particularly hard in the area of financial responsibility for pharmaceuticals under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Less financially viable hospices may have to turn patients away because there simply won\u2019t be enough reimbursement funds to cover these costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Business,Featured,The Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "VegasInc.com", "description": "The number of hospice organizations nationwide grew to 5,560 in 2012, becoming a $17 million, mostly for-profit industry.", "title": "The bottom line on hospice care", "url": "//vegasinc.com/business/2014/apr/06/bottom-line-hospice-care/", "image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2014/03/27/20140327_VI_HospiceIndustry_0011_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2014/03/27/20140327_VI_HospiceIndustry_0011_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 29825057, "card": "summary", "site": "@VegasINC"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199953030039639}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-06T02:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "E1BCF7923471E63B3CC7DDA3DE4A41FB", "google-site-verification": "bxp1knjJzNHgVqXi0tkBFqhiRQYP6Xmg5IYDJk824_c", "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQ76jIbcG_lJjmaPhfMbLI5tEWvABRborWeQmxtOOd3YJzakYNqhBoeFQ", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Sunday, April 6, 2014 | 2 a.m. - The number of hospice organizations nationwide grew to 5,560 in 2012, becoming a $17 million, mostly for-profit industry."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda03\"", "article_summary": "The bottom line on hospice care End-of-life care is sensitive, but it\u2019s also a business, and it can be profitable \u2014 and competitiveHOW TO FIND A HOSPICE Caring Connections, a program of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, suggests asking these questions when searching for hospice care: \u2022 What services are provided?\n\u201cMost people believe hospice is a place where you go to die,\u201d said Maurice Gregory, chief of operations and compliance for Comfort Hospice Care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to run a successful hospice today than it was five years ago, or even one year ago,\u201d said Candis Armour, executive director of Las Vegas Solari Hospice Care.\n\u2022 How and where does hospice provide short-term inpatient care?\nAdding some quality to their life has given them the ability to sustain longer.\u201dIndeed, some patients might begin hospice care and then withdraw from it because their condition has stabilized; others might have their hospice care renewed if, after six months, they are still seen as likely to die within the next six-month period."}
