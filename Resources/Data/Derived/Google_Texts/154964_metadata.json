However, when it makes contact with the ground, it freezes instantly and can quickly make travel hazardous as black ice forms on untreated roadways.\n\nThe coming storm, which isn't expected to cause major problems otherwise, follows a record cold Friday night in New Jersey. Across most of the state, temperatures fell below zero, bottoming out at negative 12 degrees in Walpack and negative 10 in Kingwood, according to data from the state climatologist's office.\n\nTeeth-chattering cold will make its return on Monday as a cold front moves through. Temperatures could drop about 40 degrees to near zero in a matter of hours through the course of the day, forecasts show.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-weather, weather, news", "title": "Freezing rain advisory issued for Sunday in 7 N.J. counties", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Icy conditions may precede coming rains.", "title": "Freezing rain advisory issued for Sunday in 7 N.J. counties", "url": "http://www.nj.com/weather-guy/index.ssf/2014/01/freezing_rain_advisory_issued_for_7_nj_counties_sunday.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-icejpg-7e91ba354cc3c3e5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Icy conditions may precede coming rains.", "creator": "@sstirling", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-icejpg-7e91ba354cc3c3e5.jpg", "title": "Freezing rain advisory issued for Sunday in 7 N.J. counties", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, January 04, 2014,  4:48 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephenDStirling"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, January 04, 2014,  3:14 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Icy conditions may precede coming rains."}, "article_summary": "The National Weather Service has issued a freezing rain advisory for northern and western New Jersey for Sunday, when icy conditions could develop at the start of what is expected to be a mostly rain storm.\nFreezing rain can be deceptive because it appears to the naked eye to be plain rain.\n\"It doesn't take much freezing rain to cause problems,\" said Rob Reale, a meteorologist at WeatherWorks, a forecasting firm based in Hackettstown.\nThe advisory has been issued for Sussex, Warren, Morris, Mercer, Somerset, Hunterdon and Middlesex counties.\nThe coming storm, which isn't expected to cause major problems otherwise, follows a record cold Friday night in New Jersey."}
