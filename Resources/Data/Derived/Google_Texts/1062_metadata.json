Burwell case, in which he accuses six of his colleagues not just of stupidity but of judicial malpractice.\n\nWho knew administrative law could be so much fun?\n\nAfter all, unlike this week\u2019s other big court decision on same-sex marriage, the health-care decision is not about interpreting the Constitution but about how to read a statute that at best suffers (as the majority opinion gently put it) from \u201cinartful drafting.\u201d\n\nIn the present case, the court decides to take that task on itself. This is a bit surprising: Normally in this sort of case the linchpin would have been the 1984 Chevron case, which laid out the court\u2019s ideal relation to a federal agency\u2019s interpretations of a given statute.\n\nThe court is supposed to follow three steps, namely:\n\nTo ask, is the meaning of the law clear, or ambiguous? If the latter, did the agency come up with a \u201cpermissible\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of what it might mean? If yes, to let the agency interpretation stand, even if it is not the interpretation the judges themselves might prefer. That is, \u201cWhen a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the justices claimed that \u201cthe principle of deference to administrative interpretations has been consistently followed by this Court whenever decision as to the meaning or reach of a statute has involved reconciling conflicting policies.\u201d\n\nThis was the logic followed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the government. The Circuit Court, that is, decided that the language was ambiguous, that the agency (here, the IRS) had come up with a reasonable interpretation, and thus, that the tax credits for users of state exchanges could remain.\n\nA panel of the DC Circuit decided instead that the language was unambiguous \u2013 as Scalia would have it, \u201cso obvious there would hardly be a need for the Supreme Court to hear a case about it\u201d \u2014 and thus that the tax credits were invalid.\n\nInterestingly, the Supreme Court majority decided to do the interpreting itself, removing the issue from the agency. It held that the Chevron framework did not apply, because that framework is based on Congress delegating discretionary authority to the agency to make choices about how the law works.\n\nBut here, the majority argued, the tax credit program is too central to the working of the law for such delegation to be assumed. And the IRS is not in any case expert in health insurance and its workings. \u201cThis is not a case for the IRS,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote; \u201cIt is instead our task to determine the correct reading of Section 36B.\u201d\n\nThey do so, of course, in the government\u2019s favor. Scalia, in his dissent, harrumphs that \u201cUnder all the usual rules of interpretation\u2026 the Government should lose this case.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, he points out other places in the law where the two sorts of exchanges (state and federal) are distinguished from one another, while the government\u2019s interpretation singles out only this appearance for this sort of unified treatment.\n\nBut the Roberts majority is unmoved: While a close call, perhaps, \u201cSection 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Con\u00adgress\u2019s plan, and that is the reading we adopt.\u201d In short, taking the law as a whole, the notion of an exchange \u201cestablished by the State\u201d is indeed ambiguous. Under the plaintiff\u2019s reading, the marketplace governed by the law, and thus the point of the law, would collapse in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2013 something Congress could not have meant to do.\n\nAs that suggests, the majority opinion puts a fair bit of weight on legislative intent \u2013 though not the traditional kind of legislative history that looks to floor debate and committee reports to get a sense of what Congress meant to do.\n\nJudicial utilization of those latter materials is frowned upon by Scalia and others who argue that the plain meaning of the text is what governs. Thus, though the section itself may well be an elaborate typo arising from the unorthodox process the law followed to passage \u2013 one that caused Schoolhouse Rock\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m just a Bill\u201d to roll over in his legislative grave \u2013 the majority opinion does not dwell on this point.\n\nRather, Roberts tries to dwell on what Congress actually passed, not what it meant to pass: that taken as a whole, the law had a certain architecture, and the section in question can be read to support that architecture rather than to knock it down. This hardly mollified Scalia, of course.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that statutory interpretation is a much larger fraction of the federal courts\u2019 docket than the big-ticket questions of Constitutional Rights That Will Shape Our Legacy and Make for Excellent PBS Documentaries.\n\nProfessor Edward Corwin wrote back in the 1940s that \u201cexecutive interpretations of statutes flower.\u201d Indeed, as Professor Shep Melnick wrote more than 20 years ago in his excellent book \u201cBetween the Lines\u201c: \u201cIt would be difficult to find a domestic policy area in which statutory interpretation by the federal courts has not played a significant role in shaping the activities of government.\u201d\n\nIn the current case, by moving away from Chevron, the court majority does this even more directly than might have been expected.\n\nThis may wind up being true not just for the Affordable Care Act but for a wide range of the Obama administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nThe administration\u2019s attempts to tighten regulation of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 from a variety of coal-fired power plants, and recently to aircraft \u2013 spring from an expansive reading of the Clean Air Act enabled by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. And the president\u2019s actions on immigration have been held up, at present at least, not on the grounds that they represent an unconstitutional extension of executive authority but because their issuance may have violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn short, we should probably pay more attention to administrative law, even as Congress should probably pay more attention to the laws it passes. In the oral arguments, the solicitor general was asked why legislators couldn\u2019t simply fix the problem, if it was after all just a drafting error. He replied, to knowing laughter, \u201cthis Congress?\u201d While Scalia\u2019s accusations of policy partisanship are unfair (or at least hypocritical), he is surely right that it is not the court\u2019s job to save Congress from being a punchline.\n\nNote: This post has been corrected to replace the version originally published, which contained a factual error.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health care decision is not about interpreting the Constitution but about how to read a statute.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The health care decision is not about interpreting the Constitution but about how to read a statute.", "title": "King v.
