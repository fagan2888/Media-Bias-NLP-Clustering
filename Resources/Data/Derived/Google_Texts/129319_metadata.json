In order for a virus to infect host cells, it must attach to a receptor on the host cell and be activated by it's enzymes, which allows for the fusion of the virus and host cells.\n\nThe two mutations were similar to ones discovered that allowed the virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, to jump from animals to humans. UM researchers suggest future studies on both diseases need to examine the evolutionary processes that allowed each virus to mutate in order to infect human cells.\n\nThe study is publiished in the Journal of Virology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two mutations were discovered that allowed the MERS coronavirus, which has sickened 1,200 and killed 442 since 2012, to jump from bats to people.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Two mutations were discovered that allowed the MERS coronavirus, which has sickened 1,200 and killed 442 since 2012, to jump from bats to people.", "title": "Mutations found that allow MERS to jump from bats to humans", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/06/11/Mutations-found-that-allow-MERS-to-jump-from-bats-to-humans/8601434041152/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/8601434041152/2015/1/14340450051512/v2.1/Mutations-found-that-allow-MERS-to-jump-from-bats-to-humans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8601434041152/2015/i/14340450051512/v2.1/Mutations-found-that-allow-MERS-to-jump-from-bats-to-humans.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Two mutations were discovered that allowed the MERS coronavirus, which has sickened 1,200 and killed 442 since 2012, to jump from bats to people.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mutations found that allow MERS to jump from bats to humans"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "article_summary": "MINNEAPOLIS, June 11 (UPI) -- Researchers have discovered two mutations that likely allowed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, to transmit from bats to humans.\nThe two mutations were similar to ones discovered that allowed the virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, to jump from animals to humans.\nIn the new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota compared the sequences of MERS-CoV and two MERS-like viruses in bats, discovering two mutations that allow the bat viruses to infect human cells, according to a press release.\nIn order for a virus to infect host cells, it must attach to a receptor on the host cell and be activated by it's enzymes, which allows for the fusion of the virus and host cells.\nUM researchers suggest future studies on both diseases need to examine the evolutionary processes that allowed each virus to mutate in order to infect human cells."}
