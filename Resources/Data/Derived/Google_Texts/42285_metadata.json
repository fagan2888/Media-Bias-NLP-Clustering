But access to the best diagnosticians and specialists isn\u2019t equal across our nation.\n\nLuckily, access to preventative screenings is increasing under the Affordable Care Act. Health plans must cover mammograms for women 40 and over, as well as those who are high-risk. Despite that, gaps remain in the quality of care being delivered and the number of experienced specialists available.\n\nVitals\u2019 first annual America\u2019s Top States for Access to Breast Cancer Care paired statistics from Vitals\u2019 vast doctor database with publicly available demographic data available on incident rates of breast cancer.\n\nSeveral doctors \u2013 from gynecologists to oncologists, radiologists to plastic surgeons \u2013 focus on treating women with breast cancer, but they are often unevenly distributed. For instance, the study revealed that the ratio of breast cancer patients to specialists was best in Missouri (20:1), Massachusetts (25:1) and Maryland (27:1). In contrast, the ratio of patients to breast cancer specialists in Alaska is 200 to 1. Mississippi (144:1) and Hawaii (104:1) also had high patient to doctor ratios.\n\nAccess to Breast Cancer Specialists (by incident of breast cancer)\n\nState No. of specialists Avg Incidence (per 100,000) Patients per Specialist Rank MO 163 112.1 20.6 1 MA 379 140.5 24.8 2 MD 274 126 27.3 3 RI 47 126 28.2 4 VT 27 126 29.2 5\n\nAK 5 140.5 206.5 50 MS 51 121.3 143.8 49 HI 17 126 104.1 48 ID 18 112.1 100.4 47 AR 37 112.1 89.7 46\n\nIn addition, patient-reported metrics such as doctor ratings and ease in getting an appointment were calculated into the final rankings. A good doctor-patient relationship has been shown to effect outcomes with patients. And at no time are the consequences more dire than when dealing with cancer.\n\nThe final results did not show any geographic relevance, but did match up to poverty data from the states. Seven out of the bottom 10 from the Vitals\u2019 survey are also among the poorest states in the nation.\n\nEconomic factors have been linked to when women get diagnosed with breast cancer in several medical studies. Poverty-stricken women are more likely to wait before seeking treatment because of the cost of care or time spent away from family and jobs.\n\nMaine\u2019s poverty rate is #33, while Mississippi is #50 \u2013 the worst in the nation. In contrast, Vermont, which ranked at the top of the Vitals\u2019 survey, has the third lowest poverty rate in the nation.\n\nTo view the full list of state rankings, see the press release.", "article_metadata": {"description": "access to breast cancer care", "generator": "WordPress 4.0.1", "og": {"site_name": "The Vitals Blog", "description": "access to breast cancer care", "title": "Where is America\u2019s best access to breast cancer care?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://spotlight.vitals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BestWorstBreastCancerCare_V2.png", "url": "http://spotlight.vitals.com/2014/10/where-is-americas-best-access-to-breast-cancer-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://spotlight.vitals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BestWorstBreastCancerCare_V2-276x443.png", "site": "@Vitals", "card": "summary", "description": "access to breast cancer care"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366829550049077}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9ee\"", "article_summary": "Vitals\u2019 first annual America\u2019s Top States for Access to Breast Cancer Care paired statistics from Vitals\u2019 vast doctor database with publicly available demographic data available on incident rates of breast cancer.\nAccess to Breast Cancer Specialists (by incident of breast cancer)State No.\nFor instance, the study revealed that the ratio of breast cancer patients to specialists was best in Missouri (20:1), Massachusetts (25:1) and Maryland (27:1).\nIn contrast, the ratio of patients to breast cancer specialists in Alaska is 200 to 1.\nbyDiagnosis and treatment are crucial to breast cancer survival."}
