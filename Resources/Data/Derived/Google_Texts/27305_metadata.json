The name of the witness has not been released.\n\nWhen he returned to the car later, Vandellen and the van were gone, Techmeyer said.\n\nThe abduction happened on Colorado 93 near Matthew Winters Park.\n\nThe witness said he does not know Vandellen well.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is figure out why he was with the woman on Highway 93 at 5 a.m.,\u201d Techmeyer said.\n\nThe witness was interviewed at Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Department headquarters in Golden.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Suspect in Jeffco abduction arrested; woman found safe", "title": "Suspect in Jeffco abduction arrested; woman found safe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/22/suspect-in-jeffco-abduction-arrested-woman-found-safe/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__B3GfCprCAAEU_LUp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__B3GfCprCAAEU_LUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-22T09:12:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:01:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded27\"", "article_summary": "Denver police have arrested a man sought in the early Saturday abduction of his former girlfriend after he allegedly rammed her car with his van in Jefferson County.\nVandellen was found a few hours later in the same neighborhood in which Sikora was arrested, the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office reported.\n\u201c(Sikora) was outside a house that the van was registered to,\u201d said Mark Techmeyer, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nThe car came to a stop after the suspect, described by the witness as the victim\u2019s ex-boyfriend, rammed the car with his van.\nWhen he returned to the car later, Vandellen and the van were gone, Techmeyer said."}
