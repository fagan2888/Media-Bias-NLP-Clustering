Its judges said that as a married woman, she had a right to demand an explanation for the government's decision to deny a visa to her husband.\n\nHer position drew some support from the liberal side of the high court during Monday's argument. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen G. Breyer said they were troubled by the possibility that the government could make a mistake.\n\n\"That's what we were told after Sept. 11,\" Sotomayor said, noting that the government claimed it had good reasons for arresting and holding foreigners after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, only to admit later that it made a mistake in some instances.\n\nKneedler insisted that the State Department double-checked before denying a visa, and that officials need not explain their reasons for excluding someone.\n\n\"There is no judicial review no matter what?\" Breyer asked incredulously. What if the consular official denied the visa for racist reasons or because he thought husbands and wives should not live together, the justice asked.\n\nKneedler insisted such a scenario was not possible because decisions are reviewed by other officials and attorneys to prevent personal biases.\n\nWhen Los Angeles attorney Mark Haddad rose to argue Din's case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and several of his colleagues said they did not want to extend new rights.\n\nIf wives have a constitutional right to go to court in such cases, they may also have a right to object when their imprisoned husbands are sent to a facility that is far away, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said.\n\nHaddad said that was different because a criminal had been convicted in court. In this instance, he said, Din's right to due process had been denied. \"There's a complete absence of process. The entire decision-making is behind closed doors,\" he said.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who sounded uncertain at times, said he was not convinced that the wife had a constitutional right to object in court, regardless of whether her husband were a prisoner or a foreign national.\n\n\"There's no remedy where there are two citizens living in this country, and you want us to apply that remedy to a person who's living out of the country,\" he said. \"National security interests are involved.\"\n\ndavid.savage@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @davidgsavage\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court hears woman's case on visa denial for Afghan husband", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Supreme Court justices gave a mostly skeptical hearing Monday to a California woman who wants the State Department to explain why it barred her Afghan husband from joining her in this country.", "title": "Supreme Court hears woman's case on visa denial for Afghan husband", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-court-visa-20150224-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Supreme Court, visa denial, State Department, Edwin Kneedler, Fauzia Din", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82899819", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-02-23", "Description": "Supreme Court justices gave a mostly skeptical hearing Monday to a California woman who wants the State Department to explain why it barred her Afghan husband from joining her in this country.
