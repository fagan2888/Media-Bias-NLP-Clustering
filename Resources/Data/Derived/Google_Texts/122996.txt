The Kansas Democratic Party's chairwoman says she's not seeking a third, two-year term in the job and is looking for a successor.

Joan Wagnon said Wednesday that she always intended to serve only four years as the state Democratic Party's top leader. She was elected to the job in 2011.

The party's leaders faced criticism from some Democratic activists after Republicans swept all statewide and congressional races in November's election.

Wagnon's replacement will be chosen by the party's State Committee during a March 7 meeting in Topeka. It is part of the annual Washington Days convention.

Wagnon was Kansas revenue secretary from 2003 through 2010 and served as Topeka's mayor from 1997 to 2001. She served in the Kansas House from 1983 through 1994.

In contrast, Kansas Republican Chair Kelly Arnold has told fellow party members he plans to seek a new two-year term.
