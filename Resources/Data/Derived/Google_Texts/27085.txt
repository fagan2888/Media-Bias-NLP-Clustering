WASHINGTON — A North Carolina mayor on Sunday was just a few miles away from finishing his 273-mile walk to Washington.

Fox News reported that Belhaven Mayor Adam O’Neal is walking to Washington to draw attention to the closing of his small town’s local hospital. He started the 14-day journey earlier this month.

O’Neal wants to draw attention to the plights of other rural facilities caught in financial bind created largely by ObamaCare, a changing economy and less federal funding, according to Fox News.

“We’re almost there,” O’Neal said as he reached northern Virginia ahead of an approaching thunderstorm. “We’re going to make it.”

The mayor said an increasing number of small, rural hospitals have been shuttered since ObamaCare was signed into law in 2012.

O’Neill said he wants to bring attention to what he considers Department of Health and Human Services and Justice Department failures leading to the closure of Belhaven’s Vidant Pungo Hospital.
