Digital First Media, owner of The Denver Post, said Tuesday that it will put an additional 51 real estate holdings on the market in seven states.

Twenty Lake Holdings, Digital First Media’s real estate subsidiary, will sell the properties with the assistance of Praxis Commercial.

Praxis Commercial lists eight Colorado properties for sale on its website, mostly on the Eastern Plains. They include newspaper buildings in Akron, Brush, Burlington, Cañon City, Fort Morgan, Julesburg, Lamar and Sterling.

The Daily Times-Call building in Longmont is also for sale.

California has the most properties being listed for sale, followed by Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.

“The strategy outlined by Twenty Lake Holdings and Praxis Commercial enables us to streamline our real estate portfolio through a comprehensive program encompassing property sales, new leasing, relocations and consolidation, thereby freeing the company from the constraints of being overburdened with underutilized properties,” Digital First Media president and chief operating officer Steve Rossi said in a statement.

Since 2012, Twenty Lake Holdings and Praxis Commercial have sold 67 properties, generating capital for Digital First Media.

They are now actively marketing another 70 newspaper buildings, containing 1.7 million square feet, with an estimated value of $85 million.

Digital First Media, headquartered in New York, is the second-largest newspaper company in the country by daily circulation and reaches more than 67 million readers monthly across 18 states.
