It was within this text that Bonhoeffer described \u201ccheap grace,\u201d i.e. \u201cgrace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nCheap grace is no grace at all.\n\nSimilarly, Political Correctness, the morality of Bernie Sanders, is \u201ccheap morality\u201d or \u201ccheap virtue.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, those of us who refuse to give up the genuine article in exchange for the \u201csocial respectability\u201d that accompanies this counterfeit know all too well that the former is anything but inexpensive: Real morality is hard. It\u2019s tough.\n\nSome people, like childhood friend of mine Salvatore, or \u201cIvan\u201d know this better than others.\n\nWe met in our neighborhood elementary school in Trenton, New Jersey back in the late \u201870s and had remained good friends until we lost touch some two decades ago. Courtesy of social media, I was able to find out from this child of Sicilian immigrants (who himself didn\u2019t arrive in America until he was four) that in addition to having opened his own restaurant, he was also a single father to a 10 year-old girl\u2014\u201cGia.\u201d\n\nGia had just entered the world when doctors whisked her away, for not only was Gia not crying; she wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\nIt was hours before anyone\u2014including her parents\u2014discovered that their little girl had been born with an extremely rare disease: Neonatal Myasthenia Gravis (NMG). In fact, the latter is so rare that neither the doctors who delivered her nor those world-class doctors at the Philadelphia hospital to which she was swiftly medivacked had ever seen a case of it.\n\nGia is fortunate to have survived, for her prospects did not look good. Today, 10 years later, she has what her father describes as \u201cthe worst case of Muscular Dystrophy imaginable.\u201d He summarizes her situation: \u201cGia is essentially an intelligent being trapped in a body that, tragically, simply doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThis little girl, incapable of lifting up her head, arms, and legs, is bound to a wheelchair. Nor can she eat without the assistance of a tube, and because of her inability to control her bowels, Gia must wear diapers.\n\nYet there are still other issues, like pulmonary disease, chronic respiratory illness, and cardiomyopathy, from which little Gia suffers. Four times daily, professional home care nurses administer to Gia respiratory treatments, including vigorous machine treatments that assist her in coughing, for she lacks the ability to clear her lungs on her own.\n\nIn spite of all of her problems (or is it because of them?), by all accounts, Gia is among the sweetest and most thoughtful of human beings. To note just one example, because of her vulnerability to such run-of-the-mill illnesses as the cold, the flu, etc. she not infrequently winds up in intensive care for lengthy periods of time. Yet when her father picks her up, she expresses deep sadness for the other children who can\u2019t go home.\n\nThis is real compassion\u2014not Bernie Sanders-style \u201ccompassion.\u201d\n\nPerhaps she has learned this generosity of spirit from her father, a guy who is as hard working as he is devoted to his daughter. Ivan, however, would insist that it is he who has learned from Gia. In any case, their family, unlike Bernie Sanders and every other PC ideologue, embodies real virtue.\n\nBut now\u2014now, in this Age of Obamacare!\u2014Ivan has been denied by his insurance company the coverage for Gia\u2019s medical expenses that it once supplied. A \u201cGet Gia Going\u201d gofundme page exists to assist the Gia and her family in this time of need.\n\nIn contrast to the Bernies of the world, those of us who champion real morality know that compassion and generosity can\u2019t be coerced by bullying politicians.
