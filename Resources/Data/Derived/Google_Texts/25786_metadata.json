The Times\u2019s David Brooks thought it was politically clever: \u201cShe\u2019s cleared the first political hurdle of the campaign,\u201d he wrote. Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias said that Clinton\u2019s policy agenda amounted to a rebuke of neoliberalism and indicated a \u201cpaleoliberal revival.\u201d Politico\u2019s Ben White reckoned that the speech was a non-event. \u201cThe snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: \u2018Meh. What\u2019s next?\u2019 \u201d he reported.\n\nMy reaction was that the speech suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation and to boost middle-class incomes (\u201cThat will be my mission from the first day I\u2019m President to the last,\u201d Clinton said), while still seeking to hold the center ground of today\u2019s Democratic Party, which has shifted to the left since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in 2008, and the later rise of Occupy Wall Street. Compared to the starry-eyed supply-side revivalism of Jeb Bush and the relentless labor-bashing of Scott Walker, though, her speech was on a different plane completely.\n\nIn terms of policy details, it was pretty much as expected. Many of the proposals that Clinton outlined were part of a lengthy report on \u201cinclusive prosperity\u201d that was published, earlier this year, by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, her campaign manager. The C.A.P.\u2019s panel of experts, led by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and Ed Balls, the Labour Party\u2019s top spokesman on economic issues, proposed boosting the minimum wage, investing in child care and education, setting up an infrastructure bank, changing the tax code to eliminate loopholes enjoyed by the rich, expanding tax breaks for profit-sharing and employee share ownership, and strengthening collective bargaining.\n\nClinton proposed all of these things. She also embraced President Obama\u2019s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street. (On my Twitter stream, that last pledge sparked some skepticism. One person sent me a link to an OpenSecrets.org page showing that three of Clinton\u2019s top four campaign donors, in the course of her career, are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.)\n\nOne thing Clinton didn\u2019t do was utter the \u201cR-word\u201d\u2014redistribution\u2014which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism. Instead, she talked about encouraging \u201cfair growth,\u201d which is another term for inclusive prosperity. Speaking on this theme, she said, for example, \u201cWe have to get serious about supporting workers,\u201d and, referring to the need for tax reform, \u201cThose at the top have to pay their fair share.\u201d\n\nClinton didn\u2019t spell out how she\u2019d revive labor unions, which now represent less than seven per cent of workers in the private sector. The only specific tax changes she proposed that would affect the very rich were eliminating the carried-interest deduction enjoyed by hedge-fund managers and private-equity managers, and enacting the \u201cBuffett rule,\u201d which would apply a minimum federal tax rate of thirty per cent to people earning more than a million dollars a year. These are two eminently worthwhile proposals, ones that President Obama has also endorsed. By themselves, however, they wouldn\u2019t do very much to address the remarkable concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the income distribution.\n\nTo be fair to Clinton, nobody is quite sure how to tackle that problem. At the very least, it would require a three-pronged approach: far-reaching changes to the tax code aimed at taxing wealth and restoring the progressivity that was part of the code until Ronald Reagan came to power; reining in the financial sector, which is responsible for much of the rise in inequality over the past thirty years; and challenging the social norms and corporate-governance structures that facilitate the outlandish pay packages received by senior corporate executives.\n\nClearly, Clinton isn\u2019t willing to go that far, although she did say that she\u2019d get back to us with some proposals to encourage long-term investing over short-term trading. \u201cThe speech revealed a woman who does not have her heart in class conflict,\u201d Brooks rightly noted. Like many centrist Democrats, she prefers to talk about expanding opportunity while proposing individual measures with a redistributive aspect, such as providing child care for working mothers and expanding financial aid for students from modest backgrounds. Over the past twenty-five years, this pragmatic approach has produced some major advances for Americans of modest means, such as the repeated expansion of earned-income-tax credits and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt is an eminently defensible philosophy, and Brooks may also be right when he argues that it\u2019s more politically palatable to the American public at large than the fire-and-brimstone stuff that Clinton\u2019s competitor Bernie Sanders is offering up. You have to wonder, though. Over the holiday weekend, I ran into a retired businessman who used to own a firm that employed more than a hundred people. I\u2019ve never been an extremist of any sort, he said, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that America, at this stage, would benefit from a modest dose of socialism.\n\nYes, you guessed it\u2014he was supporting Sanders.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "John Cassidy writes about Hillary Clinton\u2019s major speech on the economy, which addressed inequality but didn\u2019t clarify her view of redistribution.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Clinton suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation, but omitted an important element of how she\u2019d do it.", "title": "The Word Hillary Clinton Didn\u2019t Say - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cassidy-Hillary-Wont-Say-1200-630-14155421.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-07-14T18:37:36-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-word-hillary-clinton-wont-say", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton suggested serious intentions to tackle the problem of wage stagnation, but omitted an important element of how she\u2019d do it.", "creator": "@JohnCassidy", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cassidy-Hillary-Wont-Say-1200-630-14155421.jpg", "title": "The Word Hillary Clinton Didn\u2019t Say - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3076406\",\"title_alt\":\"The Word Hillary Clinton Didn\\u2019t Say\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/07\\/Cassidy-Hillary-Wont-Say-728-375-14155404.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "John Cassidy", "tag": "Speech", "published_time": "2015-07-14T16:51:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T18:37:36-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3076406, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "2016 election, Hillary Clinton, Inequality, Presidential Candidates, Speech"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2cc\"", "article_summary": "Clinton proposed all of these things.\nHillary Clinton\u2019s big speech about the economy on Monday generated a wide range of reactions from the punditocracy.\n\u201cThe snap reaction among Wall Street investors, economists and ardent financial reformers who thrill to the soak-the-rich rhetoric of Bernie Sanders was a collective: \u2018Meh.\nOne thing Clinton didn\u2019t do was utter the \u201cR-word\u201d\u2014redistribution\u2014which would surely be a central element of any serious revival of old-fashioned American liberalism.\nShe also embraced President Obama\u2019s recent move to expand overtime pay, called for more paid sick days and family leave, and promised to prosecute individuals and firms on Wall Street."}
