But the poll could determine whether either of those petitions is circulated to collect the necessary signatures.\n\nJohn Payne, executive director of the Missouri-based group \u201cShow Me Cannabis,\u201d says the initiatives reflect \u201cour ideal, to legalize and regulate cannabis similar to alcohol.\u201d\n\nBut if the poll indicates that Missourians aren\u2019t ready for that, the group may file a new initiative petition proposal with a narrower focus \u2013 such as legalizing marijuana for medical use.\n\n\u201cMissouri is a fairly conservative state,\u2019\u2019 Payne explained.\n\nStill, the political climate may be changing. Gov. Jay Nixon, for example, appears to have suffered little blowback for his recent decision to commute the life sentence of Jeffrey Mizanskey, of Sedalia Mo., who has been in prison for roughly 20 years for marijuana-related offenses.\n\nMarijuana legalization growing\n\nMarijuana laws already have softened a bit in Missouri, where jail time is no longer imposed on people convicted for possession of less than 10 grams of the substance.\n\nBut many states are going much further. According to Governing magazine, 23 states have legalized marijuana for at least some uses, primarily medical.\n\nFour of those states -- Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska \u2013 have legalized marijuana for recreational use. And some of their state officials are now looking upon the newly home-grown drug as a cash crop.\n\nIn the state of Washington, for example, the Seattle Times reports that legislative budget-writers are counting on collecting $1.1 billion in marijuana-related income (mainly new taxes) over the next four years in order to balance the state government\u2019s budgets.\n\nAnd Colorado\u2019s boom is believed to be affecting the drug trade in Missouri. Payne with \u201cShow Me Cannabis\u201d contends that most of Missouri\u2019s illegal marijuana products are now obtained by the distributors legally in Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s closer\u201d and safer, he explained, than the old marijuana gateways of Mexico and Canada.\n\nMissouri\u2019s strange bedfellows\n\nMissouri\u2019s potential 2016 ballot battle for some sort of marijuana legalization already has created an \u201cOdd Couple\u2019\u2019 coalition of backers.\n\nPayne says the advisory board for \u201cShow Me Cannabis\u2019\u2019 includes such diverse groups as the American Civil Liberties Union, the St. Louis Tea Party, the United Food and Commercial Workers union and the Epilepsy Foundation.\n\nSupporters also are confident they can raise the money needed for an initiative-petition drive, and for any media campaign. So far, \u201cShow Me Cannabis\u2019\u2019 and its newly formed campaign committee \u2013 called \u201cA New Approach for Missouri\u2019\u2019 \u2013 has less than $35,000 in their bank accounts, Payne said.\n\nBut he added that there are backers ready to bankroll the effort if the poll\u2019s results look promising.\n\n\u201cShow Me Cannabis\u201d was incorporated under the IRS\u2019 501C4 provision, which means the group doesn\u2019t have to identify its donors or how much it raises or spends. However, the \u201cNew Approach\u201d campaign arm already has filed paperwork with the Missouri Ethics Commission, which means its finances will have to be publicly disclosed.\n\nBackers\u2019 chief pitch for legalizing marijuana center on two arguments:\n\nThat millions of tax dollars are wasted to handle the more than 20,000 Missourians who are believed to be arrested in the state each year for marijuana-related offenses.\n\nThat keeping the plant illegal hurts \u201cpeople who have very serious illnesses who could benefit from using medical cannabis,\u2019\u2019 Payne said.\n\nOverall statewide arrest tallies for marijuana-related offenses are hard to obtain. The Missouri Highway Patrol reports that its 2014 figures for pot-related arrests show 4,082 misdemeanor arrests and 84 felony arrests for possession of marijuana. The patrol seized 1,700 pounds of marijuana last year.\n\nControversy continues over marijuana and its medicinal uses. Supporters cite studies showing that marijuana can help in the treatment of epilepsy and some eye diseases, such as glaucoma, and also helps ease the effect of debilitating cancer treatments.\n\nCritics contend the benefits are overblown. For decades, marijuana has been portrayed as \u201ca gateway drug\u2019\u2019 to more serious illegal substances, such as cocaine and heroin. Opponents of the current legalization drive also emphasize that the current crops of marijuana circulated today are much more powerful than the type sampled by many Baby Boomers decades ago.\n\nPayne \u2013 who emphasizes that he no longer uses the drug \u2013 says few people now partake of the old-school marijuana \u201cjoints\u2019\u2019 of the 1960s and \u201870s. Now, the drug usually is consumed in much smaller amounts, via vaporizers or pipes.\n\nSo far, there appears to be no organized opposition in Missouri, but Payne expects that to change should a legalization proposal actually make the 2016 ballot.\n\nIs traditional opposition softening?\n\nLaw enforcement has been traditionally been the most vocal critics of easing marijuana laws, but even that may be softening.\n\nThe Missouri Highway Patrol, which has taken the lead of the state\u2019s anti-drug efforts for decades, isn\u2019t taking any position on any marijuana legalization proposals, a spokesman said.\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, for example, said in an interview last week that she might be open to some sort of legalization if provisions are made to bar use among drivers \u201cand children aren\u2019t exposed to it.\"\n\nWith \u201csensible precautions like that, I would not necessarily be opposed to it,\u201d Joyce said. She added that she was paying close attention to what happens in Colorado -- where her daughter lives -- now that marijuana has been legalized.\n\nSuch an attitude contrasts sharply with those in 1992, when there was a national uproar over then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton\u2019s acknowledgement that he had used marijuana in college, even though he contended he didn\u2019t inhale.\n\nAnd in Missouri in 1992, a political tempest ignited during a formal debate in St. Louis featuring the Republican and Democratic candidates for state attorney general.\n\nIn response to a panelist\u2019s question, a majority of the contenders \u2013 including Nixon \u2013 acknowledged that they had sampled marijuana in college back in the 1970s. Nixon\u2019s GOP rival, David Steelman, later sought to use the Democrat\u2019s admission as an issue in the general election.\n\nThat backdrop may be a help now for legalization backers. Payne said that polls conducted elsewhere show that legalization support is strongest among the under-35 crowd, and the Baby Boomers, now in their 50s and 60s.\n\nVoters age 70 and older, Payne said, generally have been the staunchest opponents to changing marijuana laws. When it comes to legalization, he said, \u201cOne of the biggest dividers is age.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "(Updated June 17 with latest arrest figures from Missouri Highway Patrol) In the next week or so, pollsters will be contacting Missouri residents to ask if", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/will-missouri-join-states-embracing-pot", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201107/marijuana_leaf.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "(Updated June 17 with latest arrest figures from Missouri Highway Patrol) In the next week or so, pollsters will be contacting Missouri residents to ask if", "title": "Will Missouri join the states embracing pot?"}, "story_id": 412763349, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Will Missouri join the states embracing pot?"}, "nid": 46348, "datePublished": "2015-06-07", "keywords": "Jay Nixon, marijuana", "wordCount": 1328, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Missouri\u2019s strange bedfellowsMissouri\u2019s potential 2016 ballot battle for some sort of marijuana legalization already has created an \u201cOdd Couple\u2019\u2019 coalition of backers.\nThat keeping the plant illegal hurts \u201cpeople who have very serious illnesses who could benefit from using medical cannabis,\u2019\u2019 Payne said.\n\u201cMissouri is a fairly conservative state,\u2019\u2019 Payne explained.\nThe Missouri secretary of state\u2019s office has approved two initiative petitions that seek constitutional amendments to legalize marijuana production, use, sale and distribution.\nThe Missouri Highway Patrol, which has taken the lead of the state\u2019s anti-drug efforts for decades, isn\u2019t taking any position on any marijuana legalization proposals, a spokesman said."}
