In a speech at the winter Democratic National Committee meeting Thursday, he essentially told state party leaders to stiffen their spines.\n\n[READ: Democrats Can't Run From Obamacare, Even if They Never Voted for It]\n\n\u201cWhat are we worried about?\u201d Biden asked an assembling of state party chairs inside the Capital Hilton in downtown Washington, D.C. \u201cIf we run on what we believe, if we run on our value set, which happens to be totally consistent with where the American people think we should be on the substantive set of issues, we will win. We will win.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments come as the Democratic Party is strategizing on how to navigate the politically perilous sixth year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, a time when, historically, the party out of power makes electoral gains. The highest priority for Democrats is holding on to the Senate, where the party is fending off challenges in six states Obama lost twice.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democratic incumbents in red states like Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska have made explicit breaks with Obama and some of his policies \u2013 a demonstration of the president\u2019s unpopularity in their states.\n\nBut Biden suggested that approach has its drawbacks in a year when the Democratic base needs extra incentive to turn out. He lamented that members of his party are overly worried about the avalanche of outside money facing them, rather than embracing a proactive posture to combat GOP attacks.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too hung up here on the idea about the super PAC,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re worried about is the Koch brothers and their friends bringing in millions and millions and millions of dollars. I\u2019m still one of these guys who believes money can\u2019t buy an election when you\u2019re selling a bad set of goods.\u201d\n\nBiden advised Democratic candidates should always demand that their opponents articulate what they\u2019re for, turning what often becomes a referendum on the president\u2019s policies into a stark comparative choice.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re for, they don\u2019t want to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are too shy, we are not talking about it enough, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe minimum wage, equal pay for women, background checks on gun owners, marriage equality and immigration reform are all issues backed by a majority of Americans, Biden contested. Though the Affordable Care Act's popularity has taken a measurable hit in many key states, the vice president stressed it was still more popular than a repeal of the law.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Pulse", "title": "Biden Gives Democrats a Plan for Scratching the 6-Year Itch at DNC Meeting", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The vice president doesn't understand what Democrats are so worried about in 2014.", "title": "Biden Gives Democrats a Plan to Scratch the 6-Year Itch", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/27/biden-gives-democrats-a-plan-for-scratching-the-6-year-itch-at-dnc-meeting", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e6/c2/2236027843be8c2926772378e10c/140227-biden-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The vice president doesn't understand what Democrats are so worried about in 2014.", "card": "summary", "title": "Biden Gives Democrats a Plan for Scratching the 6-Year Itch at DNC Meeting"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Feb. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,David Catanese,Democratic National Convention,Democratic Party,Biden, Joe,Wasserman Schultz, Debbie,Brazile, Donna,picks,Pulse", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The vice president doesn't understand what Democrats are so worried about in 2014."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb452\"", "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden can\u2019t recall another time in the last 40 years when the majority of Americans agreed with his Democratic Party on every major issue.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re worried about is the Koch brothers and their friends bringing in millions and millions and millions of dollars.\nIn a speech at the winter Democratic National Committee meeting Thursday, he essentially told state party leaders to stiffen their spines.\nNonetheless, he said Democrats remain too timid, defensive and reactive about their positions heading into a challenging midterm election year.\nBut Biden suggested that approach has its drawbacks in a year when the Democratic base needs extra incentive to turn out."}
