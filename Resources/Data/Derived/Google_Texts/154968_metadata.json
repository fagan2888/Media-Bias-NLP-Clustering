If found in violation, the company will be given time to comply, after which penalties such as a business suspension order or improvement order were possible, the person said.\n\nOnline games and apps that use prepaid tokens as means of in-game payment are popular in Japan. Funds raised from prepaid tokens used as currencies must be reported, and companies are obliged to park half of customers' total unused deposits of over $90,620 with the Legal Affairs Bureau.\n\nA Line spokesman said it did not park any funds from a kind of token bought for its 'Key to the Treasure Box' game because it did not consider that particular token to be a currency, and as such not subject to reporting requirements.\n\nLine does report funds from other kinds of tokens within the same game, the spokesman said.\n\nNaver could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares in the parent closed down 0.5 percent in early afternoon trade versus a 0.4 percent rise in the benchmark index.\n\nThe news comes as Line, Japan's largest messaging app with 68 million registered users, eyes an initial public offering.\n\nThe company put plans for a listing on hold in August, saying it would wait until its earnings and market conditions improve. Chief Executive Takeshi Idezawa last month said a listing was still an option.\n\nJapanese regulators and companies have struggled with how to define and handle virtual currencies after the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014, when hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of the digital currency.\n\nBut new rules on virtual currencies currently passing through parliament are set to make Japan one of the first countries to regulate currencies such as bitcoin at a national level, a moved welcomed by so-called fintech-related investors and companies.\n\n($1 = 110.3500 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Takahiko Wada and Yoshiyasu Shida; Writing by Thomas Wilson; Editing by Christopher Cushing)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial regulators have raided the offices of messaging a", "title": "Japan regulators raid messaging app Line over use of payment tokens", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Japan-regulators-raid-messaging-app-Line-over-use-payment-tokens", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/line-ipo-naver_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Japan-regulators-raid-messaging-app-Line-over-use-payment-tokens", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/line-ipo-naver_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial regulators have raided the offices of messaging a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd72d1\"", "article_summary": "Online games and apps that use prepaid tokens as means of in-game payment are popular in Japan.\nJapanese regulators and companies have struggled with how to define and handle virtual currencies after the high-profile collapse of the Mt.\nThe news comes as Line, Japan's largest messaging app with 68 million registered users, eyes an initial public offering.\nLine does report funds from other kinds of tokens within the same game, the spokesman said.\nFunds raised from prepaid tokens used as currencies must be reported, and companies are obliged to park half of customers' total unused deposits of over $90,620 with the Legal Affairs Bureau."}
