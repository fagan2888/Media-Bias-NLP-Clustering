Steve Beshear to call a special session of the General Assembly to pursue impeachment of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis.\n\nMinister Jordan Palmer, secretary-general of the federation, issued a release contending that actions of Davis to deny marriage licenses to gay couples defies Kentucky and U.S. court rulings.\n\nPalmer said, \"This violates the oath of office taken by Kim Davis and, if she cannot complete her job because of religious beliefs, then she should resign. Government is free of religion and religious beliefs. Perhaps Ms. Davis would be happier in a religious state such as Afghanistan, Iran, or Iraq.\"\n\nRowan County Clerk Davis has asked Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan to stay enforcement of a federal court ruling requiring Rowan to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.\n\nIn an emergency application, Davis asks Kagan to delay Judge David Bunning\u2019s order while her appeal is being considered by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court, which refused to issue a stay.\n\nThe application was filed with Kagan because she considers such requests from Kentucky and the three other states in the 6th Circuit.\n\nKagan voted with the 5-4 majority in June that required all states to recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1EshCvW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "\"Today, we call on Governor Steve Beshear to call a Special Session of the Kentucky General Assembly to impeach the Rowan County Clerk.
