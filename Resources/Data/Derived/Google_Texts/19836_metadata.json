Mike Lee blamed big government for growing inequality in America, calling Obamacare an \u201cinequality Godzilla.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s comments came during his Tea Party response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nFollow @politicalticker\n\n\u201cObamacare \u2013 all by itself \u2013 is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMany Americans are now seeing why some of us fought so hard to stop this train-wreck over the last four years.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Obamacare, Lee cited government surveillance, changing laws without congressional approval, and abortion as issues that also spur disparity amongst \u201chard-working, play-by-the-rules\u201d Americans.\n\nResponding to the President\u2019s address, Lee stated that inequality stems mostly from three problems, immobility among the poor, insecurity in the middle class, and cronyism in the federal government.\n\n\u201cGovernment-driven inequality is the reason why, as hard-working families across the country struggle to make ends meet, six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are now suburbs of Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, who stood alongside Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s during his marathon filibuster in September over defunding Obamacare, defended the Tea Party movement\u2019s aggressive protest of big government, comparing their actions to those of the Boston Tea Party.\n\n\u201cI believe we need to do what Americans have always done \u2013 come together and press for positive change. Protesting against dysfunctional government is a great American tradition, going back to the original Tea Party in Boston, about 240 years ago,\u201d Lee said. \"Americans have a natural instinct to stand up and speak out when they know something is wrong. \u2026 Unfortunately, in recent years, we have had no choice but to engage in a number of protests against our current president\u2019s Washington-centered agenda.\u201d\n\nDespite his criticism of the Obama administration and its policies, Lee did acknowledge that the Democratic Party wasn\u2019t solely to blame to the mounting inequality in America.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and his party did not create all of these problems. \u2026 The GOP can be just as out-of-touch as the Democratic Establishment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) - Utah Sen.
