A black-robed Jesuit missionary and explorer built this church with the help of the Native People, and today he is teaching them the hymns of the Mass in Latin, the language of the Church.\n\nWhether built by the black-robed Jesuits or the brown-robed Franciscans, the mission churches built by Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino and his successors in the 18th century fulfilled the ministry of education in the faith, and in doing so, the Native People learned about the world, its spoken and written languages of Latin and Spanish, its art and its science.\n\nThey were great students, and they, in turn, taught their teachers the language, art and science of the desert.\n\nThree Men On Horseback\n\nJumping ahead to 1866, here you glimpse four men on horseback who are approaching the little town of Tucson, population 600.\n\nThree of the men are priests; one of them, Father John Baptist Salpointe, is leading the expedition that was sent by Bishop Lamy of Santa Fe. The man who isn\u2019t a priest is Mr. Vincent, a young man and a school teacher, who has been recruited by Bishop Lamy to start the first school in Arizona.\n\nTime Of Growth\n\nNow it\u2019s 1870, and there is a caravan of soldiers on horseback accompanying a horse-drawn carriage. It's late at night, and the caravan is just outside of Tucson.\n\nHaving endured a journey through the desert from Yuma, the passengers in the carriage are hoping to slip quietly into town and find their quarters so they can rest.\n\nBut it is not to be a quiet arrival for the passengers, for just about everybody in town, nearly 3,000 people, has turned out to give the passengers a real Western welcome with bonfires, fireworks, pealing bells and gunfire.\n\nThat is how excited the people are to welcome the seven Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet who have come to establish the first teaching community of religious women in Arizona.\n\nA Welcome Arrival\n\nThe happiest of all the Tucson citizens to welcome the Sisters was the Bishop of the Vicariate Apostolic of\n\nArizona, John Baptist Salpointe, who persistently had recruited the Sisters to come to Arizona to teach.\n\nThe Sisters took up residence in St. Joseph's Convent, which was adjacent to the Cathedral of St. Augustine, and it was in the convent that just a few weeks after their arrival that the Sisters opened their first school as a boarding academy for girls and a day school for boys.\n\nThe first curriculum consisted of Christian doctrine, reading, writing, spelling, simple arithmetic, music and domestic science.\n\nFulfilling the hopes of Bishop Salpointe and the Sisters, the school was soon overflowing with eager girls and boys.\n\nThree years later, the Sisters opened a school for native American children at the San Xavier Mission.\n\nThe First School\n\nIt's 1886, and now we're in Prescott, where the Sisters of St. Joseph have just opened, in the buildings that had served as a hospital, St. Joseph's Academy, a boarding academy for girls and a day school for boys.\n\nIt is the first Catholic School in that part of Arizona.\n\nTerrible Flooding\n\nWe're going back to Yuma for this next glimpse, and this one shows us just one example of the challenges our Catholic Schools have had to face from time to time.\n\nIt's February of 1891, and the Gila River is flooding with a terrible roar through the Yuma community, sweeping away half of all the buildings in town, including the Sacred Heart School.\n\nMany Firsts\n\nNow to 1900, and all Arizona is in the Diocese of Tucson, which had been established just three years earlier with Bishop Peter Bourgade as its first bishop.\n\nThe scene is the huge reservation of the Navajo People, few of whom are Catholics, but many of whom have great needs.\n\nTo help meet those needs for education and to offer the people the love of Christ in the Catholic Faith, a benefactress from the East has donated $3,000 to build a mission church and school.\n\nToday, that benefactress is visiting the site of the mission, which has the name of St. Michael's. She is talking to Navajo tribal leaders, answering their questions about the nature of the school and discussing with them the advantages of education for their children. The leaders consent to send their children to the school, and they say they will urge other parents to as well.\n\nThe school opened in 1902, and the benefactress, Mother Katherine Drexel, was present with 12 Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for the solemn High Mass of dedication.\n\nSt. Katherine Drexel\n\nIt is 1902, and Bisbee is a booming copper mining town with a population of nearly 27,000.\n\nBisbee is booming so much that it is reported that more money goes in and out of the town in one day than in El Paso in one week.\n\nMost of the population is Catholic, and they go about the work of building a church with their own hands for their new parish of St. Patrick.\n\nWith the encouragement of Bishop Henry Granjon, they also construct a school building with accommodations for 40 boarding pupils and eight grades.\n\nThe school is waiting for teachers, and it is on behalf of his flock in Bisbee that Bishop Granjon contacts the Sisters of Loretto of the Foot of the Cross to ask if they will staff a Catholic school for the children of the miners.\n\nThe Bishop writes the Sisters that St. Patrick Parish is \"one of the best congregations in the Diocese and the most promising.\"\n\n\"The spirit is excellent,\" he tells the Sisters, \"and I have no doubt that the people, both Catholics and non- Catholics, would welcome your Sisters heartily and act generously toward them.\"\n\nAnd that is exactly what the people of Bisbee did when in 1907 five Sisters arrived and opened Loretto School and Loretto Academy with an enrollment of 145.\n\nFather Bonaventura Oblasser\n\nIt is 1911 and a young Franciscan priest is gazing out over the desert surrounding Mission San Xavier del Bac near Tucson.\n\nFather Bonaventura Oblasser is 26-years-old, and he is not where he thought he would be.\n\nHis heart had been set on becoming a missionary to China, but instead the Franciscans have sent him to the Papago People in Arizona.\n\nFather Bonaventura immediately set out on a personal mission under the motto of \"Every Catholic child in a Catholic school.\"\n\nHe establishes a structure of Catholic day schools on the huge reservation. Each large village with a mission church would have a school that children from outlying villages would go to each day on a school bus.\n\nThis is at a time when the government's prevailing educational system for Native Americans was boarding schools off the reservations.\n\n\"The family is where the child belongs,\" says Father Bonaventura.\n\nA staunch supporter and advocate for the rights of Native Americans, an innovator in education for Native Americans, a much beloved priest and pretty good school bus mechanic, Father Bonaventura, the \"Padre to the Papagos,\" ministered for 56 years with the Tohono O'odham People until his death in 1967.\n\nTruly, he is one of the \"saints\" of our Diocese.\n\nHistorical Day In Douglas\n\nIt is Sept. 1, 1924, and it is an historic day indeed in Douglas, where Bishop Daniel J. Gercke is ready to dedicate the first school of his two-year episcopacy as Bishop of Tucson.\n\nIt is a grand occasion, with priests and sisters from as far away as Texas and New Mexico and the Bishop of El Paso gathered with the Catholics and the entire community of Douglas.\n\nA very special guest is Mrs. William Brophy, for it is through her kindness and generosity that the beautiful and spacious Loretto School has been constructed and is awaiting Bishop Gercke\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe next day, classes began for 231 students in nine grades.\n\nSearch For Teachers\n\nIt is 1929, and the just completed Immaculate Conception School in Yuma is ready to open. But there is just one problem: no teachers.\n\nThere has been no Catholic school in Yuma for 40 years, and all the enthusiasm of Yuma's Catholics in building their new school is turning into discouragement as Father Felician Payas' entreaties to religious communities around the country to come to Yuma go unanswered.\n\nFather Felician announces a public novena to St. Joseph for the special intention of securing teachers.\n\nOn the eighth day of the novena, Father Felician receives a letter from Mother Mary Inez of the Franciscan Sisters of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, informing him that she would come to Yuma to see what the prospects might be.\n\nShe made the visit, toured the school and experienced the enthusiasm.\n\nIn September of 1930, four Sisters from Wisconsin arrived, and in just two weeks Immaculate Conception School opened with 72 students in three grades.\n\nTough Going At First\n\nIt is 1931 in Tucson, and the community's second parochial school has just opened its doors.\n\nIt is the parochial school of Sts. Peter and Paul Parish, and even in the hard times of the Great Depression, Father Joseph Patterson and his parishioners have the faith that the new school will make it.\n\nIt is a tough go at first. Parents have a wait-and-see attitude. They want to see the school in action with other parents' children before they send their own.\n\nAnd then there is the transportation issue. The parish and its new school are just too far away for parents to drive back and forth each day.\n\nFather Patterson soon fixes that problem. He buys a school bus, and then another one.\n\nThe school begins to thrive.\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes Academy\n\nIt is September of 1940 in Nogales, and Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in the border town has been dedicated by Father Louis Duval, pastor of Sacred Heart Parish, and is ready for its first students.\n\nThe school is housed a novitiate that had been built in 1926 by the Bishop of Sonora during the persecution of the Church in Mexico.\n\nOn the first day of classes, the Minim Daughters of Mary Immaculate from Leon, Mexico, welcomed eight girls and 10 boys as boarding students and 275 day pupils.\n\nSt. Ambrose School\n\nIt is September of 1949, and classes at St. Ambrose School on Tucson Boulevard have begun, but without desks, blackboards and bulletin boards.\n\nIt took a couple of weeks before those furnishings arrived, but it was a great first year that ended on May 26, 1950, with a Mass and a May procession and crowning of Mary's statue.\n\nSt. John School\n\nIt is Nov. 26, 1950, and Bishop Gercke is dedicating a \"90-day wonder\" at St. John the Evangelist Parish on Tucson's south side.\n\nSt. John School had opened in September after construction of its buildings had been completed in just 90 days.\n\nEveryone worked on the construction: dads, moms, children, priests and sisters all had a hand in laying brick and pouring concrete.\n\nSt. John's School even featured the new-fangled green chalkboards in its classrooms.\n\nBright Future Ahead\n\nThere is so much more to write about the history of our Catholic Schools in the Diocese of Tucson.\n\nJust the banner year of 1950 alone, with St. Anthony in Casa Grande and Salpointe High School in Tucson, would take far more space than I have here.\n\nLet me close by saying that we are making history today even as we face daunting financial challenges to sustain and expand our Catholic Schools.\n\nThe need for Catholic Schools is as urgent or even more urgent than in the past.\n\nOur Catholic Schools not only prepare young people for their future, they instill in them the faith that will sustain them in that future.\n\nIt took many hands and great sacrifice to build the schools in our Diocese over these past two and a half centuries, and now, as Catholics living in the first decade of the New Millennium, it is our awesome responsibility and opportunity to provide our gifts, talents, and resources to the ministry of our Catholic schools.\n\nWe, too, will leave our mark on the \"Legacy of Faith\" that we treasure today: Our Catholic Schools.\n\nMay God bless you!", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A comprehensive history of our Catholic Schools in the Diocese of Tucson has yet to be written, but the glimpses we have of that history suggest that someone who might want to take on the task woul...", "author": "Most Rev.
