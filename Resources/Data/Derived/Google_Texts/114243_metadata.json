High on the Republican agenda is the goal of convincing women to counter President Obama and vote for their congressional and gubernatorial candidates.\n\nUsually, the opposition party has the advantage in the non-presidential midterm elections. But in this instance Democrats may in fact have greater appeal, especially among young, minority and low-income women voters. In 2012, President Obama enjoyed an 18 pointgender gap, according to exit polls.\n\nNow, Democratic Party operatives are trying to mobilize even more women voters, especially the minority women who have so strongly supported their platform. They are casting women in starring roles and hoping that by running high-profile female candidates, they will take back important governor\u2019s mansions and keep their fragile majority in the Senate. One of their stars, for example, is the famous Wendy Davis of Texas, who captured the nation\u2019s attention when she spoke for 11 hours, standing the whole time in pink running shoes, in order to prevent a vote on an anti-abortion law. She is now running for governor. Her candidacy is a long-shot, but her war chest is bulging with donations from all over the nation precisely because she championed women\u2019s reproductive rights in the heart of the Republican South.\n\nDemocrats in general are associated with defending women\u2019s reproductive health care and choices about abortion. Republicans, by contrast, have done just the opposite. Right now there are 700 bills sponsored by Republicans in state legislatures, all intended to restrict women\u2019s access to contraception and abortion. Determined to repeal both Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and women\u2019s reproduction rights, Republicans have flooded the courts with efforts to accomplish both. As a result, the Supreme Court recently announced that it will decide whether employers can refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, as is required by Obama\u2019s new health coverage. The Court\u2019s willingness to hear arguments will once again draw the nation\u2019s attention to the issue of contraception and abortion. If the court rules against the President\u2019s health plan, according to Professor Carole Joffe, a sociologist and expert on women\u2019s reproduction health and policy, \u201cmillions of women will lose access to this essential health care service.\u201d\n\nAnother reason women might vote for Democrats is that access to abortion has gradually disappeared in many parts of the United States. As Joffe points out, \u201cBecause of very severe restrictions put in place by numerous state legislatures, such as requiring clinics to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on physical plant upgrades that have no impact on patient safety, and requiring clinic doctors to have privileges at local hospitals, many clinics have already had to close.\u201d So many clinics have closed in Texas, she notes, that \u201csome women on the border are hundreds of miles from any abortion facility. A number of states are down to one clinic, and their status is in the hands of the courts. 2014 will likely see even more clinic closures.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just women\u2019s reproductive rights that could persuade women to cast their votes for Democrats. Single mothers and other women among the 99% have watched as Republicans have slashed welfare, social services, and education in the name of taming government spending. They have heard Republicans describe them as shiftless and lazy and watched them vote to cut the very food stamps that women \u2013 living on the edge, often working several jobs \u2013 need to keep their families together.\n\nIn short, if middle class and poor women are paying attention and turn out to vote \u2013 and that\u2019s always a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 they may very well vote against Republicans who have opposed reproductive rights, fought to repeal health care for the uninsured, and sought to cut food stamps.\n\nIn 2008 and 2012,President Obama won two presidential elections in Virginia \u2013 once viewed as a reliably Republican state \u2013 by a tiny margin. More recently, Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, won the Virginia governor\u2019s race by bombarding the public with messages that highlighted Republican efforts to ban contraception and abortion. In the end, he beat his Republican candidate among unmarried women voters by 42 percentage points, according to exit polling.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, are well aware of their \u201cfemale\u201d troubles. How do you run a campaign on a record of trying to unravel the safety net, chip away at women\u2019s reproductive rights and cut food stamps to hungry families? Ron Bonjean, a GOP strategist,acknowledges that \u201cthe 2012 election showed that we have problems with female issues. There is a widespread recognition by Republican strategists that this needs to change \u2013 as soon as possible.\u201d Women\u2019s advocacy groups agree. They know that women\u2019s support for pay equity and health care in particular, gives Democrats a tremendous advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep problem for the Republicans,\u201d says Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nAlthough a flurry of media stories have described women buying guns for self-protection, Republicans may also lose some women\u2019s votes due to their growing support of serious gun control. A recent poll revealed that the random massacre in 2012 of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has caused some women to re-think their beliefs about gun control. Democratic women often skip the midterm elections, but the poll revealed \u201cthat a subset of women voters who usually don\u2019t vote in midterm elections are more likely to vote in 2014 on the issue of gun violence.\u201d \u201cAs we approach the 2014 congressional elections,\u201d saysDemocratic pollster Diane Feldman, \u201cthe question will be to what degree do single women, lower income women, and persons of color participate, since that\u2019s the Democratic edge,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is an issue that can encourage them to participate.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans know this, and are seriously worried about how closely they are allied to the powerful National Rifle Association. Rep. Steve LaTourette (OH), a somewhat moderate leader in the Republican Party, recently warned his party that their refusal to support gun control could cause them to lose votes. \u201cIf the GOP is seen as being in the pocket of the NRA,\u201d he said, \u201cit could cost the party big with women in future elections.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. The Republican Party, now dominated by the political agenda of Tea Party extremists in their party, as well as their threats to unseat moderate Republicans, has become associated with a certain wacko fringe political element, which is particularly unsettling to some women. When a Republican uses the words \u201clegitimate rape\u201d to describe how a woman\u2019s body would \u201cnaturally\u201d reject the sperm of a rapist, eyes roll and Republicans lose even more credibility among women voters.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans really cared about woman, says a former director of Obama\u2019s last political campaign, \u201cthey would promote policies that encourage family-friendly fairness in the workplace. Many pregnant women in America receive no protection if they need physical accommodations during their pregnancy, and can be fired if they cannot stand all day during their shift or lift heavy items. This disproportionally affects low-income women who have service jobs.\u201d As does child care and paid parental leave, which neither party wants to address.\n\nRepublicans have a tough road ahead of them. They could, of course, promise to raise the minimum wage, expand training programs for women, create affordable housing, endorse pay equity and ensure that women earn more than 77% of men\u2019s wages. But none of this is likely to happen.\n\nStill, not all Republicans are running scared. A recent poll showed that former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton is deadlocked in a hypothetical presidential race in 2016 with New Jersey\u2019s Republican Governor, Chris Christie. \u201cHe performs particularly well among independents, winning nearly six in 10 in that key group,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said about Christie. \u201cHe also wins a majority of suburbanites and older voters, something that no other GOP hopeful (that was) tested was able to do against Clinton.\u201d\n\nBut these are not the people who put President Obama in office. And if more media storiessurface about his bullying behaviour, Christie may end up reminding too many women of the first husbands.\n\nRepublicans still have a serious \u201cfemale\u201d problem. Democrats have already staked out a winning strategy \u2013 to raise the minimum wage, an appealing policy that cuts across most of the middle class, and certainly those who work at subsistence wages in service jobs. So, unless Democrats fail to mobilize disgruntled women voters, they may have found a winning strategy to sweep the midterm elections.\n\nThe Republican\u2019s problem is clear: it\u2019s difficult to vilify women, immigrants, minorities and low-income citizens for eight years and then ask them to elect you to political office. That, in fact, is the definition of true Chutzpah.\n\nRuth Rosen, a journalist and historian, is professor emerita of history at the University of California, Davis and a visiting professor of public policy and history at UC Berkeley.
