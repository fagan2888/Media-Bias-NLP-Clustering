Their marriage the following year was brief - they separated less than three months later - and little correspondence exists from their time together.\n\nJones remarried a few years after the divorce and raised a family in the Texas Panhandle, where she kept a low profile on her previous relationship. Her grandson only learned of his family\u2019s indirect link to Rayburn after her death more than 30 years ago and kept the letter close until he was recently interviewed for the yet-unreleased Rayburn documentary.\n\n\u201cShe never talked about it when she was alive,\u201d said 56-year-old Jeff Neely III, who received the letter from his parents after asking them for a picture of his grandmother.\n\nRayburn, described by biographers as personally private, married Jones at age 45, already in the eighth term of an eventual 48-plus-year congressional career that would see him reign as House speaker for a record 20 years, ending with his death in 1961.\n\nIn the letter, Rayburn alludes to his mother being \u201cfrail\u201d and in \u201cweakness.\u201d\n\nJones and Rayburn married in October 1927, eight months after his mother\u2019s death. Their divorce quietly became official a year later, then was nearly eradicated from Rayburn\u2019s very visible public life.\n\nRayburn never remarried. But Jones, 26 at the time of the nuptials, later married Jeff Neely and raised their family in Amarillo. She died in 1982 at age 81.\n\nDon Bacon, who co-wrote a 1987 Rayburn biography, said Metze Neely refused multiple interview requests and acknowledges the letter adds to the \u201cvery little documentation of their relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither one spoke of it after the divorce,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cAnd in his district, up around Bonham, most folks never knew of it. They didn\u2019t even know he had been married. \u2026 He never had a serious romance after that.\u201d\n\nIn the letter - which includes an attached one-page postscript - Rayburn\u2019s broad script tells of his fondness for her father and almost poetically laments how it\u2019s difficult for him to find words to express his condolences.\n\n\u201cI must write you a word but what shall I say - Oh! How shallow words, how paltry to convey a deep feeling - but let me say that in your sorrow unseen hands are extended toward you and would, if possible, brush away the clouds that are about you.\u201d\n\nBacon and co-author D.B. Hardeman included a chapter about the marriage in their book, suggesting the new Mrs. Rayburn immediately disliked the Washington apartment he had selected for them. She also objected to her husband and his colleagues guzzling free-flowing liquor during Prohibition, and engaged in at least a couple public spats with him. Two months and 25 days after their wedding, she left for Texas.\n\nReed Penney, who\u2019s producing a Rayburn documentary and learned of the letter after interviewing Jeff Neely III, has suggested the document be donated to the University of Texas Briscoe Center for American History, which includes a Rayburn museum in Bonham and a collection of Rayburn documents in Austin.\n\nBriscoe spokesman Benjamin Wright said the center would be delighted to have the letter, since its holdings primarily are political rather than personal.\n\nJeff Neely III has yet to decide its fate. He has been keeping the letter in a cabinet with a copy of Rayburn\u2019s biography and is considering framing it.\n\nBut like so many others who have researched Rayburn\u2019s life, he acknowledges the rare note still does little to explain his grandmother\u2019s short chapter in Rayburn\u2019s long public life.\n\n\u201cIt was a total mystery to me,\u201d Neely III said. \u201cNobody knows what happened.\n\n\u201cThey took the secret to their graves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A two-page note handwritten nearly 90 years ago by former House Speaker Sam Rayburn begins: \"My Dearest Metze.\" It concludes with: \"My heart is sad with you - My love too.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A two-page note handwritten nearly 90 years ago by former House Speaker Sam Rayburn begins: \u201cMy Dearest Metze.\u201d It concludes with: \u201cMy heart is sad with you - My love too.\u201d", "title": "Letter provides peek at personal Sam Rayburn", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/16/letter-provides-peek-at-personal-sam-rayburn/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/9313cfc41e61f7205c0f6a706700b47a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/9313cfc41e61f7205c0f6a706700b47a.jpg", "description": "A two-page note handwritten nearly 90 years ago by former House Speaker Sam Rayburn begins: \"My Dearest Metze.\" It concludes with: \"My heart is sad with you - My love too.\"", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Letter provides peek at personal Sam Rayburn"}, "Author": "MICHAEL GRACZYK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2354\"", "article_summary": "In the letter, Rayburn alludes to his mother being \u201cfrail\u201d and in \u201cweakness.\u201dJones and Rayburn married in October 1927, eight months after his mother\u2019s death.\n\u201cIt was a total mystery to me,\u201d Neely III said.\nJeff Neely III has yet to decide its fate.\n\u201cShe never talked about it when she was alive,\u201d said 56-year-old Jeff Neely III, who received the letter from his parents after asking them for a picture of his grandmother.\nBriscoe spokesman Benjamin Wright said the center would be delighted to have the letter, since its holdings primarily are political rather than personal."}
