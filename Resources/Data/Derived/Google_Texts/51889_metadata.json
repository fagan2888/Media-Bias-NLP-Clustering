Yesterday saw primary votes in six states, but not your usual boring primaries. This time the future of the Republican Party was on the line.\n\n5/21/2014: JOHN BERMAN: Is the Tea Party over? CAROL COSTELLO: Across the nation, establishment Republicans seemingly tamed the Tea Party. RON FOURNIER: The establishment won last night. BROOKE BALDWIN: Those Tea Party Republicans, they got spanked, shellacked. Purple-nurpled! Swirlied throughout the nation, Tea Party titties were twisted. For proof the Tea Party is finished, look no further than Kentucky.\n\nJONATHAN KARL (5/21/2014): McConnell was the #1 Republican target for Tea Party groups around the country, and he easily beat back Matt Bevin, a self-styled Tea Partier. Ah! I believe we have some footage from that race.\n\nBUGS BUNNY: But I just left you! How did ya get up here anyway? TURTLE: Oh, just runnin'. (in turtle voice) \"I also got a million dollars from the Chamber of Commerce. So that helped in my race. Ah-yup.\" Mitch McConnell, the ultimate mainstream establishment Republican handily defeating the Tea Party extremist. Once more, keeping the government out of the hands of crazies who say things like, \"President Obama's destroying the Constitution!\"\n\nSEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (3/6/2014): The President of the United States is treating our Constitution worse than a place mat at Denny's. Or those insane people who say we have to repeal Obamacare!\n\nSEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (2/4/2014): If I had my way about it, we'd repeal Obamacare. Or just the general Tea Party obstructionist pistol-waving alarmist rhetoric.\n\nSEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (12/11/2012): Government spending is completely and totally out of control. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (5/16/2013): This is runaway government at its worst. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (10/20/2013): Obamacare is the worst piece of legislation that's been passed in the last half-century. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (11/4/2010): Deny President Obama a second term. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (4/25/2013): Stop this train wreck. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, R-KY (3/6/2014): (holding rifle in air as \"Livin' on a Prayer\" plays) (audience laughter) So yeah! Take that, Tea Party! Doesn't seem like the Tea Party so much lost, as found a new host.\n\nJason Jones then filed another piece on how badly corrupt the media is in India when it comes to political reporting . What is considered scandalous here in the U.S. is considered par for the course there.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen also touched upon McConnell's win, but mostly focused on the crazy fringe candidates in the Idaho GOP gubernatorial debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe then noted the outbreak of MERS in the U.S.\n\nStephen talked with actor Patrick Stewart, and Jon talked with former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who got two segments, but of course it still went long, and boy did it! Here's the unedited interview in FIVE parts. Total length of Jon's interview? Over FORTY-TWO MINUTES!\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\n\n\nNow, to properly punish Mitch McConnell for becoming an extremist, if it wasn't obvious already, help Alison Lundergan Grimes beat him this November.\n\nDonate to her campaign.\n\nInvite your friends.\n\nJoin her team to get updates about her campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Last night, Jon Stewart explained how Sen.
