Parents can expect to pay $16,500 in Massachusetts, $11,628 in California and $12,500 in Illinois, according to Child Care Aware of America. The necessity to keep working, a reality for most parents of young kids, often makes the quality of the child care center a secondary concern, advocates say.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Center for American Progress, a popular source of policy ideas for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, is releasing a new a policy proposal to help ease this common strain: A new \u201chigh-quality\u201d child care tax credit, worth up to $14,000 per child.\n\nThe proposal would target low- and moderate-income families. Under the plan, the tax credit would be advanced to families on a monthly basis and paid directly to child care providers. The centers, selected by parents, would qualify for the federal money only if they met the state\u2019s minimum quality standards.\n\nFor the poorest families -- up to those earning $32,253, or 133 percent of the poverty line, for a family of four -- the tax credit would be worth $13,340 a year, requiring a family contribution of $660, or 2 percent of income. Families of four earning $97,000, or 400 percent of the poverty line, would be eligible for a $2,360 tax credit, requiring a family contribution of $11,640, or 12 percent. The amount of the family contribution increases with income.\n\n\n\nProvided by the Center for American Progress\n\nParents would have to earn income to qualify. Those who are out of work may qualify for other federal subsidies, though many are stuck on financial aid waiting lists that stretch thousands of names long. Some simply don't know the help exists -- a hurdle advocates say can be cleared with more community outreach. Only 18 percent of children eligible to receive assistance under federal rules receive the vouchers, according to the Department of Human and Health Services.\n\n\"Our childcare subsidy system doesn't come anywhere near serving all the kids who need help,\" said Joan Entmacher, vice president for Family Economic Security at the National Women's Law Center.\n\nThe CAP authors don't specify how the program would be paid for. Restructuring the tax system and closing \"wasteful loopholes,\" however, would help cover the costs, said Carmel Martin, CAP's executive vice president for policy.\n\nThe plan, available for any candidate\u2019s consideration, could influence Hillary Clinton\u2019s next move on child care. It\u2019s a more aggressive approach than other pushes, such as attempts from liberal lawmakers to make the existing Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, meaning people with low incomes could benefit from the full value of the tax credit even if they have limited income tax due. Clinton's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, weary of increasing spending, have not supported similar measures.\n\nWhy Hillary Clinton made gender such a big deal in her first major economic speech\n\nThe CAP idea is more moderate than what Clinton\u2019s top challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pledged to do: Tax the wealthy to fund public child care. (Martin O\u2019Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore, has also called for universal childcare but hasn\u2019t yet voiced a way to pay for it.)\n\nClinton has said widening access to child care would benefit the economy.\n\n\"Another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: Breaking down barriers so more Americans can participate more fully in the workforce, especially women,\u201d Clinton proclaimed in July during her first major economic speech. \u201cWe are in a global competition and we can\u2019t afford to leave talent on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nThe issue has never reached more prominence in the national conversation, said Neera Tanden, president of CAP and former policy director for Clinton. \u201cThe facts on the ground are getting harder and harder for parents to take,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system we have obviously doesn\u2019t meet the needs of children.\u201d\n\nThe surprising number of parents scaling back at work to care for kids\n\nThe flow of cash would spark three desirable outcomes, the CAP authors said. Parents could afford daycare without worrying about their kids\u2019 safety, providers would have a new incentive to operate at high-quality level and more quality centers would enter the market.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Candidates say costly daycare is a drag on economic growth.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Candidates say costly daycare is a drag on economic growth.", "title": "This could be the new big idea about childcare from Democrats", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/02/this-could-be-the-new-big-idea-about-childcare-from-democrats/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/09/bb1.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpaqreport"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/02/this-could-be-the-new-big-idea-about-childcare-from-democrats/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "The plan, available for any candidate\u2019s consideration, could influence Hillary Clinton\u2019s next move on child care.\nUnder the plan, the tax credit would be advanced to families on a monthly basis and paid directly to child care providers.\nParents can expect to pay $16,500 in Massachusetts, $11,628 in California and $12,500 in Illinois, according to Child Care Aware of America.\nThe necessity to keep working, a reality for most parents of young kids, often makes the quality of the child care center a secondary concern, advocates say.\nClinton has said widening access to child care would benefit the economy."}
