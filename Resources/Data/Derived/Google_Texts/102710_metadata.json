That's when the school resource officer got involved. According to police, Craft also refused to give up his vape-pen to the officer. Police said he then became verbally abusive and attempted to push the officer out of the way to get on the school bus.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell whether Craft was \u201cverbally abusive\u201d\u2014or what that even means\u2014though he does appear to be arguing with the officer. Did he \u201cattempt to push the officer out of the way\u201d? He\u2019s blocked from view in the video for a single second in which that might have happened, but it must have been a pretty slight push. The ensuing assault doesn\u2019t seem justified to me.\n\nThere was also some confusion over whether the teen had been suspended. His mother told local reporters that administrators had suspended him for 10 days, but the school told me that simply wasn\u2019t true; Craft is not suspended, and was never suspended, according to a spokesperson for Mentor High.\n\nThe district is investigating the incident, and the officer will be on leave from the school until a determination is made about whether his actions were appropriate.\n\nAs for the charges against Craft: They are likely to do him a lot more harm than a few puffs from an e-cig.\n\nWatch the video here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Watch the video and decide for yourself.", "title": "What's Worse for This Teen's Health: Smoking an E-Cig, or Getting Tackled, Arrested, and Charged?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/15/whats-worse-for-this-teens-health-smokin", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14291205664235.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch the video and decide for yourself.", "creator": "@robbysoave", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14291205664235.jpg", "title": "What's Worse for This Teen's Health: Smoking an E-Cig, or Getting Tackled, Arrested, and Charged?", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2015-04-15T19:01:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe052d\"", "article_summary": "Police said he then became verbally abusive and attempted to push the officer out of the way to get on the school bus.\nSixteen-year-old James Craft of Mentor, Ohio, will be charged with persistent disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and a tobacco violation after the student was shoved and tackled by a school resources officer at Mentor High School.\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell whether Craft was \u201cverbally abusive\u201d\u2014or what that even means\u2014though he does appear to be arguing with the officer.\nAccording to newsnet5.com:Police said Craft ignored instruction from the principal to hand over his e-cigarette because the smoking devices are not allowed on school property.\nAs for the charges against Craft: They are likely to do him a lot more harm than a few puffs from an e-cig."}
