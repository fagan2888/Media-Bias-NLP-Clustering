And organized labor has over Obamacare.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s largest unions, including the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, believe the new health care law could jeopardize health plans for workers across the country.\n\nFrom high-wage construction workers to low-wage restaurant workers, 20 million employees get their health insurance through something known as Taft-Hartley plans. That\u2019s where unions and employers get together and pay in for coverage.\n\nMarquette University Law Professor Paul Secunda says Obamacare makes those plans really expensive for companies. \u201cIt might make more sense for employers to stop offering the Taft-Hartley plans, instead allow their employees to go on the state healthcare exchanges,\u201d he says.\n\nSecunda says not only would that mean workers end up with less generous coverage, it threatens the basic value of the unions.\n\n\u201cOne of the thing that employees look to unions for -- the ability to get all sorts of employee benefits, but maybe most importantly health insurance benefits -- will no longer be something the unions can no longer offer in this environment,\u201d he says.\n\nWith so much at stake, union leaders are pressing the Obama administration to protect the plans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there is anything the administration can do about it,\u201d says Washington and Lee professor Timothy Jost.\n\nUnions argue that if their workers could receive subsidies to help cover the cost, that would keep the Taft-Hartleys alive.\n\nJost says something like that requires an act of Congress.\n\n\u201cAnd right now, at least the House doesn\u2019t seem very inclined to help unions,\u201d he adds.\n\nIronically, Jost says, unions -- who backed Obamacare from the beginning -- get hurt, while for-profit health plans like Aetna and United will end up making a lot of money thanks to the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/09/02/health-care/move-over-business-owners-labor-unhappy-about-obamacare-too", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/strikeshadow.jpg?itok=756Xln7n", "type": "article", "description": "Labor unions are unhappy with provisions in the Affordable Care Act that could tax their members' health coverage.", "title": "Move over, business owners: Labor is unhappy about Obamacare, too"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "d/yLe5fcJSA9UQnfsvgH6zOgP0xzFpcGlnhn70qF3vhQkwMDspC20Ps0Vlo52IStBLp3WfpSoYDEY+8LnPcnAw==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf637\"", "article_summary": "From high-wage construction workers to low-wage restaurant workers, 20 million employees get their health insurance through something known as Taft-Hartley plans.\nAnd organized labor has over Obamacare.\nMarquette University Law Professor Paul Secunda says Obamacare makes those plans really expensive for companies.\nIronically, Jost says, unions -- who backed Obamacare from the beginning -- get hurt, while for-profit health plans like Aetna and United will end up making a lot of money thanks to the ACA.\nSome of the nation\u2019s largest unions, including the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, believe the new health care law could jeopardize health plans for workers across the country."}
