However, the amendment does not apply to the Affordable Care Act, which has its own sources of funding, rather than seeking funding through the annual appropriations bills.\n\nDebates over abortion funding in the 2010 health care law threatened to prevent its passage, as a group of pro-life Democrats said they would only support the legislation if abortion funding were excluded.\n\nIn response, President Obama promised an executive order to ban this funding. At the time, numerous pro-life groups warned that the order was legally unenforceable and would have no actual impact on the legislation.\n\nBut a September report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office \u2013 an independent government watchdog \u2013 found that the executive order had not been followed, and federal subsidies were funding abortions in more than 1,000 health plans across the country.\n\nThe report found that in five separate states, all of the plans that were offered on the health care insurance exchanges covered abortion. In addition, the stipulation that abortion coverage be funded through a separate surcharge was not followed by many health issuers.\n\nGenevieve Plaster of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said that of the 5.4 million who purchased health insurance on the exchanges in 2014, 87 percent used federal subsidies to pay for their coverage. Many of these health plans covered abortions, she added.\n\nThe website was created as a response to this problem, the joint project of the Family Research Council and the Charlotte Lozier Institute. It attempts to inform customers whether or not their health plan on the exchanges for 2015 covers abortion.\n\nSome things have changed already for the 2015 year. Plaster noted that one insurance company has already \u201cchanged over all of its individual exchange plans to now cover elective abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to public funding for abortion, the new 2015 Open Enrollment is at least as bad \u2013 and probably worse \u2013 than last year,\u201d Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated at the press conference.\n\nAccording to Grossu, for 2015 \u201cmost likely\u201d all the health plans cover abortions in four separate states \u2013 Hawaii, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Vermont \u2013 and in five others almost all of the plans will \u201cmost likely\u201d cover abortions.\n\nInformation on abortion coverage on the health exchanges was very hard to come by, Plaster added.\n\n\u201cMost summaries of benefits and coverage,\u201d she noted, \u201cwere completely silent on abortion coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was referred back and forth on phone calls within insurance departments and between companies and the exchanges themselves, sometimes to no avail,\u201d she said. \u201cThe current administration and Department of Health and Human Services seem to have made no effort to enforce transparency in the exchanges and with health insurance carriers about abortions,\u201d she concluded.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic News Agency", "description": "A new website informing Americans whether or not their health plans cover abortion is up and running, with advocates saying it provides the transparency in the health care law that the government failed to deliver.", "title": "Website shines light on which health plans cover abortion", "url": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/website-shines-light-on-which-health-plans-cover-abortion-93173/", "image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/President_Obama_delivers_remarks_on_the_health_insurance_reform_bill_March_23_2010_Credit_Official_White_House_Photo_by_Pete_Souza_CNA_US_Catholic_News_3_20_12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new website informing Americans whether or not their health plans cover abortion is up and running, with advocates saying it provides the transparency in the health care law that the government failed to deliver.", "title": "Website shines light on which health plans cover abortion", "image": {"src": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/President_Obama_delivers_remarks_on_the_health_insurance_reform_bill_March_23_2010_Credit_Official_White_House_Photo_by_Pete_Souza_CNA_US_Catholic_News_3_20_12.jpg"}, "creator": "@cnalive", "site": "@cnalive", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 32422915}, "fb": {"app_id": 1502824986641800}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": ".- A new website informing Americans whether or not their health plans cover abortion is up and running, with advocates saying it provides the transparency in the health care law that the government failed to deliver.\nAccording to Grossu, for 2015 \u201cmost likely\u201d all the health plans cover abortions in four separate states \u2013 Hawaii, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Vermont \u2013 and in five others almost all of the plans will \u201cmost likely\u201d cover abortions.\nThe report found that in five separate states, all of the plans that were offered on the health care insurance exchanges covered abortion.\nDebates over abortion funding in the 2010 health care law threatened to prevent its passage, as a group of pro-life Democrats said they would only support the legislation if abortion funding were excluded.\nInformation on abortion coverage on the health exchanges was very hard to come by, Plaster added."}
