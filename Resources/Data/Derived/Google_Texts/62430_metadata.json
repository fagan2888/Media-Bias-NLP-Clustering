White House officials had worried that the court\u2019s more conservative members might emerge victorious with a far more restrictive view of presidential power. They did not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re, of course, deeply disappointed in today\u2019s decision,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said. \u201cWe are, however, pleased that the court recognized the president\u2019s executive authority as exercised by presidents going all the way back to George Washington.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama had tried to maneuver around longstanding Republican efforts to block his appointments to the National Labor Relations Board by seating members during pro forma sessions of the Senate when almost all of the senators were at home in their districts and no legislative business was conducted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe court ruled that the president\u2019s action violated the Constitution and said that the Senate and House have the ultimate power to block such recess appointments by scheduling the mini-sessions when they want to.\n\nBut the justices for the first time recognized the basic right of the president to make appointments without the consent of the Senate when the Congress is in an extended recess during a two-year session, as it often is during the summer, around Christmas and in the spring.\n\nRepublicans said the decision amounted to a rebuke of the president at a time when they are arguing that Mr. Obama is repeatedly exceeding his authority to get around a Congress that does not do what he wants it to.\n\n\u201cHe picks and chooses what parts of the Constitution and duly passed legislation he wants to enforce or follow,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming majority leader in the House. \u201cThe president\u2019s attempt at illegitimate administrative appointments is a prime example of overreach. This bolsters the case for the House to take further action to ensure our laws are properly executed and our freedoms are protected.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the court\u2019s decision made it clear that \u201cPresident Obama acted without any legitimate authority.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes a day after Speaker John A. Boehner said he would seek legislation allowing the House to sue Mr. Obama over the president\u2019s use of executive actions. Republicans say Mr. Obama has exceeded his authority, pointing to the president\u2019s delaying of some parts of the Affordable Care Act and his granting of deportation deferrals to some immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nWhite House officials have dismissed Mr. Boehner\u2019s threats of a lawsuit as a stunt, saying that Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions are based on the president\u2019s well-established powers. They argue that the president has the right to act on behalf of the American people where he can.\n\nMr. Earnest said the president \u201cremains committed to using every element of his executive authority to make progress on behalf of middle-class families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe president is in no way considering scaling back\u201d his executive actions, he continued.\n\nBut the decision underscores how the question of presidential power is not always clear cut.\n\nIn 2007, Democratic Senate leaders began holding the pro forma sessions \u2014 in which a single Washington-area member gavels the Senate in and out of session for 30 seconds every three days \u2014 to block recess appointments by President George W. Bush.\n\nThe practice was continued after 2010, when Republicans took control of the House and effectively forced the Senate to continue holding the pro forma sessions. The Constitution says in Article 1, Section 5, that \u201cneither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days.\u201d\n\nBut in January 2012, after trying unsuccessfully to persuade Republicans to allow appointments to the labor board as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mr. Obama\u2019s legal team decided that the tiny, pro forma sessions did not really count, and that he had the authority to choose members for those panels without congressional approval.\n\nThe legal theory had never been tested, but former White House officials involved in the internal legal discussions said that Mr. Obama believed that putting people on the panels was important enough to force a legal test of his powers, even if it meant that those powers might ultimately be curtailed by the court.\n\nIn the first test of the White House theory, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that Mr. Obama \u2014 and any president \u2014 had the power to make recess appointments only in the period between the two-year sessions of Congress. And they ruled that only vacancies that occurred every two years could be filled.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected that view, ruling that presidents can make appointments during recesses that occur in the middle of a two-year session. But justices limited the president\u2019s power by saying that Congress has broad authority to define when it is in session and when it is not.\n\n\u201cThe court affirmed the president\u2019s long-recognized constitutional authority to make recess appointments when the Senate is in recess for a period of at least 10 days,\u201d said Kathryn Ruemmler, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s White House counsel until recently.\n\nStill, the court did reject the legal theory advanced by Ms. Ruemmler and Mr. Obama, handing Republicans the ability to argue that the president had overreached.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140626163018, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans hailed the decision on recess appointments as a repudiation of what they called President Obama\u2019s abuse of his constitutional power.", "title": "Decision by Justices Opens a New Debate on the Limits of Presidential Power", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/us/politics/justices-decision-opens-fresh-debate-on-limits-of-presidential-power.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002965995"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "shearm", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-cellphone-privacy-decision-1403716252176/annotated-supreme-court-cellphone-privacy-decision-1403716252176-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/us/politics/justices-decision-opens-fresh-debate-on-limits-of-presidential-power.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002965995", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/us/politics/justices-decision-opens-fresh-debate-on-limits-of-presidential-power.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 26, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Supreme Court (US),Presidents and Presidency (US),Appointments and Executive Changes,Obama  Barack,United States Politics and Government,Constitution (US),Republican Party,Washington (DC),Executive Orders and Memorandums", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
