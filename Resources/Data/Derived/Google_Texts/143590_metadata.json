Big companies saw the market potential and sank millions of dollars into ads. The most basic do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of marketing to Latinos in the U.S. have been understood for years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cohesive campaign targeted to Hispanics.\u201d\n\nSo when California officials started thinking about how to persuade the state\u2019s Latino population to enroll in health care plans, they should have had a blueprint of what to do. Instead, they made a series of mistakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cohesive campaign targeted to Hispanics,\u201d says Bessie Ramirez of the Los Angeles-based Santiago Solutions Group, a Hispanic market research firm that has consulted for large health care clients like HealthNet, Cigna and Blue Cross.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it seems obvious that the launch of this program seemed to have actually turned a blind eye to what the needs of this particular consumer were,\u201d she says.\n\nFor example, one thing health policy experts love about Obamacare is that no one can be denied coverage for a pre-existing health condition. Covered California made this a selling point in almost all its Spanish ads. But that doesn\u2019t resonate with Latinos. Many have never had insurance, never considered it.\n\nRamirez says another problem is that all the early TV ads end with a web address for Covered California \u2014 no phone number or physical address. She says that completely misses how Hispanics like to shop, especially for a complicated product like health insurance.\n\n\u201cHispanics are heavily on the Internet, and they\u2019re growing very fast on the Internet; however they\u2019re not transacting on the Internet,\u201d Ramirez notes. \u201cThey transact on a personal basis. Hispanics will wait to go to a 7-11 until 11 o\u2019clock. Because at 11 o\u2019clock they know that Juan is on duty.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Cultural Relevance\n\nPerhaps Covered California\u2019s biggest mistake was simply translating ads developed in English for a general audience into Spanish. This ignores the importance of cultural relevance. Think of the award-winning English-language campaign, Got Milk? At worst, a literal translation into Spanish could be a rude reference to breast milk. At best, it just falls flat. That\u2019s what happened with Covered California\u2019s first Spanish-language ad.\n\nThe ad features a series of people looking directly into the camera saying, in Spanish, \u201cWelcome to a new state of health. Welcome to Covered California.\u201d\n\nAd experts say that was an obvious misstep.\n\n\u201cTo say we\u2019re in a new state of health for California, it\u2019s grammatically correct to translate it literally, but it doesn\u2019t have the same nuance or cuteness that it does in English,\u201d says Roberto Orci, CEO of Acento Advertising in Santa Monica.\n\nHe found one of the state\u2019s follow-up ads just boring \u2014 the music, the message and the man in the ad.\n\n\u201cThis guy was stiff as a board and \u2026 seco, which in English means dry,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about my health insurance needs at all.\n\nLatinos Are Key to Health Insurance Risk Pool\n\nIf the product is chicken nuggets or milk, it might not matter to anyone but the companies if Latinos buy it. But, if Latinos don\u2019t buy health insurance, it matters to everyone.\n\nIt all has to do with the insurance risk pool.On average, Latinos are younger and healthier than the general population. The premiums they pay help cover the health care costs of older, sicker Californians. And that keeps premium costs down for everyone else.\n\nThat\u2019s why Covered California is sweating the numbers. Just 6 percent of people who enrolled in Covered California health plans last year speak Spanish as their first language. The state is worried how far that number is from the population of Spanish speakers in the state \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a good enough job yet,\u201d says Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. \u201cRelative to our ambitions and our aspirations we don\u2019t stack up well enough yet, and so we\u2019re going to be doubling down,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state spent almost $5 million on its Spanish ad campaign last year. It plans to spend more than $8 million in the first three months of this year. Covered California has upped its market research efforts and vowed to adjust its creative messaging. This time around it will put a lot of emphasis in ads on where people can go to get help in person.\n\n\u201cEven from day one we thought Spanish speakers would need in-person help,\u201d Lee says. \u201cHow important that is has really crystalized over the last three months.\u201d\n\nBut crucial time has been lost. The final deadline to sign up for coverage this year is March 31. It\u2019s not clear if Covered California can come up with a more effective marketing campaign before then.\n\nThis is the first of two stories looking at Covered California\u2019s flaws in enrolling the state\u2019s Latinos. The second part looks beyond marketing to the limited number of Spanish-speaking counselors and other drawbacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California is making a mad dash to enroll Latinos into health care plans.
