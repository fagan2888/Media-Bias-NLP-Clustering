An Arizona atheist running for Congress turned the tables on an anti-abortion Christian group, urging them to “prevent abortion” by sending them condoms, the Daily Banter reported.

The candidate, James Woods, sent the condoms — with the phrase “prevent abortion” inscribed on the wrapper — in response to a letter from the National Pro-Life Alliance (NPLA), along with a statement saying that while he did not support “policies that jeopardize the health and stability of women and their families,” he did support other programs that have been found to reduce abortions.

“These proven pro-family, pro-woman initiatives including: promoting sexually healthy, knowledgeable and responsible communities beginning in our K-12 schools, expanding publicly supported family planning services including universally accessible birth control for all women; and strengthening government empowerment programs for low-income women,” Woods wrote. “I look forward to working with you to promote policies like these that support our families — and that quickly, safely and dramatically reduce abortion.”

Phoenix New Times reported that the NPLA sent Woods a candidate survey and a request for him to sign a pledge signaling his support of the “sanctity of life.”

The NPLA recently published a newsletter claiming that the Affordable Care Act mandates that “taxpayers and insurers pay” for abortions. In fact, the law, commonly known as Obamacare, allows states offering healthcare exchanges to determine whether abortion services are included in coverage plans.

Woods, who is blind, is currently running against incumbent Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ), who won just under 68 percent of the vote when he was elected two years ago.
