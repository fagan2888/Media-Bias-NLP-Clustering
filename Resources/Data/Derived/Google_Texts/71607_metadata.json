The neighboring countries have had a complex relationship over time.\n\n\u201cThe Modi government\u2019s foreign policy has been a success and India is ready to project its power and influence in the region,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cBut looking to the future, Modi needs to find a way to engage Pakistan to avoid a crisis.\u201d\n\nIn his domestic policies, the experts contend that Modi has fallen short on delivering his campaign promises.\n\nDuring his campaign, Modi had spoken of overhauling labor laws, creating millions of jobs, and making sweeping economic reforms.\n\nAfter a year in office, the experts agreed that Modi could have done more in each of those domains.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the success of his foreign policy depends on the success of his economic policy,\u201d Dhume said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts analyze Prime Minister Modi of India's first year in office, finding foreign policy strengths and domestic policy weaknesses.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Experts analyze Prime Minister Modi of India's first year in office, finding foreign policy strengths and domestic policy weaknesses.", "title": "How Has India\u2019s Prime Minister Performed After 1 Year?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150609_IndiaModi_Feature.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FSEyyw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Experts analyze Prime Minister Modi of India's first year in office, finding foreign policy strengths and domestic policy weaknesses.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150609_IndiaModi_Feature.jpg"}, "title": "How Has India\u2019s Prime Minister Performed After 1 Year?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-06-10T16:12:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "India, Modi, prime minister, foreign policy, Asia"}, "article_summary": "One year after the historic election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, policy experts are commending his performance in foreign policy while criticizing his performance in improving the country\u2019s economy.\n\u201cHe has kept the basic structure [of Indian foreign policy] intact, but has put his imprint on it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the end, the success of his foreign policy depends on the success of his economic policy,\u201d Dhume said.\nThe experts praised Modi for strengthening relationships with India\u2019s neighbors.\nRecently, U.S Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited India\u2019s Eastern Naval Command, a major naval base in India."}
