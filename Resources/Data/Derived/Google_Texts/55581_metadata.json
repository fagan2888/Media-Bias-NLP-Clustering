Miller notes that last week\u2019s bankruptcy declaration came a day before a meeting of Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s Rural Hospital Stabilization Committee at the Ty Cobb Regional Medical Center in Lavonia. That Lavonia hospital, Miller reports, will require Franklin County\u2019s help to make its next bond payment.\n\nThe one topic that didn\u2019t come up among committee members assigned the task of saving Georgia\u2019s rural hospitals: Medicaid expansion.\n\n***\n\nJust in case you haven\u2019t seen it, here\u2019s the much-talked-about opening skit from NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live:\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post even did a quick fact-check on the skit.\n\n***\n\nFollowing in the snow-covered footsteps of a certain Georgia colleague, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday blamed his state\u2019s lack of preparedness for the blizzard that buried parts of Buffalo on faulty forecasts by the National Weather Service.\n\nAnd just as in Georgia, weather hounds pushed back. Hard. From the New York Post:\n\nOn Sunday, National Weather Service spokesman Chris Vaccaro unleashed records of the week\u2019s forecasts that showed his agency\u2019s predictions were \u201ctimely and accurate.\u201d Forecasters predicted Monday that Erie County could receive 3 feet of snow \u2014 then doubled the amount in their forecast by Tuesday morning. They estimated 3-to-5 inches would fall per hour, for a total of 5-to-6 feet Tuesday \u2014 plus an additional fall of up-to-2 feet Wednesday night through Thursday. But state officials only planned for 3 feet of snow from a briefing they received Monday and got a late start plowing out the region.\u2026 Buffalo weatherman Kevin O\u2019Neill called the forecasters \u201cbrilliant.\u201d \u201cShame on Cuomo for throwing @NWS under the plow. We don\u2019t tell you how to run a state. Don\u2019t tell us how to forecast,\u201d he thundered on Twitter.\n\n***\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter spoke to MSNBC\u2019s Ronan Farrow on Friday in a wide-ranging interview that touched on, among other topics, the future of the Democratic Party. Let\u2019s just say he has high hopes for his grandson Jason Carter, who has made clear another run is on his radar.\n\n\u201cI would say I want the future Democrats to be represented perhaps by my grandson Jason Carter, who ran for governor unsuccessfully in Georgia,\u201d said the elder Carter.\n\nFarrow then asked what advice he gave Carter before and after his defeat. Said the former president:\n\n\u201cJust tell the truth and get to know the people that you hope to represent as best you can, and he did quite well considering the Republican sweep of America. He\u2019s the kind of future Democrat that I hope will prevail.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAnother proxy fight to lead the Democratic Party could be in the works.\n\nDuBose Porter, the long-time Georgia lawmaker who now leads the organization, announced last week he was seeking a full four-year term. So did Rockdale County Tax Commissioner R.J. Hadley.\n\nBut most Democratic insiders are closely watching to see whether Tharon Johnson, the former Obama strategists who now works for McKenna Long & Aldridge, hops in the race. Johnson is close to Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who supported former state Sen. Doug Stoner\u2019s failed bid to lead the party last year.\n\nReed, not surprisingly, has made clear he is still no fan of Porter. And Johnson, a young and connected operative originally from Athens, could be his pick to mount a challenge.\n\nJohnson told us he was considering a bid but hadn\u2019t made up his mind yet. In the meantime, though, he\u2019s been boosting his persona with appearances on WAGA-TV\u2019s \u201cThe Georgia Gang\u201d and a more active Twitter presence.\n\nExpect Porter\u2019s allies to rally to his side. Jason Carter, the party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee, told us he expected Porter to prevail.\n\nJohnson will have to make up his mind soon. The vote is set for February.\n\n***\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s Marietta Daily Journal, former state lawmaker Roger Hines of Kennesaw says state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, R-Johns Creek, will introduce a bill to make the state school superintendent an appointed position. That would require a constitutional amendment. It\u2019s been tried at least twice before.\n\n***\n\nQualifying closed Friday on the special election for state House District 50, to replace Lynne Riley, R-Johns Creek, who Gov. Nathan Deal has appointed state revenue commissioner.\n\nYour candidates:\n\n\u2014 Christine A. Austin, 44, a Libertarian and homemaker;\n\n\u2014 Bradford Jay Raffensperger, 59, a Republican and an engineer;\n\n\u2014 Royce M. Reinecke, 62, a Republican and retired engineer;\n\n\u2014 Kelly Leigh Stewart, 48, a self-employed Republican;\n\n\u2014 And Paul Troop, 72, a retired journalist and public relations executive. No party identification listed.\n\n***\n\nOver the weekend, U.S. Rep.
