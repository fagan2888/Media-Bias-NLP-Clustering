Register today(www.eventsvc.com) because space may be limited.\n\nCMS experts will discuss timing, improvements and updates for provider revalidation \"round two\" and will open the call for questions after those prepared remarks.\n\nPhysicians can brush up on the revalidation process to get ready for the call. Materials are available online(www.cms.gov), as is a sample revalidation letter(www.cms.gov).\n\n\n\nThe provider call likely will reinforce important points such as these:\n\nMedicare contractors will contact each physician directly when it is time to revalidate enrollment information.\n\nPhysicians should not act on revalidation until they are contacted.\n\nOnce physicians receive their revalidation request, they must submit supporting Medicare enrollment documentation within 60 days or risk losing Medicare billing privileges.\n\nCMS will post the call presentation(www.cms.gov) at least one day in advance, and the agency plans to post an audio recording and transcript about two weeks after the event.\n\nThe target audience for the upcoming call is all Medicare fee-for-service providers and suppliers. However, physicians who have opted out of the Medicare program -- as well as those providers who are enrolled in Medicare for the sole purpose of ordering and referring items or services to Medicare beneficiaries -- are not required to participate in the revalidation program.\n\nLastly, CMS urges physicians to subscribe(public.govdelivery.com) to the weekly MLN Connects Provider eNews(www.cms.gov) for the latest Medicare program information, announcements of provider calls and other events, and education product updates.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "Physicians who provide health care to Medicare patients should consider participating in an upcoming CMS call about the provider enrollment revalidation process.", "pubdate": "2016-02-16", "author": "News Staff", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "Physicians who provide health care to Medicare patients should consider participating in an upcoming CMS call about the provider enrollment revalidation process.", "title": "Ready for Medicare Provider Enrollment Revalidation 'Round Two?'"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aafp", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2016-february/MC-Provider-Enroll-Call_Phone.jpg", "description": "Physicians who provide health care to Medicare patients should consider participating in an upcoming CMS call about the provider enrollment revalidation process.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ready for Medicare Provider Enrollment Revalidation 'Round Two?'"}, "lastreviewdate": "2016-02-16", "news-category": "Practice & Professional Issues", "nav-title": "Ready for Medicare Provider Enrollment Revalidation 'Round Two?'", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2016-february/MC-Provider-Enroll-Call_Phone.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "Medicare provider enrollment revalidation, CMS provider call, five-year revalidation cycle, Medicare billing privileges", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Practice & Professional Issues"}, "article_summary": "Once physicians receive their revalidation request, they must submit supporting Medicare enrollment documentation within 60 days or risk losing Medicare billing privileges.\nFamily physicians who count Medicare beneficiaries among their patients may want to reserve an hour or so in about two weeks to participate in a CMS call about the Medicare provider enrollment revalidation process.\nCMS experts will discuss timing, improvements and updates for provider revalidation \"round two\" and will open the call for questions after those prepared remarks.\nFast forward to 2016, and CMS is now reminding physicians that the next five-year period of Medicare provider revalidations has begun.\nTo help physicians understand the process -- and prepare for their next Medicare revalidation -- CMS is hosting a free provider call from 2 to 3:15 p.m. EST on March 1."}
