Chapter 15 bankruptcy promotes cooperation between the U.S. court and foreign entities, and allows foreign borrowers access to U.S. courts.\n\nThe Australian satellite company was also placed into administration, an alternative to liquidation. An Australian advisory firm, PBB Advisory, was appointed to manage the firm temporarily, and a second, McGrath Nichol, is overseeing its financial affairs.\n\nAccording to public records, NewSat benefited from more than $300 million in loans from the Export-Import Bank. The company received the financing in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and the loans were awarded for the company to purchase products from Lockheed Martin.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously approved NewSat\u2019s financing in 2012 and 2013. Records were not available for the loans approved in 2014.\n\nLockheed Martin is building NewSat\u2019s Jabiru-1 commercial satellite.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s contract with NewSat requires the bank to be one of the first creditors to be repaid if the company goes into bankruptcy. However, the bank bears a substantial liability if the satellite project is cancelled.\n\nRequests to NewSat and Ex-Im were not returned.\n\nAccording to NewSat\u2019s filings, PBB Advisory requested the bankruptcy court block Lockheed Martin from terminating its contract with NewSat. If that doesn\u2019t occur, the firm warned there would be less of a chance the Export-Import Bank would be repaid.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products. The bank\u2019s future is currently being hotly debated by policy makers, as its charter expires June 30.\n\nThe Daily Signal previously detailed NewSat\u2019s financial troubles in an article last month, which included lavish spending on travel and undisclosed payments to a yacht company owned by NewSat Chief Executive Officer Adrian Ballintine.\n\nAdditionally, the Australian company entered into \u201ctechnical default\u201d with Lockheed Martin after it failed to make payments of more than $21 million. Last year, NewSat officials flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with Ex-Im representatives. Repeated requests for information on the nature of the meeting went unanswered.\n\n>>> Future Indictments Related to Export-Import Bank Likely, Agency Watchdog Says", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Australian company backed by millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded loans from Ex-Im has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, putting its future in doubt.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Australian company backed by millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded loans from Ex-Im has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, putting its future in doubt.", "title": "Australian Company Backed by Ex-Im Files for Bankruptcy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140417_NewSatBankruptcy_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-17T16:05:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CUoICW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Australian company backed by millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded loans from Ex-Im has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, putting its future in doubt.", "title": "Australian Company Backed by Ex-Im Files for Bankruptcy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140417_NewSatBankruptcy_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-04-17T13:04:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T16:05:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, NewSat, Chapter 15 bankruptcy, PBB Advisory, McGrath Nichol, Lockheed Martin, Adrienne Ballintine"}, "article_summary": "According to filings from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware, Australian satellite company NewSat filed a petition for Chapter 15 bankruptcy yesterday.\nThe Australian satellite company was also placed into administration, an alternative to liquidation.\nAn Australian satellite company backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded loans from the Export-Import Bank has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, putting the company\u2019s future in doubt.\nAdditionally, the Australian company entered into \u201ctechnical default\u201d with Lockheed Martin after it failed to make payments of more than $21 million.\nIf that doesn\u2019t occur, the firm warned there would be less of a chance the Export-Import Bank would be repaid."}
