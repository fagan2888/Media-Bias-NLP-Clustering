Nearly six years later, with inflation still nil, it\u2019s worth reminding investors that the same rogue\u2019s gallery of economic thinkers has gotten just about every investment call wrong for years. And for the same reason: politics.\n\nThe point is: Don\u2019t listen to people who tout investments based on their politics. It\u2019s a sure sign they lack the dispassion needed to evaluate securities and make you money.\n\nObamacare. Gold. The stimulus. The stock market. Bitcoin. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The General Motors GM, +1.93% rescue, municipal bonds, the dollar, and, yes, even the Troubled Asset Relief Program, better known as the Wall Street bailouts of 2008. These 10 have but two things in common: In each case, an ideological network of investing pundits and economists predicted disaster for establishment institutions, taking their cues from conservative politicians. And they were wrong about all of them.\n\nBitcoin is down to $480 from $1,150 last fall. The dollar is worth almost 20% more, in euros, than before the financial crisis. U.S. stocks have nearly tripled since their 2009 low, which came exactly one business day after a Wall Street Journal op-ed by a top economic adviser to the first President Bush said \u201cObama\u2019s radicalism is killing the Dow.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe lesson here isn\u2019t \u201cdon\u2019t listen to Republicans.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t listen to politicians, and investment advisers who think like them.\u201d If you\u2019re looking at anything besides the microeconomics of a business or a bond, you\u2019re likely to screw up. The game\u2019s hard enough already.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s no comparable left-wing network of investment publishers, skilled or unskilled. I can\u2019t recall Rachel Maddow or Michael Moore shilling for anything the way Glenn Beck pumped gold. (Lefties will occasionally boycott stocks for policy reasons, as they have with gun manufacturers, without making an investment case.) Gold, by the way, is down by a third since 2011. At the same time, stocks that benefitted from the stimulus have crushed the market, led by Tesla Motors TSLA, +0.77% So have health-care stocks, riding Obamacare.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a network of conservative outlets whose view of investing is inextricable from their politics. Lou Dobbs spends his days presiding over \u201cbusiness\u201d shows focused on Benghazi. Online outlets like Townhall.com Finance (telling you to avoid stocks of companies whose accident-prevention technologies that will \u201clet the government drive your car one day\u201d) or Agora\u2019s Money Morning (which this week helpfully sent me a warning that a \u201cCIA economist\u201d was predicting a market meltdown that the Fed is hiding from us all) complete the picture.\n\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up. Gladly, for comedians, we don\u2019t have to.\n\nTheir politicians are no better. Rick Perry \u2014 an actual, honest-to-God presidential contender \u2014 called the Fed treasonous in 2011. (At least he remembered the Fed\u2019s name, which is more than he could do with the three Cabinet departments he wanted to eliminate.) Wall Street-bound ex-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor bought an ETF in 2009 to short Treasuries.\n\nBut Perry really smashed the unintentional-comedy scale with economic-development radio ads in six California markets last year, saying \u201cI hear building a business in California is next to impossible.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear that from Elon Musk, who chose Nevada, not Texas, for Palo Alto-based Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory. His withering assessment must have despaired Googlers, who\u2019d thought people were protesting their commuter buses in San Francisco\u2019s streets because they were rich.\n\nMaybe they believed Perry in Iowa, and maybe that was his real point. After all, venture capitalists invested 11 times as much in California startups as Texas outfits last year, according to National Venture Capital Association data.\n\nBut voters are smarter than politicians think they are. And as investors, take your money way more seriously than politicians take you.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Their biases get the best of them, and that hurts you, writes Tim Mullaney.", "creator": "@timmullaney", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT862_beck_g_ZG_20140910160448.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Tim Mullaney", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Investing", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Their biases get the best of them, and that hurts you, writes Tim Mullaney.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/never-let-a-politician-or-pundit-give-you-investment-advice-2014-09-11", "author": "Tim Mullaney", "parsely-title": "Never let a politician or pundit give you investment advice", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-09-11T17:35:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Investing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Their biases get the best of them, and that hurts you, writes Tim Mullaney.", "title": "Never let a politician or pundit give you investment advice", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/never-let-a-politician-or-pundit-give-you-investment-advice-2014-09-11", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT862_beck_g_ZG_20140910160448.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT862_beck_g_ZG_20140910160448.jpg"}, "article.id": "ADD2F4A4-3921-11E4-984A-00212804637C", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb96c\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg News has finally found a financial mistake even Michael Bloomberg couldn\u2019t have recovered from: taking investment advice from right-wing market pundits.\n(Lefties will occasionally boycott stocks for policy reasons, as they have with gun manufacturers, without making an investment case.)\nIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s no comparable left-wing network of investment publishers, skilled or unskilled.\nGetty Images Radio host Glenn Beck has implored Americans to buy gold, even as prices have plummeted.\nI can\u2019t recall Rachel Maddow or Michael Moore shilling for anything the way Glenn Beck pumped gold."}
