When one gets rich, that doesn\u2019t require other people to become poor; job gains in one state don\u2019t require job losses in another. But Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner must have skipped that lecture in Economics 101.\n\nIn a remarkable interview with the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, Rauner said his plan to revitalize his state\u2019s flagging economy relies on trying to raid neighboring Indiana for good jobs. Rauner made no effort to sugarcoat his intentions, promising something that sounds more like explicit economic warfare than simple competition.\n\nRelated: Get Ready to Pay More Tolls If Infrastructure Isn\u2019t Funded\n\n\u201cI am going to try to rip the economic guts out of Indiana,\u201d Rauner told the newspaper, going on to boast, \u201cI am one of the baddest enemies anybody can have.\u201d\n\nRauner promised that Illinois would \u201cmethodically and aggressively\u201d move to help itself to the economic detriment of its neighbor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to get it done,\u201d he vowed. \u201cWhen I set a goal we do it. And we\u2019re coming after Indiana big time. We're going to deliver jobs out of Indiana and into Illinois.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, a likely element of theater to the governor\u2019s comments. First of all, there has been a long-running feud between the two states, which are both headed by Republican governors. In 2011, the Indiana Development Corp. started a campaign targeting Chicago-region businesses with billboards that asked if they were \u201cIllinoyed by higher taxes.\u201d Second, Rauner, a career private equity executive, was elected in November to run a state that has suffered from unemployment levels consistently above the national average. Its economy has struggled more than most to find a way out of the doldrums that followed the Great Recession.\n\nRelated: How McDonald\u2019s and Walmart Wage Hikes Can Boost the Economy\n\nStill, Rauner\u2019s comments didn\u2019t sit well with Indiana officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stack Indiana's low taxes, Triple A credit rating and excellent business climate against those of any other state any time,\" said Christy Denault, communications director for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in a statement to the Indianapolis Star.\n\n\u201cOur corporate taxes are going down, our workforce has been growing, and we will continue to aggressively recruit new companies and new jobs to our state. Illinois will find tough competition here in Indiana,\u201d Denault added.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Illinois Gov.
