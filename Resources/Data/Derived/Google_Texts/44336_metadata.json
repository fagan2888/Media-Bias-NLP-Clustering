Displays of force thus far have included armored trucks, fighter planes and shoulder-fired missiles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Obama drew Maduro\u2019s ire by declaring the South American country a national security threat last Monday. He also placed tougher sanctions on Venezuelan officials for alleged human rights violations there.\n\n\u201cVenezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engaged in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement last Monday. \u201cAnd we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of U.S. financial systems.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration targeted seven former Venezuelan military, intelligence and law enforcement officials with the new restrictions. All the individuals sanctioned allegedly committed violence against anti-government protesters in Venezuela last year.\n\nVenezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez launched Saturday\u2019s display of force in Caracas at Fort Tiuna, the nation\u2019s largest military installation. He said the sanctions were \u201can imminent danger\u201d to Venezuela\u2019s security.\n\nMaduro hailed Venezuela\u2019s military as \u201cthe best guarantee of peace\u201d in a radio address Saturday night. He vowed to protect Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty from the \u201cinsolent boots of imperialism\u201d in the speech.\n\nThe Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has shown little support for Obama\u2019s latest measures. On Saturday, the 12-nation coalition rejected his assessment that Caracas threatens the U.S.\n\nThe White House\u2019s new sanctions will freeze U.S. assets of targeted individuals and ban their travel to American shores. The Obama administration has often clashed with Maduro \u2013 and his predecessor Hugo Chavez \u2013 over Venezuela\u2019s human rights record.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The White House leveled new sanctions on Venezuela last week.", "description": "The White House leveled new sanctions on Venezuela last week.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mark Hensch", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The White House leveled new sanctions on Venezuela last week.", "title": "Venezuela drills military over US 'threat\u2019", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/235765-venezuela-drills-military-over-us-threat", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/venezuela_031515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/235765-venezuela-drills-military-over-us-threat", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-15T13:59-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-15T13:59:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/235765-venezuela-drills-military-over-us-threat", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The White House leveled new sanctions on Venezuela last week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Venezuela drills military over US 'threat\u2019"}, "dcterms.title": "Venezuela drills military over US 'threat\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5fe\"", "article_summary": "Maduro hailed Venezuela\u2019s military as \u201cthe best guarantee of peace\u201d in a radio address Saturday night.\nThe Obama administration has often clashed with Maduro \u2013 and his predecessor Hugo Chavez \u2013 over Venezuela\u2019s human rights record.\nHe also placed tougher sanctions on Venezuelan officials for alleged human rights violations there.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has launched 10 days of military exercises over new U.S. sanctions placed on his nation earlier last week.\nADVERTISEMENTPresident Obama drew Maduro\u2019s ire by declaring the South American country a national security threat last Monday."}
