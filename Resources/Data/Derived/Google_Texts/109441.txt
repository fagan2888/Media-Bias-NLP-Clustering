A Bayou George man's bond is set at $100,000 after making his first appearance in court Saturday. 43 year old Michael Joe McCoy is charged in-connection with a double shooting at his home early Wednesday morning.

He appeared before Circuit Judge Bradley Clark Saturday at the Bay County Courthouse. Judge Clark formally charged him with an open count of murder and attempted murder.

Bay County sheriff's officials arrested Michael McCoy Friday. They say McCoy shot and killed 46 year old David Walker early Wednesday morning, after finding out Walker was having an affair with his wife, 37 year old Susan McCoy.

Susan McCoy apparently invited Walker to stay at her and her husband's home on Rhonda Road, after his release from the Bay County Jail on a domestic violence charge.

Investigators say McCoy pulled out a gun and planned to commit suicide when he found out about the affair, but officers say his wife talked him out of it.

He and Walker then got into an argument in the front yard, and McCoy killed Walker. Susan McCoy was also shot.

She's still in guarded condition at a local hospital. McCoy suffers physical disabilities that makes it difficult for him to walk. He claims he shot Walker in self defense and accidentally shot his wife.

Michael McCoy's next court appearance is set for March.
