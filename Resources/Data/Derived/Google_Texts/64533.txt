HAMILTON, Ala. (WIAT) — A mother is outraged after she said someone defamed pictures of her child on Facebook.

Now she’s sharing her story in hopes that other parents won’t have the same experience.

Ashton Hamner of Hamilton came across pictures of her 16-month-old daughter made into memes with offensive quotes.

Hamner said some of them made fun of her little girl, calling her bald and saying she had cancer.

“I cried,” said Hamner. “That’s all I could do. I was very upset about it, I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I went back and changed all of my settings, and now no one can access my photos unless they’re on my friends group.”

According to one legal analyst, altering someone else’s images and posting them online could be considered defamation.
