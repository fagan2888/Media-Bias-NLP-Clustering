Dan Claitor (R) confirmed he will run to represent the state\u2019s 6th District in 2014.\n\nBut while confirming his candidacy, Claitor also told the Times-Picayune that he was \u201cnot excited\u201d by the prospect of other party members on the ballot \u201chaving questionable associations with certain hate groups,\u201d then allegedly compared Perkins to Duke, a former Grand Wizard in the Klan who made headlines in 1991 for his failed gubernatorial campaign.

Perkins reportedly met with a group of 35 pastors to discuss the matter.\n\nHowever, the Christian Post reported on Friday that Perkins issued a statement criticizing House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) for calling on party members to support gay candidates for office, saying it distracted the party from mobilizing against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of the Republican platform if the party isn\u2019t looking for candidates who uphold it?\u201d Perkins\u2019 statement read. \u201cThe GOP\u2019s latest sideshow comes at the expense of the party\u2019s greatest opportunity: capitalizing on America\u2019s disgust for Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe GOP will throw its support behind any candidate they believe can win, even if it means throwing the party\u2019s stated principles overboard,\u201d Perkins\u2019 statement read.
