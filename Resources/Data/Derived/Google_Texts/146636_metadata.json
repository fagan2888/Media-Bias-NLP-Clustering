A chief author of the \"Contract with America\" and a hardline general in the Gingrich Revolution, Armey was House majority leader when the Republicans faced off against Bill Clinton in late 1995, insisting they would only fund government if the president agreed to a balanced budget in seven years. In early January 1996, under pressure from presumptive Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, the House Republicans agreed to abandon their demands and lift the shutdown.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, we called Armey and former Speaker Newt Gingrich to get their perspective on the current shutdown and its parallels to their own standoff with a Democratic president. (Gingrich-era House Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not respond to our interview request.) Armey, now retired on his north Texas ranch (with a hefty FreedomWorks severance package), shared his thoughts on Clinton (\"a jolly fellow well met\"), Gingrich (\"like Ado Annie from Oklahoma!\"), and what John Boehner should do (\"If you\u2019re going to be in command, damn it, then you got to command.\").\n\nTake me back to 1995. Why did Republican leadership think a government shutdown would be an effective tactic?\n\nWe had reason to believe we might be able to pull it off. Remember, we had had a lot of success that year. We were riding pretty high after the 100 days, and we felt that we were going to bring the Democrats to heel on our budget numbers. Newt insisted that presidents get blamed for shutdowns and that therefore we ought to develop a strategy that would take us to a shutdown. My position was that Republicans get blamed for shutdowns, because it\u2019s incongruous to the public to think that the Democrats \u2014 who they perceive as people who love the government \u2014 would shut down the government. But Newt was just certain that he would outwit Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd he was wrong \u2026\n\nI think the fundamental miscalculation of \u201995 was that we did not understand Clinton. Clinton was no sissy. He was not going to cave. And the public pressure wasn\u2019t falling on Clinton; it was falling on us. The president was advantaged by being the guy who was trying so hard and being so accommodating to get through this against the stubborn and unreasonable Republicans. Tom DeLay always argued we were winning. If we were winning, I never saw it. We were getting the tar beat out of us.\n\n\n\nAt times during the shutdowns, Gingrich was perceived as being pushed around by his hard-line base. Did you see it that way?\n\nThe speaker, the budget chairman, and the whip were the principal driving forces behind the shutdown, and Newt shared the whole \u201cWe\u2019ll show them who\u2019s in charge around here\u201d attitude. But let me walk you through the numbers. Being reelected as speaker means you have to please a majority of your majority. The majority of his majority was the \u201cWe\u2019ll fight on to the death, win or lose,\u201d hard-nosed Republicans from the \u201994 freshmen class. And, frankly, Boehner has the same thing \u2014 same set of attitudes. Now, the problem is we also had that group that was the minority of the majority \u2014 but it was also with the majority of the body.\n\nSo you had those people coming to us and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re letting these cranky, not-so-thoughtful people on your extreme right drive you. You\u2019re letting the tail wag the dog!\u201d And then we would hear from the majority of our majority, and it was, \u201cYou\u2019re listening to this small gang of moderates. You\u2019re letting the tail wag the dog!\u201d I\u2019d go home and tell my wife, \u201cI must be a two-tailed dog, because they say I\u2019m being wagged from both ends.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo how did Newt come around to admitting defeat?\n\nI was meeting with Newt and Bob Dole, and as I was walking out the door to go home, I heard Dole say, \u201cNewt, will you stay here? I want to talk to you.\u201d The next day I got a call from Newt, and he said, \u201cWell, Dick, Bob Dole and I have agreed we\u2019re going to end this.\u201d I think Dole said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s just getting to be too miserable a process, we\u2019re not behaving well, so let\u2019s just get done with it.\u201d Newt was a little bit like Ado Annie from Oklahoma! We always used to say, \u201cIf you want to know what Newt\u2019s position is, check and see who was the last one in the room with him.\u201d\n\n\n\nDid the freshmen cry bloody murder?\n\nIt was a pretty bitter business. When Newt went before the conference, I remember being stunned when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s immoral to shut down the government.\u201d Damn it, it was his idea from the get-go!\n\n\n\nAnd do you see many of the same dynamics in this shutdown?\n\nThere wasn\u2019t that big ideological component back in \u201995. Clinton was fundamentally a fiscal conservative, so more than anybody was ever willing to acknowledge, the goal of a balanced budget was a goal shared by Clinton in the first place. This fight now isn\u2019t about the budget, it\u2019s an ideological war. Nobody can surrender in this war, and their positions are mutually exclusive. Obamacare is the 50-year dream of the national Democrat party finally achieved. Everybody knew the Democrats were not going to take a bill to defund it. Boehner knew that, but he let himself get pushed into a shutdown anyway.\n\n\n\nIs he really so afraid of the tea party?\n\nTea party, shmee party. It\u2019s the Republican Study Committee, and they\u2019ve been around since long before there was ever a tea party. But I still wonder: How does a guy like Ted Cruz, who\u2019s relatively new in town, who nobody knows, who hasn\u2019t even unpacked his bags, drive this whole process? It\u2019s hard to see how Boehner gets himself out of this. My personal belief is his best model is Tip O\u2019Neill. Tip O\u2019Neill would have just said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m in charge here, you can take it or not.\u201d I think John\u2019s too worried about his speakership. If you\u2019re going to be in command, damn it, then you got to command.\n\n\n\nSo how will it end?\n\nI will predict this: When they agree on a spending bill, it will speak not at all to Obamacare and it will be at budgetary numbers higher than the sequestration level. And so in the end, the Republican conference will lose ground on the budget, they will lose ground on health care, they will lose ground politically, and they\u2019ll be in a worse position than where Boehner had them going into this process. And they\u2019ll all blame Boehner, bless his heart.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Prediction: The speaker is going to take it on the chin, one way or another.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Prediction: The speaker is going to take it on the chin, one way or another.", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s Hard to See How Boehner Gets Out of This\u2019: Dick Armey on the Shutdown", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/dick-armey-remembers-the-gingrich-shutdowns.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/11/11-dick-armey.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@intelligencer", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/11/11-dick-armey.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "Prediction: The speaker is going to take it on the chin, one way or another.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dick Armey Remembers the Gingrich Shutdowns"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "politics, shutdownpocalypse", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "politics,shutdownpocalypse", "published_time": "2013-10-11T17:34:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, politics, shutdownpocalypse", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6667\"", "article_summary": "\"), and what John Boehner should do (\"If you\u2019re going to be in command, damn it, then you got to command.\").\nIf you\u2019re going to be in command, damn it, then you got to command.\nAt times during the shutdowns, Gingrich was perceived as being pushed around by his hard-line base.\nFormer Texas congressman Dick Armey knows from shutdowns.\nNewt insisted that presidents get blamed for shutdowns and that therefore we ought to develop a strategy that would take us to a shutdown."}
