Later in life, she took a leading role in that world. She was born in Killeen in 1905, the daughter of state legislator Ike Culp.\n\nOveta Culp received her law degree in 1925 from The University of Texas at Austin. While studying, she served as the state\u2019s legislative parliamentarian. I n 1931, she married former Texas Governor William P. Hobby. The Hobbys published the Houston Post, and had two children. But when the United States entered World War II, Oveta Hobby was asked to organize a women\u2019s support section for the Army. She agreed, and through her efforts, more than 150,000 women served in the Women\u2019s Army Auxiliary Corps during the war. In January 1945, Hobby was awarded the Army\u2019s Distinguished Service Medal for her work.\n\nAfter the war, Hobby returned to Houston. But in 1953, President Eisenhower appointed her to lead the newly created Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, where she once again organized an entirely new agency of the federal government.\n\nOveta Culp Hobby died in 1995, leaving an inspiring record of civic service. Today, her words about women and the war effort are inscribed on the World War II memorial on the National Mall in Washington. The inscription reads \u201cWomen who stepped up were measured as citizens of the nation, not as women \u2026 This was a people\u2019s war, and everyone was in it.\u201d\n\nSources\n\nHobby, William P., Jr. \u201cHobby, Oveta Culp.\u201d Handbook of Texas Online. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/fho86.html\n\nRice University Fondren Library. \u201cOveta Culp Hobby and the Women\u2019s Army Corps.\u201d http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC/digital-archive-information/online-exhilbits/oveta-culp-hobby-and-the-women-s-army-corps-exhibit\n\nThis episode first aired April 21, 2012.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "She was the first woman to lead the Women's Army Corps.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "She was the first woman to lead the Women's Army Corps.", "title": "Oveta Culp Hobby And Her Leading Role In Government | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/shows/2015/11/21/42714/texas-originals-oveta-culp-hobby/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11183900/Oveta-Culp-Hobby-loc-lg-1182x800.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11183900/Oveta-Culp-Hobby-loc-lg-1182x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1182, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11183900/Oveta-Culp-Hobby-loc-lg-1182x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "wordCount": 388, "twitter": {"description": "She was the first woman to lead the Women's Army Corps.", "title": "Oveta Culp Hobby And Her Leading Role In Government", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/shows/2015/11/21/42714/texas-originals-oveta-culp-hobby/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11183900/Oveta-Culp-Hobby-loc-lg-1182x800.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Valerie Lawhorn", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-11-21T06:00:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "Texas Originals", "tag": "texas originals", "published_time": "2015-11-21T06:00:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "Education, Shows, Texas Originals, shows, texas originals", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "/ DownloadOveta Culp HobbyJanuary 19, 1905\u2013 August 16, 1995As a young girl, Oveta Culp Hobby was fascinated by the world of government.\n\u201cOveta Culp Hobby and the Women\u2019s Army Corps.\u201d http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC/digital-archive-information/online-exhilbits/oveta-culp-hobby-and-the-women-s-army-corps-exhibitThis episode first aired April 21, 2012.\nOveta Culp Hobby died in 1995, leaving an inspiring record of civic service.\nBut when the United States entered World War II, Oveta Hobby was asked to organize a women\u2019s support section for the Army.\nOveta Culp received her law degree in 1925 from The University of Texas at Austin."}
