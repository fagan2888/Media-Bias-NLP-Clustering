Yet Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) \u201chas chosen punishment over health\u201d among at-risk, marginalized communities.\n\nThe organization says authorities are punishing prostitution in the city in a way that exacerbates the spread of HIV. The report shows the NOPD has taken to assertively identifying sex workers. In addition, the department will prosecute \u201c\u2018loitering for prostitution,\u2019 an offense so vague and broadly drawn that it permits police to consider a wide range of behavior to be grounds for arrest, including where people are, what they are wearing, and what they may have done in the past.\u201d\n\nThe report says NOPD officers also look for evidence of prostitution, namely condoms, which can warrant an arrest. The targeting of condom possession has created a climate where sex workers and others are risking HIV transmission.\n\n\u201cSex workers, transgender women and others at high risk of HIV infection told us that they were afraid to carry condoms and that they sometimes had to engage in sex without protection out of fear of police harassment,\u201d the report outlines.\n\nThe practice of criminalizing condoms is not uncommon in major US cities. New York City law enforcement has been criticized for confiscating condoms of LGBT adults, youth of color, and residents of lower-income communities. Police in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington DC - all cities with high HIV/AIDS rates - have also been shown to aggressively monitor condom possession.\n\nThough in June, New York became the first state to pass a law curbing police from using condoms as evidence of prostitution-related infractions. And DC police have begun distributing \u201ccondom awareness cards\u201d to community organizations focused on sex workers and transgender communities which explain that condom possession is not an excuse for a police search in the city.\n\nHRW says Louisiana should follow suit with its own laws and programs to alleviate the risks that exist in communities with high HIV rates, including the implementation of an effective syringe exchange program. In addition, the report calls on the city and state to take into account other public health factors that intensify HIV hazards, like the high incarceration and poverty rates in Louisiana.\n\nThe southern state is the world\u2019s incarceration capital \u2013 twice the nationwide rate, HRW notes. Prison \u201cinevitably interrupts the ability to take one\u2019s HIV medications on a regular basis. Reports from the Orleans Parish Prison indicated delays ranging from two weeks to three months in commencing or resuming HIV treatment.\u201d\n\nLouisiana\u2019s high rate of poverty adds to the need for many people to turn to sex work for money, food, housing, and drugs, HRW says.\n\n\u201cMore than half of New Orleans\u2019 350,000 residents live in or near poverty and the city has the second-highest rate of homelessness in the nation,\u201d the report notes.\n\nThe human rights organization urged Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to accept the Medicaid expansion offer within the Affordable Care Act. The move could serve an estimated 265,000 low-income state residents, according to ThinkProgress.\n\nNOPD rejected the charges made in HRW\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe NOPD takes such allegations very seriously, and conducts thorough investigations into accused officers. Officers found to have violated departmental policy or law are disciplined, and in some cases, suspended or terminated,\u201d a department spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe department is currently under federal oversight after an investigation by the US Department of Justice \u201cfound evidence of the use of excessive force on civilians, discrimination, a failure to investigate serious crimes and a startling lack of accountability,\u201d according to The New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aggressive police harassment in New Orleans, such as using condoms as evidence of prostitution, is increasingly endangering sex workers, drug users, and others who face higher risks of HIV, according to Human Rights Watch.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Aggressive police harassment in New Orleans, such as using condoms as evidence of prostitution, is increasingly endangering sex workers, drug users, and others who face higher risks of HIV, according to Human Rights Watch.", "title": "\u200bPolice harassment may be worsening Louisiana AIDS crisis - report", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/88/40/00/000_169781316.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/louisiana-police-harassment-aids-348/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Aggressive police harassment in New Orleans, such as using condoms as evidence of prostitution, is increasingly endangering sex workers, drug users, and others who face higher risks of HIV, according to Human Rights Watch.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/88/40/00/000_169781316.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11f9\"", "article_summary": "HRW says Louisiana should follow suit with its own laws and programs to alleviate the risks that exist in communities with high HIV rates, including the implementation of an effective syringe exchange program.\nThe targeting of condom possession has created a climate where sex workers and others are risking HIV transmission.\nLouisiana has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and its AIDS death rate is over twice the national average.\nThe report shows the NOPD has taken to assertively identifying sex workers.\nAggressive police harassment in New Orleans, such as using condoms as evidence of prostitution, is increasingly endangering sex workers, drug users, and others who face higher risks of HIV, according to Human Rights Watch."}
