But not all net neutrality proponents want this\u2014and, as some have noted, Title II classification is irrelevant to some of the biggest goals of the net neutrality crowd, like eliminating \u201cfast lanes.\u201d\n\nRev. Jesse Jackson was an early opponent of Obama\u2019s plan. Soon after Obama\u2019s announcement, Jackson began lobbying the FCC to ignore Obama\u2019s advice and instead pursue a net neutrality plan under Section 706 of the Communications Act.\n\nJackson fears that Title II regulation would kill investment in broadband, and eliminate certain programs used by the poor. \u201cZero rating,\u201d for example, allows companies to offer users plans that exempt certain services from their data caps. These services are often used by disadvantaged minorities, but Title II regulation would eliminate this kind of unequal treatment.\n\nIt could also significantly increase the cost of broadband, particularly in certain states where burdensome state and local fees would apply. A recent study from the Progressive Policy Institute estimated that reclassification would ultimately cost consumers $17 billion in new user fees, in addition to less investment and hampered innovation.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of poor folks who don\u2019t have broadband,\u201d Jackson told the Washington Post. \u201cIf you create something where, for the poor, the lane is slower and the cost is more, you can\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP agrees with Jackson, as well as the National Urban League and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, according to a New York Times article highlighting civil rights groups\u2019 widely varying takes on the issue. The Times goes on to list other divided groups:\n\nColorofChange.org, a black political coalition, and the National Hispanic Media Coalition, for example, support treating Internet access as an essential service like electricity or water \u2014 as Mr. Obama proposed \u2014 while the League of United Latin American Citizens opposes it.\n\nOn the opposite side of the NAACP and Jackson stands the generally conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who backed Title II classification for broadband nearly ten years ago.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2005 decision in Brand X ruled that broadband did not qualify for Title II regulation because it was an \u201cinformation service\u201d that offered several services rather than internet as a \u201cstand-alone offering.\u201d Scalia called this an \u201cimplausible\u201d interpretation and said that the FCC had \u201cexceeded the authority given it by Congress.\u201d In his dissent, Scalia wrote that \u201c\u2026the Commission has attempted to establish a whole new regime of nonregulation, which will make for more or less free-market competition, depending upon whose experts are believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of issues on which President Obama agrees with Justice Antonin Scalia probably could be counted on one hand,\u201d the Times noted last month\u2014\u201c But one such agreement is a doozy\u2026\u201d\n\nMost of Scalia\u2019s fellow conservatives disagree. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) have all made clear that they plan to fight net neutrality rules. Sen.
