But operating losses continued to mount at a pace of $10 million a month due to increasing labor costs, low reimbursement rates from payers and and a dwindling market share.\n\nMergers and acquisitions show little sign of slowing in healthcare, some of them driven by distress, like Daughter\u2019s, while others are driven by the need to achieve scale as the hospital world grapples with massive changes spurred by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe deal with Prime and Daughter\u2019s also includes Daughter\u2019s medical foundation. The hospitals included in the deal are: St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, O\u2019Connor Hospital in San Jose, Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy, Seton Medical Center in Daly City, Seton Coastside in Moss Beach, and the statewide DCHS Medical Foundation.\n\nThe union and several Bay Area politicians have loudly protested Prime as a buyer, largely because of of a 2013 whistle-blower lawsuit alleging Prime fraudulently over billed Medicare and Medicaid by some $50 million. The union also alleged that Prime would likely shutter some of the struggle hospitals and carry out layoffs, a charge Prime has vehemently rejected. It filed a lawsuit against the union claiming SEIU-UHW is \u201cconspiring to extort, threaten and force Prime Healthcare to enter into a \u2018neutrality agreement\u2019 that would enable SEIU to force all employees into the union regardless of choice.\u201d\n\nStay tuned.\n\nPrime is a $2.5 billion system with 29 hospitals and 4,700 beds in nine states.
