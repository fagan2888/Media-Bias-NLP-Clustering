And as he told me in a recent conversation, he believes medtech could learn a lot from the auto industry.\n\nMedical device manufacturers today are facing the same quandary American automakers found themselves in two decades ago, he says. For years, Detroit had the market cornered, affording car companies the luxury of a cost-plus pricing model.\n\nThen, in the 1990s, foreign competitors swooped in with higher quality, more innovative, lower-cost cars that changed the game.\n\n\u201cNow the price was being set for them,\u201d Sapiente explains.\n\nIn other words, the landscape for automakers back then looked much like it does for device makers now in the post-Affordable Care Act era.\n\n\u201cTheir initial direction was to remove content from the vehicle to get the price point competitive,\u201d Sapiente says, illustrating the point by comparing an early \u201890s Cadillac with a Lexus of the same era.\n\n\u201cIf you got into a Lexus, you would see a state-of-the-art interior with leather throughout,\u201d he says. \u201cThen you got into a Cadillac, and you would see a dated interior, where the leather was removed and replaced with a plastic dash.\u201d\n\nThat tactic, as we all know, failed, costing the American auto industry dearly. But fast-forward to today, and it\u2019s a different story. Last year, the Cadillac CTS was the Motor Trend Car of the Year.\n\nWhat changed? Automakers\u2019 mindset. They still have to shrink costs, but instead of achieving that by stripping down their cars, they\u2019ve embraced two concepts from the Toyota Production System: kaizen, or \u201ccontinuous improvement,\u201d and muda, \u201celiminating waste.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re continually trying to make changes to improve the product and continually looking for ways to drive waste from the process,\u201d Sapiente says.\n\nThat\u2019s a strategy medical device makers\u2014who are increasingly facing demand for high-quality products at lower prices\u2014should also adopt.\n\nBut how do they get there?\n\nThe trend toward increased outsourcing in medtech is a step in the right direction, Sapiente says.\n\n\u201cFor years, device makers didn\u2019t want to [outsource production] because they didn\u2019t want to trust suppliers with quality,\u201d he says. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to find partners that understand quality but can also bring cost reduction.\u201d\n\nAutomakers have been doing that for years.\n\n\u201cOne of the things they do in automotive is they want ideas, from their suppliers,\u201d Sapiente says. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask their suppliers to find 5% of their revenue in ideas of how they can cut costs, so you have your whole supply base coming up with ways to improve costs.\u201d\n\nAnother automaker tactic is holding value-engineering workshops, wherein the OEM invites strategic suppliers to look at its designs and suggest ways to improve the product or eliminate waste from the manufacturing process.\n\nSuch strategies, he says, foster a culture that\u2019s committed to driving innovation and efficiency from the ground up.\n\n\u201cThe mentality in the medical device industry, I think, has been more of design for functionality, so vendors are forced to build manufacturing processes around how the device was designed,\u2019\u201d Sapiente says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that hyperfocus on keeping costs down and optimizing the design for manufacturability. By the time manufacturing gets involved, the part has passed 510(k) and, in most cases, it\u2019s far too costly to make improvements that will drive waste or cost out of the process.\u201d\n\nIn the new value-based healthcare landscape, in which device makers are under pressure to put out products that do more for less, it may be time for medtech to take a cue from the car guys.\n\nJamie Hartford is the editor-in-chief of MD+DI.
