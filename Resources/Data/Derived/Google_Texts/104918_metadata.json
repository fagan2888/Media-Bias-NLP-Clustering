In New York, New York City, spends more than a billion -- that's billion with a B -- New York City spends more than a billion dollars a year taking care of the homeless. If anybody is dying on the streets in New York, it's not because nobody cares. It's not because we're not spending enough money. It's not because of Obamacare or lack of it. It's not -- it's because... Well I don't want to oversimplify it, but I'm telling you, those are the kind of things that happen when liberals are in charge of things. I don't even want to waste time explaining it again. If you don't believe me, look at where these problems exist in the greatest numbers and you'll find they're run by liberals Democrats. It's no more complicated than that. But the point is, people are not dying on the streets because people in this country don't care. People are not dying in the streets because they don't have attention, not getting attention, we're not spending money on them. No truth to that whatsoever. Nowhere in any of this is the issue of personal responsibility ever mentioned. Because to do that, why that's, that's cold-hearted. Oh yeah, you can't talk about personal responsibility of people mentally ill, sick, or whatever. If that's the case, what are they doing -- see the liberals are the ones that closed down these institutions folks. It's not -- we don't have the right to keep the mentally ill incarcerated. They have a right to be on the street doing -- ok, they have a right to be out there. Then fine! Stop complaining what happens to them out there. If they have a right to be there -- you cannot win with these people.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "From the February 19 edition of Premiere Radio Networks'\u00a0The Rush Limbaugh Show:", "title": "Limbaugh: If Homeless People Are \"Dying On The Streets\" It's Because \"Liberals Are In Charge\"", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/02/19/limbaugh-if-homeless-people-are-dying-on-the-st/208707", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2013/05/06/rushlimbaugh6.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-19T14:18:39-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/02/19/limbaugh-if-homeless-people-are-dying-on-the-st/208707", "title": "Limbaugh: If Homeless People Are \"Dying On The Streets\" It's Because \"Liberals Are In Charge\"", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Video", "tag": "Premiere Radio Networks", "published_time": "2016-02-19T14:18:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T13:31:46-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/media-matters-staff/70"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f6c\"", "article_summary": "Because to do that, why that's, that's cold-hearted.\nIn New York, New York City, spends more than a billion -- that's billion with a B -- New York City spends more than a billion dollars a year taking care of the homeless.\nIf anybody is dying on the streets in New York, it's not because nobody cares.\nPeople are not dying in the streets because they don't have attention, not getting attention, we're not spending money on them.\nBut the point is, people are not dying on the streets because people in this country don't care."}
