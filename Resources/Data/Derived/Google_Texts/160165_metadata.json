Pasco schools have about 14,000 driving-age students, so the figure there also is about 1 percent.\n\nThe number of suspensions mostly tracks by population: Miami-Dade, which has the biggest public-school district in Florida, was No. 1 for 2013-14 with 671. Seven smaller counties \u2014 including Indian River \u2014 had no suspension orders.\n\nThe law, however, applies equally to students in private schools, saying they all must meet \u201crelevant attendance requirements.\u201d It does allow for hardship waivers in rare circumstances, such as for health or family crises.\n\nCollier County was No. 15 with 75 suspensions issued. In St. Lucie County, there were 27 and Martin County had just one for the whole year.\n\n\u201cWhile the numbers include suspensions for those who drop out of school, they predominantly reflect those students who had their driver licenses suspended\u201d because of poor attendance, said John Lucas, spokesman for the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n\nPinellas County has had a reputation for absenteeism, with a handful of students missing more than 40 days of school by February of the 2012-13 school year, according to reports.\n\nTwo years before that, Pinellas had the worst attendance among Florida school districts of more than 100,000 students.\n\nRecords for 2010-11 show 13 percent of students were classified as \u201cchronic absentees,\u201d meaning they missed 21 days or more of school.\n\nDriving-privilege suspensions aren\u2019t a magic cure, Pinellas school board member Rene Flowers said.\n\n\u201cI have to agree that if a child does not have a car or access to a car, it\u2019s not a deterrent,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor those kids, we just need to get to the heart of why they\u2019re not coming to school,\u201d Flowers added. \u201cAre they only missing morning classes? Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re oversleeping because they also work at night.\n\n\u201cOr maybe they skip school because they\u2019re being bullied, or because they can\u2019t grasp the material and aren\u2019t getting help,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we need to bridge that gap.\u201d\n\nDavid Chamberlin, a student services supervisor for Pasco County public schools, points to one benefit of the law:\n\nThe state can compel teens to attend school only to the age of 16 so the threat of driving suspensions dissuades them from dropping out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one mechanism to keep the 17-year-olds in line,\u201d Chamberlin said. \u201cThen they have a real investment in coming to class. It\u2019s definitely a strong motivator for those kids.\u201d\n\nIn Indian River County, which had no suspensions, the school district started an attendance awareness campaign this year, said Lillian Torres-Martinez, the student services director.\n\nSocial workers and individual schools help by creating mentoring programs, she added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about building these relationships,\u201d Torres-Martinez said. Students \u201cdevelop a sense of belonging in school.\u201d\n\nResearch also shows truancy has different causes for students of different socioeconomic levels. That\u2019s another reason why administrators and policymakers continually have to brainstorm for better tools.\n\nThe threat of having a driver\u2019s license suspended may not mean as much in St. Lucie County, according to Stacey Cason, student services program specialist.\n\nEconomic status plays a part in whether a teen even applies for a license, she said.\n\nIn St. Lucie, 16.6 percent of residents live below the poverty line, census figures show; that\u2019s 1 percent over the state average of 15.6 percent. Cason said she doesn\u2019t see as many students applying for licenses as elsewhere. Schools there do encourage students to attend school regularly because \u201cthey can\u2019t learn if they\u2019re not there,\u201d Cason said. Many schools have attendance committees that look at what can be done to make a child want to be at school.\n\nIn Pinellas, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to do all we can to get kids to come to school, we really are,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cOur kids are growing up in a much different world that what we faced.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re not just school board members, we\u2019re social workers, we\u2019re planners, we\u2019re data analysts; we can be a sister, a brother, an aunt or an uncle, a mentor,\u201d she added. \u201cHow do you handle all that?\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 05 Oct 2014 23:53:55 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 For some Florida teens, October is the bewitching month for reasons other than Halloween.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 For some Florida teens, October is the bewitching month for reasons other than Halloween.", "title": "Driver\u2019s licenses used to combat teen truancy", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/drivers-licenses-used-to-combat-teen-truancy-20141005/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-10-05T23:54:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Driver\u2019s licenses used to combat teen truancy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-10-05T23:53:55Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T23:54:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9397\"", "article_summary": "The rankings are roughly proportionate to the driving-age population \u2014 about 2 percent of Pinellas students old enough to drive, for example, ran afoul of the law.\nThree Tampa Bay counties made the top 10 list for suspensions issued last school year: Pinellas was No.\nDriving-privilege suspensions aren\u2019t a magic cure, Pinellas school board member Rene Flowers said.\nStudents \u201cdevelop a sense of belonging in school.\u201dResearch also shows truancy has different causes for students of different socioeconomic levels.\nMany schools have attendance committees that look at what can be done to make a child want to be at school."}
