Take the E train to the airport, and you\u2019ll see global businessmen standing alongside minimum-wage airport workers.\n\nBut in much of the country, public transit is only for the poor \u2014 making it more equal but also shoddier, because nobody with power cares.\n\nAnother key to the city\u2019s public wealth is charity.\n\nThe city\u2019s top 1 percent donated $4.6 billion to charity in 2011 \u2014 67 percent of New York\u2019s charitable deductions.
