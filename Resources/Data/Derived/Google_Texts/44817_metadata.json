But HELOCs can also pose risks should interest rates rise sharply or home values plummet.\n\nWhen the housing market crashed in late 2007, it wiped out the equity many borrowers had in their homes, prompting lenders to slash their available credit. Others overextended themselves, assuming home prices would continue to rise and boost their ability to borrow more money against their equity.\n\nThat\u2019s not deterring many homeowners from using a portion of their homes\u2019 value as a piggy bank. Available credit extended through HELOCs to U.S. homeowners jumped 27 percent to $120 billion in the 12 months that ended June 30, according to Experian Decision Analytics data.\n\n\u201cIt's important to think about whether the payments are affordable and whether it\u2019s worth putting the equity in your house at risk,\u201d said Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know to determine whether a HELOC is right for you.\n\nThe basics\n\nHome equity lines of credit essentially function like a credit card or a traditional line of credit. Borrowers can tap a portion of their available credit, pay it off, and use it again for the term of the credit line or draw period, which is typically 10 years.\n\nAfter that, any unpaid balance converts to a loan that must be repaid over a predetermined period, typically 10-20 years. In some cases, a lender will require payment in full at the end of the draw period.\n\nOne key benefit HELOCs have over standard bank loans that are not secured by real estate is that borrowers can deduct their interest payments on balances up to $100,000 against their tax liability.\n\nConsider the rate\n\nBecause the terms of HELOCs can vary, it\u2019s essential to understand how interest rates will be applied on your loan.\n\nBeyond determining the length of the draw period and starting interest rate, you\u2019ll want to know whether the terms of the loan include payment in full at the end of the draw period and how much time, if any, you\u2019ll have to pay back the balance.\n\nLenders generally base the starting interest rate on HELOCs on the prime rate. Look for lenders that offer to cap that prime rate over the life of the loan, which will protect against a spike as rates fluctuate over the draw period.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs have been trending lower this year. The average is now around 4.87 percent, according to Bankrate.com. That\u2019s based on a $30,000 line of credit with a combined loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent. The loan-to-value ratio is determined by weighing how much a borrower would owe on home loans against what the property is worth.\n\nMany economists predict loan rates will go higher beginning next year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates.\n\nDo you qualify?\n\nHaving equity in your home doesn\u2019t automatically qualify you for a HELOC.\n\nLenders will want to review your credit and income history going back a couple of years, as well as a couple of months of bank statements.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to look at your ability to have saved, your ability to have cash reserves,\u201d said Cyndee Kendall, regional mortgage sales manager at Bank of the West. \u201cDo you have the wherewithal to pull from savings to make a payment if need be?\u201d\n\nThe size of your credit line will also depend on how much equity you have relative to any other mortgages on the property. This is assessed by determining your combined loan-to-value ratio.\n\nIt\u2019s generally calculated by adding what you owe on your mortgage and the proposed credit line amount, then dividing that total by the home\u2019s appraised value.\n\nFor example, someone who owes $200,000 on a mortgage, wants a $30,000 HELOC and whose home is valued at $350,000 would have a combined loan-to-value ratio of 65.7 percent.\n\nMost lenders won\u2019t approve HELOCs where the borrower\u2019s combined loan-to-value ratio is above 80 percent, though some go as high as 90. Ideally, borrowers need at least 20 percent equity, said Mike Kinane, retail lending senior product manager at TD Bank.\n\nIn Texas, the rules for HELOCs are a little different. Texans can establish lines of credit using up to 50 percent of the value of their homes as collateral (as opposed to the 80 percent allowed on standard loans).\n\nAnother option\n\nIf you need funds that you know you won\u2019t be able to pay off within a couple of years, consider a home equity loan, said Kevin Meehan, certified financial planner at Wealth Enhancement Group.\n\nSuch loans also tap home equity, but generally come with a fixed principal and interest payment. This eliminates the potential shock payment risk of a variable interest rate.\n\n\u201cInstead of accessing a HELOC, if you have debt elsewhere, it might be the better long-term decision to roll it all together \u2026 where you have longer to pay it off with no interest rate risk,\u201d Meehan said.\n\nAlex Veiga,\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rising home values and low interest rates have spurred many borrowers to take out a home equity line of credit against the value of their home.", "og": {"description": "Rising home values and low interest rates have spurred many borrowers to take out a home equity line of credit against the value of their home.", "title": "Is a home equity line of credit a fit for you?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140829-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit-a-fit-for-you.ece", "image": {"width": 550, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140829-0803bus_perfi_heloc_web.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/0803bus_perfi_heloc_WEB.jpg", "height": 670}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-30T02:58:16Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-30T02:20:08Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Is a home equity line of credit a fit for you?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140829-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit-a-fit-for-you.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140829-0803bus_perfi_heloc_web.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/0803bus_perfi_heloc_WEB.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1888637\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-30T02:20:08Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140829-0803bus_perfi_heloc_web.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/0803bus_perfi_heloc_WEB.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-30T02:20:08Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0d5\"", "article_summary": "The basicsHome equity lines of credit essentially function like a credit card or a traditional line of credit.\nThe trend, fueled by the two-year housing recovery, has helped spur many borrowers to take out a home equity line of credit against the value of their home.\nIt\u2019s generally calculated by adding what you owe on your mortgage and the proposed credit line amount, then dividing that total by the home\u2019s appraised value.\nBorrowers can tap a portion of their available credit, pay it off, and use it again for the term of the credit line or draw period, which is typically 10 years.\nMany economists predict loan rates will go higher beginning next year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates."}
