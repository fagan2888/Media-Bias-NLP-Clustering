He also was required to complete 1,000 hours of volunteer service with an animal welfare organization.\n\nHague may face charges in Vancouver, where he is alleged to have abused a friend\u2019s Doberman puppy in an elevator, the company said.\n\nHe was captured on surveillance video kicking the dog and violently yanking on the animal\u2019s leash. The video, which was posted to YouTube, resulted in social-media backlash against the company.\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate that we do not condone nor would we ever overlook the abuse of animals,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Donnell, chairman of the board of directors for Centerplate. \u201cFollowing an extended review of the incident involving Mr. Hague, I\u2019d like to apologize for the distress that this situation has caused to so many; but also thank our employees, clients and guests who expressed their feelings about this incident. Their voices helped us to frame our deliberations during this very unusual and unfortunate set of circumstances.\u201d\n\nVerros has been Centerplate\u2019s chief operating officer since 2010 and the company said he has helped it achieve unprecedented growth.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Centerplate CEO resigns in wake of animal-abuse allegations", "title": "Centerplate CEO resigns in wake of animal-abuse allegations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/02/centerplate-ceo-resigns-in-wake-of-animal-abuse-allegations/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-02T17:19:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-02T17:19:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fbf\"", "article_summary": "He was captured on surveillance video kicking the dog and violently yanking on the animal\u2019s leash.\nHague may face charges in Vancouver, where he is alleged to have abused a friend\u2019s Doberman puppy in an elevator, the company said.\nThe video, which was posted to YouTube, resulted in social-media backlash against the company.\nStamford, Conn.-based Centerplate, which holds concession and catering contracts at the Colorado Convention Center, Sports Authority Field at Mile High, and the Denver Performing Arts Complex, on Tuesday said CEO Desmond Hague has resigned in the wake of allegations that he mistreated a dog in his care.\nHe also was required to complete 1,000 hours of volunteer service with an animal welfare organization."}
