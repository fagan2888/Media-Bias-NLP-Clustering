After all, that fight has been going on throughout the Obama presidency, leaving the political field strewn with casualties and the party consumed by resentments running in both directions.\n\nBut as Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy has revealed, it\u2019s actually more complicated than that. Trump has moved out to the front of the Republican pack by assembling a large group of supporters that resembles the Tea Party in some ways, but is completely different in its motivations. And the rest of the party \u2014 particularly Jeb Bush, who was supposed to be the establishment\u2019s candidate \u2014 can\u2019t figure out what to do about it. In the last day or two Bush and Trump have traded nasty web videos (and wasn\u2019t it about time this race got a little mean?), and they show how these two candidates have a completely different understanding of the electorate to which they\u2019re appealing.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Jeb\u2019s:\n\nAfter trading jabs with his competitor for the Republican nomination for president on the campaign trail, candidate Jeb Bush posted an ad showing Donald Trump in a series of television interviews. (Jeb Bush)\n\nThe message here is that Trump isn\u2019t a real Republican, for reasons partisan (he calls himself a Democrat at one point), ideological (he has taken stands on abortion, health care, and taxes that aren\u2019t conservative), and personal (he said nice things about Bill and Hillary Clinton). And finally, the video opens and closes with Trump saying \u201cI lived in New York City in Manhattan all my life, so my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.\u201d Horrors! (Jeb, on the other hand, learned his down-home rural values on long tractor rides through the corn fields with his pappy.)\n\nSo who is this supposed to appeal to? People who care a great deal about the Republican Party, and for whom it\u2019s very important that candidates agree with them on the key issues that form the core of conservative ideology. In other words, it\u2019s an appeal that comes right out of that establishment/Tea Party conflict.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s video about Jeb. As you might expect, he\u2019s playing an entirely different game, and none too subtly:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump released this video via social media criticizing his opponent Jeb Bush for a comment he made referring to undocumented immigrants' move to the U.S. as an \"act of love.\" (realdonaldtrump/Instagram)\n\nIn fairness, we should note that this is misleading and unfair, since it gives you the impression that when Jeb talked about \u201can act of love,\u201d he was referring not to undocumented immigrants coming to America, but to criminals killing people. In any case, while Jeb\u2019s message is that Trump isn\u2019t a real Republican, Trump\u2019s message is that Jeb loves illegal aliens who are coming to kill your daughter.\n\nTrump\u2019s message is targeted at voters who either don\u2019t care much about ideology and party loyalty, or care about it less than they do about the threat of immigrants. He has an entirely different understanding of the Republican electorate, one that so far seems pretty accurate.\n\nAs important as the anti-immigrant rhetoric is to Trump\u2019s campaign, its heart lies in a slightly different place. If Trump is right, then the real source of discontent with the GOP\u2019s leaders isn\u2019t that they\u2019ve been insufficiently conservative, which was the basis of the Tea Party\u2019s attacks on the establishment and its occasionally successful efforts to oust incumbent members of Congress. And it isn\u2019t that they\u2019ve been impractical and unrealistic, which is the establishment\u2019s belief about the Tea Party. Trump is banking on the idea that the real source of discontent with the party\u2019s leaders is that they\u2019re ineffectual. They can\u2019t get anything done, whether it\u2019s non-partisan goals like keeping jobs in America or partisan goals like repealing the Affordable Care Act. They said they were going to destroy Barack Obama, and they didn\u2019t; instead they talked a lot, shut down the government, held 50+ votes to repeal the ACA, and delivered essentially nothing of substance to their voters.\n\nAs just one data point, in the latest Quinnipiac poll, 69 percent of Republicans said they disapprove of the job Republicans in Congress are doing. It\u2019s only one poll, but that\u2019s a stunning level of contempt; as a point of comparison, only 37 percent of Democrats in the poll disapprove of the job Democrats in Congress are doing.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about government understands that it\u2019s absurd to believe that Donald Trump will just blow into DC and solve every problem the country faces through the force of his indomitable will. But Trump has figured out that with the right messenger, bombast can be more appealing than ideological fealty. Yes, he\u2019s appealing to nativist and xenophobic sentiments, but he\u2019s also arguing that he\u2019ll succeed precisely where the GOP as a whole \u2014 establishment types, Tea Party types, all of them \u2014 have failed in recent years, because unlike everyone else he can supposedly \u201cget things done.\u201d\n\nYou have to be pretty na\u00efve to think that Trump can do that when no one else can. But he\u2019s answering a question that candidates like Bush aren\u2019t even asking, which may explain why the race looks the way it does right now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turns out it's not about the establishment vs. the Tea Party after all.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Turns out it's not about the establishment vs. the Tea Party after all.", "title": "Donald Trump reveals where the real conflict within the GOP lies", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/01/donald-trump-reveals-where-the-real-conflict-within-the-gop-lies/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/plum-line/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0e8ae-021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/01/donald-trump-reveals-where-the-real-conflict-within-the-gop-lies/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "donald trump, 2016 gop presidential primary, jeb bush, republican primary voters, gop establishment, 2016 presidential race, amnesty, immigration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, 2016 gop presidential primary, jeb bush, republican primary voters, gop establishment, 2016 presidential race, amnesty, immigration"}, "article_summary": "And it isn\u2019t that they\u2019ve been impractical and unrealistic, which is the establishment\u2019s belief about the Tea Party.\nAnd the rest of the party \u2014 particularly Jeb Bush, who was supposed to be the establishment\u2019s candidate \u2014 can\u2019t figure out what to do about it.\nIn any case, while Jeb\u2019s message is that Trump isn\u2019t a real Republican, Trump\u2019s message is that Jeb loves illegal aliens who are coming to kill your daughter.\nTrump is banking on the idea that the real source of discontent with the party\u2019s leaders is that they\u2019re ineffectual.\nIn the last day or two Bush and Trump have traded nasty web videos (and wasn\u2019t it about time this race got a little mean?"}
