In late January, Mike Huckabee\u2014ever the feminist\u2014told the RNC that the Obamacare requirement that health insurance plans cover contraception is an \u201cinsult to women.\u201d\n\nI doubt that Huckabee consulted any women before drawing this conclusion, and as a woman myself, I'd have to disagree. But let's hear him out:\n\n\n\nThe fact is the Republicans don't have a war on women, they have a war for women, to empower them to be something other than victims of their gender.\n\n\n\nCompelling rhetoric, but ultimately a circular argument. If the GOP is waging a war on behalf of women so that they don't become victims of the patriarchy, who are they fighting? The women whose rights they want to take away? The women that they hope to stick with incomplete and low-quality health insurance plans? Either way, who asked all these white dudes to wage war for us?\n\nHuckabee continued:\n\n\n\nIf the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it. Let's take that discussion all across America.\n\n\n\nOh, there it is. Democrats are tricking ladies into thinking that they are untameable sex monsters who need the government to pay for their sex pills. The veil has been lifted.\n\nConservative radio show host Sean Hannity piggybacked on Huckabee's brilliance with a suggestion that all the women who are not in control of \u201ctheir libido or their reproductive system\u201d (or their PCOS, but whatever) should simply buy each other's birth control.\n\nSpeaking to a female caller who argued that not every woman can afford contraception, Hannity asked, \u201cWhy don't women like yourself, then, maybe have an Adopt-a-Woman birth control program?\u201d\n\nHere's why: As Slate pointed out, \u201c[T]he contraception mandate is closer to a consumer protection law. It's really part of a larger program in the Affordable Care Act to set minimum standards about what your insurance plan must cover. It's really no different than a law requiring a car to have four wheels and two headlights to be considered a street legal vehicle.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2014or, as Huckabee creepily refers to it, \u201cUncle Sugar\u201d\u2014isn't paying for women's birth control (if only!). The government is raising the standards for what health insurance plans must include.\n\n\u201cWomen like ourselves\u201d shouldn't have to create a separate form of insurance to pay for other women's birth control, because it is a crucial part of preventive health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious that neither Huckabee nor Hannity is making a similar case for other Obamacare-mandated covered health services, like blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, vaccines and obesity counseling.\n\nNatalie tweets from @nsanluis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives are praising Sean Hannity for discovering the \"solution\" to the \"health care dilemma\" surrounding contraception: Create an Adopt-a-Woman birt", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Burnt Orange Report", "description": "Conservatives are praising Sean Hannity for discovering the \"solution\" to the \"health care dilemma\" surrounding contraception: Create an Adopt-a-Woman birt", "title": "Sean Hannity Proposes Adopt-a-Woman Plan for Birth Control Coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/gallery/fox-news-then-and-now/8-hannity.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-04T18:47:32-05:00", "url": "http://www.burntorangereport.com/diary/14762/sean-hannity-proposes-adoptawoman-plan-for-birth-control-coverage", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives are praising Sean Hannity for discovering the \"solution\" to the \"health care dilemma\" surrounding contraception: Create an Adopt-a-Woman birt", "creator": "@nsanluis", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/gallery/fox-news-then-and-now/8-hannity.jpg", "title": "Sean Hannity Proposes Adopt-a-Woman Plan for Birth Control Coverage", "site": "@bor", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1559290521009974}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BurntOrangeReport", "published_time": "2014-02-04T20:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T18:47:32-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "texas, politics, burnt orange report"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda7b\"", "article_summary": "19 Flares Filament.io 19 Flares \u00d7Conservatives are praising Sean Hannity for discovering the \u201csolution\u201d to the \u201chealth care dilemma\u201d surrounding contraception: Create an Adopt-a-Woman birth control program.\nThe government is raising the standards for what health insurance plans must include.\nThe women that they hope to stick with incomplete and low-quality health insurance plans?\n\u201cWomen like ourselves\u201d shouldn't have to create a separate form of insurance to pay for other women's birth control, because it is a crucial part of preventive health care.\nConservative radio show host Sean Hannity piggybacked on Huckabee's brilliance with a suggestion that all the women who are not in control of \u201ctheir libido or their reproductive system\u201d (or their PCOS, but whatever) should simply buy each other's birth control."}
