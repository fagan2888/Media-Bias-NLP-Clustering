It highlights several major problem areas \u2014 including a dearth of easily accessible mental health facilities, insufficient evidence proving the efficacy of current military mental health screening programs, and a dysfunctional inter-agency coordination system that hinders various service branches and government departments\u2019 efforts to communicate with each other.\n\nMental health problems kept U.S. service members hospitalized for more days in 2012 than combat wounds, accidental injuries, and physical illnesses combined, according to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. Military suicides outnumber combat deaths by a 2:1 margin, and anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans suffer from PTSD while about 730,000 veterans have some sort of mental illness.\n\nThe IOM report confirms previous studies indicating that the military isn\u2019t effective at identifying service members at risk for a mental illness. According to a 2013 News Tribune analysis of data from the Madigan Army Medical Center, less than half a percent of soldiers who took a mental health screening before being deployed during the height of the Iraq War were diverted from combat roles \u2014 even after showing signs of a mental health problem. In fact, a stunning 70 percent of veterans with a mental illness either don\u2019t receive mental health care at all or get inadequate treatment.\n\nIOM recommends several strategies for improving military mental health care screenings and treatments, such as establishing evidence-based databases on which programs are most effective; expanding support for military spouses and children; building inter-department systems between the Pentagon and the VA to keep track of which treatments work best for service members and their families.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs still have a long way to go, according to a new report from the Institute of Medicine.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs still have a long way to go, according to a new report from the Institute of Medicine.", "title": "REPORT: The Military Needs To Get Better At Preventing Service Members\u2019 Mental Health Problems", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/20/3313601/iom-report-military-mental-health-ineffective/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_soldier-mental-health-depression-e1392921159347.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs still have a long way to go, according to a new report from the Institute of Medicine.", "title": "REPORT: The Military Needs To Get Better At Preventing Service Members\u2019 Mental Health Problems", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_soldier-mental-health-depression-e1392921159347-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_soldier-mental-health-depression-e1392921159347.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_soldier-mental-health-depression-e1392921159347.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-20T14:57:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9ff\"", "article_summary": "Health REPORT: The Military Needs To Get Better At Preventing Service Members\u2019 Mental Health Problems CREDIT: ShutterstockThe Department of Defense has a long way to go when it comes to effectively preventing mental health problems among service members and veterans, according to a new report by the independent, nonprofit Institute of Medicine (IOM).\nThe IOM report confirms previous studies indicating that the military isn\u2019t effective at identifying service members at risk for a mental illness.\nMental health problems kept U.S. service members hospitalized for more days in 2012 than combat wounds, accidental injuries, and physical illnesses combined, according to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.\nIn fact, a stunning 70 percent of veterans with a mental illness either don\u2019t receive mental health care at all or get inadequate treatment.\nIt highlights several major problem areas \u2014 including a dearth of easily accessible mental health facilities, insufficient evidence proving the efficacy of current military mental health screening programs, and a dysfunctional inter-agency coordination system that hinders various service branches and government departments\u2019 efforts to communicate with each other."}
