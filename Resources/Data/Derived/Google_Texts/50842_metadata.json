This is why it\u2019s so easy for someone diagnosed with a disease experiences a domino effect of other health problems. Infertility is one of those problems, and hypertension may be to blame, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cAbout 15 percent of all couples have fertility issues, and in half of those cases the male partner has semen deficiencies,\u201d said lead author Dr. Michael Eisenberg, assistant professor of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University, in a press release. \u201cWe should be paying more attention to these millions of men.\u201d\n\nIt makes sense when you look at the effects of stress and high blood pressure on a man\u2019s reproductive health, and vice versa. It eventually becomes a cycle of worsening health. Erectile dysfunction (ED) happens when a man can\u2019t get it up due to problems with the vascular network in the penis. In fact, problems with these blood vessels \u2014 they usually become too narrow to carry the right amount of blood \u2014 are the most common cause of ED, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. So right there, you have problems with the cardiovascular and reproductive system. Naturally, something like this becomes stressful, an effect that\u2019s been shown to reduce sperm quality.\n\nBy wrangling in all these components, infertility patients may be able to improve their health and quality of life. \u201cA man\u2019s health is strongly correlated with his semen quality,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cGiven the high incidence of infertility, we need to take a broader view. As we treat men\u2019s infertility, we should also assess their overall health. That visit to a fertility clinic represents a big opportunity to improve their treatment for other conditions, which we now suspect could actually help resolve the infertility they came in for in the first place.\u201d\n\nEisenberg and his team discovered the correlation after looking over the medical records of 9,387 men, whose media age was 38, and who\u2019d gone to Stanford Hospital & Clinics between 1994 and 2011. The men regularly submitted semen samples, which were analyzed for volume, concentration, and motility \u2014 the ability for sperm to move through the female reproductive tract. About half the men had abnormal semen. But when the researchers looked at other health problems, they found that 44 percent had something else that could have been causing infertility. Heart, vascular, and blood pressure problems played the largest role.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s much easier said than done to ease stress and subsequent high blood pressure, and thus improve fertility, men with these problems may benefit from a Mediterranean diet. A study from just last week found that men with ED who began eating the fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, olive oil, fish, and unrefined grains that comprise the diet were able to reverse some vessel damage. Thus ED may improve, and maybe even sperm quality \u2014 maybe. Besides the Mediterranean diet, there are so many more ways to reduce stress, you just have to find what\u2019s right for you.\n\nSource: Cullen M, Eisenberg M, Behr B, Pera R, Li S.
