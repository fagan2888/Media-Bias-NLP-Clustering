It is predicted that will drop to 62 percent by the 2020-21 school year.\n\nThese demographic shifts may accelerate as housing prices continue to climb, Boasberg said.\n\n\u201cTremendous numbers of families of color are being priced out,\u201d Boasberg said. \u201cYou see it in Northwest Denver and around the Sloan\u2019s Lake area and in Five Points. But we are beginning to see it in Elyria-Swansea. Those schools are losing families of color.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the district is seeing a decline in enrollment in the earlier grades.\n\nKindergarten enrollment is falling due to the decline in the number of births during the recession. That trend is expected to continue as families with fewer children are moving into the city and more couples are choosing not to have children or as many, Boasberg said.\n\nDenver is not about to become Aspen.\n\nDPS serves a large urban center that will still have a large minority and poor population for decades \u2014 even if gentrification accelerates.\n\nThe school district must not abandon its focus on helping disadvantaged children.\n\nDPS reform efforts for a decade have been led by superintendents with big hearts and a committed vow to improvement.\n\nIt is imperative as the demographics of Denver change to not lose focus.\n\nFuture administrators must continue to speed up the narrowing of the achievement gap between minority students and their white peers.\n\nOverall district achievement levels will likely improve as the district becomes wealthier. Affluence tends to mirror academic success.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the game has been won.\n\nIn the meantime, nonprofit groups that have helped shepherd Denver\u2019s reforms and have been focused on DPS\u2019s struggles must begin shifting their focus outside of the city where many disadvantaged families are increasingly residing.\n\nThankfully, that appears to be happening.\n\nA-Plus Denver, an organization created to \u201charness the power of Denver\u2019s civic leadership\u201d to push student achievement, recently released a report on the troubled Aurora Public Schools.\n\nThe Piton Foundation, which has been focused on improving educational opportunities for disadvantaged kids in Denver, also is now working on issues in Aurora and Adams County.\n\nDenver is certainly changing, but the sad fact that too many kids are struggling in school hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
