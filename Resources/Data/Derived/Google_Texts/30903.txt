Prince's publicist says the music superstar's remains have been cremated and a small group of family, friends and musicians have celebrated his life in a private ceremony.

Yvette Noel-Schure said in a statement Saturday that Prince's remains have been cremated and their "final storage" will be private.

The 57-year-old singer died Thursday at his Paisley Park compound in suburban Minneapolis. An autopsy was done Friday but no cause has been announced.

The publicist's statement said the cause of death remains unknown. It said it will be at least four weeks before results are released.
