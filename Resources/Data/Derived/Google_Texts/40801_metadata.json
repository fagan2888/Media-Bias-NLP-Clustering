Bob McDonnell and his wife hasn\u2019t slowed lobbyist spending in Virginia.\n\nTotal lobbyist spending was up nearly 5 percent in the 2013-2014 year ending in April 30 over the year before, according to data compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nThe number of \u201ctangible gifts\u201d lobbyists gave did take a sharp drop from the year before \u2014 but 2012-2013 also was an unusually big year for gift giving, VPAP noted.\n\nIn other words, lobbyists in Virginia are still spending a pretty penny to buy influence \u2014 $1.72 million, to be precise, up from $1.64 million the year before, adjusted for inflation.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear many of the top lobbying groups were focused on one thing \u2014 fighting for, or against, Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe conservative Americans for Prosperity, a consistent voice against expansion, spent the most in lobbying expenses in the 2013-2014 year \u2014 nearly $480,000.\n\n\u201cNo question,\u201d said AFP Virginia State Director Sean Lansing. \u201cStopping Medicaid was our top priority of the session.\n\nBut Lansing called those figures a little \u201cmisleading,\u201d because so much of their lobbying was a \u201cgrassroots\u201d effort of reaching out to citizens, rather than elected officials.\n\n\u201cOur paid staff who were out in the field knocking on those doors, making those phone calls, are required to file their time by Virginia law as grassroots lobbying,\u201d Lansing said, adding that AFP workers knocked on about 50,00 doors and made about 75,000 phone calls in just a couple of months.\n\nJust behind AFP in spending is the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, which has pushed for some form of Medicaid expansion to compensate hospitals for other money they\u2019re losing through the Affordable Care Act. It recorded roughly $475,000 in lobbying expenses in the same time frame.\n\nThe Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\n\nLike AFP, VHHA had representatives at virtually every meeting of the Medicaid Innovation and Reform Commission, a controversial commission created under the McDonnell administration to find ways to reform and possibly expand Medicaid.\n\nThe usual lobbying powerhouses Dominion and Altria spent the third and fourth most on lobbying, respectively. After them, however, come health insurance company Anthem and the Medical Society of Virginia.\n\nThe fight over Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t over yet, even though a Republican-dominated General Assembly shot it down earlier this summer. With Health and Human Services Secretary Bill Hazel expected to come up with a plan for some form of expanded health care coverage by Monday, and the General Assembly scheduled to return for a special session on the subject in mid-September, Virginians haven\u2019t heard the last of this yet.\n\n\u201cIt remains our top priority,\u201d Lansing said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Medicaid expansion issue was a big driver of lobbyist spending in the 2013-2014 disclosure year.", "title": "Medicaid expansion debate drives lobbyist spending in Virginia - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/08/Medicaid-cash.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-29T04:00:20+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/167816/medicaid-expansion-lobbyist-spending/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Bob McDonnell,lobbyist,Richmond,State Government,Terry McAuliffe,Virginia,Washington", "published_time": "2014-08-29T04:00:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T04:00:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Medicaid expansion issue was a big driver of lobbyist spending in the 2013-2014 disclosure year.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/08/Medicaid-cash.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid expansion debate drives lobbyist spending in Virginia - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The Medicaid expansion issue was a big driver of lobbyist spending in the 2013-2014 disclosure year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb87\"", "article_summary": "The fight over Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t over yet, even though a Republican-dominated General Assembly shot it down earlier this summer.\nStill, it\u2019s clear many of the top lobbying groups were focused on one thing \u2014 fighting for, or against, Medicaid expansion.\nThe conservative Americans for Prosperity, a consistent voice against expansion, spent the most in lobbying expenses in the 2013-2014 year \u2014 nearly $480,000.\nBob McDonnell and his wife hasn\u2019t slowed lobbyist spending in Virginia.\nJust behind AFP in spending is the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, which has pushed for some form of Medicaid expansion to compensate hospitals for other money they\u2019re losing through the Affordable Care Act."}
