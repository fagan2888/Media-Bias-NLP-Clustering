The Edmond Police Department has confirmed OSU basketball player Stevie Clark was arrested Wednesday morning after a traffic stop.

Around 10 a.m., an officer pulled over a vehicle on northbound Interstate 35 at 33rd Street. Edmond Police spokeswoman Jenny Monroe says the car the Cowboys freshman point guard was a passenger in was stopped for a seatbelt violation, but the officer determined there was marijuana in the car.

Both Clark and the driver were arrested for possession of marijuana.

Early last month, Clark returned to the court after a brief suspension. The coach did not say why Clark was suspended.
