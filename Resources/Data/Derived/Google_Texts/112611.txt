More Americans, or one of three US voters, are now supporting the idea that states should have the right to ignore federal court rulings if their elected state officials disagree with them.

A poll was conducted by Rasmussen Reports after the US Supreme Courts issued decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage.

The survey was conducted among 1,000 likely voters from June 30 to July 1.

A total of 33 percent of the respondents said states should ignore federal court rulings, up from 24 percent in the same poll conducted last February.

Just over half, 52 percent, disagreed, down from 58 percent in the earlier survey. Fifteen percent remained undecided.

"Perhaps even more disturbing is that the voters who feel strongest about overriding the federal courts—Republicans and conservatives—are those who traditionally have been the most supportive of the Constitution and separation of powers," Rasmussen Reports said.

It claimed that under the Obama administration, "these voters have become increasingly suspicious and even hostile toward the federal government."

Fifty percent of Republican voters support the idea of states having the right to ignore federal court rulings compared to 22 percent among Democrat voters and 30 percent of voters who are not affiliated with either party.

The survey said 50 percent of conservative voters support this idea but just 27 percent among moderates and 15 percent among liberals.

A Rasmussen Reports poll on the US Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage said 49 percent of likely US voters agreed with the decision while 45 percent opposed it.

In an earlier poll, 26 percent of votes said President Obama should have the right to ignore federal court rulings if they are standing in the way of actions he feels are important for the country. A total of 43 percent of Democrats agreed while 81 percent of Republicans and 67 percent of unaffiliated voters disagreed.
