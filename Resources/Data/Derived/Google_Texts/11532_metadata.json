Photo by Heidi de Marco/KHN\n\nMonth after month, Natalia Pedroza showed up at the doctor\u2019s office with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. Her medications never seemed to work, and she kept returning to the emergency room in crisis.\n\nWalfred Lopez, a Los Angeles County community health worker, was determined to figure out why.\n\nLopez spoke to her in her native Spanish and, little by little, gained her trust. Pedroza, a street vendor living in downtown Los Angeles, shared with him that she was depressed. She didn\u2019t have immigration papers, she told him, and her children still lived in Mexico.\n\nThen she mentioned something she hadn\u2019t told her doctors: She was nearly blind.\n\nPedroza\u2019s doctor, Janina Morrison, was stunned. For years, Morrison said, \u201cpeople have been changing her medications and changing her insulin doses, not really realizing that she can\u2019t read the bottles.\u201d\n\nHealth officials across the country face a vexing quandary: How do you help the sickest and neediest patients get healthier and prevent their costly visits to emergency rooms? Los Angeles County is testing whether community health workers like Lopez may be one part of the answer.\n\nFront lines\n\nLopez is among 25 workers employed by the county to do everything possible to remove obstacles standing in the way of patients\u2019 health. That may mean coaching them about their diseases, ensuring they take their medications or scheduling medical appointments. Their help can extend beyond the clinic walls too, to such things as finding housing or getting food stamps.\n\nThe workers don\u2019t necessarily have a medical background. They get several months of county-sponsored training, which includes instruction on different diseases and medications, as well as tips on how to help patients change behavior. They are chosen for their ability to relate to both patients and providers. Many have been doing this job for friends and family for years, just without pay.\n\n\u201cBy being from the community, by speaking their language, by having these shared life experiences, they are able to break through and engage patients in ways that we as providers often can\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Clemens Hong, who is heading the program for the county. \u201cThat helps break down barriers.\u201d\n\nNot just a number\n\nFor now, they work with about 150 patients, many of whom have mental health issues, substance abuse problems and chronic diseases. The patients haven\u2019t always had the best experience with the county\u2019s massive health care system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey tell us, \u2018I am just a number on this list,\u2019 \u201d Lopez said. \u201cWhen you call them by name and when you know them one-on-one \u2026 they receive that message that I care for you. You are not a number.\u201d\n\nBy spring, Hong said he hopes to have hundreds more patients in the program.\n\nCommunity health workers have been used for decades in the U.S. and even longer in other countries. But now officials in various counties and states \u2014 including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Oregon \u2014 are relying on them more as pressure grows to improve health outcomes and reduce Medicaid and other public costs, experts said.\n\n\u201cThey are finding a resurgence because of the Affordable Care Act and because health care providers are being held financially accountable for factors that occur outside the clinical walls,\u201d said Dr. Shreya Kangovi, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Center for Community Health Workers.\n\nTo Lopez, 43, the work is personal. A former accountant from Guatemala, Lopez has a genetic condition that led to a kidney transplant. Like some of his patients, including Pedroza, he is now on dialysis.\n\nHe tries to use his experience and education to get what patients need. But even he runs into snags, he said. One time, he had to argue with a clerk who turned away his patient at an appointment because she didn\u2019t have identification.\n\nLopez and his fellow community health worker, Jessie Cho, sit in small cubicles in the clinic at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the county\u2019s biggest and busiest public hospital. Throughout the day, they accompany patients to visits and meet with them before and after the doctor does. They also visit patients at home and in the hospital, and give out their cellphone numbers so patients can reach them quickly.\n\nJob is compassion\n\nCho said the patients often can\u2019t believe that somebody is willing to listen to them.\n\n\u201cNobody else on the medical team has it as their job to provide empathy and compassion,\u201d she said.\n\nMorrison, the clinic physician, said both workers have become an essential part of the health team.\n\n\u201cThere is just a limited amount I can accomplish in 15 or 20 minutes,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere are all these mysteries of my patients\u2019 lives that I know are getting in the way of taking care of their chronic medical problems. I either don\u2019t have time to get to the bottom of it or they are never going to really feel that comfortable talking to me about it.\u201d\n\nPedroza is a perfect example. Morrison said before Lopez came on board, \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with her.\u201d\n\nInitially, Lopez had a hard time helping her understand her health conditions and overcoming her distrust of the system. When they first met, Pedroza believed the dialysis that kept her kidneys functioning was the cause of her health problems. And she didn\u2019t get why Lopez was always around.\n\nBut he helped her by getting her appointments, for instance, and arranging for Pedroza to get pre-packaged medications so she wouldn\u2019t have to read the directions. Now Pedroza thinks Lopez is helping her to get better.\n\nLopez said he believes he has made a difference for other patients as well. On a recent Sunday, a 43-year-old patient with chronic pain who initially refused his help texted that he planned to go to the emergency room because of a headache. Lopez reached Morrison, who agreed to squeeze him into the schedule a few days later. And the patient didn\u2019t go to the ER.\n\nIn one case, his ability to bond with a patient almost undermined his goal of getting the man the help he needed. The patient, who was depressed, said he didn\u2019t want to go see a mental health counselor because he was more comfortable talking to Lopez.\n\n\u201cIt was touching,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI was about to cry.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
