1. Obama says he will go it alone on the economy if Congress won't act

President Obama declared in his State of the Union address Thursday night that he would act on his own to boost the economy if Congress failed to act due to partisan gridlock. Starting what he said would be a "year of action," Obama announced several initiatives, including an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, and the creation of a new retirement savings plan, MyRA, to let workers without 401(k)s make before-tax investments in U.S. bonds.

3. House passes bill barring the use of ObamaCare subsidies for abortion

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill seeking to bar any federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act from being used to pay for a health-care plan covering abortion. The 227–188 vote, essentially along party lines, marked the 50th time the House had passed a measure seeking to repeal or limit ObamaCare. The bill is not expected to stand a chance in the Senate, which is run by Democrats, but it underscored Congress' partisan divide ahead of President Obama's State of the Union address.

7. Yahoo's revenue drop drags down its stock

Yahoo shares fell by 4 percent Tuesday after it reported declining revenue for the fourth straight quarter at the end of 2013, due to a slip in ad prices. The drop was relatively minor — net revenue was $1.2 billion, down from $1.22 billion a year ago — but it was disappointing for a company hoping for a turnaround under CEO Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive. On the positive side, Yahoo's stock price had doubled since the start of the year thanks to its one-quarter stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. [Los Angeles Times]
