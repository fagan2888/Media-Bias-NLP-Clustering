Someone in the crowd gathered in a leafy backyard Wednesday evening in Concord, New Hampshire, called out \u201cThis Land Is Your Land!\u201d And O\u2019Malley began: \u201cFrom the redwood forest\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Democrats on the lawn may not have realized it, but the patriotic Woody Guthrie ditty happens to also be a favorite of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the other progressive challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders often plays a recording of the song at his rallies, and he even sung it himself in a heavy Brookylnese on an amateur Vermont folk album in the 1980s.\n\nBut while O\u2019Malley is the more competent singer, it is Sanders who has so far captured the imagination of the Democratic left, taking valuable attention and progressive favor away from O\u2019Malley. Now far behind in the polls after Clinton and Sanders, O\u2019Malley is preparing for a hard slog in New Hampshire and Iowa. He is traveling largely as an unknown candidate, even as Sanders draws thousands to his rallies.\n\nOn the campaign trail, O\u2019Malley is reminding his supporters to stay upbeat\u2014and he\u2019s doing his best to downplay Sanders\u2019 rise.\n\n\u201cHistory is full of examples of candidates with one- or two-percent name-recognition suddenly emerging on caucus night or in the New Hampshire primary as the alternative to the inevitable frontrunner,\u201d O\u2019Malley told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cHistory\u2019s also full of examples of candidates peaking in June who don\u2019t cross the finish line come January or February.\u201d\n\nMORE: What Martin O\u2019Malley Hopes to Learn From Gary Hart\n\nDistant third is an awkward position for O\u2019Malley, who seemed to do all the right things to prepare for a run for president. He was a crime-fighting mayor in a big city. He\u2019s a former two-term governor. He established a federal political action committee that gained him a national profile before announcing his bid, and he was chair of the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association for two years. He\u2019s visited Iowa, New Hampshire and other states repeatedly since 2013, meeting voters and campaigning for local candidates across the states before announcing his own candidacy. And since announcing, he\u2019s unveiled a bevy of detailed progressive policy proposals.\n\nBut for all his carefully laid plans, O\u2019Malley has struggled to gain notable recognition from voters in the first since his launch. Polls in the last few weeks showed that 61% of New Hampshire residents and 70% of Iowans haven\u2019t heard of him. Fewer than 5% of Democrats in those states say they\u2019d favor him in a primary. Go to one of his campaign events, and half the people in the crowd will say they stumbled in by chance, or they just heard of him yesterday, or last week, and came on a whim.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\u2014the unpolished independent who calls himself a revolutionary and a socialist\u2014is drawing huge crowds and gaining rapidly on Clinton, coming within 10 percentage points of Hillary in New Hampshire and boasting 33% support in Iowa, according to new polls. Whether Sanders can come close to winning the Democratic nomination or not, he is hogging the spotlight, casting O\u2019Malley into his shadow.\n\nIn the evening light in the backyard in Concord, some guests expressed reservations about the former governor\u2019s ability to win the nomination. Sanders, some said, is all the rage right now. \u201cIf you\u2019re a registered Democrat, how do you disagree with O\u2019Malley\u2019s points?\u201d said Andrew Eills, a local attorney. \u201cThe question is, would he get the momentum to move forward?\u201d\n\nA political scientist among the guests at the lawn party also weighed in. \u201cO\u2019Malley has to extinguish Sanders if he\u2019s going to have any shot against Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Dante Scala of the University of New Hampshire. \u201cOtherwise, he\u2019s running for Secretary of Transportation.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley and his allies are showing signs of unease about Sanders\u2019 rise. The candidate repeatedly referenced Sanders on Wednesday, though mostly avoided mentioning him by name. The pro-O\u2019Malley super PAC, Generation Forward, released last month the first attack ad of the 2016 campaign: a critique of Sanders\u2019 gun record questioning whether the Vermont senator is a \u201ctrue progressive.\u201d\n\nIf O\u2019Malley is fortunate, Sanders will end up like the Howard Dean of 2016: a personality-driven candidate who burns hot and bright with the Democratic left, but then quickly fizzles out.\n\nIn the meantime, though, O\u2019Malley is working his way through New Hampshire, campaigning one town hall meeting, waffle breakfast and pub visit at a time.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, O\u2019Malley unveiled a plan for debt-free public college at St. Anselm College, then followed with a morning meeting in a tavern in Derry, a radio interview, a meeting with a local teachers\u2019 union, a house party and a bar visit. By 10 o\u2019clock, an aide was tugging on O\u2019Malley\u2019s shoulder, reminding him of his early breakfast appointment the following morning as the former governor munched on a burger and entertained locals in a Concord bar.\n\nO\u2019Malley shooed the aide away and continued telling stories, looking as chipper as he had been that the morning.\n\n\u201cI need to be in this race for more days and I need to be in more places,\u201d O\u2019Malley had said earlier. \u201cI intend to do this the tried-and-true way of meeting as many people as I can who go to their caucuses in Iowa, by doing it one town at a time. It means doing the same thing in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nWith many of the people coming away from his events unconvinced he can win, however, it will be a long and uphill battle. O\u2019Malley has unveiled a long list of progressive policy proposals, pledging to move the United States entirely to clean energy by 2050, reinstate barriers between commercial and investment banks, make Wall Street executives culpable for financial crimes, eradicate student debt at public universities and act on immigration reform.\n\nMany of his ideas are more detailed than Sanders\u2019 proposals, and also wonkier and less eye-catching: Sanders calls for a single-payer healthcare system, while O\u2019Malley advocates for improving on Obamacare with a multi-part plan to reduce healthcare costs. On Thursday, he unveiled a detailed plan for reforming Wall Street.\n\n\u201cGovernor O\u2019Malley has laid out the most comprehensive plan on Wall Street of any 2016 candidate. It is bold, it is progressive, and it is specific. No one\u2014to date\u2014has laid out as detailed a plan for structural and accountability reforms as Governor O\u2019Malley,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith.\n\nWhile making the rounds in the Concord bar at the end of the day, O\u2019Malley, drank a Guinness and talked with voters about his prospects against Sanders and Clinton.\n\n\u201cBetween the socialist and the same-old, same-old\u201d\u2014 O\u2019Malley widened his hands\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s a huge gap.\u201d The challenge for O\u2019Malley will be finding a way to fill it.\n\nRead Next: Martin O\u2019Malley Looks to Future But Can\u2019t Escape the Past", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Maryland Gov.
