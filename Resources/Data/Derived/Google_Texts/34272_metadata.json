Without a subsidy, the average individual premium is now $274 a month. Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period \u2014 average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.\n\nAn important caveat is that eHealth\u2019s prices don\u2019t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.\n\nPremiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration\u2019s highly touted \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.\n\nSome benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don\u2019t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns \u2014 their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.\n\nBut premiums aren\u2019t the only key to health care costs \u2014 deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so. (RELATED: 4 of 5 companies may hike deductibles due to Obamacare)\n\nPrices may be people away from purchasing health insurance. The latest survey from consulting firm McKinsey found that half of those who haven\u2019t purchased health insurance yet this year cited their inability to pay the premium.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
