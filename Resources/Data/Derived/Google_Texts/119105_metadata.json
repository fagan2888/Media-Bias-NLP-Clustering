They\u2019re also providing a suite of online services and call centers to make it easier to sign up for plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for a while that the ACA made April 15 the most important day in health care,\u201d said Brian Haile, senior vice president for health care policy at Jackson Hewitt.\n\nSEE ALSO: EDITORIAL: Democrats flee Obamacare ahead of midterm elections\n\nOne key point tax preparation companies are making is that higher-income taxpayers could face an even bigger fine next year than the $95 penalty for not having health coverage in 2014. Tax experts said the law actually calls for a fine of either $95 or 1 percent of a person\u2019s income above the filing threshold, which could end up being quite large for wealthy filers.\n\nTax preparers said they aren\u2019t looking to proselytize on behalf of Obamacare, but do want to advise customers about their options. It also behooves them to warn returning customers about penalties for failing to gain coverage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to deliver the message next year,\u201d said Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president for health enrollment services at H&R Block.\n\nHealth insurance has been intertwined with the tax code \u201cfor quite a while,\u201d said Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies healthy policy, including provisions such as the preferential tax treatment of health benefits people get from their employers.\n\nSo, he said, it should not surprise anyone that the tax-prep industry is taking heed of the new health care law.\n\n\u201cThe fact they\u2019re making money on it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone either, because this is America,\u201d he added.\n\nThe industry\u2019s involvement underscores the business potential and inherent challenges to selling a complex law like Mr. Obama\u2019s overhaul of American health care. The venture should bring in new customers and profits, but it\u2019s difficult to cut through the confusion that has permeated the law\u2019s rollout.\n\nSome clients are unaware of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d that requires all Americans to hold health insurance. The administration plans to enforce the penalty for 2014 during the spring 2015 tax season, when filers will have to attest that they hold health coverage.\n\nJennifer Reese, an uninsured 50-year-old who visited a free health clinic in Buena Vista, Va., this month for dental work, said she and her husband planned to review Obamacare plans in the coming days because someone they met at a tax preparation office offered to help.\n\n\u201cHe just said that everybody had to have the insurance and he would like to meet with us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe companies are web-savvy, too. H&R Block launched a sleek website, helpth.com, with licensed web broker GoHealth to help customers browse and select plans. Its home page doesn\u2019t mention the Affordable Care Act by name, but it does have a section on \u201cMaking sense of health care reform in a way that actually makes sense.\u201d\n\nA footnote on the site makes clear that customers will not have to pay more for the service, although H&R Block will make commissions on sales.\n\nCompanies also are using tax information to see if clients qualify for Medicaid, that government-run health program for low-income Americans that\u2019s been expanded in more than half the states because of Obamacare.\n\nMr. Haile said Jackson Hewitt will mail in Medicaid forms after consumers review and sign them, and the tax information laid out in front of them gives partnering brokers a head start in helping other customers apply for private coverage.\n\n\u201cOur customers don\u2019t have to touch a keyboard,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With less than a month left for Americans to enroll in insurance plans under President Obama's health care overhaul, companies like H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt Tax Service may be the administration's secret weapon in getting people to sign up.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With less than a month left for Americans to enroll in insurance plans under President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, companies like H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt Tax Service may be the administration\u2019s secret weapon in getting people to sign up.", "title": "Tax-prep firms pitch in, cash in on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/6/tax-prep-firms-pitch-in-cash-in-on-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/06/earns-h-r-blockjpeg-00323.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/06/earns-h-r-blockjpeg-00323.jpg", "description": "With less than a month left for Americans to enroll in insurance plans under President Obama's health care overhaul, companies like H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt Tax Service may be the administration's", "card": "summary", "title": "Tax-prep firms pitch in, cash in on Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Labor, Business Finance, H R Block, Jackson Hewitt Tax Services"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd381c\"", "article_summary": "So, he said, it should not surprise anyone that the tax-prep industry is taking heed of the new health care law.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for a while that the ACA made April 15 the most important day in health care,\u201d said Brian Haile, senior vice president for health care policy at Jackson Hewitt.\nSome clients are unaware of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d that requires all Americans to hold health insurance.\nThe industry\u2019s involvement underscores the business potential and inherent challenges to selling a complex law like Mr. Obama\u2019s overhaul of American health care.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to deliver the message next year,\u201d said Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president for health enrollment services at H&R Block."}
