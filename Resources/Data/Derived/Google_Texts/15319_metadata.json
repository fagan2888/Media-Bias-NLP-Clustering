The end is that this gets exposed,\u201d she told The Washington Times last week. \u201cTwo powerful committees in both houses of Congress are investigating this. That alone indicates there is some serious weight to this. Unless this is all exposed, unless every level of inappropriateness and corruption is exposed, I certainly won\u2019t be the last person to be politically intimidated like this.\u201d\n\nCongressional hearings, however, may be unlikely. Ways and Means sources and outside legal analysts say the IRS tax code prevents the disclosure of any information related to cases like Ms. O'Donnell\u2018s.\n\nPHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals\n\nEven Ms. O\u2019Donnell herself will not be briefed on what either congressional committee discovers, as the federal government asserts that tax law goes so far as to shield its own employees from being exposed publicly if they are engaged in willful targeting or other wrongdoing.\n\nOnly the chairmen of the investigating committees \u2014 Rep. Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who heads Ways and Means, and Sen. Max Baucus, the outgoing Montana Democrat who heads the Senate finance panel \u2014 can learn exactly what happened in a case such as Ms. O'Donnell\u2018s.\n\nBy law, they are unable to reveal what they discover.\n\n\u201cThe IRS takes a position that they don\u2019t have to tell you the wrongdoing by their own agency and employees because of the protections that are supposed to be afforded to the taxpayer are then reversed and afforded to the IRS employee. This is a big problem. This agency is a big problem,\u201d said Cleta Mitchell, a Washington lawyer who has sued the IRS on behalf of the National Organization for Marriage and has worked with tea party groups who claim they were singled out by the government.\n\nThe National Organization for Marriage lawsuit is an attempt to find out who accessed and leaked its confidential tax files, which included the names of donors.\n\nThe IRS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the primary investigative body in the O\u2019Donnell case which first informed her that her tax information had been breached, said very little. A spokesman told The Times that \u201cby law, TIGTA is not able to disclose any information concerning its investigative work.\u201d\n\nIn addition to looking into the details of the O\u2019Donnell case specifically, the Ways and Means probe also has spurred a conversation within the committee about proposed changes to U.S. tax law, sources familiar with the investigation said. The law in question, Section 6103 of the U.S. code, states that \u201cno officer or employee of the United States shall disclose any return or return information obtained by him in any manner.\u201d\n\nThe rule also extends to state government employees, law enforcement agencies and other investigative bodies.\n\nThe law is meant to protect the privacy of personal tax information, but critics argue that it is being used to prevent guilty parties in the IRS or elsewhere from being exposed.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has been used as a political weapon, something in the campaign arsenal of the higher-ups for so long that of course there are going to be measures put in place to protect the secrecy of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Ms. O'Donnell said. \u201cI think that is exactly what\u2019s happening here. And this is exactly why there needs to be a hearing.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. O'Donnell, the improper accessing of her tax records was more than a breach of privacy. It also carried tangible consequences.\n\nJust as she was announcing her ill-fated 2010 Senate bid, a tax lien was placed on a house purported to be hers. The lien was highly publicized and used to discredit Ms. O'Donnell\u2019s candidacy just as it was getting off the ground, even though she no longer owned the home in question.\n\nThe IRS eventually blamed the lien on a computer glitch and withdrew it. Ms. O'Donnell sold the home in 2008, and financial documents from her lender show that her back payments were satisfied in July of that year, long before the IRS initiated the erroneous lien.\n\nMs. O'Donnell also battled a three-year audit of her personal finances that ultimately ended with her repaying $1,100 to the federal government. She said friends and family also were subjected to intrusive audits, though they were cleared.\n\nBefore the ordeal began, Ms. O'Donnell said, she was warned of what would come.\n\nAs she pondered a Senate run, she said, she was told by a prominent political figure in Delaware that if she challenged Mr. Castle \u2014 a former Delaware governor and congressman and a fixture in the state Republican Party \u2014 that the IRS and others would \u201cF with her head.\u201d\n\nThe case eventually spawned an inquiry from Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, an influential Republican who serves on the Finance and Judiciary committees.\n\nAs a result of his probe, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration revealed that at least four politicians or political donors have had their personal tax records improperly accessed since 2006, including one case described as a willful violation of federal law.\n\nThe Justice Department has declined to prosecute in any of the cases, and many of the details remain unclear.\n\nThe IRS previously stated that the \u201cwillful violation\u201d unearthed by inspector general was not by an IRS employee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress now wants answers to questions surrounding Christine O'Donnell's personal tax records and whether the Delaware Republican's private information was illegally accessed and ultimately used in an effort to derail her 2010 U.S. Senate bid.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Congress now wants answers to questions surrounding Christine O\u2019Donnell\u2019s personal tax records and whether the Delaware Republican\u2019s private information was illegally accessed and ultimately used in an effort to derail her 2010 U.S. Senate bid.", "title": "Congressional inquiry on Christine O\u2019Donnell tax records heats up, but truth may stay hidden", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/26/congressional-inquiry-on-christine-odonnell-tax-re/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/1_262014_christine-odonnell8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/1_262014_christine-odonnell8201.jpg", "description": "Congress now wants answers to questions surrounding Christine O'Donnell's personal tax records and whether the Delaware Republican's private information was illegally accessed and ultimately used in a", "card": "summary", "title": "Congressional inquiry on Christine O\u2019Donnell tax records heats u"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Law Crime, Christine O Donnell, Internal Revenue Service, Tax Administration"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1cc\"", "article_summary": "Ms. O'Donnell also battled a three-year audit of her personal finances that ultimately ended with her repaying $1,100 to the federal government.\nThe Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the primary investigative body in the O\u2019Donnell case which first informed her that her tax information had been breached, said very little.\nBefore the ordeal began, Ms. O'Donnell said, she was warned of what would come.\nAnd this is exactly why there needs to be a hearing.\u201dFor Ms. O'Donnell, the improper accessing of her tax records was more than a breach of privacy.\nWays and Means sources and outside legal analysts say the IRS tax code prevents the disclosure of any information related to cases like Ms. O'Donnell\u2018s."}
