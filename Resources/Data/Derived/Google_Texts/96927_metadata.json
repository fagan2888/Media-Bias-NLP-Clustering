Online outlets \u2014 ranging from locals such as Door to Door Organics and Mile High Organics to multinational giants Amazon.com and Walmart -\u2014 are taking bigger bites of the industry pie.\n\nDoor to Door Organics and Mile High Organics, which have recorded double-digit sales increases, are eyeing new regions and product lines, respectively.\n\nWalmart appears poised to throw its weight behind grocery delivery if pilot programs -\u2014 such as one currently taking place in Denver \u2014 prove successful.\n\nAnd Amazon.com is digging deeper with its AmazonFresh experiment by expanding outside its hometown of Seattle to test the waters of San Francisco, Los Angeles and, reportedly, 20 more markets in 2014.\n\nHow those and other firms execute on their initiatives this year not only could have ripple effects on the brick-and-mortar grocers, but also could set the stage for what the online model becomes in the future, industry members and analysts say.\n\nThe \u201cover-stored\u201d issue \u2014 where the pure amount of retail square footage is too great for the population size \u2014 is happening in virtually every region, said Bill Bishop, founder and chief architect of Brick Meets Click, a retail consulting firm based in Barrington, Ill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because when you have someone like Trader Joe\u2019s or Sprouts (Farmers Market) appear, they\u2019re different enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a question about how the shopper regards the store \u2014 as a primary place or a secondary place to shop.\n\n\u201cThis works particularly to the advantage of the traditional supermarket.\u201d\n\nThat being said, the crowding of the market also has created a situation where retail grocery sales are, at best, \u201csluggish\u201d at the individual store level, he said.\n\n\u201cYou add the online option to the mix, so it\u2019s just one more way to divert a purchase,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the close of 2013, the online sector had a 3.3 percent share of total grocery dollars, according to Brick Meets Click research.\n\nTen years from now, that market share could range from 6.7 percent on the conservative side to 16.9 percent on the aggressive side, the report showed.\n\nThe conservative growth model consists of market conditions where the only online grocery option was a new player that invested in a fulfillment center and took a measured approach to expansion. The aggressive model includes market conditions where \u201cmajor disruption\u201d has occurred as AmazonFresh increases its markets and national and regional chains respond.\n\nOnline grocery shopping currently is growing in two dimensions, Bishop said. The first is that customers are seeking a special item they can\u2019t find at stores anymore; then there is the specialty option \u2014 upscale appeal, organic appeal, natural appeal and culinary appeal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing (companies) like Door to Door Organics, (San Francisco-based) Good Eggs, (Virginia-based) Relay (and others) \u2026 establish some degree of prominence,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to IBISWorld, online grocery is a $6 billion business and is expected to reach nearly $9.5 billion in 2017.\n\n\u2018Food as a lifestyle\u2019\n\nThe privately held Door to Door Organics finished last year with $26 million in revenue, a more than 60 percent increase from the $16 million recorded in 2012, said Chad Arnold, president and chief executive officer.\n\nThat growth came from Door to Door\u2019s five existing markets that include Colorado, Chicago, Michigan, Kansas City and Pennsylvania and reach into nine states, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all same-market growth,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t expanded into any new significant (geographic areas)\u201d in the past year.\n\nDoor to Door also benefitted from a broader, national focus on health and the relationships between food, culture and society, Arnold said, noting his company tailored its offerings to include recipes and meal-planning assistance.\n\n\u201cWe really want to support food as a lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really want to help people add value to planning, help them think more about how they\u2019re cooking for their health.\n\n\u201d \u2026 We want to connect that lifestyle experience to that shopping experience.\u201d\n\nThe arrival of grocery retailers such as Trader Joe\u2019s should have minimal effects on Door to Door\u2019s business. When those retailers start offering delivery, the impacts could be greater, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Walmart delivery piece, I absolutely think that we\u2019ll overlap with them somewhere down the road,\u201d he said, noting that Door to Door is differentiated because of its customer base. \u201c\u2026When we look at our customers in the wheel of all the different places they shop, Walmart makes the list, but it\u2019s not in the top five, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nDoor to Door\u2019s near-term goals involve building awareness for the concept, integrating back-end technology and operations, expanding the product selection and then expanding geographically.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Door to Door could add another three states this year.\n\nTo fuel those initiatives, Door to Door is raising a B round of capital of about $14 million. Arnold expressed confidence in that endeavor, adding that he\u2019s noticed that investors are looking more favorably upon e-commerce food businesses.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a level of innovation occurring now that capital is starting to flow into food and technology,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing for premium\n\nBoulder\u2019s Mile High Organics appears to be a competitor to Door to Door Organics, but that\u2019s not how founder and CEO Michael Joseph sees it.\n\nMile High Organics is going after natural grocery industry leader Whole Foods, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going for the premium grocery dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of December, Mile High Organics built an on-site kitchen at its Denver warehouse. By the end of January, the company had launched a prepared foods line that included salads, cheeses and beverages such as made-to-order almond milk.\n\n\u201cThose have been all nice drivers of growth,\u201d Joseph said, noting his company is adding more items from the Mile High Organics kitchen on a weekly basis.\n\nAs of last week, Mile High Organics has about 130 stock keeping units of its prepared items. About 90 of those are bulk goods. In total, Mile High Organics has about 3,500 SKUs.\n\nBy supplementing its line of organic, locally sourced and genetically modified organism-free items with made-to-order foods, Mile High Organics should be able carve a deeper niche for itself within the borders of Colorado, Joseph said.\n\n\u201cWe believe this business can scale to multiple geographies, but it\u2019s just not our focus right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 50-employee company\u2019s delivery reach stretches from Pueblo north to Fort Collins. It covers most of Colorado\u2019s Front Range and goes as far west as Eagle.\n\nSomething that could help Mile High Organics\u2019 growth would be the arrival of AmazonFresh and Walmart.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re highly specialized,\u201d he said, noting that the presence of other online grocers would bring a \u201cgrander awareness\u201d to the segment.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nTraditional grocers haven\u2019t made much more than cursory efforts into the delivery business. Brick Meets Click\u2019s Bishop attributes this to profits and sourcing.\n\n\u201cIt really isn\u2019t as profitable as their current business, so there\u2019s a feeling afoot of, \u2018Let\u2019s keep our business as profitable as it can be and, when we have to, we\u2019ll move quickly,'\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a risky endeavor.\u201d\n\nWalmart, alternatively, is testing the waters with grocery delivery. Whether the discount giant ultimately moves forward with expanding those efforts remains to be seen, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to allow themselves to fall behind without a tremendous effort,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nAggregating the products and getting those products to the customer are all logistical challenges. Some companies have gone the warehouse model while others, notably yummy.com, have built distribution centers that also are used as stores.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re finding people skinning the cat differently,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cClearly getting the product to the customer is a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe aggregation and delivery do come at a higher cost, but some firms have found customers willing to pay.\n\n\u201cI think these more specialized online grocery shopping enterprises have very cleverly entered the online grocery market at the upper level so that the economics of their businesses are more easily worked out for their shoppers and for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nBishop believes AmazonFresh may follow that strategy as well.\n\nAmazon.com likely will target its AmazonFresh to the top 10 percent to 15 percent of earners and work to perfect the concept. Once that occurs, Amazon.com likely would bring it down to the top 30 percent to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cI think there have been bumps along the way for them in the consumer acceptance site of it,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nAmazonFresh adopted an annual subscription approach that has been difficult for \u201cpeople to get their minds around.\u201d\n\nAmazonFresh could find success thanks to some of its executives hailing from of the highest profile failures in the online grocery business: Webvan.\n\nAfter rising to prominence in the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, Webvan\u2019s online grocery business faltered as the firm made substantial investments in a fulfillment center, but couldn\u2019t turn a profit.\n\n\u201cIt was proven, the market was there in 2000 with Webvan,\u201d Bishopsaid. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the shoppers that failed Webvan, it was Webvan that failed the shoppers.\u201d\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "More news", "title": "More news", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/08/more-news-306/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T13:28:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-08T13:28:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd120b\"", "article_summary": "At the end of December, Mile High Organics built an on-site kitchen at its Denver warehouse.\nWalmart appears poised to throw its weight behind grocery delivery if pilot programs -\u2014 such as one currently taking place in Denver \u2014 prove successful.\nDoor to Door Organics and Mile High Organics, which have recorded double-digit sales increases, are eyeing new regions and product lines, respectively.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing (companies) like Door to Door Organics, (San Francisco-based) Good Eggs, (Virginia-based) Relay (and others) \u2026 establish some degree of prominence,\u201d he said.\nAs of last week, Mile High Organics has about 130 stock keeping units of its prepared items."}
