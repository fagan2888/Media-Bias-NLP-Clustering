Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to congratulate Nyad, and, in so doing, more heartily congratulate herself.\n\nFlying to 112 countries is a lot until you consider swimming between 2. Feels like I swim with sharks - but you actually did it! Congrats! \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 2, 2013\n\nLeaving aside the fact that Clinton, or whoever tweets for her, uses up so many characters praising herself that she doesn\u2019t have room for a proper noun elucidating to whom she\u2019s speaking, this is among the most tone-deaf moments yet for a political figure usually far more adept. Flying between countries is literally a baseline requirement for the Secretary of State job that has made Clinton a credible potential presidential candidate, not a terrible hardship on par with days of uninterrupted swimming.\n\nCan a news event happen without Clinton reminding us of just how hard she worked until just before the crisis in Syria erupted? (That\u2019s the sort of event on which Clinton\u2019s take would be welcome \u2014 but, of course, it can\u2019t be answered with a pithy joke about how hard she worked!)\n\nClinton isn\u2019t very active on Twitter, but her tweet at Nyad wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s hijacked a news event to make a somewhat incoherent joke about her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nCongratulations from across the pond to the Duke and Duchess! Wishing you the best of luck and a bit of advice: It Takes a (Royal) Village! \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 23, 2013\n\nGet it, Kate and Will? Hillary Clinton is an extremely famous person who\u2019s been famous since the 1990s, when she wrote a book called \u201cIt Takes a Village.\u201d This is the only way this scans, as \u2014 of course \u2014 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will have plenty of childrearing support. As for how non-famous parents might manage to raise their children in less glamorous circumstances, @HillaryClinton has no time for that.\n\nBill Clinton is little better; using the occasion of Barack Obama\u2019s birthday to remind his followers that he was also president once:\n\nTo 44: Happy birthday @BarackObama. From 42. \u2014 Bill Clinton (@billclinton) August 4, 2013\n\nAnd making weird jokes directed at celebrity pals:\n\nEveryone wants the moves like Jagger...but @MickJagger, you're one of a kind. Happy Birthday, friend! \u2014 Bill Clinton (@billclinton) July 26, 2013\n\nHey @McIlroyRory - I'm working on my short game.
