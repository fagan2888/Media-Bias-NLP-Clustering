For example, how is the outside world going to know what makes the Islamic State tick without on site, independently reported information?\n\nThus, German peace activist and \"Why Do You Kill, Zaid?\" author Jurgen Todenhofer, headed into the heart of ISIS -- guaranteed that he would not be harmed. His family thought he was crazy. In an online think piece entitled \"ISLAMIC STATE -- Seven Impressions Of A Difficult Journey\" -- he notes:\n\nThe guarantee turned out to be genuine, and the ISIS stuck to their agreement during our visits to Mosul and Raqqa. Though, we were under surveillance by the secret service for most of the time and had to hand over our mobile phones and laptops.

Let me tell you that arguing with heavily armed ISIS fighters isn\u2019t exactly the easiest thing to do. I was close to abandoning the journey twice during that time. In view of the acute danger that all of the involved were dealing with daily, they often were short tempered. Yet, overall, I was treated correctly.\n\nAs the title states, Todenhofer offers seven observations about what he saw. This is not neutral, \"American model of the press\" material. However, I thought that journalists and those who care about religion news would want to see this. His observations are powerful and not one we are seeing in standard reporting.\n\nFor example, in his first observation he notes:\n\nTHE WEST IS DRAMATICALLY UNDERESTIMATING THE THREAT EMANATING FROM ISIS, and ISIS\u2019 fighters are much more intelligent and dangerous than our politicians realize. The Islamic State is drenched in almost infectious enthusiasm and confident of victory -- something I have never before experienced in a war zone. More importantly, the ISIS fighters are convinced that their totalitarian faith and demonstrative brutality will help them move mountains. In Mosul, less than 400 ISIS fighters routed many as 25,000 Iraqi soldiers and militias despite their ultra-modern equipment. Within months, the ISIS has conquered a territory larger than Great Britain and dwarfed Al Qaeda.\n\nI found this section of observation No. 4 especially haunting, for obvious reasons:\n\nISIS ISN\u2019T JUST AIMING AT CONQUERING THE MIDDLE EAST AND, EVENTUALLY, THE REST OF THE WORLD. RATHER, THEY WANT THE LARGEST \u201cRELIGIOUS CLEANSING\u201d IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. With the exception of the so-called \u201creligions of the book\u201d -- that is, ISIS\u2019 version of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity -- ISIS wants to kill non-believers and apostates and enslave their women and children. This means that all of the Shiites, Yazidis, Hindus, Atheists and Polytheists are supposed to die, and that hundreds of millions of people would be eliminated in the course of this \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, all of the moderate Muslims approving of democracy are supposed to be killed, as they \u2013 from ISIS\u2019 point of view -- put human laws above God\u2019s laws. Upon successful conquest of the West, this would also apply to democratically-minded Muslims here. A non-believer\u2019s only chance to escape death are voluntary repentance and voluntary conversion to \u201ctrue Islam\u201d which, allegedly, is represented by ISIS only. He or she must do so before their country is conquered.\n\nIs this Islam? It is a radical fragment of Islam, stresses Todenhofer. This is an issue that Muslims must face.\n\nHere is a key point that will anger many Americans: ISIS can only be stopped by other Sunni Muslims and they must have a rational reason for wanted to do this (meaning they must be allowed back into the power mix in the region). What does that mean for Shiites? For religious minorities? For those who compromised with ISIS?\n\nRead it all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Journalists have been known to do crazy things, dangerous things and \r\nsometimes both at the same time.
