There were frightening moments for a Putnam City School bus when a nearby traffic stop turned into a high-speed chase.

"It was scary as can be, the kids were very upset," said Jarel Miles, who was driving the bus full of students leaving a leadership retreat near Chickasha.

"All the police were following him, and they rammed him there, and then the car spinned and almost took out the school bus."

Oklahoma City police said around 5:30 Saturday night, an officer tried to pull over a man for speeding while driving a gray Chevy impala at NW 10th and Council, but he took off and led police on a pursuit that ended near NW 50th and Meridian.

Warr Acres and Oklahoma Highway Patrol joined in and tried to get the suspect to get out of his car.

Police even used batons to try to get the driver out, but he eventually, had to be extracted out of the vehicle.

"The driver made it known that he was not going to exit the car made some threatening statements to the officers while in the car and started to reach for something inside of the car, the car lunged forward striking a Warr Acres vehicle, one of the officers opened fire on the vehicle," said Oklahoma City Police Capt. Dexter Nelson.

Meanwhile, the bus full of kids was on alert.

"I was just telling them get down, get down, get down, do not look out the windows, get on the ground, we were close it was boom, boom, boom, but I probably heard at least, seven or eight shots," said Miles, who says another Putnam City School bus wasn't far behind them.

The suspect was taken to the hospital, and thankfully, no one else was injured.

"He would not pay attention to anything the police were saying, and I got the kids back to the high school," Miles said.

Police say the suspect was hit with some glass but suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Investigators will release the suspect and officer's name at a later time.
