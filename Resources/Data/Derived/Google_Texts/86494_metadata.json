Quite a few alleged horror stories about \u201cObamacare victims\u201d have been debunked in recent months, but for some reason, the story of Michigan\u2019s Julia Boonstra has taken on more significance than most.\n\nTo briefly recap, Boonstra is featured in a Michigan attack ad sponsored by the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity, in which she talks about her fight against leukemia. In the commercial, Boonstra says she\u2019s transitioned to a new coverage plan, which she criticized as \u201cunaffordable.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the claims started looking dubious . We soon learned that Boonstra, at worst, would break even, all while benefiting from more secure coverage.\n\nBut as the controversy surrounding the attack ad grew, Boonstra felt compelled to provide more information about her circumstances. The Detroit News learned which plan she chose and reported yesterday that she\u2019ll save \u201cat least $1,200 compared with her former insurance plan.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this \u201cObamacare victim\u201d will, now know for certain, pay less money for better coverage and won\u2019t have to change doctors.\n\nWhen advised of the details of her Blues\u2019 plan, Boonstra said the idea that it would be cheaper \u201ccan\u2019t be true.\u201d \u201cI personally do not believe that,\u201d Boonstra said.\n\nFacts are not dependent on belief.\n\nAs for why this alleged horror story, in particular, became nationally significant, there are a few relevant angles to keep in mind. First, the pattern of attack ads featuring \u201cvictims\u201d who aren\u2019t victims at all has clearly reached a critical mass. Second, Boonstra seemed to go out of her way to give her story a national profile, participating in a Republican National Committee event and even appearing as a Republican guest at this year\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nBut Boonstra\u2019s story is also the one in which the right decided en masse that misleading ACA attack ads shouldn\u2019t be fact-checked at all because \u2026 it\u2019s not nice. Boonstra is a private citizen facing a life-threatening ailment, so conservatives said her claims, deceptive or not, should be off limits to scrutiny.\n\nThe defense remains wildly unpersuasive. Boonstra sought public attention and asked the public to consider her perspective. She chose to try to influence the public discourse, condemning both the health care law that\u2019s helping her and those who helped approve it. In effect, when she chose to enter the public arena and present her story to the country, Boonstra invited scrutiny.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened. No one has pried into her personal life beyond the details she\u2019s volunteered to share, and those details do not bolster the argument she asked the public to believe.\n\nWhat we\u2019re left with is an attack ad featuring a woman who\u2019ll save a lot of money while receiving better coverage. The right may see her as a \u201cvictim,\u201d and she may personally choose not to believe the available evidence, but this does not a horror story make.\n\nADDING: Related video:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Arguably the most high-profile \"Obamacare victim,\" it turns out, benefits even more from the law than previously known.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-facts-cant-be-true", "og": {"url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-facts-cant-be-true", "site_name": "MSNBC", "type": "article", "description": "Arguably the most high-profile \"Obamacare victim,\" it turns out, benefits even more from the law than previously known.", "title": "When facts 'can't be true'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-facts-cant-be-true", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/2014-02-20_1146.jpg?itok=LCuIV1lp", "title": "When facts 'can't be true'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Arguably the most high-profile \"Obamacare victim,\" it turns out, benefits even more from the law than previously known."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-11T08:01:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "When facts 'can't be true'", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/when-facts-cant-be-true", "published": 1, "date": "03/11/2014 08:01:00 EDT", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Arguably the most high-profile \"Obamacare victim,\" it turns out, benefits even more from the law than previously known.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedc2\"", "article_summary": "When advised of the details of her Blues\u2019 plan, Boonstra said the idea that it would be cheaper \u201ccan\u2019t be true.\u201d \u201cI personally do not believe that,\u201d Boonstra said.\nIn the commercial, Boonstra says she\u2019s transitioned to a new coverage plan, which she criticized as \u201cunaffordable.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before the claims started looking dubious .\nFirst, the pattern of attack ads featuring \u201cvictims\u201d who aren\u2019t victims at all has clearly reached a critical mass.\nBut as the controversy surrounding the attack ad grew, Boonstra felt compelled to provide more information about her circumstances.\nIn effect, when she chose to enter the public arena and present her story to the country, Boonstra invited scrutiny."}
