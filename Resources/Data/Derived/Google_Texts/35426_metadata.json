The number of families arriving at the border, consisting mostly of mothers with infants and toddlers, has increased in similar fashion.\n\nImmigration Update: 5 Myths on the Border Crisis\n\nAs Congress and the Obama administration dickered this summer over what should be done to detain, process and in many cases deport this wave of humanity, the public was treated to horrifying reports and images of toddlers and young people being crammed into concrete jails and warehouses, sleeping on the floor as they awaited processing and transfer to other facilities.\n\nWhile there are signs that the worst of the warehousing and mistreatment of these young people has abated, there are still thousands who are languishing in Texas and Arizona jails and facilities awaiting the next step in their uncertain journey.\n\n\u201cI think they [federal authorities] have put some processes in place and have probably begun to more efficiently move [the children] and move them out, quite frankly,\u201d Wendy Feliz, communications director for the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group tracking the crisis along the border, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that [the influx of young immigrants] is slowing down, so I\u2019m not sure how much warehousing of people there is at this point.\u201d\n\nMany of these illegal immigrants who poured into the U.S. said they were fleeing gang violence and poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, or were hoping to be reunited with parents or other family members already living in this country.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s August Playbook: Own the Immigration Fix\n\nLast month, National Public Radio reported that some of these children complained of being subjected to \u201cabusive and inhumane treatment in U.S. Border Patrol stations in South Texas,\u201d including frigid holding rooms known as \u201cthe ice box,\u201d sleep deprivation, inadequate food and water and denial of medical attention.\n\nSaul Martinez, a 15-year-old from El Salvador, testified at a Congressional Progressive Caucus hearing in Washington last month that after he was caught crossing the Rio Grande into Texas, he was held with about 200 other children in an ice box for six days, according to an Arizona Republic report. Conditions were wretched and there was only one toilet for the 200 children.\n\nA 12-year-old girl from Honduras testified at the same hearing that she had been better treated by the human smugglers who brought her to this country than by the U.S. immigration authorities, according to the report.\n\nGil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, did not dispute that some of the immigrant children had legitimate complaints about conditions in the holding cells, but said border agency officers had been overwhelmed by the influx of the youthful illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: Brutality and \u2018The Beast\u2019-- Why Child Migration to U.S. Is Slowing Down\n\n\u201cWhen I looked at all the complaints, sleeping on a concrete floor is not anything any of us wanted to see, and to see a room the size of this office with maybe 40 or 50 kids lying on the floor covered in a blanket, waiting two and three and four days to be actually moved to a better facility, I know that we were overwhelmed,\u201d he told NPR in late July.\n\nBy law, Central American children and their parents are entitled to a court hearing to appeal for asylum or special immigration status before being deported. Border Patrol agents are in charge of screening immigrant children and holding them for up to 72 hours before they must be transferred to the care of the Department of Health and Human Services \u2013 although in many cases the children have been held much longer.\n\nJust when conditions appeared to reach intolerable levels, the administration disclosed early this month that the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended crossing the border declined in July by nearly half the number during the previous two months, The Washington Post reported.\n\nNew Border Patrol figures showed that 5,508 children were taken into federal custody in July, which was down from more than 10,000 in both May and June, according to The Post. The number of adults crossing into this country illegally with their children also declined sharply, from 16,330 in June to 7,410 in July, according to the report.\n\nRelated: \u2018Do-Nothing Congress\u2019 Gets Ready for an Unearned 5-Week Vacation\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the spectacle of hordes of Central American children being packed like sardines in jails and holding cells in Texas and Arizona border towns began to abate, as many of the children and their parents taken into custody were processed and moved into a government pipeline spanning the country.\n\nSo what precisely are the conditions today along the border? The Dallas Morning News recently published a comprehensive report on the border crisis that sheds considerable light on the status of the children and current conditions. Among the central findings:\n\nSince the start of the fiscal year last October, border authorities have transferred 51,000 unaccompanied minors to the custody of the Department of Human Services. The department has contracted with welfare agencies and private non-profits at 94 facilities throughout the U.S. to provide the children with housing and social services.\n\nOf those 51,000, 88 percent have been placed with members of their family. More than half of these children are living with a parent while their immigration status is under review.\n\nThe number of children still being held in cramped conditions in jail cells throughout the Rio Grande Valley is comparatively low. The newspaper was told by border patrol officials that a total of about 2,300 unaccompanied children were still being held in jail-like facilities.\n\nThe government recently stepped up efforts to open detention centers for hundreds of migrant families awaiting deportation proceedings, including a 700-bed facility in Artesia, N.M. Feliz complained that federal officials are targeting families at Artesia for a fast-track review and deportation.\n\nThat\u2019s because while unaccompanied children must be granted a full and often time-consuming review and placement by HHS, parents with their children can be processed in short order and sent back to their home countries. Moreover, most of those families have no legal representation in the proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prime example of a very knee-jerk reaction to getting people in and out really quickly, so I think a lot of eyes are on Artesia right now,\u201d Feliz said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Congress and the president on vacation and the situation in Iraq and Syria boiling over, the spotlight has shifted away from the humanitarian crisis along the Southwest border \u2013 and what is being done about the tens of thousands of children and young people from Central America who have illegally entered this country.
