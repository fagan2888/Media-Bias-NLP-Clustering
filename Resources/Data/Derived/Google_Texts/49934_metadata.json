The party increased its strength in the House of Representatives by more than 50 new members, many from suburban districts that had previously elected Republicans.\n\nThe Watergate Babies, as the new members were called, were a different breed of Democrat than the veterans who represented more urban districts. They were not only more liberal on cultural issues and more committed to environmental causes than many more senior Democrats, but many of them were also less committed to the kind of bread-and-butter New Deal economic policies with which the party had been identified. In 1974, Jerry Brown was first elected governor of California preaching that the nation had entered an \u201cera of limits,\u201d by which he meant, limits to social spending. Gary Hart was first elected senator from Colorado, disparaging the politics of old labor Democrats.\n\nToday, just two Watergate babies remain in Congress, both from California. Yet neither one has ever been the kind of neo-liberal that came to typify the Class of \u201974. Henry Waxman, from Los Angeles\u2019 Westside has spent his career strengthening the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and expanding Medicaid coverage, even during the Reagan years. George Miller, from a working-class suburb of San Francisco, was, with Waxman, one of the leading congressional authors of the Affordable Care Act (and a longtime proponent of single-payer healthcare as well). He steered the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it far easier for workers to join unions, through the House in 2009, though it couldn\u2019t clear the 60-vote hurdle in the Senate. He also steered the 2007 hike in the federal minimum wage through Congress, and today is the co-author, with Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, of legislation that would raise that wage to $10.10 an hour.\n\nThis week, Miller announced he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election later this year. He\u2019d call it quits, he said, after 40 years in the House.\n\nHarkin, too, has announced he won\u2019t run for re-election this year, but Miller is optimistic that their final major piece of legislation\u2014the minimum wage hike\u2014will pass before the term is over. \u201cToday, lots of people\u2014people I went to school with\u2014they all know people who are being paid the minimum wage,\u201d Miller told me earlier this week. \u201cPeople with college degrees are not in the jobs they are trained for. People are saying\u2014and it\u2019s showing up in the polls\u2014that no one can live on the minimum wage. I didn\u2019t hear this in 2007 [the last time Congress raised the wage].\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s commitment to a more egalitarian economy has its roots in postwar California\u2019s distinct mix of working-class and middle-class progressivism. Both Miller and Waxman were a special subset of Watergate Babies: They were prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Phil Burton, the brilliant San Francisco representative who was the House\u2019s leading liberal in the 1970s, and an acknowledged genius at getting environmental, labor, and social welfare legislation through even conservative congresses. In a larger sense, they were products of a 1960s California liberalism that mixed social welfare concerns with the antiwar and culturally liberal politics of the 1960s.\n\nThe one other Burton prot\u00e9g\u00e9 still serving in the House (though not a Watergate Baby herself) is the member who represents his old district: Nancy Pelosi. Miller is not just Pelosi\u2019s consigliere, but it was he who first suggested that Pelosi could one day lead the House, and who, working with an unlikely crew of House liberals and not-so-liberal congressional leaders impressed by Pelosi\u2019s abilities, helped her win the party\u2019s top post\u2014and, in time, the Speakership.\n\nPelosi\u2019s ascent is emblematic of what Miller sees as the biggest change in politics since he first came to Congress in the mid-Seventies. \u201cThe diversity we\u2019ve seen for some time in California is now entering national politics in full force,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were just a handful of women in the House when I came here. Now, you look at the recent Democratic freshman classes, they\u2019re really in sync with the rest of America. And, unfortunately, this change is part of the reason for a lot of the acrimony in political life today. The old white guys have been in control for a long time, and they\u2019re not crazy about ceding authority. This is a backdrop, too, to the struggle over the role of government that we\u2019ve been having in Congress.\u201d\n\nAs my Washington Post colleague E.J. Dionne has noted, Miller has long been able to combine his fierce commitment to liberalism with an ability to reach across the aisle to get legislation passed. In recent years, the cross-aisle reach has grown harder to accomplish. The problem, he says is that, \u201cRepublicans have made \u2018government\u2019 a pejorative term. They\u2019ve convinced themselves that there\u2019s no value added by government, so there\u2019s no harm if we get rid of scholarships for minorities or defund cancer research. This is completely at odds with American history\u2014with government\u2019s role in everything from highways to public universities\u2014but that\u2019s the zone that Republicans are in today.\u201d\n\nFor Miller, government\u2019s role is to provide the security that individuals\u2014and the nation\u2014need to succeed. \u201cThe people now covered under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he says, \u201cwon\u2019t lose their health insurance because they\u2019ve lost their job or are divorced or widowed, or because they want to go out and start a small business. That\u2019s the greatest gain in economic security in the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first ran for Congress in 1974, I ran to stop the Vietnam War and get single-payer health care. When President Obama signed the ACA, a signal went off inside me that it might be time to leave. I\u2019d been one of the three principle authors in the House, and I didn\u2019t know how I could make a greater contribution.\u201d\n\nMiller is known for sharing his Capitol Hill townhouse/crashpad with other congressional Democrats\u2014in recent years, Senators Dick Durbin and Charles Schumer. But it\u2019s his 40 years of cross-country weekend commutes to his district and back that give his tenure the quality of an odyssey. \u201cUnited tells me I have 5 million miles with them,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWhen I go home, though, I get my batteries charged. It\u2019s always given me the energy to come back. But at 40 years, it gets a little tougher.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "George Miller calls it quits.", "title": "The Penultimate Watergate Baby", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/penultimate-watergate-baby", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/screen_shot_2014-01-17_at_9.06.10_am.png?itok=X_SyDrnG", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe9c\"", "article_summary": "The one other Burton prot\u00e9g\u00e9 still serving in the House (though not a Watergate Baby herself) is the member who represents his old district: Nancy Pelosi.\nPeople are saying\u2014and it\u2019s showing up in the polls\u2014that no one can live on the minimum wage.\nToday, just two Watergate babies remain in Congress, both from California.\n\u201cToday, lots of people\u2014people I went to school with\u2014they all know people who are being paid the minimum wage,\u201d Miller told me earlier this week.\nThe Watergate Babies, as the new members were called, were a different breed of Democrat than the veterans who represented more urban districts."}
