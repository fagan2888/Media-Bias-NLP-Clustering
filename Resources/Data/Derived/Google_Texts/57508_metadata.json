Something he has made a habit of doing, according to Yellow Hammer.\n\nThis time, his explanation of why he thinks \u201cfollow your passion\u201d is terrible advice has gone viral.\n\nAfter being challenged by a fan on his Facebook page, Rowe detailed exactly why people shouldn\u2019t get caught up in only following their dreams.\n\nHi Stephen,\n\nA few years ago, I did a special called \u201cThe Dirty Truth.\u201d In it, I challenged the conventional wisdom of popular platitudes by offering \u201cdirtier,\u201d more individualistic alternatives. For my inspiration, I looked to those hackneyed bromides that hang on the walls of corporate America. The ones that extoll passersby to live up to their potential by \u201cdreaming bigger,\u201d \u201cworking smarter,\u201d and being a better \u201cteam player.\u201d In that context, I first saw \u201cFollow Your Passion\u201d displayed in the conference room of a telemarketing firm that employed me thirty years ago. The words appeared next to an image of a rainbow, arcing gently over a waterfall and disappearing into a field of butterflies. Thinking of it now still makes me throw up in my mouth.\n\nLike all bad advice, \u201cFollow Your Passion\u201d is routinely dispensed as though it\u2019s wisdom were both incontrovertible and equally applicable to all. It\u2019s not. Just because you\u2019re passionate about something doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t suck at it. And just because you\u2019re determined to improve doesn\u2019t mean that you will. Does that mean you shouldn\u2019t pursue a thing you\u2019re passionate about?\u201d Of course not. The question is, for how long, and to what end?\n\nWhen it comes to earning a living and being a productive member of society \u2013 I don\u2019t think people should limit their options to those vocations they feel passionate towards. I met a lot of people on Dirty Jobs who really loved their work. But very few of them dreamed of having the career they ultimately chose. I remember a very successful septic tank cleaner who told me his secret of success. \u201cI looked around to see where everyone else was headed, and then I went the opposite way,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I got good at my work. Then I found a way to love it. Then I got rich.\u201d\n\nEvery time I watch The Oscars, I cringe when some famous movie star \u2013 trophy in hand \u2013 starts to deconstruct the secret to happiness. It\u2019s always the same thing, and I can never hit \u201cmute\u201d fast enough to escape the inevitable cliches. \u201cDon\u2019t give up on your dreams kids, no matter what.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you don\u2019t have what it takes.\u201d And of course, \u201cAlways follow your passion!\u201d\n\nToday, we have millions looking for work, and millions of good jobs unfilled because people are simply not passionate about pursuing those particular opportunities. Do we really need Lady Gaga telling our kids that happiness and success can be theirs if only they follow their passion?\n\nThere are many examples \u2013 including those you mention \u2013 of passionate people with big dreams who stayed the course, worked hard, overcame adversity, and changed the world though sheer pluck and determination. We love stories that begin with a dream, and culminate when that dream comes true. And to your question, we would surely be worse off without the likes of Bill Gates and Thomas Edison and all the other innovators and Captains of Industry. But from my perspective, I don\u2019t see a shortage of people who are willing to dream big. I see people struggling because their reach has exceeded their grasp.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated by the beginning of American Idol. Every year, thousands of aspiring pop-stars show up with great expectations, only to learn that they don\u2019t have anything close to the skills they thought they did. What\u2019s amazing to me, isn\u2019t their lack of talent \u2013 it\u2019s their lack of awareness, and the resulting shock of being rejected. How is it that so many people are so blind to their own limitations? How did these peope get the impression they could sing in the first place? Then again, is their incredulity really so different than the surprise of a college graduate who learns on his first interview that his double major in Medieval Studies and French Literature doesn\u2019t guarantee him the job he expected? In a world where everyone gets a trophy, encouragement trumps honesty, and realistic expectations go out the window.\n\nWhen I was 16, I wanted to follow in my grandfathers footsteps. I wanted to be a tradesman. I wanted to build things, and fix things, and make things with my own two hands. This was my passion, and I followed it for years. I took all the shop classes at school, and did all I could to absorb the knowledge and skill that came so easily to my granddad. Unfortunately, the handy gene skipped over me, and I became frustrated. But I remained determined to do whatever it took to become a tradesman.\n\nOne day, I brought home a sconce from woodshop that looked like a paramecium, and after a heavy sigh, my grandfather told me the truth. He explained that my life would be a lot more satisfying and productive if I got myself a different kind of toolbox. This was almost certainly the best advice I\u2019ve ever received, but at the time, it was crushing. It felt contradictory to everything I knew about persistence, and the importance of \u201cstaying the course.\u201d It felt like quitting. But here\u2019s the \u201cdirty truth,\u201d Stephen. \u201cStaying the course\u201d only makes sense if you\u2019re headed in a sensible direction. Because passion and persistence \u2013 while most often associated with success \u2013 are also essential ingredients of futility.\n\nThat\u2019s why I would never advise anyone to \u201cfollow their passion\u201d until I understand who they are, what they want, and why they want it. Even then, I\u2019d be cautious. Passion is too important to be without, but too fickle to be guided by. Which is why I\u2019m more inclined to say, \u201cDon\u2019t Follow Your Passion, But Always Bring it With You.\u201d\n\nCarry On,\n\nMike", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like all bad advice, \u201cFollow Your Passion\u201d is routinely dispensed as though it\u2019s wisdom were both incontrovertible and equally applicable to all.
