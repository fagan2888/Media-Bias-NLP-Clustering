CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nImagine if the human body were similar to a car: As it gets older and parts stop working, you could just send it to the repair shop and have those parts replaced. That\u2019s the notion behind bionic organs, or essentially replacement mechanical organs that could work better and longer than a person\u2019s failing biological ones.\n\nNow, researchers believe they\u2019ve come close to developing the first bionic heart \u2014 and, strangely enough, it won\u2019t be like a regular heart. The bionic heart, known as the BiVACOR, won\u2019t pump blood through a person\u2019s veins through beating. Instead, it will \u201cpropel\u201d blood through the body through silver tubes. It\u2019s meant to be a form of treatment for people with heart failure, a chance for them to get a new, stronger heart that can last them much longer and be more reliable.\n\n\u201cThe device has performed in many respects better than any artificial heart anybody has come up with in the last 50 years,\u201d Cohn told ABC News. He believes it\u2019s the \u201cfirst legitimate shot on goal for a permanent mechanical replacement for the failing human heart.\u201d\n\nThe average human heart beats 42 million times per year, meaning that a potential bionic heart would have to account for that large number of pumps \u2014 and it\u2019s likely it would quickly wear out, according to Dr. William Cohn, the chief medical officer of BiVACOR who is currently working on the new bionic heart. That\u2019s why Cohn and his team aim to develop a bionic heart that wouldn\u2019t require beating in order to flush blood throughout the body and reach every limb and finger and toe.\n\nOn BiVACOR\u2019s website, the researchers note that the new machine would provide \u201cpowerful\u201d centrifugal pumps,\u201d as well as \u201csmart controllers\u201d that are able to adapt to a person\u2019s physical activity level. The device is also small enough for a child, and is expected to work five to 10 years.\n\nIt sounds crazy, and it may be a while before the BiVACOR team, led by Cohn and Australian researcher Daniel Timms, will be able to put the heart into place in humans. But for now, they\u2019re studying it in large animals \u2014 who have been able to walk on treadmills and live for a month before the researchers kill them in order to examine the effects of the device on the rest of the body. Cohn claims that \u201ckidney function, lung function, everything works beautifully throughout,\u201d according to ABC News.\n\nSince 1982, when the first artificial heart was successfully transplanted in a patient, researchers from all over the world have tried to develop a better and more reliable version of a transplanted mechanical heart. There are currently over 4,000 people in the U.S. waiting for heart transplants; the BiVACOR team hopes that their device will eventually assist in alleviating that number.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bionic heart, heart transplants", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Developers of a new bionic heart that doesn\u2019t beat, but rather propels blood through the body, believe it might be a breakthrough device in replacing failing hearts.", "title": "Bionic Heart That Doesn't Beat Could Revolutionize Transplants", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-bionic-heart-propels-blood-instead-pumping-it-and-it-may-revolutionize-325678", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/bionic-heart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Developers of a new bionic heart that doesn\u2019t beat, but rather propels blood through the body, believe it might be a breakthrough device in replacing failing hearts.", "title": "Bionic Heart That Doesn't Beat Could Revolutionize Transplants", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-bionic-heart-propels-blood-instead-pumping-it-and-it-may-revolutionize-325678", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/bionic-heart.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/bionic-heart.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-03-13T17:16:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T17:16:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Developers of a new bionic heart that doesn\u2019t beat, but rather propels blood through the body, believe it might be a breakthrough device in replacing failing hearts."}, "article_summary": "Now, researchers believe they\u2019ve come close to developing the first bionic heart \u2014 and, strangely enough, it won\u2019t be like a regular heart.\nThe bionic heart, known as the BiVACOR, won\u2019t pump blood through a person\u2019s veins through beating.\nThere are currently over 4,000 people in the U.S. waiting for heart transplants; the BiVACOR team hopes that their device will eventually assist in alleviating that number.\nThat\u2019s why Cohn and his team aim to develop a bionic heart that wouldn\u2019t require beating in order to flush blood throughout the body and reach every limb and finger and toe.\n\u201cThe device has performed in many respects better than any artificial heart anybody has come up with in the last 50 years,\u201d Cohn told ABC News."}
