The clinic is at 517 N. Parsons Ave., next door to the Emergency Care Help Organization (ECHO). Clinic services include diagnostic screenings, lab tests and medications necessary to treat chronic conditions and diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nThe clinic serves people who have income but whose paychecks are not enough to cover their medical expenses.\n\n\u201cWe keep our patients healthy so they can go to work to keep their jobs to support their families and keep their homes,\u201d said Deborah \u201cDebbie\u201d Meegan, the clinic\u2019s executive director.\n\nDoctors, nurses and other medical professionals donate their time and services to the clinic.\n\n\u201cI volunteer because I know pain is not something to ignore,\u201d said orthopedic surgeon Dr. Wari L. Wabara, who added that he was born in Africa and educated in England. \u201cI volunteer because I came here with nothing. When I landed at (New York\u2019s) JFK airport in 1970, I had $200 in my pocket.\u201d\n\nAlso among the volunteers is nurse Angie Smith, who said she works at the clinic to pay it forward. \u201cI\u2019m retired from nursing and I just want to give back to the community (and work) without the pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised there\u2019s not a constant line out the door. The clinic is just a great contribution to Brandon.\u201d\n\nTo receive clinic services, a person must fall between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on household size, Meegan said.\n\nNewly served \u201cbridge\u201d patients fall below 100 percent of the poverty level, which monthly for an individual is $957.50 and, for a family of four, $1,962.50.\n\n\u201cWith the need out there, Hills- borough County can take up to a month or two to process aid requests from these people and these people have diabetes and heart conditions,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have months to wait. If they wait they can end up in the emergency room or worse.\u201d\n\nWatts added that a person will have to show a pressing medical need that requires immediate attention to be designated a bridge patient. Also, that they need a little more time to be processed and deemed eligible for Hillsborough County care or federal Medicare health insurance.\n\nAlso in the works for the clinic is a new fundraiser to add to the group\u2019s lineup of annual charity awareness events.\n\nTo continue is the Pink Your Pony Trail Ride fundraiser, scheduled for Oct. 11, and organized by horse owner and breast cancer survivor Dawn Galia, executive director of the Center Place Fine Arts & Civic Association. A week later is Paint the Plaza at Plaza Bella in Valrico. The Kentucky Derby viewing party in May will be moved from Center Place to The Regent in Riverview, a much larger venue.\n\nNew to the clinic\u2019s outreach lineup will be the Kentucky Derby Tea on Feb. 28, featuring a Kentucky Derby Fashion Show.\n\nFor information about the Brandon Outreach Clinic, visit online at www.brandonoutreach clinic.com.
