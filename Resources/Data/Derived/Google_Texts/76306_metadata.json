The self-described democratic-socialist has raised a total of $109 million in the first quarter of 2016 and has bested Clinton over the last couple months.\n\nThe fundraising windfall comes as the Democratic primary is taking on a new, nasty tone.\n\nThe increased friction boils down to this: Clinton\u2019s campaign believes the former secretary of state has a nearly insurmountable lead in terms of delegates and believes Sanders should tone down his rhetoric to avoid damaging her before the general election against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that Sanders, and his supporters, aren\u2019t about to back off.\n\nRelated: Sanders Gets Some Wins, but the Numbers Still Point to Clinton\n\nAt a campaign event in New York on Thursday an activist from Greenpeace approached Clinton to ask if she would \"reject fossil-fuel money in the future\" in her campaign. Visibly annoyed, the former First Lady replied that she has only received contribution from oil company employees, not the firms themselves.\n\n\u201cI am so sick, I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nSanders\u2019 camp is trying to make the most out of rare flare-up by demanding Clinton apologize for her remarks.\n\n\u201cI think she probably owes the senator an apology for that because the senator is not lying about her record,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Friday on MSNBC.\n\nRelated: For Now, Democrats Savor a Clinton-Trump Matchup This Fall\n\nWeaver later issued a statement citing research from a Greenpeace report that claims she accepts donations from industry lobbyists and bundlers.\n\n\u201cIf the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won\u2019t affect her decisions if she\u2019s elected, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary\u2019s fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth promises to grow more heated ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary in Wisconsin. Sanders leads Clinton by slightly more than 2 percent in the state, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls.\n\nA Sanders win next week, following his clean sweep of three states last weekend, could once again make Clinton\u2019s operatives nervous that her frontrunner status is weakening.\n\nThe 74-year-old Sanders is certainly sounding confident these days, predicting he will beat Clinton in New York, the state she represented in the U.S. Senate, when it holds its primary on April 19.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win New York,\u201d the Brooklyn native said on CBS This Morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do rallies all over the state, and I think we have a good shot at this,\u201d he added.\n\nClinton leads Sanders by 27 points in the Empire State, according to the poll average from Real Clear Politics. But Sanders is gaining steam: A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows him down only 12 points to Clinton, 54 to 42 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Bernie Sanders broke his monthly fundraising record in March, raking in more than $44 million and ensuring that he will continue to battle Hillary Clinton for weeks, if not months, to come.", "title": "Sanders\u2019 Fundraising Surges Again as the Candidates Get Testy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Sanders-Fundraising-Surges-Again-Candidates-Get-Testy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/hillary_clinton_bernie_sanders_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Sanders-Fundraising-Surges-Again-Candidates-Get-Testy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/hillary_clinton_bernie_sanders_split.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Bernie Sanders broke his monthly fundraising record in March, raking in more than $44 million and ensuring that he will continue to battle Hillary Clinton for weeks, if not months, to come.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think she probably owes the senator an apology for that because the senator is not lying about her record,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Friday on MSNBC.\n\u201cI am so sick, I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.\nClinton leads Sanders by 27 points in the Empire State, according to the poll average from Real Clear Politics.\n\u201cIf the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won\u2019t affect her decisions if she\u2019s elected, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.\nBernie Sanders broke his monthly fundraising record in March, taking in more than $44 million and ensuring that he can continue to battle Hillary Clinton for weeks, if not months, to come."}
