If he doesn\u2019t, the Rams will really be short in the secondary, as Trent Matthews is out with the ACL injury he suffered in the win over Fresno State, undergoing surgery on Dec. 19. He and Pierre-Louis are four-year starters, creating a big gap at safety for the team.\n\nThe Rams had prepped for half of that, with Nick Januska, Jake Schlager and Justin Sweet all seeing reps in both spots. Further complicating the situation is Schlager is now hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose three, and Demontrie Taylor is also working some safety as well, and Josh Bowman is working there, too,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely thin at that position with Trent already down, who\u2019s been a seven-year starter for us. KP not being here has definitely hurt, but he\u2019s played in enough games and understands what we\u2019re doing, if we get him here, we\u2019ll be able to get him ready to play. The other guys have to step up. The bad thing is Schlager is a little down right now, so he didn\u2019t practice today. We\u2019ll see (Saturday) how well he\u2019s moving around.\u201d\n\nIn Gaines, the Rams lose their most experienced kick returner, but they do have quality backups in Jordon Vaden and Kevin Nutt, both of whom average better than 33 yards a return. It\u2019s a small sample size \u2014 nine returns combined \u2014 but Nutt did help the Rams rally to beat Fresno State with his 96-yard kickoff return for a score, and Vaden broke off a 99-yarder in the opener with Savannah State, a return better remembered for him dropping the ball too soon.\n\nAs for practice, Bobo was impressed with his squad\u2019s work coming off a four-day break. He said the players were focused and sharp, as well as rested and excited to be back on the field.\n\nNot so full \u2014 Bobo said the Rams are also dealing with a skeleton staff at fullback, and Nu\u2019uvali Fa\u2019apito and George Maumau are not healthy enough to play in the game. The coach still feels fine at the spot, noting Nolan Peralta and Steven Walker have both seen ample time at the spot this season.\n\nImpressive \u2014 The Rams are practicing at the Kino Sports Complex, and Bobo was extremely impressed with the facility. He said the surface was excellent, and while they only used one field on Friday, he said there\u2019s more than enough space for them to use the remaining three days of practice.\n\nThe Arizona Bowl is making its debut, and the CSU first-year coach feels it is going all out. Staying at the JW Marriott Starr Pass, he said the meeting rooms were excellent and the staff was doing everything it could to help make this a successful venture for the Rams.\n\n\u201cThe bowl hospitality has been awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were 50-100 people to greet us at the airport, and it\u2019s been first class up to this point. Everything has been first class. The hospitality, it\u2019s along the lines of the bowls I\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.comt and twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29311985/colorado-state-football-arrives-at-arizona-bowl-two", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1225/20151225_101056_Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl logo_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard", "description": "TUCSON, Ariz. - Colorado State's football team arrived in Tucson to start preparation for Tuesday's Arizona Bowl against Nevada, doing so short two players.\n\nCSU coach Mike Bobo said kick returner/wideout Deionte Gaines will miss the contest due to academic reasons, and senior Kevin Pierre-Louis could be in the same situation, though Bobo said he still has time.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29311985:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-25T22:08:31-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29311985/colorado-state-football-arrives-at-arizona-bowl-two", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1225/20151225_101056_Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "TUCSON, Ariz. - Colorado State's football team arrived in Tucson to start preparation for Tuesday's Arizona Bowl against Nevada, doing so short two players.\n\nCSU coach Mike Bobo said kick returner/wideout Deionte Gaines will miss the contest due to academic reasons, and senior Kevin Pierre-Louis could be in the same situation, though Bobo said he still has time.", "title": "Colorado State football arrives at Arizona Bowl two players short"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "TUCSON, Ariz. - Colorado State's football team arrived in Tucson to start preparation for Tuesday's Arizona Bowl against Nevada, doing so short two players.\n\nCSU coach Mike Bobo said kick returner/wideout Deionte Gaines will miss the contest due to academic reasons, and senior Kevin Pierre-Louis could be in the same situation, though Bobo said he still has time.", "title": "Colorado State football arrives at Arizona Bowl two players short", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29311985/colorado-state-football-arrives-at-arizona-bowl-two", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1225/20151225_101056_Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl logo.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-25T22:08:31-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State football arrives at Arizona Bowl two players short", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1225/20151225_101056_Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl logo.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2015-12-25T22:11:31-0700", "endDate": "2025-12-25T22:08:31-0700", "byline": "By Mike Brohard", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-12-25T22:12:32-0700", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "article_summary": "Deionte Gaines out; Kevin Pierre-Louis out for nowTUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 Colorado State\u2019s football team arrived in Tucson to start preparation for Tuesday\u2019s Arizona Bowl against Nevada, doing so short two players.\n\u201cKevin Pierre-Louis is not here at the moment, but there\u2019s still a chance he can get here in a day or two,\u201d Bobo said.\nThe Arizona Bowl is making its debut, and the CSU first-year coach feels it is going all out.\nHe said the players were focused and sharp, as well as rested and excited to be back on the field.\nThe Rams had prepped for half of that, with Nick Januska, Jake Schlager and Justin Sweet all seeing reps in both spots."}
