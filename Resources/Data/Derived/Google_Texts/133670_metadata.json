Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota. Are you excited?\n\nDavid Brooks: Have you ever heard of negative panic? In times of chaos or extreme excitement, before a fire or an oncoming tornado, some people act with extreme calm, as if everything is normal. Their brains just don\u2019t know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances don\u2019t exist. Many people die because they don\u2019t take the simple evasive action that would save their lives.\n\nI am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal. I give off the appearance of extreme calm. But deep down I\u2019m rippling with excitement. Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic.\n\nGail: I may have gotten carried away. I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa.\n\nBut we\u2019ve only got three more weeks of this election season, so you have to humor me. In South Dakota, Mike Rounds, the Republican Senate candidate, was supposed to win. Then he got mired in a scandal. It\u2019s one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like \u201callegations of corruption.\u201d\n\nDavid: Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited? Now I\u2019ve been there a few times. What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other. You\u2019d think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldn\u2019t have time for east/west. I guess the winters are long.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality.\n\nGail: Well, Rounds hasn\u2019t run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans don\u2019t like that tone. Although to be fair, until recently he didn\u2019t think he had any competition. People who are basically running unopposed love the high road.\n\nThe Democrat, Rick Weiland, has been running as a populist-liberal, and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely. Then Larry Pressler, a former Republican senator now turned independent, began to get traction. Now anything seems possible.\n\nDavid: I love the fact that Pressler is back, once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature, that there are no second acts in American life.\n\nGail: Oh my gosh, I totally agree with you. Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts.\n\nDavid: Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act. The guy was a Rhodes Scholar, a Vietnam vet. He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president. That\u2019s a long time ago. He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal. Here\u2019s a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:\n\n\u201cThanks to the F.B.I.\u2019s undercover \u2018sting\u2019 operation, there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought. Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress, there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD) tells the undercover agents, in effect, to take their sting and stick it. Pressler, according to law enforcement sources, was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors, as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs. At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.\u201d\n\nGail: I do love listening to you read the news. And you brought back Abscam! It\u2019s comforting, at minimum, to know there was at least one senator who didn\u2019t immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle.\n\nDavid: So yes, I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate. That said, I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him.\n\nGail: So we agree South Dakota is \u2013 yes! \u2013 exciting. And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents.\n\nHere\u2019s what worries me about that. There are already two official independents in the Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine. Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4? If the independents formed their own little caucus, they\u2019d have the deciding votes on everything. The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas, South Dakota, Vermont and Maine. Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population.\n\nDavid: Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center. Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states.\n\nGail: Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington, D.C? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls, which is more than Pat Roberts, the endangered Kansas senator, bothered to do.\n\nDavid: I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldn\u2019t fly home every week. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time at home that ruins them; it\u2019s the airport food.\n\nI know people like me are always saying this, but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more. Plus, members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day.\n\nGail: Well, sort of. Until the budget or the farm bill comes out, and everybody\u2019s trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake.\n\nWe do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year. Besides South Dakota and Kansas, there\u2019s Louisiana, where Senator Mary Landrieu\u2019s official state residence is in her parents\u2019 house. And in Alaska, the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots.\n\nDavid: We\u2019ve got to start paying these people more. With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C. levels, it\u2019s expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state. I really think this residency business is a crazy issue.\n\nGail: Maybe we could put up dorms. Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students.\n\nThis is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered, one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven, Connecticut, Burger King outlet.\n\nDavid: I didn\u2019t know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut.\n\nGail: Ach, low blow.\n\nBut it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear, competing agendas \u2014 plus the ability, at least in theory, to deliver on some of their promises.\n\nDavid: If one party or another had a total grip on the truth I\u2019d agree with you. Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests. Independents, if they know their job, can help find this balance. If they don\u2019t know their job they just waffle in the middle.\n\nGail: Well, I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory.\n\nDavid: So true.\n\nGail: Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue. Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots?\n\nI don\u2019t want to force your opinion, but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season.\n\nDavid: Sorry. I do think health care inflation is declining, which is fabulous news, either because of Obamacare or some other reason. But I\u2019m afraid this issue will be with us forever. When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056, we\u2019ll still be talking about it.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141014195532, "BN": "opinionator", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/opinionator", "channels": "NytNow", "per": "Orman, Gregory J;Pressler, Larry;Rounds, Mike", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Orman Gregory J,Pressler Larry,Rounds Mike,Elections Senate,Midterm Elections (2014),United States Politics and Government,Senate,Kansas,South Dakota,The Conversation", "GBLC": "The Conversation", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/opinionator/Independents' Day ( 20141014 )", "news_keywords": "2014 Midterm Elections,Greg Orman,Kansas,Larry Pressler,Mike Rounds,Senate,Senate races,South Dakota,US Politics", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "David Brooks and Gail Collins", "SCG": "opinionator", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "David Brooks and Gail Collins", "byl": "David Brooks and Gail Collins", "twitter": {"description": "Brooks and Collins on unusual campaign developments in Kansas and South Dakota.", "title": "Independents' Day", "url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/independents-day/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/04/25/opinion/opinionator-pog-theconversation/opinionator-pog-theconversation-thumbLarge.png", "site": "@nytopinionator", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/opinionator/post", "description": "Brooks and Collins on unusual campaign developments in Kansas and South Dakota.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 14, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "The Conversation", "published_time": 1413330932, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T23:55:32-04:00"}, "geo": "Kansas;South Dakota", "utime": 20141014235532, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141014, "pdate": 20141014, "des": "Elections, Senate;Midterm Elections (2014);United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/04/25/opinion/opinionator-pog-theconversation/opinionator-pog-theconversation-thumbLarge.png", "og": {"site_name": "Opinionator", "description": "Brooks and Collins on unusual campaign developments in Kansas and South Dakota.", "title": "Independents' Day", "url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/independents-day/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/independents-day/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Independents' Day", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/04/25/opinion/opinionator-pog-theconversation/opinionator-pog-theconversation-thumbLarge.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 14, 2014"}, "article_summary": "I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa.\nTheir brains just don\u2019t know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances don\u2019t exist.\nThe fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas, South Dakota, Vermont and Maine.\nAnd in Alaska, the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots.\nIn South Dakota, Mike Rounds, the Republican Senate candidate, was supposed to win."}
