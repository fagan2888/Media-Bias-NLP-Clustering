Cincinnati’s hospital systems saw a surge in net income in 2014, although the increases came about more from investments, government grants and philanthropy than from operations, a new review of Ohio’s health-care economy shows.

The 13th edition of “Ohio Health Market Review” also found that the overall profits for Ohio’s health insurers went down even as the carriers picked up about 800,000 more customers through the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio.

The report said hospitals in Greater Cincinnati had combined net income of $645.1 million in 2014, and the strongest margins were at The Christ Hospital, TriHealth and St. Elizabeth Healthcare. That amount is up significantly from the report’s finding in 2012 of $588.6 million in net income.

Every two years since 1997, independent market analyst Allan Baumgarten of Minneapolis has produced the “Ohio Health Market Review” to take a sweeping look at the Buckeye State’s health-care economy. He has published similar reports in 11 other key states.

Among his other findings for 2014:

Local hospital systems have been on a building binge even though the number of days that patients stay in the hospital has dropped. In 2008, the occupancy rate was 68.7 percent; in 2014, it was 67.4 percent.

TriHealth had the highest occupancy rate at 74.4 percent, with Bethesda North the highest of all at nearly 82 percent. The occupancy rate at UC Health hospitals was 67.1 percent, and at Mercy Health’s five hospitals Greater Cincinnati, the rate was 63.9 percent. At Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the rate was 71 percent.

Medicare covered 42.6 percent of inpatient days. Other payers, mostly commercial insurers, covered 32.3 percent of inpatient days.

Statewide, enrollment in Medicaid health-maintenance organizations hit 2.4 million in 2014, including more than 600,000 recipients added under the Medicaid expansion.

With more people enrolled in Medicaid, the federal program covered more impatient days at local hospitals: In 2013, the number was 234,000 days; in 2014, 269,000 days.

Enrollment in individual HMO plans grew by almost 100,000 in 2014.

HMO profitability has declined. Statewide, HMOs had net income of $171.2 million in 2014, or 1.1 percent of premium revenues – a sharp drop from 2012’s net income of $243 million, or 2.5 percent of premium revenues.

Hospitals are devoting more effort in strategic alliances, such as the Healthcare Solutions Network joining TriHealth and St. Elizabeth Healthcare.
