Even churches are not exempt from funding abortions.\n\nBut churches in California are refusing to comply with the law. Instead, they\u2019re working with the pro-life legal group Alliance Defending Freedom to file suit against the state.\n\nADF informed LifeNews today that it filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the California Department of Managed Health Care for forcing churches to pay for elective abortions in their health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cChurches should not be forced to pay for the killing of innocent human life,\u201d said ADF Senior Legal Counsel Erik Stanley. \u201cThe government has no right to demand that church health insurance plans contain coverage for abortion \u2013 something that violates these churches\u2019 most sincerely held religious beliefs. California is violating the Constitution by strong-arming churches into having this coverage in their plans.\u201d\n\nADF filed the lawsuit, Foothill Church v. Rouillard, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch.\n\nLast year, ADF and Life Legal Defense Foundation filed formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against DMHC regarding California\u2019s mandate and its violation of federal conscience law. Those came on the heels of a complaint filed directly with DMHC, which responded by affirming its decision to force all plans to cover all abortions without any explanation as to how that decision squares with the Constitution and contrasting federal law.\n\n\u201cBecause Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan, these churches are truly left with no way to opt out of paying for abortions,\u201d said ADF Litigation Staff Counsel Jeremiah Galus. \u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though, is that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage. Californians should not be forced to choose between following their deepest convictions and submitting to unlawful and unnecessary government mandates.\u201d\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\n\n\u201cElective abortions are not part of \u2018basic health care,\u2019\u201d Galus continued. \u201cThey have no business being forced into the medical coverage provided by churches that do not wish to support terminating lives due to very real, sincere, and well-known faith convictions. We hope the court will require California to follow the Constitution and respect these churches\u2019 fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nAD told LifeNews that the concern of many pro-life Californians about being compelled by the government to pay for elective abortions has only been enhanced recently by the knowledge that some of those aborted children may have had their body parts sold for profit. Planned Parenthood has been caught in a series of videos selling aborted babies and their body parts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California Forces Churches to Fund Abortions, Churches Refuse to Comply and File Lawsuit", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Last year, in a direct assault on people of faith in California, the California Department of Managed Health Care reclassified abortion as a \u201cbasic health ser", "title": "California Forces Churches to Fund Abortions, Churches Refuse to Comply and File Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/10/16/california-forces-churches-to-fund-abortions-churches-refuse-to-comply-and-file-lawsuit/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/california2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "california forces churches to fund abortions,churches refuse to comply and file lawsuit", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27f6\"", "article_summary": "ADF informed LifeNews today that it filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the California Department of Managed Health Care for forcing churches to pay for elective abortions in their health insurance plans.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though, is that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage.\nBut churches in California are refusing to comply with the law.\n\u201cThe government has no right to demand that church health insurance plans contain coverage for abortion \u2013 something that violates these churches\u2019 most sincerely held religious beliefs.\nFollow @LifeNewsHQ\u201cElective abortions are not part of \u2018basic health care,\u2019\u201d Galus continued."}
