Even Jessica Alba is getting involved with funding a slew of digital health startups trying to heal the healthcare system.\n\nYet, to outlive the hype that comes with being Silicon Valley\u2019s latest trend, and actually improve care for patients and consumers, health tech will require more than a just a funding pipeline. The good news is that all the pieces are in place \u2014 the problem, the appetite for a solution and the tech \u2014 to bring healthcare into the modern age.\n\nThe next step is to integrate efforts in cooperation with all of the players to put these cutting-edge technologies into action and transform care \u2014 a step often underestimated.\n\nIt also will require matching our maturing technology toolbox with macro trends that serve to hasten the evolution of our digital health future. We must take into account the ripple effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and begin to prepare for the Silver Tsunami of retiring Baby Boomers, who will be on the forefront of adopting digital health tools.\n\nIf we bring all the pieces together, our generation will go down in history as the era when healthcare joined the modern age. No longer will hospitals need to print discharge plans and hand them to frazzled patients and family members. No longer will a doctor need to fax a signature to a health agency.\n\nBeyond the fundamentals, the biggest changes will be manifest in everything from how the healthcare is measured and managed to the mainstreaming of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to keeping seniors out of the hospital and able to spend more of their golden years at home. Here are three key areas that, if developed and implemented correctly, will help us seize the next great opportunity in tech and ignite the digital health revolution.\n\nFocus On Quality: Measuring Outcomes With Big Data\n\nThe first step to utilizing modern technology to improve care processes is to tap into technologies used ubiquitously in other industries to measure effective, quality outcomes. It seems simple, but most doctors, nurses and aides in the U.S. do not know how long their own procedures, on average, require. Moreover, quality outcomes today are measured with metrics that are decades old and devices that are mostly manual.\n\nAgree or disagree with the ACA, it has set us on a completely new trajectory for healthcare \u2014 one that relies heavily on new technology. Not so long ago, healthcare providers charged patients per visit or medical test \u2014 or fee for service. The incentive was simple: do more to make more. In response, healthcare produced volumes of unnecessary lab tests, procedures and additional billing items. But under the ACA, new payment requirements must be the norm by 2018. The focus now is on value, or high-quality care.\n\nQuality outcomes today are measured with metrics that are decades old.\n\nAs a result, we are at a tipping point in how the healthcare industry measures outcomes. Using big data and other technologies, the opportunity for savings is massive. Approximately $44 billion is spent on unplanned hospital readmissions, with Medicare footing the bill for $26 billion. As a result, everyone is eagerly embracing technologies with a goal of keeping patients from making a return visit. To do so, investors are working with the best health tech innovators to create electronic records, sensors and wearables.\n\nLeading electronic health record (EHR) vendors Epic, Cerner and Athenahealth have begun to tackle this challenge of monitoring and maintaining health data. Epic, for example, is working with Apple\u2019s HealthKit to run pilot programs at hospitals for high-risk patients. There is still much progress to be made in this space, however. Creating measurement systems that work at each point of care and connecting the dots between each care setting and each party is the first piece to the puzzle.\n\nNew Care Settings: Telehealth And Shifting Healthcare From Hospital To Home\n\nThe second piece to unlocking the digital health potential is the recognition and development of new care settings. Think about care everywhere, not just in the hospital. This will be especially important for seniors, given the overwhelming preference of individuals facing retirement, who would prefer to stay in their own homes instead of moving to an assisted living facility.\n\nAs the primary point of care shifts to the living room for aging Baby Boomers, a major evolution is underway as home care becomes the next frontier of technology innovation. Telehealth technologies that allow doctors to conduct house calls from afar and monitor health conditions via wearable devices and in-home sensors will help avoid expensive hospitalizations and readmissions.\n\nPropeller Health\u2019s inhaler sensor serves as another example. The sensor tracks how often patients use their medication and sends alerts to their physician or caregiver if there are changes in usage. The sensor and accompanying mobile app are just one of many mobile applications in existence with the aim of curbing readmissions.\n\nThe New Front Line: Empowering Atypical Early Adopters\n\nOur systems need to not only allow for telecommunication on phones, tablets and within IoT devices, but will need to be developed for an atypical group of early adopters \u2013caregivers in the field, seniors aging at home instead and friends and family members who will assist with care management.\n\nGiven smartphone ownership is low among seniors, it underscores the need for health tech solutions outside of the mobile device. Lively is one startup that recognizes this. Similar to how Apple knew people wouldn\u2019t want to wear a smartwatch if it wasn\u2019t fashionable, Lively designed a stylish safety watch that works with activity sensors in the home to detect falls and notify family members of things like a missed meal. Family alerts that allow loved ones to remotely monitor are a must-have feature, given the 7-10 million adults caring for their aging parents from a long distance, and the 15-24 million members of the sandwich generation that are adult-child caregivers.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe challenge facing health tech is arguably much greater than other industries because it is working within the confines of tremendous regulation and complexity. Revolutionizing a rigid system and tackling not-so-simple challenges like the rapidly aging Baby Boomer generation is a tall task, but the opportunity is ripe.\n\nThe Silver Tsunami is upon us, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that to avoid the wave crashing down, the health tech and healthcare industries will need to navigate this together. The problem, the opportunity and the tech are on the table \u2014 together, the digital health revolution will become a reality.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/contributor/geoffrey-nudd/\" title=\"Posts by Geoffrey Nudd\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Geoffrey Nudd</a>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "To outlive the hype that comes with being Silicon Valley\u2019s latest trend, and actually improve care for patients and consumers, health tech will require more than a just a funding pipeline.\u2026", "title": "How The Digital Health Revolution Will Become A Reality |\u2026", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/07/how-the-digital-health-revolution-will-become-a-reality/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/doctorpov.png?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "To outlive the hype that comes with being Silicon Valley\u2019s latest trend, and actually improve care for patients and consumers, health tech will require more than a just a funding pipeline.
