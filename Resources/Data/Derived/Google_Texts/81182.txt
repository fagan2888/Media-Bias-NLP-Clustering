Forecasters advise mountain travelers to be on the lookout for rain and snow Sunday.

“People coming down from the mountains should be aware of road conditions,” said Kari Bowen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Those showers, which Bowen said would start Sunday afternoon, could persist through the night and into Monday, resulting in accumulations of up to four inches. She noted that wind gusts could reach 30 mph.

In the metro area, forecasters say a warm and overcast Sunday will likely turn into a wet, chilly Monday.

Bowen said temperatures will reach the lower 70s by Sunday afternoon. On Monday, temperatures are expected to dip into the lower 50s.

A 50 percent chance of rain could produce showers beginning around noon Monday. There’s a 30 percent chance those showers will turn into snow overnight, as temperatures drop below freezing.
