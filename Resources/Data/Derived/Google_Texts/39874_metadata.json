It also stated that many individuals do not qualify for exemption and that \"If you do not have insurance...the federal government may impose a fee on your taxes.\" It states that the fee in 2014, \"will be one percent of annual income or $95, whichever is greater\" and the fee would be paid when \"you file your taxes at the end of the year.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the meeting, Kolami advised that open enrollment is through March, and if purchased on or before the 15th of the month, coverage will take effect on the first day of the following month. She stated that certain life events, such births or death and divorce or marriage, do provide individuals opportunities to enroll outside of the open enrollment period.\n\nKolami said insurance companies are sending out letters of cancellation if coverage is not \"aligned with the laws of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nKolami provided contact information for Connect for Health Colorado.
