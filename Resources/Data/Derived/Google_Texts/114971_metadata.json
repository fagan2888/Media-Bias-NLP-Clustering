They chase him down streets for photos. Sometimes, they just continue to stare with awe after he speaks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of overwhelmed,\u201d said Peter Rice, a retired volunteer firefighter, his newly acquired \u201cI\u2019m with Ben\u201d button in hand. \u201cThis guy is a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s liking a candidate \u2014 and then there\u2019s the particular passion that Carson seems to incite, despite the sometimes unusual statements that make him stand out among 2016\u2019s Republican White House hopefuls.\n\nSo what is it about the 63-year-old political neophyte, who often refers to himself in the third person as \u201cCarson\u201d during stump speeches, advocates for tax rates based on tithing, and compares the life-or-death plight of Revolutionary figures to today\u2019s politics?\n\nHe speaks with the aplomb of a superstar neurosurgeon and a highbrow history buff \u2014 yet also the raw candor overheard in a coffee klatch. While describing detractors\u2019 efforts to bring him down \u2014 including a reference to a years-old paternity suit \u2014 Carson revealed to a packed town hall Tuesday that, \u201cI knew something they didn\u2019t know. I knew that the only woman I\u2019d ever slept with in my life was my wife.\u201d\n\nSupporters gush over what they call his \u201ccompelling personal story\u201d and \u201ccommon sense.\u201d He is the only African-American candidate \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 and his resume is unlike the others. It includes his tenure as director of neurosurgery at John Hopkins University but no elected offices or previous flirtations with running for president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are pundits who say Carson\u2019s brand of religious conservatism will not win in New Hampshire, which polls show is one of the least religious states in the country.\n\nA recent poll by the University of New Hampshire showed Carson barely registered when voters were asked who had the best chance of winning, which candidate best represented Republicans like themselves, and who would be the strongest leader.\n\nStill, the university poll did show Carson had a high net favorability ranking, coming in second after US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. And according to national polls, he would make the 10-candidate cut to be onstage if the first televised national debate were held today.\n\nSo the retired doctor and his supporters aren\u2019t worried about the naysayers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with him,\u201d said Dianne Durkin, president and founder of an employment loyalty company. \u201cHis entire thing about . . . leadership is spot on.\u201d\n\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff Ben Carson greeted passersby as he campaigned in Portsmouth, N.H. earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSo far, he hits the nerve in my body that says treat people fairly, be respectable, do the right thing, love your country,\u201d said Doug Bates, president of the Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBates estimates he has heard eight candidates speak but only wanted his picture taken with one \u2013 Carson.\n\n\u2018So far, he hits the nerve in my body that says treat people fairly, be respectable, do the right thing, love your country.\u2019 Doug Bates, president of the Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce\n\nIn a speech Tuesday morning to about 50 business leaders at Pease International Tradeport, Carson called for \u201cstopping all this silly divisiveness\u201d and class, race, gender, and age \u201cwarfare\u201d \u2014 all distractions, he said, from the \u201cradical Islamic jihadists\u201d targeting America.\n\n\u201cWe are falling for garbage. We are allowing ourselves to be colluded. You can\u2019t just go through life worried about who\u2019s on \u2018Dancing with the Stars,\u2019 \u201d Carson said. \u201cWhat are you willing to fight for? What are you willing to die for?\u201d\n\nCarson spent three days campaigning in New Hampshire, with its first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nLast month, Carson grabbed national attention by calling out some of the other candidates who, he said, were slow to criticize the massacre at the Charleston, S.C., church as rooted in racism.\n\n\u201cBut there are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who dare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of offending a particular segment of the electorate,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed piece.\n\nIt was just two years ago that Carson burst into the political arena at the National Prayer Breakfast. He used humor and his personal story of growing up in an impoverished Detroit home to give a conservative critique on the country\u2019s state of affairs as President Obama sat nearby.\n\nSome of his most scathing remarks focused on the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to replace with a health care system that gives people transferable health savings accounts.\n\nCarson\u2019s single mother was determined her two sons would rise above their station in life, he said. She refused to accept public assistance and required regular book reports when he began doing poorly in school, even though she couldn\u2019t read them.\n\nHe would earn a scholarship to Yale University, where he met his wife, Candy, and continue to the University of Michigan\u2019s medical school.\n\nEchoes of that speech come through when Carson addresses a crowd from the campaign trail \u2014 but not when he engages in retail politics. As he shook hands and greeted voters one-on-one along the streets of downtown Portsmouth with his wife of 40 years, she was talkative and personable while he was awkward and reserved.\n\nOnstage, though, he seems to capture voters. In Bedford, after one of the must-stop \u201cPolitics & Eggs\u201d forums, a woman murmured, \u201cLove his message. He says it just right.\u201d At a town hall in Barrington, he concluded his speech by invoking Nathan Hale, famous for saying \u201cI only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe baton of freedom is in the hands of we the people,\u201d Carson told the crowd of about 150.\n\nIt was a speech that might have earned Donna Callmeyer\u2019s support. The 72-year-old Milford resident said she, like so many Republicans, was looking \u201cfor one of the bazillion candidates that we can support.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s intellect \u201ctotally impressed,\u201d her, as did \u201cthe fact that he answers questions so thoroughly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t, like, in your face about it,\u201d interjected her 14-year-old granddaughter Asia Hanson.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t walk away wondering what he thinks about immigration or the economy,\u201d Callmeyer continued. \u201cI felt a genuine honesty. This is the first candidate I\u2019m excited about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.3688310926", "eomportal-id": 650714, "description": "What is it about Dr. Ben Carson, the now-retired-pediatric-neurosurgeon-turned-political-neophyte, who refers to himself as \u201cCarson\u201d during stump speeches and incites a peculiar passion among some?", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Portsmouth", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "What is it about Dr. Ben Carson, the now-retired-pediatric-neurosurgeon-turned-political-neophyte, who refers to himself as \u201cCarson\u201d during stump speeches and incites a peculiar passion among some?", "title": "Ben Carson brings uncanny appeal to campaign trail - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/07/10/ben-carson-brings-uncanny-appeal-campaign-trail/pnCWdgy6wArheCYG19DINK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/07/07/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/150707_kdb_ben_carson_0016.jpg", "longitude": "-70.76255320000001", "state": "NH", "latitude": "43.0717552", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson,neurosurgeon,pediatric,presidential candidate,Republican,voters,White House,hopefuls,stand out,political neophyte", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 02:30:04 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Ben Carson,neurosurgeon,pediatric,presidential candidate,Republican,voters,White House,hopefuls,stand out,political neophyte,third person,'Carson',tax rates,tithing,based,common sense,African American,sole,candidate,John Hopkins University,favorability,ranking,national debate,Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce,National Prayer Breakfast., Peter Rice, Marco  Rubio, Barack  Obama, Nathan  Hale,Republican Party, Democratic Party, University of New Hampshire, Yale University, Twitter, Metro AG", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "617af32a-277a-11e5-a137-29c7ab0372e3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7300\"", "article_summary": "Echoes of that speech come through when Carson addresses a crowd from the campaign trail \u2014 but not when he engages in retail politics.\nPORTSMOUTH, N.H. \u2014 There\u2019s just something about Dr. Ben Carson, some Republican voters here say.\nleadership is spot on.\u201dKeith Bedford/Globe Staff Ben Carson greeted passersby as he campaigned in Portsmouth, N.H. earlier this week.\nAdvertisement\u201cI\u2019m just kind of overwhelmed,\u201d said Peter Rice, a retired volunteer firefighter, his newly acquired \u201cI\u2019m with Ben\u201d button in hand.\nIt was just two years ago that Carson burst into the political arena at the National Prayer Breakfast."}
