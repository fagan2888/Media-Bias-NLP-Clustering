(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World) Story Highlights Students from Cambodia, China, Germany, Ireland, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan, Palestine and Vietnam attend Park Vista.\n\nSo do Creoles, Cajuns and Native Americans.\n\nParents, teachers and aides carried tray after tray of food into the Park Vista Elementary School cafeteria.\n\nBut Friday\u2019s meal wasn\u2019t an ordinary lunch.\n\nThe spread included Pakistani kebabs, Salvadoran pupusas, Vietnamese rice cakes, Mexican tamales and Palestinian hummus, all homemade.\n\nEven for those who didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the dishes, they all translated into delicious.\n\nFor Park Vista principal Ulysse Joubert, that was the point of the school\u2019s second annual International Day.\n\n\u201cIn a school you have to learn, but it\u2019s not just the things you learn in books,\u201d he told about 300 students, parents and staff before the feast.\n\n\u201cWe want to celebrate the backgrounds of all the children we have here,\u201d Joubert said. \u201cSome parents said, \u2018What we want is to be the same as everybody else and not point out the differences.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe principal continued, \u201cMy answer to that is: too late.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s 630-plus students represent more than a dozen nationalities. While some are relatively recent arrivals to the area, their presence reinforces a longstanding Louisiana way of life, Joubert said.\n\nFor example, crawfish routinely shows up on Chinese restaurant menus here, he said, adding, \u201cwe take a little bit of every culture and we make it one.\u201d\n\nParents at the luncheon said they and their children feel that unity inside out.\n\n\u201cI wish every school in St. Landry Parish were like Park Vista, where people from different countries are being accepted,\u201d said Shaid Swati, the parent of four children at the school.\n\nWith his brothers, Swati operates gas stations and convenience stores. The Pakistan native, now a U.S. citizen, also volunteers at the school.\n\nLucia DeLeon put in lots of time before the event making pork tamales and guacamole from scratch.\n\n\u201cThis is the second year I\u2019ve enjoyed this day,\u201d said the mother born in Guadalajara, Mexico, who arrived in the U.S. eight years ago with her husband, who runs a construction company.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here, I didn\u2019t speak any English. I can tell you that around the town, people looked at our kids funny when they spoke Spanish,\u201d she said. DeLeon emphasized that she feels as strongly about her three children maintaining their native language as others in St. Landry Parish feel about keeping French alive.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason she gets excited about International Day \u2014 which, as it turns out, happens at a school with a French-language immersion program.\n\n\u201cLatinos are being pointed to as \u2018lazy illegals,\u2019\u201d said DeLeon, who wore a tiered skirt in the red, white and green of the Mexican flag. \u201cThis is a good way to show others that we are good and hardworking.\u201d\n\nLike her, Ola Farhad is rearing her children in two languages. To represent Palestine where many people speak Arabic, she displayed the baklava, hummus and pita bread she brought with examples of Islamic calligraphy and mosaic work.\n\nFarhad also wore a black-and-white headscarf and dressed some of her daughters in richly embroidered velvet gowns.\u201dMy kids love to be noticed,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes the kids proud of their country\u201d \u2014 a country most nations, and soon Pope Francis, recognize as sovereign even as Israel, the United States, Canada and Mexico do not.\n\nHer daughter Jennat, a second grader, said that to her the day \u201cmeans different countries.\n\n\u201cThey express that they aren\u2019t that different. They are the same as you.\u201d\n\nJoubert said it takes constant work to reinforce that idea.\n\nThe principal likes to remind people that \u201cthe world is bigger than St. Landry Parish. Everything south of Texas is not Mexico. Everything Asian is not Vietnamese.\u201d\n\nGesturing toward two girls in the cafeteria who twirled in Mexican folk dresses, he said, \u201cTwo boys teased them today.\n\n\u201cI jumped on them like a duck on a junebug and said, \u2018Hold up. Suppose someone made fun of you?\u2019\u201d\n\nJoubert paused.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we still need this.\u201d\n\nThe World in a School\n\nPark Vista Elementary enrolls students from Cambodia, China, El Salvador, Germany, Ireland, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan, Palestine and Vietnam. Along with Cajuns, Creoles and Native Americans.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/education/2015/05/16/variety-stop-lunch-table/27446125/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Once a year, Park Vista Elementary marks International Day", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "Once a year, Park Vista Elementary marks International Day", "title": "Variety doesn\u2019t stop at the lunch table", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/education/2015/05/16/variety-stop-lunch-table/27446125/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Once a year, Park Vista Elementary marks International Day", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d496e61ac69426aacbc949e0831e569a85df1be/c=356-0-2045-1689&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/16/LafayetteLA/B9317376132Z.1_20150516151536_000_G62AQ4EM3.1-0.jpg", "title": "Variety doesn\u2019t stop at the lunch table", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Parents, teachers and aides carried tray after tray of food into the Park Vista Elementary School cafeteria.\nOla Farhad and her daughters pose for a selfie during the annual International Day Luncheon Friday at Park Vista Elementary.\nFor Park Vista principal Ulysse Joubert, that was the point of the school\u2019s second annual International Day.\n(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World) Story Highlights Students from Cambodia, China, Germany, Ireland, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan, Palestine and Vietnam attend Park Vista.\nThe spread included Pakistani kebabs, Salvadoran pupusas, Vietnamese rice cakes, Mexican tamales and Palestinian hummus, all homemade."}
