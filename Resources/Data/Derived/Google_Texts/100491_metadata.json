They warned that smoking causes wrinkles and lung cancer, booze bloats your face, marijuana fries your brain, and too much candy destroys your teeth. I never listened, drinking, toking, smoking and sugar-rushing all through high school, college and my graduate studies.\n\nWithout quitting anything, I was able to get two degrees, marry, launch an exciting career. That seemed proof that my substance abuse wasn\u2019t really a problem. But what was cute in my twenties wasn\u2019t as adorable by my fourth decade. That\u2019s when I had a full-blown midlife crisis, unhappy marriage, family issues, debt and debilitating job rejections. I needed help. \u201cYour addictions are keeping you from getting everything you want in life,\u201d said my substance abuse specialist.\n\nI was surprised that he blamed my employment and relationship failures on my habits. He seemed sure that my inability to be close to my husband, complete a long project, be financially solvent or get what I most wanted were all insidious byproducts of being addicted. Hearing horror stories of what over-imbibing did to your body or reading that higher percentages of middle-aged white Americans were dying of overdoses, I rationalized that I wasn\u2019t shooting heroin or popping Oxycodone. I cited studies showing that a glass a day of wine was healthy and marijuana wasn\u2019t addictive. Nobody told me that daily use of benign substances (like alcohol and pot) could actually mar your mind, creating a direct barrier to success \u2013 in work and love. My specialist explained his theory, that addicts depended on substances, not people. Instead of allowing myself to feel pain, discomfort, depression or awkwardness, I was sucking in smoke, sipping booze or eating my frustration and sadness away. \u201cUnderlying every substance problem I\u2019ve ever seen is a deep depression that feels unbearable. But it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s how I stopped several damaging habits and what I recommend:\n\nNEW YEAR\u2019S IS ACTUALLY A BAD DAY TO QUIT: In case you\u2019ve already blown your resolutions, no problem. Resolving in a fervor that everything will be different on a big national holiday when you\u2019re away from work, school and your routine might be setting yourself up for disappointment. \u201cBeware all excitement because it takes you out of yourself and you always have to go back to yourself,\u201d my addiction specialist warned. Most people who try to quit anything on January 1 fail, perhaps because vague, general promises to yourself (like \u201cI will lose weight\u201d), without a solid plan already in effect, don\u2019t work. When I was really ready to stop my 27-year smoking and drinking habits, I picked a more personal quitting date, Oct. 7, 2001, which stuck.\n\nSEE AN EXPERT: I never even knew there were addiction specialists until I\u2019d stumbled on a brilliant Ph.D. with that expertise. I also didn\u2019t know that with a \u201csubstance abuse\u201d diagnosis, my health insurance would cover three times as many sessions. (A coworker confirms this is also true with his Obamacare.) Google to find social workers, psychologists and psychiatric experts in your area. If you don\u2019t have medical coverage, ask if they\u2019ll use a sliding scale, since some practitioners will reduce their rate to as little as $20 a session. If you can\u2019t afford that, there are free daily AA, NA and OA meetings (for alcoholics, narcotics abusers and overeaters) where you can find a sponsor, or online recovery groups where you don\u2019t have to leave your house. If you hate meetings and therapy, ask a sober coworker or relative for advice. I\u2019ve been happy to help other addicts who\u2019ve approached me by listening and sharing my techniques. One student emailed me every day to tell me her progress.\n\nDON\u2019T JUST SWITCH ADDICTIONS: Since I\u2019d smoked two packs a day and cigarettes were ridiculously expensive and banned almost everywhere, I decided to stop smoking first. Without realizing it, I immediately started drinking more. When my addiction specialist insisted I monitor my liquor intake, I turned to Blow Pop lollipops incessantly. \u201cIf you gain 20 pounds you\u2019ll use this as a reason you can\u2019t quit smoking,\u201d he said. I switched to chewing on cinnamon sticks instead (which have zero calories), watched my diet and exercised. I miraculously lost 10 pounds while quitting. So that blew the \u201cbut I\u2019ll gain weight\u201d excuse. It\u2019s fairly common for addicts to do the \u201csubstance shuffle.\u201d But despite popular misconceptions, it\u2019s entirely possible to drop weight while abstaining from cigarettes, drugs or alcohol, especially with an addiction expert to guide you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you give up a toxic substance,  you create room for something better to take its place.
