A eating disorder had caused extensive, yet unseen, damage. Earlier that year, she even went to the emergency room for a blood-related problem but was sent away, told she was healthy and that she should go home.\n\nHer husband, Nathan, is trying to make sure others don\u2019t suffer the same fate, lobbying for a bill called the Anna Westin Act. The legislation, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., would use existing grant funds to train school personnel, health care providers and others on how to identify eating disorders and how to intervene.\n\nLibbey says more education and less stigma around eating disorders would have helped his late wife.\n\n\u201cShe would go to the doctor, they would say she\u2019s healthy. She had children, she held a job. She didn\u2019t look like a stereotypical eating disorder patient,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut being bulimic, you purge yourself of electrolytes on a daily basis, and eventually it just rots away your insides. And no one knew it.\u201d\n\nHidden eating disorders\n\nJennifer Libbey, who taught kindergarten in the Burlington Area School District, officially died of cardiac arrest, but that doesn\u2019t tell the full story. As a result of purging behavior, her potassium levels got so low it threw her heart out of rhythm.\n\nShe died Aug. 14, 2014, while attending a conference in Wisconsin Rapids, without any warning signs her health was that dire, the Journal Times (http://bit.ly/22b6Ntf ) reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the doctors\u2019 fault. I\u2019m never going to blame anyone for being misinformed, but that\u2019s exactly what they are,\u201d Nathan Libbey said. \u201cIf she had weighed 30 pounds less, I think the conversation is very different and I think the outcome is very different.\u201d\n\nJennifer Libbey was in treatment off and on through the years, but she often felt like a burden after people learned she suffered from an eating disorder, her husband said.\n\nThat had much to do with stigma surrounding eating disorders and mental health, which he hopes diminishes over time.\n\nSomeday, Libbey hopes those recovering from eating disorders can be looked at the same as recovering alcoholics, who count the days, months and years they have remained sober.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re nowhere near that,\u201d he said.\n\nCase in point: Some people have reached out to Libbey about how they sought help because of his wife\u2019s story.\n\nIn the next breath, they\u2019ll ask he not tell anybody about it.\n\nEating Disorders Coalition\n\nAfter his wife\u2019s death, Nathan contacted the Eating Disorders Coalition, which invited him to a lobbying day in Washington D.C. Bucking negative perceptions of lobbying, he said he was impressed with progress made and support of lawmakers.\n\nThe Anna Westin Act was introduced last year. It\u2019s named after a Minnesota girl who struggled with anorexia and committed suicide at age 21.\n\nBaldwin said the legislation would help improve prevention, treatment and diagnosis for 192,000 Wisconsinites battling eating disorders.\n\n\u201cNathan\u2019s advocacy and tireless devotion in promoting greater public awareness about eating disorders is truly inspiring. With Nathan\u2019s help, I am proud to fight for bipartisan legislation to improve health insurance coverage of treatment and to help health professionals and school personnel better recognize and understand eating disorders,\u201d Baldwin said in a statement to The Journal Times.\n\nLibbey is 33, a district manager at Nestle and engaged to be married again.\n\nHe\u2019ll someday tell his children, who are now 3, 4 and 6, the full story of what happened to their mother.\n\nIt won\u2019t be a shameful story. And he hopes he\u2019ll also talk about changes he helped create.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say, \u2018This is what the people that we told about it (are) doing to help you and your generation,'\" he said. \u201cI really believe in that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill co-sponsored by Tammy Baldwin would use existing funds to train health-care providers and others on how to identify eating disorders.", "og": {"site_name": "Wisconsin Gazette", "description": "A bill co-sponsored by Tammy Baldwin would use existing funds to train health-care providers and others on how to identify eating disorders.", "title": "Tammy Baldwin co-sponsors bill addressing eating disorders", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bulimia-600x315.jpg", "url": "http://wisconsingazette.com/2016/03/26/tammy-baldwin-co-sponsors-bill-addressing-eating-disorders/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bill co-sponsored by Tammy Baldwin would use existing funds to train health-care providers and others on how to identify eating disorders.", "title": "Tammy Baldwin co-sponsors bill addressing eating disorders", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bulimia.jpg", "creator": "@wigazette", "site": "@wigazette", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 656359844}, "google-site-verification": "seM7rhmcUuSzBWv6kkeJ_YZI5fL-A0v6VtNwwuSnfkc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wigazette/", "section": "News", "tag": "Tammy Baldwin", "published_time": "2016-03-26T09:58:26-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNathan\u2019s advocacy and tireless devotion in promoting greater public awareness about eating disorders is truly inspiring.\nBaldwin said the legislation would help improve prevention, treatment and diagnosis for 192,000 Wisconsinites battling eating disorders.\nThat had much to do with stigma surrounding eating disorders and mental health, which he hopes diminishes over time.\nLibbey says more education and less stigma around eating disorders would have helped his late wife.\nThe legislation, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen.
