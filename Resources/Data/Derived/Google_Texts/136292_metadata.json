Besides Lionel Messi, he\u2019s been Argentina\u2019s most influential player in Brazil.\n\nDi Maria scored the extra-time winner against Switzerland in the second round and set up Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s winning goal in the first half against Belgium on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a key player in this project,\u201d Higuain said of Di Maria. \u201cWe hope that he will be ready as soon as possible because we know what he does for the team.\u201d\n\nCoach Alejandro Sabella called Di Maria \u201cvital\u201d to Argentina, which is already missing striker Sergio Aguero due to injury.\n\nSabella also praised Messi\u2019s performance against Belgium, even though he didn\u2019t score. The four-time world player of the year started the move that resulted in Higuain\u2019s goal, pirouetting past two Belgium players before giving the ball to Di Maria whose pass deflected off a defender into Higuain\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cMessi, I feel that he played a wonderful match because it is not only scoring goals,\u201d Sabella said. \u201cIt is bringing together three opponents and to see if you can give the ball to a teammate to move forward in the pitch. Every move he makes is a sign of hope for us and it endangers the opponent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "author": "Karl Ritter", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "title": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/di_maria_injury_setback_for_argentina_at_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-argentina-belgium.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-argentina-belgium.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Di Maria injury setback for Argentina at World Cup", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80c3\"", "article_summary": "Losing Di Maria would be a big blow for Argentina as it prepares for its first World Cup semifinal since 1990.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBRASILIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 One step away from a potential World Cup final, Argentina is hoping for Angel Di Maria to recover from a thigh injury in time for Wednesday\u2019s semifinal clash against Netherlands.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a key player in this project,\u201d Higuain said of Di Maria.\nDi Maria scored the extra-time winner against Switzerland in the second round and set up Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s winning goal in the first half against Belgium on Saturday.\n\u201cWe hope that he will be ready as soon as possible because we know what he does for the team.\u201dCoach Alejandro Sabella called Di Maria \u201cvital\u201d to Argentina, which is already missing striker Sergio Aguero due to injury."}
