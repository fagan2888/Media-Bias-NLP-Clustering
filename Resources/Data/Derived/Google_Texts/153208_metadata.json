Kelli Ward is seriously considering a run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican John McCain\u2014something that clearly has McCain rattled\u2014she told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview while at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) in National Harbor, M.D., late last month.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still early in the process, this has just come to light publicly just about two and a half weeks ago,\u201d Ward, a family physician who ran for state senate in 2012 and is now serving her second term, told Breitbart News.\n\nI\u2019m still in the early listening, thinking, learning and praying phase to kind of think about whether there\u2019s a political pathway and a financial pathway to make this challenge because really it is a David and Goliath story. Obviously, it\u2019s not something to just jump into lightly. I\u2019m still early in the process but the reason I\u2019m considering it is because there\u2019s an outcry from the people of Arizona for conservative leadership. They want something new. They want somebody new. They want somebody positive and passionate and persuasive and principled. They want all of those things and many of the people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re getting it right now. They\u2019re searching for someone.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one considering a run against McCain, but she\u2019s the most public at this time\u2014and has been public for at least a month now. Breitbart News can officially confirm here for the first time publicly that, according to a source close to him, Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) is also seriously looking at a run for McCain\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cIs he looking at it? Yes he is. Yes he is,\u201d a source close to Salmon told Breitbart News in an interview this week. \u201dBut unlike his colleagues in the Arizona delegation, he\u2019s not going to talk to the press about it. He\u2019s not going to engage in speculation. It\u2019s not some kind of a reflection of a lack of seriousness or anything, he\u2019s had a lot of people encourage him to take a hard look at this seat and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nMany thought Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) or Paul Gosar (R-AZ) would make a run against McCain, but it\u2019s looking increasingly likely neither will.\n\nWard told Breitbart News she thinks Congress needs more doctors like herself, \u201cpeople in the trenches who actually want to fight Obamacare not \u2018yes men\u2019 who want to keep socializing our medical system and leading to single-payer, that\u2019s no good for patients, no good for doctors, no good for anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare was actually the reason why I decided to run for office,\u201d she said.\n\nWe were considering a state exchange and Medicaid expansion at the time and I thought it was a terrible idea, a horrible idea and I wanted to be down there in the trenches as a conservative physician voice to fight that. We didn\u2019t win. We didn\u2019t get exchanges, but we lost on the Medicaid expansion because we had too many wishy-washy middle-of-the-road Republicans who voted with the Democrats to expand a huge entitlement program in our state. People are already feeling sorry about it.\n\nShe noted that she\u2019s \u201cvery conservative, with a very conservative voting record\u201d that she said focuses on \u201csmaller government, less taxes, less regulation, following the Constitution, more personal responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of those things have been what I campaigned on and what I lived up to since I\u2019ve been serving,\u201d she said. \u201cI never really thought I\u2019d be in office, I\u2019m a family doctor by trade and never thought I\u2019d be in politics.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a Super PAC called Kelli PAC set up to back her already, and that group\u2019s leader Doug McKee told Breitbart News that Kelli PAC\u2019s \u201cgoal is to raise enough money and to also create a huge ground force to provide ground game support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea with that is that it started out encouraging her and showing the support that we could get and kind of encourage her to kick some holes in the ice if you will to run,\u201d McKee said.\n\nI\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s going to run\u2014the way she\u2019s been acting as a candidate all over the state. But with Kelli PAC the whole idea was literally to raise money and raise awareness and clear a path because we saw what the McCain foundation did to J.D. Hayworth. We saw that. He spent $24 million of the $27 million that he had in the war chest from his presidential campaign to cut him to pieces and we just want to make sure that he has enough money and backing outside that we can fight something like that if that\u2019s how he decides to fight again.\n\nMcCain\u2019s decades in Washington \u201ccertainly have\u201d had an effect on him, McKee said.\n\n\u201cI think he started out great, but I think it\u2019s time\u2014I\u2019ll tell you the whole idea here is we don\u2019t want to beat on Sen. McCain,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe want to do this in an honorable and dignified manner. We think the people of Arizona deserve a change, somebody who is new, fresh and has good ideas and is strong with all the values Arizona has and will stand up and fight for those values. Kelli\u2019s the one, no doubt.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Ward \u201cthe one,\u201d he said first off is an \u201can immunity to lobbyists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they try to get at her, and she\u2019ll smile and listen to what they have to say but then she votes the way that her constituents want her to vote,\u201d he said, adding that her opposition to Common Core and her work against Obamacare as a doctor and state senator are crucial assets.\n\n\u201cWe need another strong conservative physician on the floor who\u2019s going to stand against that,\u201d McKee said.\n\nShe\u2019s physically felt the strains of the Affordable Care Act as a family physician and small business owner. She knows how it operates and how it harms the income of a doctor and brings down the standards of medicine in the United States. She\u2019s seen it all firsthand. Again, she\u2019d be a strong advocate on the floor of the Senate standing against that\u2014fighting to see it repealed.\n\nSalmon, the other potential challenger to McCain, was elected to Arizona\u2019s state senate in 1990 then ran for a House seat in 1994\u2014pledging to term-limit himself voluntarily to three terms. He followed through on that despite having won re-election by wide margins the two times he did run for re-election, going on to later become the 2002 Republican nominee for governor in Arizona.\n\nHe fell 11,819 votes shy of beating Democrat Janet Napolitano, who later went on to become President Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security Secretary, garnering 45 percent of the vote to Napolitano\u2019s 46 percent. He later served as a lobbyist and as the chairman of the Arizona Republican Party before deciding to run for his old congressional seat in the 2012 election, as since Jeff Flake was leaving the seat to run for the U.S. Senate seat now former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) was retiring from.\n\nSalmon said his view on term limits has evolved, and he believes they are a flawed concept. Since winning re-election to the House, Salmon has quickly become one of the conservative leaders in frequent battles with not just the Obama administration and congressional Democrats but also with establishment elements of his own Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing that separates him right off the bat from Sen. McCain and that would be that Matt Salmon is a strong conservative and John McCain has proven time and again that he\u2019s not,\u201d the source close to Salmon told Breitbart News. \u201cWhat you have in Congressman Salmon is a strong conservative who believes in the Constitution, believes in limited government freedom and strong secure borders who doesn\u2019t just talk about it\u2014he\u2019s actually taken the lead on many of these issues throughout his career.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s team, for its part, laughs off any primary challenge in what\u2019s an apparent effort to project strength early in the process to try to scare off any potential challengers.\n\n\u201cAs he\u2019s said, Senator McCain is strongly leaning toward running for re-election. In the meantime, he\u2019s taking all the necessary steps to be ready,\u201d McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told Breitbart News. \u201cAnyone contemplating a primary challenge would be well-advised to consider what happened in 2010, when Senator McCain beat former Congressman J.D. Hayworth by 24 points.\u201d\n\nSean Noble, a McCain ally who once served as chief of staff to now former Rep. John Shadegg (R-AZ) and handled outside expenditures for newly elected Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, said that he thinks McCain is likely to succeed due to the political climate.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where timing is very good for McCain. We are headed towards what I think is largely going to be a national security election and Obama\u2019s foreign policy is going to be so bad in that I don\u2019t have any doubt we\u2019re going to see more beheadings, more ISIS ebb and flow, we might even see an attack on America\u2014whether it\u2019s overseas or on American soil,\u201d Noble said in an interview this week.\n\nI think this is going to be kind of the reverse of 2008. I thought 2014 was the reverse of 2006\u2014Bush won in 2004 then we lost everything in 2006 in the House and Senate, I think that was replicated big in reverse with the big wins in the Senate and some gains in the House in 2014 after an Obama win. And just as McCain could not overcome the negatives of Bush of in 08, I don\u2019t think Clinton will able to overcome the negatives of Obama in 16\u2014although we can talk about presidential because I think there\u2019s one candidate she can beat and it happens to be the brother of somebody who was the president. The fact is that when it comes to the Republican base, we are first and foremost a national security party because that is the one thing that the Constitution calls for. With McCain being in this position of Armed Services Chairman being able to criticize Obama on a daily basis between now and the election of 2016, the appeal to the base is going to overwhelm what anyone can bring to the table.\u201d\n\nBut the source close to Salmon who confirmed to Breitbart News he\u2019s considering a run said that the comments from Noble and from Rogers are just blustering to try to scare potentially strong primary challengers away. Essentially, what McCain is doing right now, he said, is working to attempt to manipulate the political field on which he\u2019ll be playing in much the same way Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) potential challengers who would have beaten him had they run.\n\n\u201cI get what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019ve known this for a while. For most campaigns, the last six to eight months are the most important of an election. For John McCain, the first six months are the most important because the first six months are going to be when it\u2019s determined who runs against him. He\u2019s trying to set the field in a way that\u2019s advantageous to him. We get it. So what they\u2019re out there doing is they\u2019re out there beating their chests, they\u2019re out there saying how they\u2019re going to kill everyone, about how much money they have. That\u2019s exactly the play, so then you ask yourself why? It\u2019s because they\u2019ve seen the same polling everyone else has and they know that if they have a strong opponent running against them the likelihood they win re-election goes significantly down. So what are they trying to do? They\u2019re trying to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen by talking tough. But here\u2019s the reality about Sen. McCain in Arizona today, and it\u2019s best exemplified by the last couple of fundraisers he\u2019s had. Look at the host committees on these invites, one thing is very notable for an incumbent senator who\u2019s run for president and been in office for as long as he has, and what\u2019s notable is the lack of real Republican office holders of any significance, congressmen, et cetera.\u201d\n\nHe also said that McCain\u2019s allies \u201cspin\u201d that this will be an election that McCain can breeze through due to his chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee isn\u2019t entirely accurate.\n\n\u201cEveryone has got their spin but I would venture a guess that even McCain people don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said.\n\nThey know Arizona voters as well as we all do, and to buy that argument is to buy that they\u2019re single issue voters\u2014which is simply not the case. If they\u2019re going to hang on to that whole argument [then they\u2019re in trouble]. Just like the race won\u2019t entirely be about immigration, it won\u2019t entirely be about national security. It\u2019ll be about the candidates\u2019 records and the one thing Sen. McCain and his allies cannot escape is his voting record is far more liberal than the average Arizona Republican wants to see from their senator.\n\nNoble is pretty certain immigration won\u2019t be a big deal in the election, even though illegal aliens are expected to be pouring across the border in droves thanks to President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that that\u2019s not going to rise to the level of what national security will do among the base,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThe immigration issue is not as hot as it was in 2010. I think where we were in 2010, we had SB 1070, Russell Pearce was at the height of his influence, Jan Brewer signed the bill and rode to a huge reelection because of it. This is not 2010.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Noble is insistent that even if immigration\u2014McCain\u2019s weakest issue\u2014gains more traction than he thinks it will that McCain will still win and he\u2019ll do so by blaming everything on Obama.\n\n\u201cI think particularly in Arizona everyone understands that the problem is not McCain, it\u2019s Obama,\u201d Noble said. \u201cI think that if there\u2019s anything that helps McCain it was the election of 2014, and all the failures of immigration and of border security were placed at Obama\u2019s feet and that\u2019s the narrative.\u201d\n\nBack in 2010, McCain\u2014having lost his White House bid to Barack Obama two years before\u2014faced a primary challenge from then former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ). Hayworth, who had served in the U.S. House from early 1995 through early 2007, worked as a radio host in Phoenix after losing his re-election in 2006 to Democrat Harry Mitchell.\n\nIn 2010, McCain beat Hayworth in the GOP primary by 24 points. McCain, who received 284,374 votes, won just 56 percent of the vote\u2014not a high percentage\u2014compared to Hayworth\u2019s 162,502 votes for 32 percent of the vote. The other nearly 12 percent of the vote wen to the more libertarian leaning Jim Deakin, who won 59,447 votes.\n\nThe primary was one of the most brutal in history, and in a year where insurgent candidates won shocking victories nationwide\u2014now Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rand Paul (R-KY) each beat out GOP establishment picks, and Ken Buck won the nomination in Colorado, as did Christine O\u2019Donnell in Delaware, Joe Miller in Alaska and Sharron Angle in Nevada\u2014McCain survived the primary by crushing Hayworth.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Republic, McCain spent more than $20 million in the primary that year pounding the airwaves with ads. That was more than five times as much as McCain spent in his entire 2004 re-election campaign, primary and general election included, where he according to the Center for Responsive Politics he only spent $3.8 million total.\n\nThe source close to Salmon told Breitbart News he\u2019s not sure McCain can bring in that much cash this time around to defend himself.\n\n\u201cWhat is lost, and what the McCain people want everyone to believe, is that they have the ability to raise that kind of money,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they ultimately won\u2019t do it, but if you look at his most recent FEC reports, I don\u2019t see indication of that. The bulk of that money, as I\u2019m sure you know, came as what was leftover funds I believe from his presidential legal fund. They transferred the money to finance the race. They want you to believe that what\u2019s past is prologue, we can do it again. I can\u2019t say definitively whether or not they will but they don\u2019t have $20 million stashed away in a presidential account like they did last time.\n\nWard said she\u2019s ready for what McCain is likely to throw her way\u2014a very similar aggressive attack.\n\n\u201cDo you really know if you\u2019re ready? I think I\u2019ve developed a pretty thick skin,\u201d she said, adding that McCain\u2019s vulnerability is much higher than it was in 2010.\n\n\u201cWith the grassroots, it [McCain\u2019s support] is definitely crumbling or has already crumbled,\u201d Ward said.\n\nThere is a huge outcry from the people from someone new. The money people, I think, if there is a quid pro quo going on\u2014then a lot of them are willing to support him if that flow is going to be able to continue. So, that\u2019s something that makes him a formidable opponent because of that money. Arizona money might be one thing but there\u2019s 49 other states where people also don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening with Washington and don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening with our senior senator.\n\nMcCain has definitely seem stunning defeats in even the halls of the state GOP and local executive committees in recent years. In early 2014, Republicans in the state party passed a resolution calling his liberal positions in Washington \u201cdisastrous and harmful\u201d to Arizona and the U.S. as a whole, something the Arizona Republic wrote was a \u201cstrong rebuke\u201d of McCain. A couple weeks beforehand, the Maricopa County GOP voted 1,150-to-351 to pass a resolution censuring McCain. Maricopa County Republicans, conducted during the Jan. 10 statutory meeting this year\u2014a year after the censure of McCain\u2014voted more for Salmon for U.S. Senate than they did for McCain. Salmon got 106 votes in the straw poll, Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) got 66, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin got 49, and McCain only got 39 votes. Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) got 38 votes. Ward, who wasn\u2019t on the ballot, got 1 write-in vote.\n\nNoble, McCain\u2019s ally, says that while he\u2019s unsure McCain can raise another $20 million to crush primary opponents, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it if Ward is the candidate. Noble was, however, under the impression that Salmon is not considering a run when he spoke with Breitbart News\u2014something that Breitbart News subsequently confirmed with sources close to the congressman. Noble says that Ward is not a \u201cviable candidate\u201d because she won\u2019t be able to raise big time Washington politician-level dollars for her campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he has that kind of money, but can he raise that kind of money? Probably,\u201d Noble said.\n\nBack then there was lots of the outside effort. I think you\u2019ll probably see a lot more robust inside-outside effort than there was in 2010. The fact of the matter is I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need to raise nearly as much as he did before because I don\u2019t think the national groups are going to spend money because Kelli Ward is not a viable candidate. She won\u2019t be able to raise the money, and you just can\u2019t go from being a rural state senator and go up against a very popular United States Senator who chairs the Armed Services Committee and leading the charge against the administration on national security issues on a daily basis. This is going from little league to the big leagues without any stop at triple A on the way or even single A or high school ball on the way.\n\nThe most notable campaign ad from the 2010 primary\u2014one that\u2019s cited frequently by Republicans who don\u2019t trust Arizona\u2019s senior senator\u2014featured McCain walking along the border with Pinal County, AZ, sheriff Paul Babeu.\n\n\u201cDrug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder,\u201d McCain says as they walk along an unsecured stretch of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re outmanned,\u201d Babeu interjects. \u201cOf all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave we got the right plan?\u201d McCain asked him.\n\n\u201cThe plan\u2019s perfect: You bring troops, state, county and local law enforcement together,\u201d Babeu said.\n\n\u201cAnd complete the danged fence,\u201d McCain said, as his campaign launched a website CompleteTheDangedFence.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work this time,\u201d Babeu responds. \u201cSenator, you\u2019re one of us.\u201d\n\nThe fence that McCain discussed then has never been built. Instead of fighting for it after getting re-elected, McCain went on to push the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill that would have put every illegal alien in America on a pathway to citizenship with special benefits and the ability to work taking jobs away from struggling Americans.\n\nWard thinks that McCain\u2019s hollow promise for a border fence is one of many reasons he\u2019s incapable of representing Arizona in the U.S. Senate anymore.\n\n\u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d Ward told Breitbart News when asked about how McCain never made sure the \u201cdanged fence\u201d was actually built.\n\nThe words he said led you to think that was what was going to happen, but the actions definitely went against that. I think people want someone who\u2019s going to secure the border and who\u2019s going to fight for Americans and American citizens, who\u2019s going to fight for the rule of law and who\u2019s not going to have a comprehensive immigration reform but who\u2019s going to have common sense, principled immigration policies so that we\u2019re going to get people in that want to be here, and need to be here, and keep the people out who want to seek entitlements and the nanny state benefits.\n\nMcKee, the head of Kelli PAC, echoed those comments in his interview with Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cYou look at all these things he\u2019s done and the first question I\u2019d ask him is: Where is our fence?\u201d McKee said.\n\nHe claims to be a conservative about six months out of every six years. He starts talking about tough borders and tough security. We haven\u2019t seen anything in Arizona, but Arizona is worse than it\u2019s ever been. He constantly talks about how he is a huge veteran supporter but then you look at all the things that he\u2019s voted for and all the things he\u2019s promised to vote for are going to gut veterans\u2019 benefits and veterans are going to have pay more for their insurance at the VA. He is not a supporter of veterans either. He has not done well for America and he has not done well for Arizona. He does not hold the values that Arizona holds. He\u2019s not a limited government, low tax guy.\n\nWhen asked what McCain could be doing better than he is on issues in Washington, Ward replied: \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs to do anything,\u201d Ward said.\n\nAnything. Instead of just basically being a mouthpiece for all of the policies that the president is putting out that I think are egregious, that are not something to strengthen our country, to make excuses for the president. He\u2019s supposed to be the leader, an elder statesman who\u2019s supposed to fight for the people of the country and the people of Arizona in particular and that is not happening. We need somebody in there who has a backbone and is not afraid of the president and is not afraid of special interest groups and is not afraid of the press and the things they might say about them if they are fighting for the country and fighting for the state. We need someone else. We need a change.\n\nIt seems for now that McCain and his allies are at least a little bit worried about these matters. McKee said Rogers\u2019 comments on McCain\u2019s behalf warning potential challengers about what happened to Hayworth was a threat and \u201cit doesn\u2019t surprise us that they\u2019re using that tactic.\u201d\n\nSources in Arizona have also confirmed that anti-Ward pollsters are out in the field at this time gathering polling data on Ward for a forthcoming hit poll.
